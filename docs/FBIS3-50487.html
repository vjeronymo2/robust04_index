Why do people believe [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo has  so much power in the country. Is it just their imagination or  does he really have so much power? I am asking you this  question in your capacity as commander of the Armed Forces.    [Wasmosy] I would say that he is a very active person.  Within the Armed Forces he is probably the most concerned about  his subordinates. This attitude is probably interpreted by some  as if he were the most powerful person within the Armed Forces.  However, looking you straight in your eyes I can tell you I  have never had any problems with Lino Oviedo. I, personally,  here in my office, filled in the posts of the Armed Forces  organization chart. First I worked on it with [Military Forces  Commander Vice Admiral Eduardo] Gonzalez Petit, then with the  Army, Navy, and Air Force Commanders and the chief of the joint  staff. The logistics commander was also present on some  occasions as was [Division General Pedro de la Cruz] Ocampos,  the chief of staff. They can confirm that the appointments were  made directly by me.    I would like refer to those remarks that so-and-so was  appointed because it will help Oviedo or that so-and-so is  against so-and-so, and that sort of comment. I can show you the  service record, the military law, and the seniority list, and  you will see that I have respected the officers' seniority and  their merits. So much so that the commanders of the  engineering, transmission units are the best there are. Nobody  can accuse me of having discriminated against anybody who was  the top of his class. By no means. Why do you think they  respect my decisions. Injustices surface sooner or later.    [Ruffinelli] What many people question is the possible  political actions of Gen. Lino Oviedo.    [Wasmosy] Do you consider it to be political action when he  helps each and everyone in his home town by building a school,  giving social assistance, and so on. I regard it as absolutely  normal. Now, if he stood up and said he wants to be president  of a Colorado Party precinct or that so-and-so must be  appointed, etc., yes, that is engaging in politics. I would  really like all my aides to help me. I am being frank and must  say that many commanders -- within their jurisdiction -- do so.  Not long ago we dedicated social projects with General Barreto,  the Curuguaty commander. When these ceremonies occur in rather  distant regions and there is no transportation, the media just  do not turn up.    [Ruffinelli] When there is no means of transportation?    [Wasmosy] This is probably why these ceremonies are not  covered sufficiently. But they are all doing their best to  increase the level, to humanize the Army. Soldiers and  sergeants currently live like human beings. These activities  are criticized because it is always...[changes thought]... well  this is the price of being the Army commander, this is the price  I have to pay for being president of Republic. As a means of  consolation, and to give myself a bit more courage, when I  receive criticisms which I accept happily -- well, not happily  but which I tolerate...    [Ruffinelli] Let us talk about that later...    [Wasmosy] ...which I tolerate, because we must be frank, I  tell myself they are directed against the president of the  Republic. Juan Carlos Wasmosy is president of the Republic, but  only temporarily. Every criticism is directed against the  leader, against the authority. That is only normal. It happens  within the Army, religious congregations, among bishops and  cardinals, right? For example, you women sometimes complain  about your husbands, because they are the boss at home.    [Ruffinelli] Of course. Well, we will see who is the boss.    [Wasmosy] Well, in some cases the husband is the boss.    [Ruffinelli] Engineer, sometimes Gen. Oviedo's actions --  which may be done in good faith -- are questioned. There is a  very narrow margin between proselytism, campaigning, and  engaging in politics. As you well know, this is banned by the  Constitution. Right from the beginning of this interview you  have said that your main concern, your main goal is to respect  the Constitution. Is there any chance, if he were to engage in  politics, that ....    [Wasmosy] If Gen. Oviedo were to engage in politics, let us  say seeking to obtain a post within a party precinct, that is  one thing.    [Ruffinelli] I don't think he will go that far.    [Wasmosy] That situation would justify your criticisms, but  if he is only helping the government -- to which the Armed  Forces belong -- implementing social projects because you should  recall that the Army...    [Ruffinelli] Do you believe he is acting in good faith?    [Wasmosy] I believe he is acting in good faith. What is  more, I have no complaints against him. I believe that to have  the Army cooperating as it is now, guarantees this democratic  process.    [Ruffinelli] Why?    [Wasmosy] Because the Army will not tolerate anything that  violates the Constitution. People believe that we will only  live in democracy through the downfall of the Colorado Party.  We are proving that the Colorado Party brought democracy back  to the country and that it is consolidating this democratic  process. People also say that free elections and democracy are  not possible until Lino Oviedo is not discharged or retired.  That is not true, young lady. Quite the opposite. Let us look  at things positively. I believe the Colorado Party and an  institutionalized, well organized, rationalized Armed Forces are  the best guarantee to consolidate our democracy. This is not a  story, I am absolutely convinced of what I am saying.    [Ruffinelli] Engineer. Changing the subject and referring to  another subject that has surfaced...    [Wasmosy] I don't know whether I am passing your test.    [Ruffinelli] I am not testing you. We want to share this  moment with the SNT listeners throughout the country during the  last few days of this year. I want to raise another important  topic which has been a matter of concern lately: drug  trafficking and money laundering and the U.S. Government's  concern reflected in a press communique written and signed by  [U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay] Jon Glassman. What do you have to  say about this?    [Wasmosy] There are three aspects to this problem. There are  countries that consume drugs, produce drugs, and others that act  as routes for drug trafficking. Let us hope our country is not  used as a route between producer and consumer countries.    [Ruffinelli] This is what we are being accused of.    [Wasmosy] It would be regrettable if our youth became hooked  on this really lamentable vice. I have repeatedly and publicly  stated that I am in favor of a total struggle against drug  trafficking, money laundering, and I am against those who kill  to steal, who traffic in stolen vehicles, etc.    I believe Ambassador Glassman made a rather hasty comment  when he stated that honest people have been replaced by  dishonest people, yet failed to say who the dishonest people  are. One cannot make groundless charges. I respect him in his  capacity as ambassador but, as long I am president of the  Republic, I will not allow him to interfere in the domestic  affairs of this country. Paraguay is a small but sovereign  country.    There is a lot of talk about obscure situations, that  so-and-so is involved. If people provide me with evidence I  will dismiss the guilty parties. I have already removed several  people involved in the contraband of cigarettes, chickens, and  onions brought from Brazil or Argentina, but one cannot make  groundless charges and suspect everyone. Do people not trust  me? I have proven I am trustworthy. I want to tell the  listeners that I summoned Ambassador Glassman to Government  House together with [Alternate Senator Eustacio] Morel Garay and  General Escobar Anzoategui [National Antinarcotics Secretariat,  Senad, executive secretary] and told him that if he wanted to  know anything about the Senad he should ask General Escobar and  not Morel Garay or anybody else because there is a chain of  command that must be respected. We cannot tolerate intervention  at the various levels. Either you have trust or you do not. I  cannot decide if a person is involved in drug trafficking or  money laundering if I do not have evidence. If you tell me who  is guilty of these crimes and bring the evidence against the  person then it is my responsibility to follow it up, but in the  meantime I cannot prejudge.    [Ruffinellii] Engineer, please allow me to mention some  figures that are of concern to the U.S. Embassy which, as you  known, is a landmark in international affairs. They say that  during the past years we have only managed to seize a few kilos  of cocaine, I think it was 48 kg or a similarly small figure:  meanwhile neighboring countries talk about tonnes. More than 30  Paraguayan citizens charged with drug trafficking or consumption  have been arrested abroad, but this has not happened here. This  is out of proportion.    [Wasmosy] There are two alternatives. Either drug  trafficking has dropped here or the entire government is  involved in this trade. Therefore, to uncover the government  officials involved in this trade I need the necessary means. I  have asked them to install radar units in Mariscal Estigarribia,  Ciudad del Este, Concepcion, and Ayolas and to provide two  helicopter-gunships operated by U.S. Marines. What better proof  is there than that to show I want to fight this scourge openly.    [Ruffinelli] However, they maintain that when you list the  aid received you do not mention the DEA agents who use the  infrastructure exclusively designed to fight drug trafficking.    [Wasmosy] That is right but the U.S. Embassy has also  included in the global aid granted us the cost of bringing an  aircraft with radar [AWACS] to our country. I am grateful to  them for this aircraft but the decision to send it here was  theirs. They cannot charge the cost of sending an aircraft  equipped with radar to the aid granted to Paraguay. They are  trying to determine the origin of this nefarious merchandise  which is consumed in their country. They cannot charge this  cost to the aid granted to us. That is a U.S. expenditure or  investment, not a Paraguayan expenditure. No. If they were to  really grant us support and we did not fight drug trafficking,  then we would be guilty. But with what budget can I fight these  people who are much better equipped with more sophisticated  weapons than what our Army has. They have money to buy the most  sophisticated weapons. We have discussed this subject with the  presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay. This must be a joint  effort with the aid of the United States, which is the greatest  drug consumer. The United States must help us. What can we do  alone or in an isolated manner?    [Ruffinelli] Engineer Wasmosy, do you know how this is being  interpreted? Jon Glassman, to some extent, has warned that the  funds obtained from money laundering and drug trafficking may  become a very strong political power that is very hard to  eradicate.    [Wasmosy] I fully agree with him.    [Ruffinelli] What worries him is the impunity that may  currently prevail in Paraguay and that is generating a system of  privileges that may even undermine the democracy we are  currently enjoying.    [Wasmosy] This risk not only exists in Paraguay, it exists  in  any South American country.    [Ruffinelli] We are no exception.    [Wasmosy] We are no exception. Do you think it was easy to  catch [Colombian drug trafficker Pablo] Escobar, or do you think  he was a sort of superman that flew from one place to another?  How do you think he got out of prison? There is the answer to  your question.    [Ruffinelli] The key issue of the electoral campaign, and  even after the campaign, was the economic issue, how to pull out  of the prevailing situation, how to resume the economic growth.  Even in your Christmas message, you said you wanted to resume  the country's growth. We would like to know how you intend to  go about resuming this growth.    [Wasmosy] Basically through the implementation of all the  corrective measures which, in opinion of the government and  entire economic team, fall within the government's program.  Some draft bills are still in Congress. We are still awaiting  the approval of a law on the Central Bank, a law on  privatization, the insurance companies law, and many others that  represent the legal tools necessary to carry out these changes  in the economic field. According to our possibilities we have,  however, given the agricultural sector -- the primary producers  in particular -- the best seed, which is no longer distributed  by the state but directly by interested parties such as  cooperatives and association of producers. The producers will  get the best seed on a timely basis. For the first time too, we  have placed 305 billion guaranies at the disposal of the primary  producers before the beginning of the agricultural year. The  Central Bank and the Finance Ministry used to issue the  corresponding decrees around mid-December. We issued them  before the beginning of the agricultural year to really cut that  chain of... I wouldn't call them usurers, but of those who take  advantage of the producers ignorance, misinformation, or need,  and who, instead of giving them money, offer them goods at two  or three times the real price.    [Ruffinelli] However, the great pending issue about which  everyone talks and wants are job opportunities.    [Wasmosy] Right, but job opportunities cannot be created  overnight. I would like to point out that Brazilian investments  in our country today are huge and there are industries whose  projects have been approved by the Industry and Commerce  Ministry. All this is being elaborated and organized. Together  with the economic team we have evaluated the best way to create  more job opportunities and have come to the conclusion that a  reforestation program would be best. But we need to shoulder  that financing because it is instrumental in making people  settle down in one place rather than obliging them to go to live  in the city ...    [Rufinelli] The rural exodus problem.    [Wasmosy] ... because they have to weed out the saplings.  Incidentally, I visited one with the Cordillera governor on the  Pozuelo River, near the Guaira Falls -- actually it was nearer  Catuete, near Corpus Christi -- really a veritable model of that  project. It is a very profitable business. What will the  government do through the officials from the Agricultural and  Livestock Development Service? It will promote the idea. There  have been three poor harvests in a row -- two of them due to low  international market prices that discouraged farmers who were no  longer motivated to grow more crops and another caused by  adverse weather conditions. I can tell you -- and by the way, I  have just returned from Arroyito, Horqueta, and other places  where I saw that the cotton crop is greater than ever as is the  case of corn and new crops in our country, namely sunflower --  that this year without a shadow of a doubt that our export  earnings will exceed $1 billion. Whenever agricultural  activities are doing well, and farmers and agricultural  producers get a fair price for the fruit of their work, then it  follows necessarily that wholesalers, truck drivers, retailers,  and importers earn money too. There is a domino effect, in the  same way that construction is the best catalyst to produce a  trickle-down effect in the whole economy. Hence, I believe that  by strengthening the basis of production, there will be an  automatic upswing, and consequently, the number of truck drivers  will increase, which in turn means more jobs. And yet, what is  really striking at present is the shortage of school teachers to  teach the 135,000 children that are without a teacher...    [Rufinelli] What are we doing about this?    [Wasmosy] This indeed concerns me. People from the private  sector have offered to train 2,000 teachers. They are already  doing so. But we are still 3,000 short and time is running out.  Thus, I urge all these youngsters whom I had the honor of  presenting their high-school diplomas to take up teaching so  that they may stay where they were born and bred. There are  also those who want to study but lack the means to do so. We  are granting them scholarships. I am looking for businessmen,  traders, industrialists to defray the cost of those studies.  Aldo Zucolillo from ABC COLOR newspaper, for example, has  already pledged to finance schools in Villa Florida. We are also  contemplating doing something comparable at Inagrisa [Wasmosy's  own company] in those places which constitute its area of  production. We need other companies to cover that deficit. I  would not like to resort to the Army because whenever we are in  a quandary we turn to the Army and then we criticize it for  intervening. Imagine that, a joint action to check smuggling.  You can easily verify that all breweries are currently working  around the clock while in the past they only worked a six or  eight hours per day. You may wonder why. Well, because we  curbed the smuggling of beer. Then people say: There are no  openings. No. We want legal jobs. The same applies to  contraband chickens. We have contained this, preventing them  from entering the country. After we seized a considerable  number of contraband chickens, the price started to go up. Then  we liberalize imports so that we may substitute smuggling with  legal importation of products through the payment of customs  duties. And who are those importers? The producers themselves  since there is total freedom for importing goods into the  country. [passage omitted]</p>

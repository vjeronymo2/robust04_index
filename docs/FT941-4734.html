			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japanese clear way for Jeep Japan is expected to clear the way today for the US vehicle manufacturer Chrysler to boost substantially its exports to Japan of Jeep Cherokee sports utility vehicles, in what appears to be part of a campaign to ease trade tensions. Chrysler said yesterday that it had been told at short notice that a vice-minister in the Transport Ministry would present the company with a 'type certificate' at a meeting in Detroit today. The certificate allows Chrysler's distributor in Japan to carry out road-worthiness inspections of Cherokees rather than having to submit each vehicle for certification by the Transport Ministry. US car manufacturers have long complained that the ministry inspections are an important non-tariff trade barrier. Chrysler, which was told some time ago that it was likely to get a type certificate, plans to boost its Japanese sales of Cherokees from 4,000 a year to 10,000. However, a spokeswoman said yesterday that Japan still had a long way to go to open up its vehicle market.</p>

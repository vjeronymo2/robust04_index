			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Pressure grows on Stolpe to resign EAST Germany's best-known politician, Mr Manfred Stolpe, the prime minister of Brandenburg state, came under growing pressure yesterday to resign after allegations that he was awarded a medal by the Stasi security police. As Mr Stolpe met the leadership of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Bonn to discuss the charges, members of his coalition government in Potsdam distanced themselves from him and called for his resignation. Ms Marianne Birthler, minister of education in Brandenburg and a member of the New Forum party, said the coalition faced a 'major crisis'. Leaders of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) said Mr Stolpe had to resign if the latest allegations were true. An SPD aide to Mr Stolpe said it was now only a 'question of when' the premier would be forced to step down. The latest allegation was made by Mr Klaus Rossberg, a senior Stasi officer, in a sworn statement to a lawyer. He said he personally gave Mr Stolpe the medal, the Order of Merit of the former East Germany, in 1978 in a clandestine Stasi residence. Mr Stolpe denied the charge as slanderous and said he would take legal steps against Mr Rossberg. Mr Stolpe has previously admitted receiving the medal but said it was awarded to him by East Germany's late State Secretary for Church Affairs. He has repeatedly denied allegations that he was an informer for the Stasi codenamed 'Secretary' while serving as a senior Protestant Church official. He acknowledged, however, having frequent talks with Stasi officers to help East Germans in conflict with the authorities. Mr Rossberg also claimed that in late 1989, as the communist regime was crumbling, the Stasi urged Mr Stolpe to act as its vehicle in the newly-formed Social Democratic party in East Germany. Mr Stolpe has not responded to this allegation. Mr Stolpe's departure would be a serious blow to the already battered self-respect of east Germans who have tended to regard claims that he was a Stasi informer as part of a west German campaign to denigrate easterners.</p>

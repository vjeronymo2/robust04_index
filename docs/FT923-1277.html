			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Confidence vote on Italian budget ITALIAN prime minister Giuliano Amato is planning to call a vote of confidence in parliament on the 1993 budget announced last Thursday. The aim is to accelerate the normally lengthy process of parliamentary approval and to rally support for his four-party coalition government. He has already used this device to good effect to force through his July emergency economic package raising L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn) in fresh revenues and spending cuts. The new vote of confidence underlines Mr Amato's strategy of demonstrating to a fractious parliament that, if his two-and-a-half-month-old government falls, the country would face unprecedented political chaos and damaging loss of international confidence. The Socialist premier's coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals has a narrow 16-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The 1993 budget proposes to raise L93,000bn in new taxes and expenditure cuts in order to hold the public sector deficit down to L150,000bn, equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP. The proposals, which include cuts in the health service, new wealth taxes, a cap on pensions and a freeze on public sector employment, have provoked protests from almost every segment of society. Yesterday was the second day of a series of rolling, regional four-hour general strikes, called by the three main trades union confederations and these could foreshadow a national general strike. Union leaders are due to meet the prime minister on Friday, the second time this week. The government appears willing to make only minor amendments, largely related to ironing out anomalies or catering for proven hardship cases such as certain categories of pensioners. No timetable has been fixed for the vote of confidence which has to be in both houses of parliament. The government must wait until next week when the Chamber is expected to endorse the Senate's vote giving the executive power to reform pensions, the health service, local administration and the civil service - reforms central to the 1993 budget. The speed with which the budget is approved and the extent of amendments is closely linked to the credibility of Italy re-entering the European Monetary System. Seven local politicians in Rome were arrested yesterday on allegations of taking billions of lira in bribes from a Milanese railway equipment maker. The arrests follow months of investigations into the accounts of Socimi, a Milan-based engineering group specialising in railway and transport equipment.</p>

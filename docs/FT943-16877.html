			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond weakness drives shares lower - Market Report An early bout of optimism in the UK stock market was abruptly reversed yesterday following a sell-off in both the US dollar and Federal bonds when statistics on US factory orders and personal spending revived inflation worries. London equities were hit hard by heavy falls in British government bonds on news of a sharp rise in the Purchasing Managers Index for June. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 27.1 points off at 2,919.2, having rallied at the close with Wall Street, which showed a fall of 20 Dow points in UK hours. The wider-ranging FT-SE Mid 250 Index dipped only 1.1 to 3,414.1, indicating the focus on the blue chip sectors. It was a volatile session, with the FT-SE 100 gaining nearly 16 points at first as bond markets across Europe continued to firm in spite of the weakness of the dollar. Confidence was encouraged by unsubstantiated reports that the German and US authorities would agree on concerted monetary co-operation at the meeting of the Group of Seven ministers in Naples at the end of next week. Growing confidence that the dollar's problems would be managed without resort to over-heavy action on US interest rates had helped European markets on Wednesday. But the indications yesterday, from both the US personal consumption data and the UK Purchasing Managers Index, has put inflation fears back into the centre of the market stage, and unsettled hopes in the London market that a further cut in base rates might be possible this autumn. UK equities had begun to drift back from their highs, with the banking sector weakening the overall picture in the wake of the aggressive cuts in overdraft rates by Abbey National. But underlying confidence remained sound until UK government bonds began to fall sharply. The FT-SE 100 Index was down by nearly 36 points at the day's worst of 2,910.6. The renewed turmoil in bond markets put an end, for the time being at least, to the recovery in confidence in equities. Some strategists pointed out that US markets are moving into a holiday weekend, which opens with an early closure for today's session. This, it was stressed, increased pressure on European traders to unload bonds rather than hold them over an extended weekend. However, markets are still believed to be focusing on prospects for favourable action at the G7 meeting at the end of next week. Today brings more data on the US economy, notably the latest economic leading indicators and construction spending statistics. Traders are resigned to seeing further nervousness in the bond markets which will continue to restrain share prices. Selling of equities increased as the session progressed. However, the final Seaq total of 597.4m shares traded was more than one fifth higher than on Wednesday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.03bn. Non-Footsie shares made up only about 55 per cent of business yesterday, further indicating the market's concentration on the futures-related Footsie-listed stocks. Several trading programmes were identified as a flow of sizeable deals crossed the trading screens. Many reflected end-of-quarter tidying up operations by fund managers. The first half of 1994 has brought highly volatile trading in UK equities. The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by around 5.4 per cent over the second quarter.</p>

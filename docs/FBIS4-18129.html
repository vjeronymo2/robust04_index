			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- A French right-wing  parliamentarian resigned Wednesday [30 March] in protest at  France's unemployment crisis, saying the government was impotent.    Jean-Louis Borloo, an independent conservative who is also  deputy mayor of the northern city of Valenciennes, said in a  newspaper interview to appear Thursday that the current scale of  joblessness was ruining the nation's young people.    "Resign is not the right word. I disclaim it. By giving up  my mandate as a lawmaker, I want on the contrary to remain  faithful to my mission," he said, adding he could no longer look  at voters "in the eye."    Calling for a counter-offensive to put France back on its  feet, he said: "The list of public impotence is too long. I  want to continue to fight with my head held high."    Some 3.3 million people are jobless in France -- 12.2 of the  active population -- of whom 20 percent are under 26.    French youngsters have taken to the streets in recent weeks  to protest against a new draft law aimed at reducing  unemployment by paying first-time employees 20 percent less than  the minimum wage. The nationwide protests earlier this week  prompted Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to effectively shelve  the plan.</p>

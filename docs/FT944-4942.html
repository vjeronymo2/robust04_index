			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint escapes receiver - Tim Burt considers the repercussions of investing too heavily The takeover offer by Quebecor Printing, the Canadian printer, for HunterPrint yesterday cleared another hurdle by extracting new terms from union leaders at the group's plant in Corby, Northamptonshire. Mr David Doulton, HunterPrint's managing director, said the GPMU print union did not take much persuading. He told them that if they rejected the offer, the company's 500 workers 'would be looking right down the receiver's throat'. Welcoming the deal, Mr Doulton claimed it would not only safeguard jobs but re-establish HunterPrint as an important force in UK printing. Ironically, by recommending the offer he may also have signed his own death warrant. There is no guarantee that Quebecor will retain a management that has struggled to contain borrowings during five successive years of losses. A Pounds 13.6m rights issue and Pounds 18.3m capital reorganisation failed to stem the tide, and investors who once saw the shares reach 565p have witnessed a steady decline to yesterday's close of 1 3/4 p - a fall of 1 1/4 p on the day. Nevertheless, investors holding 53.5 per cent of the ordinary shares have accepted Quebecor's offer of 2p per share, while preference shareholders will get 1.33p per share. With no other offers on the horizon and its auditors expressing 'fundamental uncertainty' over its future, HunterPrint expects the remaining shareholders to accept given that receivership is the likely alternative. But Mr Geoffrey Eades, finance director, said the group's performance could improve with Quebecor's backing. It could not get much worse. The company has been fighting a series of crises since it turned to lenders in 1989 to finance the bulk of its new plant at Corby. Mr Eades lays the blame squarely at the door of Mr Michael Hunter, the founder, who pushed the company to the edge of bankruptcy by investing heavily in probably the UK's most modern web offset plant. That saddled the group with debts of Pounds 44.5m just as the recession hit the industry. Some City analysts say the management, led from 1990 to 1992 by Sir Ian MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and the National Coal Board, made matters worse by sharply discounting prices to win more contract printing deals. 'They undercut their rivals by up to 50 per cent and could not generate the cash just to run the business,' according to one. Yet that strategy has paid off with potentially lucrative contracts with publishers such as Mirror Group Newspapers, the Guardian Media Group and Associated Newspapers, which Quebecor will inherit just as they are beginning to mature. While agreeing to inject Pounds 7m to underpin the business, the Canadian group has also persuaded HunterPrint's lenders to waive interest on its current borrowing for two years. Those borrowings have been steadily reduced to Pounds 17m, making the Corby site an even more attractive proposition. For the printing industry, this may be bad news. A rival that looked terminally ill may be reborn in a leaner form, and HunterPrint could yet realise its founder's vision of 'keeping one step ahead of the competition'.</p>

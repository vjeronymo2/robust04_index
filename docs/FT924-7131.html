			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Curb on private pay ruled out THE government has no intention of imposing an incomes policy on the private sector, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. However, he said in evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that the government had a right to point out the danger of high pay settlements in the environment caused by sterling's devaluation since Black Wednesday in September. He said British industry had granted its employees high real wage increases instead of winning increased orders. Mr Portillo provided an explanation for the sharp Pounds 1.16bn fall in payments to the European Community envisaged in the government's spending plans for 1993-94. The cut from earlier planned levels reflected: A reduced forecast for EC spending on agriculture. Expectations of substantially higher receipts from the farm guarantee fund following reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. A lower UK share of gross contributions to the Community reflecting a lower UK share of EC gross domestic product.</p>

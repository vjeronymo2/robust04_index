			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / MD of Hutchison Whampoa steps down MR SIMON Murray yesterday stepped down as managing director - or Taipan - of Hong Kong's largest conglomerate, Hutchison Whampoa. He is replaced by fellow director Mr Canning Fok in a move which crystallises the group's evolution from British-style trading company to Chinese corporation. Mr Murray's departure, which had been expected, comes at a time of rapid change for Hutchison. It has reversed the international diversification of the 1980s and focused on its core businesses of infrastructure and property in Hong Kong and China - businesses where the expatriate manager has a limited role. Mr Fok is regarded as a short-term stand-in for Richard Li, 26, who was promoted yesterday to deputy chairman. He is the son of the chairman, Mr Li Ka-shing, whose listed flagship Cheung Kong owns 40 per cent of Hutchison. Mr Murray joined the group in 1984, four years after Mr Li became the first 'Chinese' owner of a British-style hong - or trading company - when it purchased the restructured Hutchison from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. When Mr Murray joined Hutchison it was primarily involved in property development, trading, retailing and port operation. Subsequently it acquired control of Hongkong Electric and pushed into telecommunications. However, he was also instrumental in Hutchison's diversification overseas - primarily into Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) and Husky Oil and Gas - reflecting growing concern over Hong Kong exposure in the lead-up to the colony's hand-over to China in 1997. But the overseas expansion has proved far less successful in the 1990s than Hutchison's core business in the colony. During 1991 and 1992, Hutchison wrote off HKDollars 2.2bn (Pounds 187m) against Husky Oil and suffered losses in UK telecoms. Last year, it became clear that Mr Li had decided to sell these businesses and focus on post-1997 Hong Kong and China. It is estimated that the company will invest HKDollars 8bn over the next four years in the development of its two Chinese container ports, in Shanghai and in Yantian, in the Pearl River delta. The group is also believed to be negotiating some substantial Chinese property deals. Mr Murray liked to play an active role in local politics, but his views are believed to have upset the Beijing officialdom that Mr Li has been so anxious to court. Mr Murray will remain a non-executive director and consultant to the company.</p>

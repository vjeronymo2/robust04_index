			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE ASSAILS CUBA, PANAMA AND NICARAGUA  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle sharply denounced "the axis of Cuba, Nicaragua and  Panama" on Monday, warning that the three nations pose a threat to the region's  struggling economies.  </P> <P> Using particularly blunt language, the vice president expressed skepticism  about elections that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's government has  promised to hold next February, saying they could be a "sham." He said he will  tell Contra military commanders that their return to Nicaragua to take part in  the political process is an option available to them, but he would give them no  recommendations on what course to follow.  </P> <P> "You have to look at the past track record of Ortega. It hasn't been a good  one," Quayle said.  </P> <P> The vice president visited Guatemala and Honduras on Monday, the first stops on  a three-day tour of Central America. The trip is his second to the region as he  assumes a leading role in the Bush Administration's low-visibility effort to  make progress in an area that vexed the Reagan Administration for eight years.  </P> <P> At stops in Guatemala and Honduras, Quayle met with elected civilian Presidents  Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo and Jose Azcona Hoyo, who are struggling to maintain  fledgling democracies. He stressed the need to adhere to the course of open  political systems, while seeking to drum up regional pressure against Nicaragua  and Panama.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Time for Dictators'  </P> <P> "The hemisphere no longer has time for dictators of any stripe," he said,  lumping Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega and the Marxist leaders of Cuba  and Nicaragua together. "The axis of Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama threatens peace  and democracy in this hemisphere.  </P> <P> "That axis would work very much to the economic decline of this region," he  said.  </P> <P> With the Bush Administration stymied in its ongoing effort to remove military  strongman Noriega from power, Quayle met for 90 minutes late Sunday evening  upon his arrival in Guatemala City with Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario  Palencia. Palencia and the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Trinidad-Tobago are  members of a special mission of the Organization of American States that is  trying to negotiate a resolution to the Panamanian crisis.  </P> <P> Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force Two as he flew Sunday evening from  Washington to Guatemala, the vice president said he will tell the Contra  military commanders this morning that if they are "comfortable" with the idea  of abandoning their camps in Honduras and returning to Nicaragua, they will be  encouraged to follow such a course. But he added: "I don't have to tell them  what Danny Ortega's track record is."  </P> <P> Quayle's meeting with the Contra figures this morning at the U.S. Embassy here  will be the first such conference between a senior U.S. official and the field  commanders who have been fighting the now-stalled guerrilla war against the  Sandinista government.  </P> <P> Asked what he would tell the Contra field commanders if they ask whether a  resumption of the war is one of their options, Quayle said, "I would say that  is currently not policy."  </P></p>

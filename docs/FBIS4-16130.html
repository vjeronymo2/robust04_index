			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 13, BNS -- American military experts  see a number of positive changes in Lithuania's national defense  system and think the improvement is partly a result of the  successful implementation of the U.S. Military-to-Military  Contacts Program in Lithuania.    Such contacts cost the United States around 100,000 dollars  a  month, but Brig. Gen. Thomas Lennon, deputy director of the  program in 13 world countries, said he is certain that money is  not spent uselessly in Lithuania. The general arrived in  Vilnius Monday [11 April].    On Tuesday, Lennon met with the U.S. ambassador to  Lithuania,  Darryl Johnson, and Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas  Linkevicius. At a press conference, Lennon said he is satisfied  with the work of a joint U.S.-Lithuanian military contacts  group. He emphasized that the Military-to-Military program is a  mutual exchange of ideas and experience, but not an attempt to  press on American views.    Lennon said 85 projects ranging a full spectrum of national  defense activities were carried out in Lithuania since last May.    Lithuanians and Americans acquainted each other with their  defense structures, civil defense, military communication  systems, military medicine and engineering. The  Military-to-Military program will be continued in Lithuania next  year, although initially it was intended for half year or a  year. Lennon said the program will continue in Lithuania  because "the interest of the United States is supporting your  democratic transformations."</p>

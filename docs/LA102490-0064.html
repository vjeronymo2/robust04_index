			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> George Foreman, the famous eater, believes Evander Holyfield will beat Buster  Douglas because the challenger is hungrier than the champion. . . .  </P> <P> Only guy working cheap Thursday will be ring announcer Sugar Ray Leonard. His  pay is a two-bedroom suite at the Mirage. On second thought, that's not real  cheap. . . .  </P> <P> The quickie World Series was a blessing for Steve Wynn. Columnists who wouldn't  have arrived in Las Vegas until the day of the fight if the Series had gone  seven games got there early. . . .  </P> <P> Consultant Mike Trainer forecasts that the fight will be viewed on pay-per-view  TV in a record 1 million homes. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Tyson sounds more ridiculous every time he opens his mouth. . . .  </P> <P> The oral commitment given Duke by 6-foot-11 Marina High School center Cherokee  Parks is a blow to UCLA, which may be only a big man away from national  championship contention the next four years. . . .  </P> <P> Too bad the Breeders' Cup and Santa Anita can't settle their differences. The  Cup belongs in Arcadia, where the facilities, attendance and weather are  unsurpassed. . . .  </P> <P> Santa Anita press box regulars like Corwyn Bay's chances in the Breeder's Cup  Sprint Saturday at Belmont. . . .  </P> <P> If there were only one race for 2-year-olds, filly Meadow Star would be  favored. . . .  </P> <P> The huge entry list for the Classic means there are no superstars in the field.  . . .  </P> <P> However, the race would have been a genuine classic if injuries hadn't  sidelined Sunday Silence, Easy Goer and Criminal Type. . . .  </P> <P> Unlike Bo Schembechler, Gary Moeller won't get a chance to screw up in the Rose  Bowl this season. . . .  </P> <P> Nice to see Washington move up in the ratings, but at No. 6 in United Press  International and No. 7 in Associated Press, the Huskies still aren't high  enough. . . .  </P> <P> For a change, Terry Donahue shouldn't have trouble getting UCLA up for Oregon  State, which upset the Bruins last year at Corvallis. . . .  </P> <P> Ty Detmer of Brigham Young is only the fourth-ranked passer in the NCAA. . . .  </P> <P> Five of the eight Ivy League teams are tied for first place. . . .  </P> <P> If you thought Boog Powell was big when he was playing ball, you should have  seen him on ESPN's "Sports Look" the other day. . . .  </P> <P> Billy Hatcher is bringing the two-handed catch back to baseball. . . .  </P> <P> It's surprising to hear so many Dodger fans say they can do without Darryl  Strawberry. . . .  </P> <P> Funniest TV bit over the weekend came during CBS' telecast of the Washington  Redskins-Philadelphia Eagles game when John Madden doubted that the Goodyear  blimp was really as long as a football field. . . .  </P> <P> When Ryan O'Neal talks about boxing as a sportscaster on his new sitcom with  Farrah Fawcett, he won't have to fake it. O'Neal, who managed welterweight  contender Hedgemon Lewis, is a walking encyclopedia of the sport. . . .  </P> <P> Lori Johns, the top fuel racer who suffered spinal injuries in an accident four  years ago, toured Casa Colina Hospital for Rehabilitative Medicine in Pomona  with Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia Tuesday. . . .  </P> <P> Lee Trevino is the leading money winner on any PGA tour this year and soon will  reach the $1-million mark. . . .  </P> <P> The Philadelphia 76ers like the toughness of guard Brian Oliver, their  second-round draft choice from Georgia Tech. . . .  </P> <P> Eastern basketball talk: The Boston Celtics could be vastly improved with the  return of Brian Shaw and with Larry Bird ready to go at top speed from opening  night. In contrast, the New York Knicks might have a down season and will miss  shooting forward Johnny Newman. . . .  </P> <P> Don't be surprised to see the Charlotte Hornets put Rex Chapman, who has been  demoted to second string, on the trading block. . . .  </P> <P> Rick Dempsey, who has played his last game for the Dodgers, is good managerial  material. . . .  </P> <P> Few people wrote about boxing or thoroughbred racing with more wit and wisdom  than Barney Nagler, the Daily Racing Form columnist who died Monday night at  78. . . .  </P> <P> Those high television ratings for the Raiders-San Diego Chargers game shows you  what winning will do to pump up interest in a Los Angeles team. . . .  </P> <P> I was reminded Monday night that my favorite celebration in football is the  Ickey Shuffle. A lot of fun and not insulting to the other team. . . .  </P> <P> It shouldn't be long before Raider assistant coach Mike White, who has done  wonders with Jay Schroeder, becomes a head coach somewhere in the NFL. . . .  </P> <P> I already miss the box scores.  </P></p>

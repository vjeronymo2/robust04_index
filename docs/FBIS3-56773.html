The capital's chief is worried  about the fact that certain members of government are trying to  "push through" a plan for the elimination of federal food  stocks, introduce high customs duties on food, put a stop to  preferential credits, and abolish foreign food subsidies.    It is for the State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy to  decide whether or not there is a deal between the organ of state  power and the major economic bodies. But the fact remains that  the adoption of these decisions can only benefit our food  lobbyists -- the monopolists -- and will hit the pockets of  practically all strata of the population hard. For example,  Russian sugar magnates are greatly irked by the fact that  imported sugar retails at 600 rubles [R] per kg, whereas sugar  leaves our refineries at a price of R900 per kg. But since they  do not want the bother of cutting production costs and so on,  the monopolists dream about using their own sector ministers'  hands to strangle foreign competitors.    Moreover, the open letter points out, given the current  decline in agricultural production, Muscovites can rely neither  on Russia's regions nor on the CIS countries. For instance, in  the first six months of 1994 the proposed volumes of purchases  of vegetable oil for the capital are only 7 percent of what is  required, while the equivalent figures for meat and meat  products are 35 percent, for butter 41 percent, and for powdered  milk 63 percent.    "By informing you of this," Yuriy Luzhkov writes, "we hope,  Esteemed Viktor Stepanovich, to secure your assistance and  support and ask you to prevent the situation from becoming  critical by immediately adopting the Russian Federation  Government draft decree, elaborated by the ministries and  departments in conjunction with the Moscow government in  accordance with your instructions, on providing the population  of Moscow with food. The examination of it by the Russian  Federation Economics and Finance Ministries has been delayed for  no reason since last November."    Rather long-winded, but very urgent and timely. The  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office, which, for obvious reasons,  lives in Moscow, fully endorses its mayor's request.</p>

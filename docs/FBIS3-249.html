			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just heard that for about half an hour this  morning about 20 Somalis directed fire at the former Italian  Embassy in Mogadishu, in which a unit of the Italian contingent  is based.    Guards returned fire, as did the crews on two caterpillar  vehicles that were returning to the base when they also came  under attack.    No Italians have been hurt. The Somalis fled shortly  afterward and it is not known if any of them were hurt. The  motives behind the attack are not yet known.</p>

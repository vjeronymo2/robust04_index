			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: BART SIMPSON? KIDS NEED A BRAT LIKE HIM  </P> <P> It is no surprise that Bart Simpson has become a role model for every kid in  America. And why not? The TV cartoon character is insensitive, rotten and  manipulative. If he lived next door, you would forbid your child to play with  him.  </P> <P> This is upsetting for many educators and parents, as it "sends out the wrong  message to children."  </P> <P> For as long as I can remember, there have been characters in this world who  play off goodness. Just when you thought Shirley Temple's face would break out  from so much perfection, along came Jane Withers, who could make her cry. For  some reason, this minimized the fiction.  </P> <P> You could always count on the Beav and Wally to do the right thing, but the  character my kids really related to was Eddie Haskell, who sneaked into movies  without paying, never cut the grass and in general spelled trouble. You just  knew when he said, "Gee, Mrs. Cleaver, didn't I see your twin on the cover of  Seventeen magazine?" that he was full of it, but so what?  </P> <P> Kids need to know that somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull  off all the things they fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their  parents and still be permitted to live.  </P> <P> Children are made up of certain component parts: goodness, conscience, daring,  judgment, cuteness, larceny and rebellion. There's a little of Dennis the  Menace in them, a tad of Oscar the Grouch, a snippet of the Brady Bunch.  </P> <P> They are endowed with the same ambivalence as their parents. Adults love their  children more than life one minute, and the next threaten to chain them to  their beds through puberty.  </P> <P> The message always seems clear, though. Mike Seaver on "Growing Pains" and  Dennis on "Head of the Class" get their comeuppance for their behavior. Hey,  didn't Bart get shipped off to France as a slave to a couple of sleazy  winemakers?  </P> <P> I wouldn't have been surprised if my kids had chosen Lizzie Borden as a role  model. We're dealing with relationships where the protagonist is always bigger,  taller, older and has permanent possession of the car keys. The children are  the ones who always have to listen, learn and do as they're told. I wouldn't  deprive them of Bart for anything in the world.  </P> <P> Be honest. When Roseanne wins a round with her teen-agers, don't we all stand a  little taller?  </P></p>

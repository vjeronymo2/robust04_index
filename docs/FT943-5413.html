			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: For those with a taste for learning - Cooker / Philippa Davenport looks at courses, classes and demonstrations being held this Michaelmas term September heralds the Michaelmas term. Back to school for the young; time for the not-so-young to consider new beginnings or, perhaps, refresher courses. This autumn the choice for aspirant and accomplished cooks seems wider than ever and evening classes are on the increase. Those who want to learn new kitchen tricks and culinary skills might reap much pleasure and benefit from a two-day intensive hands-on workshop run by Sonia Stevenson. Although alternative courses are sometimes offered, sauce-making and fish cookery are Stevenson's specialities. An amazing amount is packed into each day. Classes are restricted to a maximum of eight participants and tuition is highly personal to accommodate can't-boil-an-egg types as well as budding Masterchef contestants. Stevenson, ex chef-patronne of the Horn of Plenty in Devon, is a travelling tutor. Dates and venues scheduled for the next couple of months include September 10-11 and 13-14 near Guildford; September 26-27 and 28-9 in Clapham; October 1-2 and 4-5 in Warwick; a one day course on October 12 in Norfolk; October 17-18 near Liskeard; October 29-30 and November 5-6 near Edinburgh. Two-day courses cost Pounds 158. For further details and bookings, tel: 0752-851813. If you prefer to leave your apron at home and be entertained as you pick up a few culinary ideas, demonstrations might suit you better. In London, Divertimenti, the well-known cookshop, has created a demonstration theatre area in the centre of its Fulham Road emporium. Performing there are cookery writers and chefs, often with new books to promote. Each demonstration lasts about 2 1/2 hours and costs Pounds 24. Sessions start at either 10am or 7pm. Forthcoming attractions include restaurateur Stephen Bull on September 6; Robin Weir, ice-cream maker, on September 20; Marie-Pierre Moine, the increasingly popular and highly respected French-born food writer, on October 18; Lindsey Bareham, author of two of my favourite books, In Praise of the Potato and A Celebration of Soup, on November 1; and Henrietta Green, compiler of the Food Lovers' Guide to Britain, on November 15. For further details and bookings, tel: 071-581 8065. Autumn term begins at Valvona &amp; Crolla, the Edinburgh deli, has a with Sue Lawrence, winner of Masterchef 1992, demonstrating breads, pies and tarts on September 21 and 22. Claire Macdonald, author, journalist and mistress of Kinloch Lodge Hotel takes the floor on September 27 and 28; Olivia Contini cooks fungi on October 10 and 11; Hilary Brown of La Potiniere tackles notions for Christmas on November 1; while Scotland's youngest Michelin starred chef, Nick Nairn of Braeval Old Mill, Aberfoyle, takes his turn on November 15. For further details and bookings, tel: 031-556 6066. There is much to be said for watching a chef at work on his or her home territory. Claire Macdonald is running a series of mid-week breaks (two days and three nights) at Kinloch Lodge Hotel on the Isle of Skye. Mornings will be spent watching and gleaning recipes and tips from Lady Macdonald, with free time in the afternoons. Proposed dates are November 9-11, November 15-17, November 23-25. The cost is Pounds 290 per person for tuition, accommodation and meals (but not drinks). A five-night break is scheduled for October 24-28 when two mornings of cookery demonstrations will be supplemented by two mornings of gardening. For further details and bookings tel: 04713-214, or fax: 04713-277. Lady Macdonald is a cook rooted in the country house tradition. Her style is confident and practical. Her food is blessedly unpretentious. She writes and speaks with bubbling enthusiasm, is a good lateral thinker and has a gift for vivid description. No slavish follower of passing fads and fashions, she is not afraid of roux-based sauces and has a sensible old-fashioned respect for butter and cream used in their proper place. Nor is she extravagant: her recipes often make use of such ingredients as mussels, kidneys and praline, none of them noted bank robbers. Here is a sample taste of her cooking from Suppers (Doubleday Pounds 15.99) to be published on September 8. OYSTERS WITH GINGER &amp; SPRING ONIONS (Serves 6) This is an aromatic and original way to serve oysters instead of slipping them raw and briny down the throat. Serve with boiled Basmati rice and a crunchy salad. Depending on their size, allow 5-6 oysters per person for a main course (or 3 for a first course); about 2 inches fresh root ginger; 18-20 good spring onions (not weedy grass-thin ones); 3 tablespoons sunflower oil;  1/2 pt single cream. Method: Shell the oysters. Peel the ginger and cut the flesh into fine slivers. Trim the spring onions and cut diagonally into  1/4 -inch slices. Heat the oil in a wide shallow pan (saute or frying pan) and cook the ginger and spring onions, stirring continuously, for about 3 minutes. Then add the oysters and cook for a few seconds before pouring on the cream. Let the cream bubble for about a minute. Season with salt and pepper, tip into a warmed dish and serve as soon as possible. LEEKS IN HAM IN GOAT'S CHEESE SOUFFLE (Serves 6) This is essentially a variation on the classic dish of chicory wrapped in ham and cloaked in cheese sauce. A salad dressed with walnut oil is recommended for serving on the side. 12 medium leeks, trimmed, well washed and steamed till just tender; 12 very thin slices of ham; 2oz butter; 2oz self-raising flour;  3/4 pt milk; salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper and a grating of nutmeg;  1/2 lb fresh creamy goats' cheese; 4 large eggs, separated. Method: Butter an oval or oblong ovenproof dish. Wrap each just-cooked leek in a slice of ham and lay them in the dish. Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour. Cook for a minute before pouring in the milk, gradually. Stir continuously till the sauce boils. Take the pan off the heat, season and stir in the goats' cheese. Beat in the yolks, one by one, then whisk the whites until they are very stiff. With a large metal spoon, fold the whisked whites quickly and thoroughly through the cheese sauce. Pour the mixture over the ham-wrapped leeks. Bake straight away or set aside, covered, for 2-3 hours before cooking if more convenient. Bake at 425F (220C) gas mark 7 for 30 minutes. The souffle mixture should be very slightly runny in the middle when served.</p>

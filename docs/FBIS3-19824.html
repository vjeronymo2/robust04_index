			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Brussels] </F>   [Text] European foreign ministers today failed to breach  the log-jam over voting rights which has brought turmoil to  plans to enlarge the Union and left Britain all but isolated.    The talks in Brussels were adjourned until Saturday [26  March] when the 12 foreign ministers, including Britain's  Douglas Hurd, will meet in Ioannina, Greece, in a renewed bid to  heal the rift.    But today, Mr Hurd emerged from the meeting insisting that  the talks had not collapsed and that Britain remained "at the  heart of Europe."    The crisis hinges on the number of votes needed to block  European decisions once the European Union [EU] is enlarged from  12 to 16 next January with the addition of Sweden, Norway,  Finland and Austria.    The refusal by Britain and Spain to adapt the voting rules  has triggered the current stand-off which leaves Britain  ominously isolated and has become a major distraction for the  Conservative Party in the run up to Euro elections in June.    At present EU nations have to muster a total of 23 votes out  of the 76 available to block a contentious proposal which means  at least three of the 12 member states must vote together  against any proposition.    The new proposals increase the total votes to 90 with the  four new members and seek to raise the number needed for a veto  to 27.    Mr Hurd had arrived in Brussels saying he was not seeking to  "torpedo" enlargement plans but would not be "hustled" into any  agreement which was not in British interests.</p>

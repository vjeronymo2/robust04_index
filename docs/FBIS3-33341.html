			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by James Aparicio] </F>   [Text] An investigation conducted by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA  disclosed that General Ruben Dario Paredes and Ruben Dario  Carles, presidential candidate and former comptroller, have made  a pact to include former Panama Defense Forces [FDP] officers in  his movement and discredit opposition candidate Perez Balladares.    Paredes, the man who closed the media and imposed censorship  on 31 July 1982 with his famous phrase "as of now," negotiated  with Carles for an advisory position on public security matters  as well as for the creation of a support group.    Paredes has called at least three meetings with former  officers, among them Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Delgado, Lt. Col.  Carlos Arosemena King, Lt. Col. Juan Antonio Guizado, Major  Severino Mejia, and Arrigo Guardia, one of the main promoters of  Carles' candidacy.    Mitchel Doens, first assistant secretary of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD), told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that his  group knows about these meetings and asserted that there is a  "fallacy campaign" promoted by Paredes and Carles' electoral  team.    According to Doens, "the main goal (of the campaign) is to  spread the rumor that the PRD wants to reestablish the army and  that it has made a secret pact with former FDP officers."    "Carles' and Paredes' goal is to keep the PRD from attaining  power," Doens said.    When Perez Balladares launched his presidential campaign he  said that he would not make changes to the current Public Force,  that he would make the Public Force more professional, and that  under no circumstances would he incorporate the former FDP  officers into that force.    Last week Doens sent a letter to Stanley Muschett, president  of the Peace and Justice Commission, warning him that a campaign  was being prepared and that it "is based on false documents,  slanderous statements, and even offenses against the candidacy  of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares."    According to Doens, they are planning to make public an  alleged pact "between Dr. Perez Balladares and officers of the  defunct FDP to reestablish militarism in Panama."    "Everyone knows our candidate's position. He has stated  quite clearly that he will respect the current structures of the  Public Force and will not reinstate any former officer who was  not already an active member of the force on 1 January 1994,"  Doens recalled.    Doens reminded Muschett that the PRD will continue to  respect  the Santa Maria La Antigua Political Parties Pact that was also  signed by the coalition that supports Carles.    "Our goal (the PRD's) is to follow that ethical line, giving  priority to the debate of the problems of the Panamanian people  and suggestions for the solution of these problems," Doens said,  adding that the Peace and Justice Commission must not allow  itself to be surprised "by those who are bent on violating the  agreements they promised to respect."</p>

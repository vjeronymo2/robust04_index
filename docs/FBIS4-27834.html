			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The May targets were  topped by many units of the national economy of Korea.    The Anju, Sunchon, Tokchon and Pukchang area coal complexes,  which had waged a vigorous increased production drive from the  beginning of the year, far surpassed the monthly plans on all  indices by producing more coal than the daily quotas through the  active introduction of advanced coal-cutting methods in May.    The Munmuri mine under the Ministry of Mining Industry hit  the monthly goal five days earlier than the set time by keeping  the equipment in full-capacity operation.    The March 17 United Hydraulic Power Plant, the Kanggye Youth  Power Station, the Taechon United Hydraulic Power Plant and  other hydraulic power stations fulfilled their monthly  assignments far ahead of schedule. These days they have chalked  up the record high in recent years in power production.    In May the foreign shipping plan was carried out at 103  percent, domestic shipping plan at 106 percent and freight  traffic turnover plan at ports at 105 percent under the Ministry  of Marine Transport.    The May targets were topped also by the Namhung Youth  Chemical Complex, the associated local industry bureau, the  general bureau of garment industry, the foodstuff complex of  Pyongyang, the general bureau of local industry of South Pyongan  and South Hwanghae Provinces, the Korean cigarette group and  many other industrial establishments.</p>

The latter detailed  his 14-15 February visit to Burma, authorized by the Burmese  Government, to meet with Burmese leader General Khin Nyunt and  opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.    Minister Surin said the new development reflects U.S.  interest in Burma and the importance it attaches to diplomatic  contacts with Burma. It also reflects the same concern that  ASEAN feels for Burma. The deputy foreign minister said  Representative William Richardson expressed his satisfaction  that there is greater access to the Burmese leader and to Aung  San Suu Kyi as a result of the constructive engagement policy.    Mr. William Richardson also wants Thailand to help promote  unity in Burma in the areas of politics, narcotics, and human  rights, and stressed Thailand's role with regards to the Burmese  refugees at the common border with Burma. He said that  Thailand, as Burma's neighbor, is in a good position to help  Burma solve these problems. The deputy foreign minister said  Thailand would do as much as it could to help Burma and provide  the facilities that it needs.</p>

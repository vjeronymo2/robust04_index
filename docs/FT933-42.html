			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (5): A city at war with itself - Ahmedabad usually suffers six riots a year A GROUP of schoolboys plays cricket in a back alley of Ahmedabad. The ball accidentally hits a passer-by, and it is enough to spark off a communal riot between Hindus and Moslems in the city. Ahmedabad has had the worst record of riots in the country - each year, for the past eight years, there have been at least six riots on an average. Curfew is imposed and the army often summoned to help restore law and order, workdays are lost, and factories come to a grinding halt. The city's streets are transformed into a wasteland by arsonists shouting slogans and setting buses and cars alight. The looting and arson is often carried out by gangs divided along religious lines. And the police are little help at times like these because they become Hindus or Moslems first, to the detriment of duty. This once-flourishing industrial city of Gujarat in western India has been tainted by its violent reputation. And yet, it is not that its people are intolerant. The Guajaratis are usually a timid, peace-loving race. Founded by the Moghul emperor Ahmed Shah on the banks of the river Sabarmati, Ahmedabad grew into an important textile centre at the turn of the century, and was often described as the 'Manchester of the east'. Hindus and Moslems shared a common culture, especially since most of the Moslem population were converted from Hinduism three centuries ago. The mill owners and cloth traders were traditionally Hindus, while the textile workers were Moslem. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a boom in the industrial growth of the city. Though the cotton mills were facing a recession, other large industrial houses were attracted to the city because of its spirit of enterprise. Large drug companies such as Torrent Pharmaceuticals and Cadilla were among those which decided to set up business there. But many middle-class dreams were shattered in 1985, when riots broke out against the reservation of places for the underprivileged in educational institutions. This agitation was given a communal twist as there were many Moslems among the disadvantaged, since they were the poorer community. The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had very little support in the traditionally Gandhian-socialist stronghold (Mahatma Gandhi was from Gujarat), suddenly found a political issue to establish a base. The BJP has had a phenomenal rise in the state, and is likely to win power there in the next elections. Mr EA Khan, a retired bureaucrat, decided to move from his home state, Uttar Pradesh, to Ahmedabad. He had been posted there for 10 years in the 1970s, and testifies to the city's dramatic change for the worse. 'When I moved back here a few years ago, there was a distinct polarisation between members of the two communities,' he says. 'I found it difficult to find a landlord to rent a house to a Moslem, which was most distressing.' Ahmedabad, with its population of nearly 4m and an area which has over the years expanded to 280 square kilometres, is 'an overgrown village,' says Mr Doshi, an architect. 'Social tensions are often the root cause of riots, and if people are herded together like they have been in the walled city, the proximity will only create deep chasms between them, which is what has happened. Then all differences are accentuated, and religious differences are always the easiest to erupt.' Real estate in Ahmedabad is dependent on the communal colour of an area. Entire streets have sometimes been sold for a song when one community decides that it is too dangerous to live in a particular place, and has moved to a safer part of town. The construction industry, which is usually booming thanks to Ahmedabad's nouveaux riches businessmen and diamond merchants, collapses when there is a riot or long days of curfew. In July 1992, 25 people lost their lives after communal tensions led to yet another bloody riot. And when a mosque was destroyed in Ayodhya in December last year, Ahmedabad was badly hit with lengthy curfews and at least 50 people dead. Many Moslems have moved to the Gulf countries for jobs, since fewer and fewer Moslems are being employed by Hindu factory owners. Unemployed youth of both communities, however, find ready work in the large Mafia which controls the bootlegging trade (Gujarat is India's only 'dry' state, where prohibition is still - loosely - enforced). The rise of the BJP and the upsurge of Hindu nationalism in the city will only make things worse.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Broadgate The tussle over the future of London's prestigious Broadgate development is starting to resemble an elaborate game of poker. In addition to Rosehaugh and Stanhope, joint owners of Broadgate Properties, at least three sets of anxious bankers and an unknown number of potential buyers are involved. British Land, the most aggressive of the bidders, has already strengthened its hand by buying a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope itself. Talk of Stanhope's debt changing hands in the secondary market raises the suspicion that it, or another bidder, is trying to apply additional pressure. Whatever the truth on that score, it is the attitude of lenders rather than shareholders that will determine the final outcome. With the property market moving in their favour, Rosehaugh's receivers and bankers have said that they are in no mood to sell their share of Broadgate for less than a full price. Since Stanhope is under pressure to restructure its Pounds 160m debt by the end of the year, though, the question is whether its syndicate of 15 banks is prepared to take an equally optimistic view. The Pounds 1.5bn target valuation of Broadgate by Stanhope's surveyors must encourage them to do so. If the heady assumptions about rental growth prove to be correct it would make sense for Stanhope to retain an equity interest in Broadgate rather than selling at the first opportunity. After the disappointments of recent years, though, the bankers must be inclined to treat such forecasts with suspicion. The bidders must decide whether to call their bluff.</p>

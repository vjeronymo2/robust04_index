			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 2 (TANJUG) -- Slovene Prime Minister  Janez Drnovsek on Sunday warned the leadership of the  neighbouring Republic of Croatia that `Slovenia may take a  firmer stand towards Croatia as regards the resolution of mutual  problems.' Drnovsek told Ljubljana Television that so far it  has been Slovenia alone that has initiated talks, `sticking by  what is termed a soft stand.' That was why Slovenia decided to  `cool off relations for Croatia to realize that this problem  must be of joint concern,' said Drnovsek.    In recent months, Slovene-Croatian relations have been  broken  off entirely, as was asserted also by Slovene Foreign Minister  Lojze Peterle. One-time firm alliance between Ljubljana and  Zagreb in breaking Yugoslavia has been affected by a series of  outstanding territorial and other matters [sentence as received].    The central problem is posed by a future sea border in the  Piran Bay. Both sides adhere to their origiinal stands --  Slovenia insists on the current border, Croatia on a redrawn  border. The settlement of the sea border issue, analysts  believe, might engage also an international arbitration. In  that case an additional weight would be put on what are at this  time only minor territorial questions.</p>

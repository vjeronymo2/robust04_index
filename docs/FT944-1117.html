			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Samsung seeks site for new plant Samsung, the Korean industrial group building a Pounds 450m electronics complex in Cleveland, is 'seriously considering' setting up a UK plant to assemble excavators and other heavy equipment. The group, which earlier this week marked the establishment of its European headquarters in Britain by switching on a big neon sign in London's Piccadilly Circus, said it was considering a number of sites for the new plant. Mr Sung-Rai Choi, the recently appointed president of Samsung Europe, said the group expected to make a decision on the new investment soon. No financial details of the planned level of additional investment were given, but Samsung said the new plant was expected to employ about 100 people initially. Mr Jaehyung Lee, managing director of Samsung UK, said the proposed plant would initially be used to assemble excavators, although production might be extended to include fork lift trucks and other equipment. Samsung is understood to be negotiating over a number of potential sites. An inward investment specialist familiar with the negotiations said yesterday that the company 'has looked at the whole of the north-east of England as part of its site selection programme'.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Reality threatens to overcome China-Taiwan rivalry / Preview of talks between Beijing and Taipei that may for the first time address the issue of direct sea and air links Village chief Huang, who has spent most of his 64 years fishing out of Nanliao, a small port on the north-west coast of Taiwan, is angry. Since the government cracked down on a brisk trade in smuggling goods between the island and China a few years ago, local fishermen are having a tough time making ends meet. 'The government should just legalise direct shipping with China and make those smugglers pay tax, like they do on the mainland side,' complains Mr Huang. 'That's a much better way to manage things. Instead, they send the fishermen to jail, burn their boats and the police confiscate the goods for themselves. This is totally unreasonable. Besides, it isn't really smuggling anyway; it's domestic trade.' Even as Mr Huang was speaking, officials from rival governments in Taipei and Beijing were preparing to hold high-level talks in which, Taiwanese newspapers have suggested, Taipei may for the first time address the issue of resuming direct sea and air links to China. Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned the san tung or 'three directs' - transportation, trade and post - with China since 1949, when General Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist forces. Fast-growing cross-strait trade is mostly funneled through Hong Kong. But smuggling and illegal fishing in the Taiwan Strait surged once the government lifted martial law and began to relax coastal defence operations in 1987. Positioned at the narrowest point along the strait, Nanliao became a smuggling hub. To traverse the 70-odd nautical miles to Pingtan on the coast of China's Fujian province takes 10 hours by fishing boat, three to four hours by cruiser, or less than two hours by speedboat. Lured by high returns, local fishermen plied the waters in wooden boats laden with contraband ranging from liquor, cigarettes and medicines, to narcotics from betel to heroin and human cargo which has found its way to shores as far-flung as New York. Judging by the number of Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs on the sleepy byways of Nanliao, some locals profited handsomely before Taiwan's maritime police swooped on Nanliao. Cross-strait smuggling has simply been diverted elsewhere, mainly along Taiwan's northern coast. An estimated 200 fishing boats make the crossing each day. Smuggled Chinese products can be found in markets and 30,000 mainlanders are illegally living on the island. From tomorrow, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, Mr Chiao Jen-ho, will begin four days of talks with his counterpart from Beijing, Mr Tang Shubei. Little progress has been made in five previous quasi-official cross-strait discussions since ground-breaking meetings in April 1993. But the stalemate in political relations belies resurgent economic ties, driven by cultural and family connections as well as the search by Taiwan businessmen for cheap labour, land, raw materials and markets. Taiwanese investment in China is estimated at more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn). Taiwan officials predict that Hong Kong, the main conduit, will soon supplant the US as the island's biggest export market. In the first half of this year, shipments to the US accounted for 25.9 per cent of total exports, down 1.8 per cent from a year earlier. Exports to the British colony jumped 11.2 per cent to account for 22.9 per cent of outbound shipments. Most shipments headed for Hong Kong are destined for China. A leading Chinese businessman visited the island last week under the guise of promoting cross-strait golfing exchanges. Mr Wang Jun, president of the China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), China's leading international business conglomerate, met with senior figures in politics and business. Mr Wang's low-profile tour of the island included a trip to Taichung harbour, which is preparing for the advent of cross-strait shipping. It is perhaps no coincidence that Citic and Bechtel Enterprises, the finance and development arm of the engineering group, last week jointly announced a port development plan at Daxie Island, about 100 miles south of Shanghai. So far, Taipei has refused to discuss direct links on the grounds that Beijing must first recognise Taiwan as a sovereign government. China continues to regard Taiwan as a renegade province. But as economic ties between the two sides grow, so too does pressure from Taiwan's business community, making it increasingly difficult for Taipei to stave off the inevitable. The ministry of transportation and communications promised early last month to produce a report by mid-1995 outlining technical aspects of direct sea and air links with China. This is probably little more than a stalling technique, as the ministry has already been studying the matter for years. But the government knows it must come to grips with the issue before June 30 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, for then there can be no more pretence of keeping China at arm's length.</p>

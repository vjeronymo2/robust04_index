			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Coal: cabinet tinkering when competition should be the aim Sir, Mr J D Meads (Letters, January 20) correctly points out that, with no competition from imported coal or any other energy source, British Coal could produce 60m tonnes of coal a year profitably. This is not the point. Competition is fundamental to allow a consumer choice and, regrettably for coal, competitive sources of fuel are, and must, remain available. Mr Meads goes on to cast gas as the main culprit for the demise of the UK coal industry, but care must be taken in making sweeping assertions about an industry as large and diversified as the offshore gas industry which has many jobs at stake in the current energy review. Under the currently contemplated five-year coal contracts, the limit of 40m tonnes a year falling to 30m tonnes is set by the size of the franchise market for electricity, of which nearly 40 per cent will by 1995 be accounted for by those gas-fired generating stations with long-term take or pay contracts with the regional electricity companies. It is, however, important to recognise that not all gas-fired power stations supply the franchise market and those which do not (owned by National Power and PowerGen) have no impact on the five-year coal contracts under consideration. The current debate has had a severe and unjustifiable impact on the development of these stations, such as at Connahs Quay in Clwyd, with enormous implications for loss of investment and new jobs. The only thing preventing British Coal increasing its output beyond the level of the five-year contract is its inability to compete with imported coal. All our efforts must be directed to making British Coal internationally competitive rather than trying to shut down competing industry in the UK particularly at a time when we can ill afford to lose jobs in any industry, be it coal, nuclear or oil and gas.

The solutions, Ciampi suggested, lie in "consistent"  attitudes at the next round of contract renewal talks and by the  next government, which must pick up where this executive leaves  off.    According to Ciampi, unemployment is caused by both external  and structural conditions. Tackling both involves focusing on  macro-economics, such as future labor accords in which wage  increases are linked to production and private industry is  encouraged to invest in infrastructures.    In the medium- and long-term, Ciampi continued, economic  policies must follow the lines adopted by the European  Commission in its job-creation plan, especially concerning  investments.    In Italy in particular, he added, the government must pursue  privatizations and the streamlining of public administration,  increasing efficiency. At the same time, the job market must be  made more "flexible" while maintaining protection for workers.</p>

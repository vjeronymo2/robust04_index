			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Receivers at Palmerston subsidiaries Three subsidiaries of Palmerston Holdings, the property group, have had receivers appointed by Hill Samuel Bank after they were unable to meet a demand to repay Pounds 10.4m of loans by June 7. The announcement was made last night after the market had closed. The shares were unchanged at 15p. The companies in receivership are Reliable Properties, Florin Properties and Benjamin &amp; Edward. In January Palmerston announced it had breached its banking covenants, partly because the value of its properties had declined, and partly because of the support its associate companies required. Further, Borodin Properties, another subsidiary, has requested in writing for Bankers Trust and the Bank of Yokohama to appoint an official receiver as it is unable to meet current and future tax liabilities. The current debt to the banks is Pounds 3.7m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Undated statement by political parties and movements of </F> Orenburg and Volga regions entitled "U.S Troops Have No Business  on Our Soil," published under "Letter to People's Newspaper"  rubric: "Totskiy Range Again"]    [Text] As reported in the press, Brigadier General Leonard  Holder Jnr., commander of the U.S. 3d Infantry Division, has  visited Totskiy Range in Orenburg Oblast to reconnoiter the  tactical exercise scheduled for July 1994 involving U.S. and  Russian Federation servicemen. General P. Grachev, Russian  Federation defense minister, had also visited Volga Military  District units a little earlier.    The following question arises: What kind of "peacekeeping"  missions do the U.S. 3d Infantry and Russian 27th Divisions  intend to solve jointly?    Bloody conflicts began on many republics' territories  following the Soviet Union's disbandment. The Russian economy  and the economies of other states formed on USSR territory ended  up in a catastrophic situation. It is also alarming that the  country's defense potential, created by the Soviet people's  intensive labor, has been lost to a considerable extent.  Meanwhile NATO countries headed by the United States are  cynically flexing their military muscles. They launched missile  and bomb attacks on the Iraqi people, they are issuing  ultimatums to Cuba, the DPRK, and our fraternal Serbian people,  they are shooting down aircraft in the Bosnian skies, and they  are threatening to bomb Serb positions.    It is painful for working people of the Orenburg and Volga  regions, like all Russians, to see the country's military and  economic might and political authority declining in the course  of reforms directed against the people. The increasing  peremptoriness with which Western powers are openly interfering  in Russia's internal affairs is a cause of anger and indignation  to us.    The Orenburg region is turning into a kind of communal yard  and a dumping ground for Western enterprises' harmful waste.  Israeli, French, and Dutch enterprises have sent around 20 cars  to the oblast loaded with industrial waste which is dangerous to  people's health. While the authorities can reconcile themselves  to such shameful phenomena, we have no intention of doing so.  Sociopolitical organizations in the Orenburg and Volga regions  strongly protest against the attempt to hold military exercises  involving the U.S. Army in a strategically important region of  Russia where the defense industry is densely concentrated and  which is the people's breadbasket. We demand that the Russian  Federation president and Government cancel the Defense  Ministry's plans to hold exercises on southern Urals territory.  We call on the State Duma to protect working people's  fundamental interests and our oblasts' peaceful life. We call  on all honest patriots in the Urals and Volga region republics  and oblasts to raise their voices in defense of our country's  sovereignty. U.S troops have no business on our soil!

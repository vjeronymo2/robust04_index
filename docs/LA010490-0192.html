			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL/TOURISM;  </P> <P> TUSTIN MARKET PLACE SIGNS TWO FAST-FOOD EATERIES TO LEASES  </P> <P> The Tustin Market Place continues to attract new tenants -- this time, two  fast-food eateries and Chick's Sporting Goods.  </P> <P> In-N-Out Burger and El Pollo Loco are coming to the community shopping center  next year.  </P> <P> They are the first of four fast-food tenants planned for Tustin Market Place,  the 750,000-square-foot, open center at Jamboree Road and the Santa Ana  Freeway.  </P> <P> El Pollo Loco signed a 20-year lease and broke ground in December on a  2,700-square-foot building. The restaurant is scheduled for completion by July.  </P> <P> In-N-Out Burger, scheduled to open in the spring, has a 20-year lease for 3,500  square feet.  </P> <P> Announcement of the fast-food chains was made by Donahue Schriber of Newport  Beach, which is developing and managing the center.  </P> <P> Chick's Sporting Goods has signed a lease for 50,000 square feet at the center.  </P> <P> Chick's construction should begin in November, with completion scheduled for  early summer, 1990.  </P> <P> And construction was recently completed by two larger retailers -- T.J. Maxx  and Ross Dress for Less. Both merchants are leasing 23,000-square-foot spaces  at the shopping center.  </P> <P> Tustin Market Place first caught attention -- and a lot of criticism -- in late  1988.  </P> <P> That was after the Irvine Co., which owns Tustin Market Place, had painted the  center in a bold color scheme of purple and brownish-red. But when many  complained about the colors, the entire center was repainted in a brownish-red  tone.  </P> <P> Since then, the center has grown to include three home-improvement retailers as  anchor tenants -- STOR, Home Express and Home Depot.  </P> <P> A six-screen Edwards Cinema is also due to join the Tustin center eventually.

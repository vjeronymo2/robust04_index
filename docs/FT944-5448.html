			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: GMet up on broker support Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan rose 3 to 381p as the group's brokers lent their support. Full-year figures on Thursday had received a mixed reaction but buyers returned yesterday encouraged by recommendations from Panmure Gordon and NatWest Securities. Panmure pointed out that the shares were at a five-year low and analysts at the broker said: 'This discount to the average market rating must be unsustainable.' The team at NatWest Securities urged investors to 'add' to holdings and said: 'The shares look fairly rated for 1995, at a small discount to the market for a year in which we forecast a small decline in earnings. Thereafter, growth should start to accelerate.' Dealers also reported switching into GrandMet from Guinness, which fell 7 to 445p.</p>

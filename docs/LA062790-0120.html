			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES $531-MILLION BUDGET  </P> <P> Day care will cost more but there will be more police protection in Anaheim  under the city's $531-million 1990-91 budget, which was approved by the City  Council on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> In the first major increase in the past decade, the Police Department will  receive $2.9 million extra this year, which is a 7% jump in their current  operating fund. Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the money is the first step in a  plan to provide the city with additional service.  </P> <P> "It's small compared to our budget, but to us it's a tremendous start," Molloy  said.  </P> <P> The police staff will hire 18 new officers, who will be distributed in patrols,  and in teams combatting narcotics and drunk driving. Four of those officers and  one sergeant will begin a new community policing team that will work in  targeted neighborhoods that need extra protection, similar to the pilot program  in the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood, Molloy said.  </P> <P> The city's budget decreased by $9 million from last year but is still the  largest in the county. Santa Ana, which has a budget about half the size, is  second. While Anaheim is the largest city in the county, its budget is still  greatly oversized because its city-owned utility company accounts for about  half of the funds.  </P> <P> This year, the city will also benefit from the nearly $33-million settlement in  its lawsuit against the Anaheim Hilton and Towers. Most of the settlement will  be retained in a reserve fund.  </P> <P> Despite the increased funds in some areas, residents will see increases in the  costs of nearly every program offered through the city parks, recreation and  community service department.  </P> <P> Extended day care during the school year will cost up to $35 a month more, and  weeklong holiday day care camps will be increased by up to $15 a session.  </P> <P> Nearly every personal improvement and speciality class offered through the city  -- from computer training to photography -- will cost a few dollars more.  </P> <P> In addition, it will cost more to rent most of the city athletic fields, golf  courses, community meeting rooms and gymnasiums under the new budget.  </P> <P> The budget needs to be approved by the start of the fiscal year, July 1.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Oiang [7115 1730]: ``Multifunctional </F> Computer Fax System Unveiled'']    [Summary] The model ZL-560B multifunctional computer fax  system (version THI.0) was recently developed by Fujiang [3242  3068] Machine Plant in Mianyang, Sichuan. This multifunctional,  multipurpose office automation system is based on the Jiuzhou  brand model ZL-560 fax machine, which has all the functions of  the internationally prevalent G3 fax machine, but also includes  a built-in computer to provide integrated office automation and  communications services. The system replaces a keyboard or  scanner--documents and images can be directly input into the  computer, with a 1000-odd-character page requiring only 10  seconds for inputting. Resolution is 400 dpi [dots per inch]  and the number of gray levels is 64.</p>

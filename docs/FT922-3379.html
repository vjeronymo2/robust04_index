			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: Strategic choice One question that has been intriguing London's community of strategic thinkers for the past eight months - where will Francois Heisbourg, the high-flying director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, land next? - seems to have been resolved. The bubbling 42-year-old Frenchman will not for the moment be launching himself into politics. He's joining the defence and space division of France's Matra group, as senior vice president, when he vacates the IISS post in October. The former diplomat and defence ministry adviser had a three-year spell with industry before, at state-controlled Thomson-CSF, but this will be a more senior job. What will he be in charge of at Matra? Why, strategy, of course.</p>

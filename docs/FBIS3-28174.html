On the same day, an electronic jamming plane  [chonjajangaegi], which flew into the skies of the regions of  Yongwol and Pyongchang from Japan's (?Yokosuka) base, created  electronic jamming in this region. Also, they were running amok  in the concentrated attack exercise of invading the skies of the  operational regions by formations of pursuit assault planes and  vertical take-off and landing assault crafts which took off from  an overseas base.    This very provocative war exercise was playing with fire to  enhance the capability of unexpected attack amid electronic  jamming.    Also on this day, the South Korean puppets continuously  mobilized and deployed some 20 tanks and 300 armed hooligans  from Manu-ri toward Ogok-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province. In  addition, they kicked up a commotion of dragging in and  assembling large-caliber guns in the whole area of (Kagong)-ri,  Inje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea to the DMZ of the  Military Demarcation Line.</p>

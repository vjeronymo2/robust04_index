			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Upwards of 30,000  students of far more than a hundred universities across South  Korea under the South Korean Federation of General Student  councils Friday held rallies and protests and boycotted school  to check the "parliamentary ratification" of farm market opening  by the Kim Yong-sam group, a radio report from Seoul said.    Some 20,000 students of 20 odd universities in Seoul  including Korea and Hanyang Universities at their rallies  branded the enforcement schedule submitted by the Kim Yong-sam  regime to the GATT as humilitating one which complied with the  brigandish demand of the United States. They strongly urged its  revocation and "renegotiation of the Uruguay Round talks."    They held protests shouting "check the `parliamentary  ratification' of farm market opening" in the teeth of repression  by combat police of some 170 companies 20,000 strong.    Student protests also took place in Pusan, Kwangju, Taegu  and  other local cities.</p>

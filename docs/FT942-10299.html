			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Price war threat to profitable Kwik Save Kwik Save, the UK's biggest discount grocery retailer, yesterday announced an increase in interim profits before tax from Pounds 61m to Pounds 65.4m, but said trading was being damaged by last month's tax increases and prices were falling. Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said sales volumes from existing stores increased 3.2 per cent in the 28 weeks to March 12, but since the tax changes took effect, volume growth had fallen to 1 per cent. At the same time, grocery prices were now 3.5 per cent lower than last year, owing partly to intense price competition. An increase in liquor and tobacco prices offset that, but overall price deflation had reached 2 per cent, after averaging 1.2 per cent in the first half. Mr Graeme Bowler, chief executive, warned the tough competition would continue. 'I don't think it is something that is here today and gone tomorrow. We are in for a period of sustained pressure on prices,' he said. Kwik Save shares closed down 2p at 570p. Total turnover rose 9.1 per cent to Pounds 1.63bn, of which new stores contributed 8.4 percentage points. The operating profit increased 8.5 per cent to Pounds 66.3m. Mr Pretty said price competition had forced the gross margin down 0.2 percentage points - less than the falls reported by the superstore operators, thanks to alterations to the product mix, tough negotiations with suppliers and action to reduce shrinkage. The operating margin had fallen only 0.1 points to 3.6 per cent. Rental income from Kwik Save's fresh food concessions increased 18 per cent to Pounds 12.2m. Kwik Save now has 838 stores, and plans 80 openings a year for up to 10 years. Mr Bowler said recent research had identified 800 more locations throughout the UK where Kwik Save stores could trade profitably, including smaller towns which did not interest superstore operators. Capital spending will increase from Pounds 103m to Pounds 115m this year, with 45 store openings planned in the second half, on top of the 35 in the first half. Earnings increased from 26.5p to 28.36p per share, and the interim dividend was lifted from 5.4p to 5.75p. Lex, Page 26</p>

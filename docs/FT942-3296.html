			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Benfield expands its reinsurance activities Benfield Group, one of the UK's most successful reinsurance brokers, will today announce the launch of Benfield Re, a Pounds 50m London market reinsurance company. The venture is the latest of a number of new international reinsurance companies to have been launched in the last 18 months, following rises in rates after heavy losses between 1988 and 1992. Institutional investors backing the venture include Montagu Private Equity and Royal Bank Development Capital, the venture capital arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which also owns Direct Line, the highly profitable direct-response insurer. Institutions will invest Pounds 12.5m, with Benfield Group supplying Pounds 17.5m from existing cash resources. A further Pounds 20m of senior debt has been raised from Citibank and Lloyds Bank. Benfield Re will specialise in catastrophe reinsurance, underwriting sections of contracts negotiated by about a dozen so-called 'lead' underwriters from both Lloyd's and the London company market. It can accept up to Pounds 125m in premiums, although with rate competition beginning to return to the market, income in its first year, probably starting in January 1995, is likely to be much less. 'The new venture will perform a long-term role in the Benfield strategy. It is not under pressure to write premium to give us a return,' stressed Mr Matthew Harding, chairman. He said the new company would underwrite contracts brokered by a range of brokers but would have 'pretty obvious access to Benfield's account'. Like the Benfield brokerage group, the new company will co-operate with Frankona, a German reinsurance company, and Fortress Re, a US agency which underwrites on behalf of a group of Japanese companies. Benfield Group has grown rapidly in the last four years and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.2m in 1993 on turnover of Pounds 38.8m. Net asset value was Pounds 30.2m at June 30 1993. Four of its directors figured prominently in a recent listing of 500 of the UK's most wealthy individuals. Mr Harding, whose personal wealth was estimated at more than Pounds 100m in the survey, owns a minority stake in Chelsea Football Club after injecting Pounds 5m last year. His salary rose from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.4m last year. One of Benfield's four other directors earned more than Pounds 1.3m last year while another exceeded Pounds 985,000. With a total staff of 60 and a wage bill of more than Pounds 10m, including directors, Benfield's per capita pay rates - and profits - are among the highest in the UK.</p>

Based on its functions, there are two  different kinds of bond markets: Bond issue markets (primary  markets) and bond transfer markets (trading markets).    Issuing bonds is the traditional method for raising medium  and long-term capital in various countries. Floaters consist  mainly of enterprises established by governments, institutions,  and stock companies; public utilities such as railways,  telegrams, and telephones; and banking institutions and  international financial organizations. Through bond markets, a  large sum of capital can be raised within a short period.  Vouchers for bond markets are mainly government bonds, company  bonds, and security vouchers. Like company bonds, government  bonds are vouchers which repay capital with interest on terms;  however, because government bonds are guaranteed by government  creditability, they are fairly safe and entail only a small  risk. There are various kinds of company bonds, including a  small number of unsecured bonds from credit companies; however,  the majority are secured company bonds. Security vouchers are a  kind of contract certificate which enables debtors to use  certain property as a guaranty to raise long-term capital. In  the past, property used as guaranty was mostly real estate;  however, negotiable securities have recently become the most  common form of guaranty.    Bonds can be transferred or traded through two different  forms: commission and off-board transactions. The former, also  called on-board trading, refers to the selling and buying which  investors commission stock companies to engage in at stock  exchanges. As all bonds entering transaction at stock exchanges  are registered and come in great varieties, investors have the  option of investing in bonds with small risks, big  profitability, and strong liquidity. Off-board trading refers to  bond transactions between banks or enterprises and stock  companies. Presently bond transactions are concentrated mainly  on off-board trading. Payments for service charges differ  according to the forms of trading. Applicants for on-board  trading at stock exchanges are required to pay a commission  service charge. However, off-board trading does not have to pay  the service charge; the differential between the buying and  selling price of bonds is the service charge paid to stock  companies.    Presently bonds are generally transferred through four  different methods in China's secondary stock markets: 1) Direct  buying and selling by a company: based on listed prices,  companies buy discount bonds and transfer them to new buyers,  with the buying and selling price of bonds based on bank  discount rates, and with the prices fluctuating along with  market changes; 2) commission trading: bond holders and buyers  commission companies to sell or buy on their behalf, with prices  decided by the buyers and sellers, and with companies collecting  a fixed service charge; 3) mortgage: a bond holder who urgently  needs cash but cannot sell bonds through the aforesaid two  methods can mortgage bonds for capital and redeem them within a  time limit; otherwise the mortgage company has the right to  transfer the bonds; 4) appraisal and certification: after  transactions are completed, and in order to protect the rights  and interests of the buyers and sellers, companies are  responsible for appraising the authenticity of bonds and  collecting a certain percentage of their face value as appraisal  and certification fees.</p>

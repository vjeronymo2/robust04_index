			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Better to stay in control than try to branch out  -The pitfalls facing defence contractors seeking new markets in the civil sector When Dowty, a middle-sized defence engineering company, decided in the mid-1980s to diversify into the civil sector, it made a classic mistake. From its hard won position of providing command and control systems for Royal Navy ships, it plunged into a competition for a Pounds 700m civil aviation air traffic control system. But by 1991, it had finally lost out to formidable rivals like IBM or Thomson-CSF, the French state-owned company. The moral of the story, according to the National Economic Development Council which documented the case*, is that 'it is very difficult to topple established major players whose past performance has not been subject to significant problems'. This is only one of the many potential obstacles in the way of defence contractors seeking new markets. A recent survey of defence companies by The Technology Partnership, a consultancy, found that executives see many blocks to diversification, including: A lack of marketing skills in the civil sector. Management accustomed to dealing with one customer - the Ministry of Defence  -and unable to adapt to a more entrepreneurial environment. Financial pressures: banks have become less prepared to lend on risky projects and top management and shareholders compound the problem by demanding rapid returns on investment. Some companies can overcome these obstacles. Racal Avionics was formed in 1982 from Decca, which Racal had bought in 1980. At the time, it made aircraft radio equipment and sold 90 per cent of output for defence purposes. Leo Gallagher, marketing director, says that when Racal decided to try to find civil customers, it had two main planks to its strategy: to identify products with the potential to be world leaders and, therefore, to compete on technology rather than price. It found that some of its satellite communications equipment could be fitted to civil aircraft with little modification. The company underwent a profound cultural change, says Gallagher. 'We had to become absorbent to new ideas. There was a big impact on marketing and product support.' For example, sales staff had to recognise that while defence customers had their own maintenance crews, civil buyers did not. But without expertise in such levels of customer service, or in marketing outside the defence sector, Racal also needed partners. It established a joint venture with Honeywell, the US electronics company and formed a consortium with British Telecom and British Airways to develop aircraft-based satellite communications. More than 60 complete satellite communications systems have now been delivered at a typical cost of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 270,000) each. On the basis of this and nine more cases, NEDC has produced a set of guidelines for companies keen to diversify Build on strengths. Change the product or the market but not both. Prepare for cultural change. Relationships with customers and perceptions of how long it takes to get a product to market are different in the civil sector. Expertise may have to be recruited at the highest level. A dedicated project team is one answer. Be prepared to acquire people and skills through recruitment, acquisition or joint ventures. Prepare to spend. Diversification must be driven by the board; ideas from the workforce should be sought but rigorously pruned. If these rules look familiar, so they should. NEDC staff and defence executives see them as applicable to any company thinking of diversification, not just those in the defence sector. *Diversifying from Defence: Case Studies and Management Guidelines.

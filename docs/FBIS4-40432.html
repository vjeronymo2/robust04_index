			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 15 June TASS -- A strong and authoritative  power capable of making decisions and answering for their  consequences is necessary for Ukraine to get out of crisis.  "Nobody in the world has ever survived a crisis without a strong  authority," said Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian presidential  candidate, in a national radio broadcast on Wednesday.    If I am elected Ukrainian president, I will be ready to  assume full responsibility for the state of things in the  country, Kuchma emphasized.    "Ukraine needs to take a new political course which should  be  aimed at rejecting self-isolation, at restoring all mutually  beneficial economic, spiritual and cultural ties with the former  Soviet republics, and first of all with Russia," he said.    "Ukraine should be open to cooperation with the rest of the  world, and only then state-of-the-art Western technologies will  come here -- and application of these technologies holds the  country's future," he added.    Kuchma, who is now a leader of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, promised that his first move  in the position of Ukrainian president would be "to form a  united economic area with all the CIS countries."    At that rate, he will also "strive for Ukraine's full  membership in the economic union," declare for reaching an  agreement on hard currency and customs regulations based on  equal rights among the CIS countries and for an urgent  elimination of fixed karbovanets-US dollar exchange rate.    According to Kuchma, he will "strive for granting Russian an  official status, while Ukrainian will retain its state-language  status."    "I have never and nowhere risen the issue of restoring the  Soviet Union. But I will do my utmost to develop good  neighbourly relations with all those countries with which we  have traditional historic, economic and cultural ties. I have  always opposed building an independent state based on  anti-Russian sentiments," he said.    In his opinion, land should not be sold or purchased,  whereas  public medical and education services should be free of charge.    "I would like to realize the plans which they stopped me  from  realizing in 1993," he concluded.</p>

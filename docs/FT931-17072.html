			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Government finance By the time of the budget, attention may focus more strongly on the government finances. Not only may tax increases seem by then inevitable. The equity market will have to confront its greatest test of 1993: its ability to compete against a gilt market in which the government will be raising Pounds 1bn a week. The received wisdom is that, since government borrowing needs exceed institutional cash-flow, gilt yields will have to rise to the point where domestic investors switch out of equities on a large-scale. The theory is so neat and so beguiling that it must to some degree be suspect. Perhaps the government will, after all, decide to allow gilt sales to banks to be counted as funding the PSBR. Perhaps it will borrow foreign currencies abroad. Small savers may come to the rescue by switching out of building society accounts and into equity and gilt-linked investments. The recovery may be more robust than expected and the PSBR correspondingly smaller. None of these can count as sure predictions, but they are close enough to the realm of the possible to serve as a reminder that the funding problem need not turn out as dire as appears. Gilts and equity markets have been aware of the 1993-94 funding requirement since the Autumn Statement. Both have blithely ignored it so far.</p>

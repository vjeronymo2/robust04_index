			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Personal View: Hard lessons of Somalia's suffering The violence and famine unfolding in Somalia have left many people - both inside and outside the international relief agencies - shocked and shamed by their inability to prevent one of the world's most dire humanitarian disasters. Few participants in the relief effort will emerge from the catastrophe with their reputations unscathed. Some courageous non-governmental organisations (NGOs) stand out for special praise, however. The Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and SOS Kinderdorf have kept their flags flying in one of the most dangerous situations ever faced by aid workers. But the United Nations, the organisation which should have provided the lead, has failed to respond adequately to the crisis. Citing issues of sovereignty and the great danger of operating in the country, the UN has dithered. Only in the last few months has a big humanitarian effort begun to take shape. With every day of delay, the task of recovery has become harder as Somalia slips further into anarchy. Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN special envoy to Somalia, summed it up last week in a remarkably candid and self-critical press conference in Nairobi. 'If only we had intervened before November,' he said. 'Because of that delay, we now pay the price.' Belated efforts are now being made to tackle the humanitarian disaster, but in the meantime the lessons that have been learned in Somalia need to be put into action if further Somalias are to be averted in Africa. An early response to an unfolding disaster, better funding of NGOs and a re-examination of the concept of sovereignty are critical. For Somalia itself, the international community urgently needs to make high-level assessment visits; provide the right type of food in bigger quantities; fund efforts to get supplies into the interior; begin creating self-sufficiency rather than food-aid dependency; and, for the long term, undertake a massive development aid programme. For several years there has been a suggestion that a well-funded disaster relief office be set up at the UN. It should have the power to act swiftly and effectively without bureaucratic delay. The west should support such an initiative and provide it with ample resources. Governments must also massively increase funds to the NGOs which often prove very effective at moving swiftly and reaching those most severely in need. Last week Mr Sahnoun paid tribute to the NGOs which remained in Somalia despite fears for the safety of aid workers. The west must also stop dealing with local warlords who have no popular mandate as sovereign governments. For months protracted negotiations were undertaken between the UN and Somali warlords who control parts of the country. Thousands died during these diplomatic exchanges. Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, one of those warlords, continues to oppose the UN sending in blue-berets to safeguard humanitarian personnel and operations which most aid workers believe are vital to prevent many more deaths. This type of obstruction must stop. The humanitarian imperative should take priority over such sovereignty issues. There are many practical measures which the west could take immediately to help ease the suffering in Somalia. The first is to send a senior team of officials to see the situation for themselves. Last week's visit to Somalia by Mr Bernard Kouchner, the French health and humanitarian action minister, has done much to publicise the plight of Somalia and spur the world into action. Experts working in Somalia say it is critical for governments to increase their food pledges. However, governments should be selective in their donations of food - sending wheat, maize, and sorghum while avoiding high-value commodities such as rice and vegetable oil, which often attract violence and looting. Whenever high-value commodities are distributed, such as a recent Saudi Arabian shipment of food packages, the death toll rises as gunmen battle to grab the valued goods. In the short term, it is vital to get food distributed outside of Mogadishu to prevent starving people abandoning their homesteads and walking to the city in a desperate search for food. Ten of thousands of people have already flooded into the city and their presence has increased the violent squabbling over scarce resources. Getting food to the interior of the country would prevent Mogadishu swelling even further and thus would reduce the security problem. Widespread banditry currently rules out moving food by road, so a massive and costly airlift needs to be undertaken. The UN is presently studying the logistics of an airlift operation but so far the funding for it has not been pledged. Sending in food alone, however, is merely a short-term measure. Food aid traditionally creates dependency. It takes people off the land and brings them to feeding centres, making them reliant of handouts. It is important from the very beginning that seeds and tools are distributed alongside food aid to make sure that next year Somalis will be able to feed themselves. Reviving the rural veterinary service, which is now non-existent, is also critical to the self-sufficiency of Somalis, because livestock will be the only significant export and source of revenue for the foreseeable future. Finally, it is important to remember that much of the present crisis in Somalia is the result of dire poverty which reflects the lack of an effective western-funded development programme. For years development resources were poured into ill-conceived projects in Mogadishu at the expense of the impoverished countryside. The disenfranchised rural population became intent on redistributing the centralised wealth of the country by force and settling old scores. When law and order breaks down, it is the fighting over scarce resources as much as any ideological or tribal rivalry that fuels the conflict. In Somalia, looting has become a means of wealth redistribution. The west is going to have to aid Somalia massively for years to come. But more importantly it must put into place effective programmes which spread wealth equitably if poverty and the cycle of violence that it breeds are to be eradicated.</p>

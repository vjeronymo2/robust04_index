			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the data revealed at the first  provincial conference on economic crimes on 10 May, the  departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the  public security organs at all levels across the province have  persistently regarded the work of dealing blows at economic  crimes as an important task over the past six years since the  establishment of these departments. By concentrating their  efforts on investigating and cracking down on serious and  appalling economic cases, they have recovered the embezzled  money and articles worth more than 1.05 billion yuan Renminbi  and retrieved a tremendous amount of economic losses for the  state in a timely manner.    Economic offenders are criminals with strong covertness. As  a heavy industrial base in the country, Liaoning Province has  more than 1,000 large and medium-sized enterprises. Under the  condition of building a market economic structure, these  enterprises are shifting their track; changing their style; and  entering the markets. During the period, various social  problems caused by the economy have steadily cropped up and  economic swindling cases in some localities have rapidly  increased. Of these cases, serious and appalling ones have  sharply increased and the volume of funds involved in these  cases has become increasingly large. In 1993 the province as a  whole incurred 85 economic cases and each of them involved more  than 1 million yuan. Of these cases, 10 involved more than 10  million yuan. The province's number of such cases has been rare  since the founding of the PRC.    By regarding the work of safeguarding the economic order as  their own duty and persistently regarding the cases that are  exerting large harm and influence as the focal points of attack,  the departments in charge of economic crime investigation under  the public security organs throughout the province have  investigated and wound up more than 10,000 cases of various  economic crimes by adopting effective measures and methods and  boldly overcoming the difficulties. They have arrested more  than 9,000 criminal elements and recovered a large amount of  funds and articles for the state. Recently, Vice Governor Cong  Zhenglong paid a special visit to the provincial public security  department to speak highly of the achievements scored by the  departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the  public security organs across the province.</p>

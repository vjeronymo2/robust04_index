			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: A triumph of excess Most nights for the last 50 years George Melly has sung 'Frankie and Johnny', or rather he has performed, camped up, nourished, and milked this old American ballad. He is doing it tonight, and until August 13, at the Green Room of the Cafe Royal and the world is a happier place as a result. If the modern age could produce a Renaissance Man it would probably be Melly  -the jazz singing historian of Surrealism who also created the Flook cartoon strip. There is something definitely quatrocento about his appearance - the bright turquoise suit, the crimson shoes, the battered straw hat. He celebrates the triumph of excess, Silenus having the last laugh. First appearances are not encouraging as the four elderly gents, accompanied by a plump youngish man, fall on to the small stage. But as soon as Melly plunges into his signature tune, 'Good Time George', and trumpet player and leader John Chilton leads his Feetwarmers into their first solos, you know you are safely in the hands of old pros. This ensemble has spent years on the road, playing everything from jazz clubs to Winter Gardens. The Green Room surrenders without a fight. For a man nudging 70 George Melly still sings with amazing energy and precision, and he cleverly slices into his act anecdotes, jokes, and a little jazz history, much of it cheerfully smutty, all of it delivered with casual panache. There can be few cabaret artists who rejoice in the death of their libido by quoting a Greek philosopher 'I feel as if I've been unchained from a lunatic', and tops it up with a Dr Johnson drollery about his penis. Melly relishes the seedy low life origins of jazz. He joyfully tells of hearing a DJ introduce 'a funky Cliff Richard record'; Melly knows that 'funky' was originally black slang for 'smelling of stale sex'. Give him a song like 'You've got the right key, but you're working on the wrong keyhole' and he is in his element. It is not all barrack room bawdy. Melly can still deliver a romantic ballad like 'Stardust Memory' with some emotion, and he does not ignore the desperate times of the first jazz musicians as he honours his heroine Bessie Smith with 'Wasted Life Blues'. But refreshed by constant sit downs while the band share out the solos, Melly is at last ready to plunge into the audience. It is an awesome sight to seem him approach a mesmerised female crooning 'You want a hot dog in your roll'; and only a man of impeccable middle-class origins could get away with tales of shipboard life during his gay youth. 'I don't like bending down these days' he confesses. 'It is neither profitable nor pleasurable'. After a lengthy, perhaps a midge too lengthy, set, Melly is ready for 'Frankie and Johnny'. The shoes come off, to be used as props in the love making verse; the camp accent is re- created for the bar tender's contribution; and we are back ten, 20, 35 years to when we first saw Melly do his party piece. He is now much too portly to run his hands up and down his back but what he loses in agility he compensates with charm. For any visiting tourist, bored with the blandness of American cabaret, a view of George would be a shockingly enjoyable eye opener to one of the great traditions of British music hall.</p>

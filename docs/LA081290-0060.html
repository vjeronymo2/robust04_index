			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH SENDS TROOPS TO SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> With regard to the Iraq invasion, the clamor toward a military solution appears  to have coincided with the Senate vote on the military budget for fiscal 1991.  I propose that we cut military spending down from $289 billion to $250 billion,  and use the remaining $39 billion to create a solid alternative energy program.  </P> <P> That's the real solution to this problem. As long as we're an oil-dependent  country we're at the mercy of the fanatics who control it.  </P> <P> And I hate to see this country's leaders join in the fanaticism instead of  confronting the real issue -- oil dependency. It's up to the taxpayer to stop  this outrageous military spending ASAP and insist on an alternative energy  program now.  </P> <P> JEFF INGRAM  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

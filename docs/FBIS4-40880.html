			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Presidential Candidate Zyanon </F> Paznyak's Economic Program"]    [Text]  <H5>  I. What "Heritage" Will Z. Paznyak Inherit From the V. </H5> Kebich Government?    The Kebich government received all necessary powers from the  Supreme Soviet to implement market reforms and stabilize and  strengthen the economy of the Republic. However, four years  have passed.    Within this period:    -- The volume of production has decreased by more than 50  percent;    -- Inflation exceeded 50 percent per month;    -- Foreign debts now total some $1.5 billion and are growing  at a rate of $1 billion a year;    -- Prices for basic consumer goods jumped by 3,000 percent;    -- Seven in every ten Belarusian citizens live below the  poverty level.    Time -- the most valuable factor -- has been lost. The years  1991 and 1992 were the most favorable for reforming the national  economy. This time could have been used to carry out profound  reconstruction of the national economy with much lower  expenditures, for introducing new jobs, for producing  competitive products, and for ensuring public welfare.    The government has not only failed to begin reforming the  economy in this direction, but has no idea of how to do this.  <H5>  II. Reasons for the Economic Crisis </H5>   -- Deliberate unwillingness on the part of the government to  pursue an independent economic policy, the lack of political  will -- to formulate a track for the state's development --  among the majority of Supreme Soviet deputies.    -- Violation of basic economic concepts of ownership. The  economy preserved its nonmarket nature, however, despite this,  [the government] tried to implant market mechanisms and levers.  This triggered the mismanagement of, and anarchy in, the  production sector, the violation of proportions between work and  consumption, which, in turn, prompted profiteering drives, a  drop in production, and inflation.    -- Continuous destruction of the monetary and credit system.    -- Foreign trade is directed against domestic producers,  especially against our agricultural workers.    -- The preservation of the dominant state ownership in both  the industrial and agricultural sectors.    -- Lack of goals and programs postulating the transition of  the national economy to alternate principles, to the opposite  type of production -- production based on a market economy.  <H5>  III. Why Does Belarus Require the Market? </H5>   According to the experience of advanced states, the economy  has no other mechanisms -- other than the market -- to promptly  report on who requires our products and to objectively report on  the efficiency of national enterprises.  <H5>  IV. Key Principles of Reforms </H5>   -- In line with the Constitution. In line with Clause No. 1  of the Constitution, "... The Republic of Belarus has all powers  on its territory to pursue an independent domestic and foreign  policy.    "The Republic of Belarus protects its independence and  territorial integrity, constitutional order, and provides for  lawfulness and legal order."    The implementation of reforms in the Belarusian economy will  entirely correspond to the constitutional principles and vital  interests of our people.    -- With this purpose in mind, all factors shaping Belarusian  statehood -- borders, customs checkpoints, a national currency,  banking system with the central bank, the ability to protect our  state sovereignty (the national Armed Forces) -- should be  preserved.    -- Nonviolation of the principles of the inviolability of  ownership and preservation of ownership rights. Each person  must be sure that their hard-earned property will never be  expropriated.    -- In the state-owned sector, functions of maintaining state  property and exercising power will be separated. (Functions of  exercising power will be transferred to stock holding companies  and concerns, while functions of maintaining state property --  to the Ministry for Management of State Property; terrestrial  property is defined according to the law on land.)    -- Market relations -- given the equality of all forms of  ownership -- will be put on a legal footing to provide for:    a) The freedom of economic activity for physical and  economic entities;    b) Freedom of people's consumption on the market;    c) Setting conditions for the development of competition.    -- The establishment of a private (nonstate) sector in the  economy through destatization and privatization, the formulation  of state policy encouraging entrepreneurship.    -- The adoption of military expenditures standing at no more  than 6 percent of Gross National Product.    -- State policy aimed at the profound reconstructing of the  Belarusian economy and providing selective support to specific  enterprises and sectors of the economy which have real chances  to enter the global market with competitive products.    -- The implementation of monetary reform and the legal  strengthening of the national currency of the Republic of  Belarus as sole legal tender.    -- The establishment of a taxation system aimed at  supporting  production, the pursuing of an active investment policy; an  increase in amortization allotments.    -- An active and designated social policy aimed at  supporting  the unprotected segments of society at the expense of the state  and local budgets.    -- A guaranteed redemption of state debts to the citizens  at the expense of privatizing state property, as well as at the  expense of real estate.    -- The implementation of a new budget policy based on:    a) The formation of the budget from below, at the local  government level,    b) Procurement of profits using state property,    c) The refusal to issue subsidies to producers, however,  support for financially insecure citizens is obligatory,    d) Reducing expenditures for maintaining the state  administration,    e) Earmarking considerable funds to ensure the legal order,  protecting the life and health of citizens, guaranteeing  ownership rights, and protecting the property of physical and  economic entities,    f) Financing such sectors as culture, scientific  development, education, and health care,    g) Financing Chernobyl cleanup programs and establishing a  system for ensuring environmental safety.  <H5>  V. Domestic Economic Policy </H5>   The domestic economic policy will set conditions ensuring  the  stabilization of the economy and providing for the welfare of  citizens. To realize this goal, the Belarusian economy must be  put on the market track. Special attention will be focused on  the nonstate sector of the economy, toward support for small-  and mid-sized businesses.    A quick transition to market purchasing and selling of all  products and resources will be implemented. This is a key  condition for the implementation of reforms ensuring the  economic order and giving producers genuine knowledge about the  needs of society for specific products, resources, and labor.  All the remaining issues -- social security, privatization,  procurement of foodstuffs, conversion, etc. -- cannot be  resolved without the absolute independence of businesses on the  condition that they receive maximum profits.    Market trade is based on trade contracts and money is the  means of serving them. Therefore, we will adopt such a monetary  and credit policy that will shrink the monthly inflation rate to  2-3 percent. To implement this, monetary reform -- along with  establishing the customs territory, accumulating currency  reserves, establishing an appropriate financial infrastructure,  resolving technical issues such as printing money and drafting a  normative basis [not further identified] -- will be carried out.  During the first stage, accounting checks from the National  Bank will receive the status of national currency.    The key means to provide for "sound" money will be the  transition of all businesses, irrespective of the forms of  ownership, to a system of market relations. In addition, the  law on bankruptcy -- with all the necessary leverage for its  implementation -- will be adopted.    Other urgent measures include:    -- The legal shaping of the state debt, procedures for its  molding, and sources for the redemption of this debt.    -- Recognition of compensations -- for bank deposits of  citizens and residential housing construction cooperatives, and  for a part of the pensioners' fund -- as related to the category  of state debt.    -- Implementation of a new policy regarding wages and  incomes  of state sector workers and employees of budget-sector  institutions postulating that people with equal qualifications  and job performance are equitably compensated.    -- Antimonopoly policy and state control over conditions  providing for competition among producers.    -- A housing policy aimed at building houses at the expense  of the partial utilization of state funds to set up an  engineering infrastructure in construction areas and citizens'  savings to build houses. To provide for this, financial  mortgage institutions will be established.    A state energy program aimed at renewing and developing the  national energy-generating capacities will be drafted and  implemented. A tariff policy that encourages energy-saving  steps and state standards defining obligatory conditions for the  conservation of resources will be adopted.    -- The implementation of an efficient demographic policy  supporting women, children, and young families.    -- An efficient migration policy in the interests of the  state.    Belarus has considerable raw material and mineral resources.  Therefore, a state program regarding the development of ferrous,  nonferrous, and rare-earth metals, and additional prospecting  for energy resources will be drafted. The proposed technologies  should also include stringent environmental controls. A range  of agreements -- on issuing concessions for extracting raw  materials and energy resources on the territory of other states  -- will be signed.  <H5>  VI. Land Reform </H5>   Land is a key strategic resource of any state. It is on the  land where a person lives and produces, on the basis of which  agricultural production functions.    The Republic of Belarus -- a big state in the middle of  Europe with a moderate climate -- is rich in land resources.    Attitudes toward land and land management should be  economically sound, scientifically founded, and efficient.    Currently, land policy is acquiring a particular weight when  our society has to move to a new stage -- toward a market  economy when the role of the state is considerably decreased,  when incompetent politicians can carry out the total  privatization of land which is scientifically and methodically  unfounded. (By the way, in 1992, the opposition Belarusian  Popular Front faction in the Supreme Soviet managed to vote down  such concept of privatization, in other words, "collective  ownership.") State policy should be rational, scientifically  based, and stringent. The government should establish a  committee for, and -- during the implementation of reforms -- a  ministry for land resources.    We favor privatizing land ownership, equal rights for all  citizens in land privatization, however, we oppose land as a  source of profiteering or a basis for the exclusive power of the  corrupt nomenklatura (officials).    We require new laws on land. Land should become a commodity,  but of a specific nature.    The key condition for the efficient utilization of land and  its socially-fair privatization is the establishment of precise  land valuation, otherwise, not privatization but land-grabbing  will happen. To introduce land evaluation, a special state body  should be established which -- by not violating the rights of  local bodies -- will keep privatization in line with state  interests.    Local authorities should have their own funds to implement  social programs. The land tax -- a key source in forming a  budget in the agricultural areas -- will raise this money.  Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and other users of land should not  supplant local bodies, but engage in economic activities and pay  -- like all other land users -- a land tax that is economically  founded and equal for all.    It is strictly prohibited to purchase land rights by  purchasing real estate. Currently, it is possible to  automatically privatize a plot of land in a city when  privatizing a shabby house. We will abolish such a practice.    Favoring the unification of the monetary systems of Russia  and Belarus, some politicians do not realize the consequences of  this move. Unification with a state, which has already  established its market structure and mortgage banks, and which  has experience in privatizing [state property] -- including land  -- leads to a situation whereby a Belarusian agricultural worker  or an entrepreneur (our powers did not allow them to become land  owners) could be left without land in their native state.    Privatization of land is not an aim in itself, but a way to  raise the efficiency of the economy, a way of guaranteeing the  establishment of a network of small enterprises processing  agricultural products. This means that agricultural products  will be preserved, and our export potential will be increased.  This is our key guarantee for any investments and, hence, the  primary condition for spurring investment and the economy in  general.    The land market -- functioning through mortgage banks and  land mortgages, a nonemission credit policy -- is the real way  out of the crisis, a path along which all developed states had  gone. Belarus is extremely rich in land resources. We should  now be wise in using them.  <H5>  VII. Agrarian Policy </H5>   The key goal of our agrarian policy is the welfare of an  agricultural worker and the efficiency of his work.    Land should reacquire masters, and our society --  agricultural workers. As a result, an entrepreneur could engage  in private enterprise, and could choose what and where to  produce without any state involvement. All forms of organized  production -- state, collective, and individual -- will have  equal rights. Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers could set  prices for their products themselves. Only the market will  regulate them.    Each producer will become an owner of his own products, and  will be able to sell them -- for a profit -- without any state  restrictions. The evil practice of signing obligatory contracts  based on low prices will be abolished.    Purchasing land on preferential terms for private ownership  with the right to divide and sell it (except for agricultural  production) is economic nonsense. Preferential terms could be  postulated only when land plots are apportioned to financially  insecure sectors of the population for temporary (or indefinite)  use within a legal framework. As for the land for agricultural  purposes, we favor free privatization of land by those citizens  and associations who want to work on this land, however, it  would be based on the Republican legislation, on condition that  free privatization will account for not more than 30 percent of  the total land in this category. Further increases in  agricultural land holding will take place at the expense of land  leasing from the state (with the right to subsequent purchase)  on equal terms for all economic entities irrespective of the  forms of ownership.    Our state is slow in competing for agricultural commodities  markets. If, in the near future, we do not develop agricultural  production that is efficient and competitive, we could even lose  our domestic market due to high production costs.    Our businesses will have the opportunity to become market  structures, voluntary associations of owners in the form of  partnerships, stock partnerships, unions, associations, etc.  Equal conditions for the development of various forms of  production organizations -- both collective and individual --  will be created.    State programs for financing technological reconstruction,  the proportional development of all sectors of agricultural  production will be drafted. A network of agricultural mortgage  banks -- to credit agricultural production, to build houses and  sites of social designation based on property mortgage -- will  be established in the shortest time possible.    Special attention will be devoted to the processing of the  agricultural production. Primarily, all state-owned meat  processing factories, dairy plants, sugar refineries,  fruit-and-vegetable processing plants, and related businesses  will be privatized. All businesses will receive their share of  stock. Favorable credits -- for purchasing installations and  building small processing enterprises -- will be earmarked.    To more efficiently use and promptly supply all producers  with agricultural vehicles, all agricultural equipment will be  privatized. Based on currently existing workshops in the  agricultural sector, servicing organizations (stations) will  service state, collective, and agricultural businesses and  private plots.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>   Our foreign economic policy is aimed at establishing  partnerships primarily with neighboring states. Belarus is  striving to sign agreements on free trade, customs and currency  unions, on ensuring mutual freedom for activity of economic  entities, on most-favored-nation status, on ensuring guarantees  for the right of ownership, the protection of personal property  and property of economic entities on their territories, and in  the long run -- setting up a common market.    Monopoly in foreign trade will be abolished. The number of  suppliers and consumers -- particularly, in energy resources --  will increase.    A new customs policy -- encouraging exports -- and a new  license policy -- regulating imports -- will be formulated.    A single free economic and off-shore zone on the territory  of  the Republic of Belarus -- making it attractive to foreign trade  -- will create new jobs and increase the national income.    Across the territory of Belarus, a free banking zone --  based  on Swiss banking laws -- will be established. This will make  Belarus attractive to foreign banks and investment companies.    A system of international exchanges -- stock, energy  resources, metals, grain -- will be established.</p>

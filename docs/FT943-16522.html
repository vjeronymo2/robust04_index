			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Test of momentum for the big issue  -Ina Italian and international institutional investors will know tomorrow how many shares they have been allocated in the biggest Italian privatisation so far: the sale of 51 per cent of Ina, the state-owned insurer, which closed last week. Small investors  - more than 400,000 of whom applied for shares  -should hear about their allocation by Wednesday morning, when dealings will start on the Milan and New York stock exchanges, and on London's SEAQ International. The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, expects to raise more than L4,800bn (Pounds 1.97bn) from the sale, making it by far the largest privatisation yet attempted. Investors and analysts are watching carefully to gauge the success of the issue, which was prudently priced at L2,400 a share, towards the lower end of the range originally suggested by the treasury. In view of the recent turbulence on Italian and international markets and suggestions that the Italian public may be weary of large flotations, advisers to the government will be hoping for lively trading on Wednesday as an indication that the momentum of previous issues is being maintained. In the autumn, the government expects to return to the market with offers of shares in Stet, the telecommunications holding company, and Enel, the electricity generator.</p>

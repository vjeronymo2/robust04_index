			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work  conference was convened in Zhengzhou yesterday with a view to  opening up new vistas for firmly grasping two key work aspects  at the same time; pressing ahead with reform, opening up, and  modernization building; and raising the province's propaganda  and ideological work to a new level.    Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun delivered  an important speech in which he first and foremost expounded on  propaganda and ideological work's important position and role in  the new historical period. He stated: In the new historical  period, propaganda and ideological work is at once an important  guarantee for implementing the party's basic line and an  important way of uniting the broad masses of people. The  propaganda and ideological work is of great importance to such  overall interests as grasping opportunities, deepening reforms,  expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability. It should submit to and serve the overall interests  of the province's work and aim at unifying the ideology of the  broad masses of party members, cadres, and people with the help  of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and mobilizing the broad masses of people to build a socialist  market economic structure. This is the major theme.    Secretary Li Changchun pointed out: In accordance with the  requirements laid down by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at a  recent national propaganda and ideological work conference, and  in light of the realities in Henan, we should firmly adhere to  "one basic principle" and publicize "one major theme," striving  to accomplish five major propaganda and ideological work tasks  at the moment. By "one basic principle," we mean Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, which governs party work in all domains. We  should firmly adhere to this basic principle in conducting  propaganda and ideological work. By "one major theme," we mean  grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability, the overall  interests of the whole party's work. Thus, all types of work  should submit to and serve such overall interests of the whole  party's work. The propaganda and ideological work should aim at  publicizing this major theme. The five major work tasks to be  accomplished are as follows:    1. To arm the broad masses of the party members, cadres, and  people across the province with the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics;    2. To correctly guide public opinion to create a favorable  public opinion environment for reform and opening up;    3. To train a new generation of people with lofty ideals,  moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and a sense of  discipline; build spiritual civilization more vigorously; and to  serve socialism and people;    4. To adhere to the principle as letting a hundred flowers  blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend in order to  bring about cultural and artistic prosperity; and    5. To further strengthen foreign-related propaganda work.    Secrertary Li Changchun emphatically noted: We now have a  clear- cut guiding ideology for propaganda and ideological work  as well as long- and short-term goals and tasks to fulfill.  Moreover, we have also acquired objective conditions under  which we are able to open up new vistas for the province's  propaganda and ideological work. The party committees at all  levels and the broad masses of propaganda and ideological  workers should therefore brace themselves; strengthen  confidence; work in a down-to-earth manner; implement to the  letter all the relevant policies; and strive to open up new  vistas for the province's propaganda and ideological work and  contribute more to the province's reform, development,  stability, and the building of two civilizations.    Yesterday's conference was presided over by Song Zhaosu,  provincial party committee deputy secretary.    Zhang Wenbin, provincial party committee standing committee  member and propaganda department director, relayed the spirit of  the national propaganda and ideological work conference.    Yesterday's conference was attended by Lin Yinghai  [provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  committee chairman]; Wu Guangqian [provincial military district  political commissar]; Zheng Zengmao [provincial higher people's  court president]; Song Guochen; Zhang Deguang; Ma Jianzhang;  Zhang Shiying; some other provincial leaders; various city and  prefectural leaders; various provincial department and bureau  leaders; Henan- based central news unit leaders; major  industrial enterprises and mines leaders; and others.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jinan: "China To Launch 2nd </F> Satellite for Firm"]    [Text] The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation (CGWIC)  yesterday signed a contract with a Hong Kong-based company to  launch a communications satellite using a Chinese rocket carrier  later this year.    The satellite, to be put into orbit between October and  December, is manufactured by the Hughes Corporation of the U.S.    It will be the second satellite launched by China for Asia  Pacific Satellite Communications Co. Ltd of Hong Kong.    Asia Pacific plans to launch the first satellite in the  first  half of this year from Xichang Space Centre in Sichuan Province  on a Long March-2E rocket carrier, according to a December 1992  contract with the CGWIC.    The second satellite, HS601, a large capacity satellite,  will  blast off from Xichang using the same model of rocket.    Both sides refused to disclose costs for the launch.    Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, was pleased with the  recent decision by the U.S. Government to lift export bans on  three satellites to China.    "It is a positive move and we appreciate the decision," he  said before the contract-signing ceremony at the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse.    But Zhang also expressed regret the U.S. still places other  restrictions on his company.    The U.S. imposed the satellite export ban last August after  the alleged sale of missiles and technology by China to Pakistan.    He hoped the U.S. will issue export permits to other  satellites and lift its sanctions on the CGWIC.    "By doing so, it will be beneficial to the international  satellite customers and it will also protect the benefits of the  U.S. satellite manufacturers," he said.    Zhang also hoped the Chinese and U.S. Governments will start  negotiations on commercial satellite launching and international  trade before the current agreement expires at the end of this  year. The current satellite agreement was signed in 1989.    China will honour all launching contracts signed with  overseas customers. They include the Asia Sat-2 communications  satellite for the Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co Ltd, the  Intelsat-7A telecommunications satellite for the International  Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the Iridium  satellites for the U.S. Motorola Company and two APT satellites  this year and next year.</p>

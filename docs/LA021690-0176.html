			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SMITS WANTS NON-LATINO ROLES  </P> <P> Jimmy Smits, who plays Victor Sifuentes on NBC's "L.A. Law," says he is looking  forward to some non-Latino roles.  </P> <P> Smits played an Italian in the TV movie "Glitz" and last year played Dr. David  Redding in a film called "Vital Signs."  </P> <P> "As I become more successful, I am aware that it affects other Latinos," he  told Parade magazine in Sunday's issue. "It's imperative that I don't forget  the homeboys and the old neighborhood. But I'm also an artist and an actor. The  one thing I want to do with my career is be versatile -- not limit myself."  </P> <P> Smits, 34, holds a master's degree in fine arts from Cornell University. His  mother is Puerto Rican and his father is from Suriname.  </P> <P> "I don't recall overt acts of prejudice, but I must have felt them," said  Smits, who grew up in New York City. "I always felt that I had to prove  something because I'm Hispanic.  </P> <P> "When I started studying acting, it wasn't good enough for someone to say, 'For  a Latino, he's OK,' so I studied twice as hard as anybody."  </P></p>

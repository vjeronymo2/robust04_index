			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Economic Sanctions Face Many </F> Problems"]    [Text] The three countries of Japan, the United States,  and South Korea have begun to discuss the possible imposition of  economic sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) over its  suspected nuclear development program. Their basic position on  economic sanctions is that they should follow the passing of a  resolution by the UN Security Council. But since China is  resistant to such a resolution, there is a possibility that  sanctions will only be carried out by major nations such as the  European countries plus the three countries of Japan, the United  States, and South Korea. As there are also obstacles to making  these sanctions effective, the government is having a difficult  time figuring out what it should do.  Direction of Economic Sanctions and Problems Involved [subhead]    If a resolution on sanctions is passed by the UN Security  Council, they will probably be conducted -- as seen in past  examples -- in the following steps: 1) A ban on exports of arms  and oil; 2) a ban on trade in general; 3) restrictions on  visits; and 4) a freeze on overseas assets and suspension of  financial transactions.    Informal talks by UN Security Council members have started  in  New York, but before that, on 4 June, the three countries --  Japan, the United States, and South Korea -- held a  working-level meeting in Washington. According to a source in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], during the meeting the  United States was said to have noted: "For economic sanctions  against North Korea to be effective, the key point will rest on  whether exports of oil from China and monetary remittances from  Japan can be stopped."    North Korea has mostly depended on China for the supply of  petroleum products since Russia stopped supplying it with oil.  Shortages of foreign currency reserves are serious in the  country. As such, the United States thinks the key for economic  sanctions to be effective is in the hands of China and Japan.    Economic sanctions are implemented by restricting the flow  of  people, commodities, and money. Japan can control personnel  exchanges under the Immigration Law, and trade and banking  operations under the Foreign Exchange Control Law.    As for trade, a top official of the Ministry of  International  Trade and Industry said: "We are getting ready to take action  along the lines of a UN resolution if a resolution is decided  upon." The ministry will be able to cope even if sanctions  escalate into those requiring a total ban on exports or a ban on  intermediary trade.    However, there will be problems if Japan wants to restrict  monetary remittances and travel. In addition to about 15,000  North Korean residents living in Japan who return there on  annual visits, there are about 20,000 people coming and going  between Japan and North Korea each year. It is has been pointed  out that cash carried by Koreans on visits to their hometowns  have become a major source of foreign currency for that country.  A MOFA source noted problems from a human rights viewpoint:  "Enforcement of sanctions in this area will be difficult."  Moreover, under the existing law it will be difficult to be  harsh on only visitors to North Korea and to impose restrictions  on rules allowing each person to carry up to 5 million yen.  Sanctions in the Past [subhead]    The severest action the Japanese Government has so far meted  out as economic sanctions were those taken against Rhodesia (now  Zimbabwe) for its policy of oppression of blacks and against  Iraq for invading Iran. Both cases were enforced following  sanctions decided on by the United Nations.    Among sanctions taken without a UN resolution were those  taken against Iran over the incident of taking U.S. Embassy  personnel as hostages; against the Soviet Union over its  invasion of Afghanistan; and against China over the Tiananmen  incident. The contents of these sanctions mostly concerned  limiting personnel exchanges -- reducing the number of embassy  personnel (for Iran) and reducing the number of government  officials and other people exchanged (in the case of the Soviet  Union and China).    The economic sanctions taken were lenient in nature, like  requiring exporters to obtain prior approval on exports (to  Iran) and freezing economic cooperation (to China). Whether or  not Japan will go for full-scale economic sanctions against  North Korea this time will depend on the UN Security Council  resolution -- seen from past experiences.</p>

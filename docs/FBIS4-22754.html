It will be recalled that in  February inflation did not exceed, according to these data, 10  percent, and in March--9 percent. Sergey Dubinin, acting  minister of finance, expects a further drop in the rate of  inflation. Viktor Gerashchenko came out with a statement that  the Central Bank will possibly lower the rate of refinancing to  100-110 percent in the second half of the year, that is, by a  factor of two. On Friday a memorandum of the government and the  Central Bank on economic policy was signed. It supports  benchmarks of 7 percent monthly inflation by the end of the year  set by the prime minister. And the IMF, in the person of the  administrative director, treated the policy of the Russian prime  minister kindly, promising to express his approval of the policy  being conducted at a meeting of the board of directors: The  government has maintained its monetarist priorities in the fight  against inflation.    Meanwhile, the grounds for choosing this policy, and indeed  Russian inflation itself, deserve a lot of attention. What,  nonetheless, is the real rate of inflation in Russia? Most  likely, no less than 15 percent (taking into account the  so-called "debt" prices).    Inflation is calculated by the government center for  economic  conditions by sectors. The increase in consumer prices in the  market is really less than 10 percent per month. But the  increase in prices for services to the population in March  totaled about 15 percent, and the increase in energy  prices--13.9 percent; moreover, this indicator even seems  surprisingly low for energy sources--by comparison with the  previous month of this year.    Thus, as before in the fight against inflation, production  and the agro-industrial complex, which deal in the sluggish  consumer market, are the most suppressed--they are affected by  demand restrictions and the competition of imports. "The  obviously increased" producer prices that, on the one hand, are  being squeezed by an almost stable ruble and imports and, on the  other hand, energy sources, judging by everything, are not used  in calculating inflation, inasmuch as formal calculations on  them are not conducted, but only "mutual indebtedness emerges."    Proving to be extremes, industry and landowners do not  perform the role of extras (the agro-industrial complex,  together with the coal miners, draw on the budget generously);  however, with industry the government prefers to resolve  problems individually. What is left of plants everywhere and the  increase in hidden unemployment are reflected in the White House  only by meetings on problems of the giants like ZIL [Likhachev  Automobile Plant].    Demand restrictions, whether being conducted by virtue of  the  inertia of the government machine or because of a sincere  conviction of their necessity (it was Fedorov who shamed the Red  directors), have led to the formation of hidden inflation; that  is, an overhang of a mass of accounts between enterprises  (nonpayments) not reinforced by money. A situation reminiscent  of the summer of 1992 is being created when, after the Gaydar  "squeeze," the sum of nonpayments amounted to 2.5 rubles [R] for  each ruble enterprises had. Today this figure is 30-40 kopeks  less; that is, the ratio is more than 1:2! "Unaccounted money"  not only continuously makes a mess of the budget for tax  revenues (in the first quarter less was collected than predicted  by a factor of three), but it also generally removes the feeling  of the severity of economic policy. For those who have not  forgotten the inflationary "splash" (i.e., the emergence of  tendencies that were not taken into account and that were not  counted as inflation before mutual offsets) in the fall of 1992,  the government's dreams of vouchers and other attempts to give  the appearance that money can be done without in payments are  quite indicative. And if Sergey Dubinin does not succeed in  making this monetary overhang zero without eliminating industry  as a class (after which, naturally, their debts to one another  will disappear, and "debt prices" and inflation will be  calculated by the movement of prices on the consumer market,  where imports that are influenced only by import duties and the  ruble rate of exchange dominate), given the assistance of an  immediate all-Russian distribution of vouchers and the  development of commercial credit, then even Viktor Gerashchenko  will go down in the history of the Russian state as the grave  digger of native producers, despite all his earlier services in  their defense. Because if there is no method of resolving the  problem of nonpayments without increasing the monetary mass,  then it will not be resolved, because the method of resolution  contradicts the policy of the government, and this means digging  a hole for the economy. (But the government with the Central  Bank has already sworn in a memorandum not to produce mutual  offsets; under pressure from Yeltsin, import duties are about to  be revised.)    An overall illusion, engendered by official figures, not  only  replaces reality in the estimate of inflation itself but also  becomes a picture placed for us in the window depicting an  idyllic scene in the economy everywhere.    We can vouch even less now that the dollar exchange rate  established by the Central Bank reflects reality. After the  introduction in Moscow of the new tax collection at the MMVB  [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange], the volume of trades there  fell by a factor of three to four, and the main transactions are  conducted now on the interbank market. Talks about economic  integration in the CIS remain just that--there are no concrete  results even with Belarus. "Experts" propose to conduct agrarian  reform until the sowing campaign and to establish a system other  than the American federal reserve system (only in the United  States is there such a variant of the Central Bank).  Privatization is being conducted according to the old scheme,  although with greater deviations than previously--both in Moscow  and in the regions. No mention has been made of an industrial  and complex social policy, it also does not exist in the budget,  bankruptcies are expected like common manna, and Oleg Soskovets  is already being shot down by "little tin soldiers."    A paradoxical situation is developing: The forces that, it  is  generally admitted, previously used slogans of liberalism as a  cover but then did something else are now being covered by this  "something else," and they are creating liberalism exactly at a  time when the voters and the producers are fighting against it,  but the so-called reformers (from among the radicals) have ended  up in a parliamentary minority.    There are paradoxes and paradoxes, but the creation of the  illusion of the success of reforms can be interpreted in two  ways. Either Chernomyrdin with Gerashchenko decided to pretend  to be Gaydar and Fedorov--or the illustration of the success of  economic transformations is needed for political use, whether it  is for speeding up the signing of a memorandum on accord and/or  the acceleration of integrational processes.</p>

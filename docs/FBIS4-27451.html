			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] [Passage indistinct] of this inter-Cambodian control  commission. At this point, the Kingdom of Cambodia had already  presented its candidates for this commission.    "The delegation also proposed that simultaneously with the  cease-fire, an agreement in principle be adopted in order to  immediately create the inter-Cambodian Control Commission as a  mechanism to control and monitor without delay the cease-fire.    "The delegation fully supported His Majesty's clear-sighted  and sacred idea on the solemn declaration of fidelity for  Cambodia as a state of unity without partition and secession,  within its own territorial integrity (the internationally  recognized borders between 1963-1969), of peace, solidarity,  national unity and prosperity in the concerted efforts for  national construction.    "Unfortunately, the initiatives on the standstill,  unconditional, immediate, total, durable, and irreversible  cease-fire all over the territory of Cambodia at the  above-mentioned date and time [15 June] had been categorically  rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge,  despite the insisted appeal made by His Majesty the King and the  two Preah Sangkhareach [supreme patriarchs], Samdech Preah  Monkol Tepeacha and Samdech Moha Khousananda.    "Instead firstly, Mr. Khieu Samphan urged that this  cease-fire process be controlled and monitored by some foreign  countries. A list of ten countries was submitted by Mr. Khieu  Samphan for consideration, five of which had to be selected to  control and monitor the cease-fire. It is worthy to note that  the ten proposed countries are all full members of the United  Nations that had bitter experiences with the Khmer Rouge during  the process of implementing the Paris peace agreements.    "Secondly, the Khmer Rouge urged the delegation of the  Kingdom of Cambodia to accept the formulation of the so-called  "minimal policy program" before proceeding to the discussion on  His Majesty's proposed cease-fire. This minimal policy program  is nothing but its aims at dissolving the legal and legitimate  institution of the Kingdom of Cambodia -- the National Assembly  and Royal Government of Cambodia -- issued from the UN-organized  and supervised general elections.    "On 28 May 1994, the participants to this roundtable talk  had  agreed to issue a joint communique by which a roundtable working  group for peace and national reconciliation under the  chairmanship of the royal representative of His Majesty the King  -- Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong -- be set up to further their  discussion. This working group, which will consist of four  representatives from the Kingdom of Cambodia and four others  from the Khmer Rouge group, will hold its first meeting on June  15, 1994 at Damnak Chan in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.    "Throughout this roundtable talk, it is an undeniable fact  that the Khmer Rouge revealed their intention not to seek a  solution to the remaining Cambodian problems by political means,  but to resort to their stalled tactics of "fight talk, fight  talk." Worse still, they had striven to internationalize the  remaining internal problems existing among Cambodians to  dismantle the National Assembly and the Royal Government of  Cambodia, internationally recognized through UN-sponsored free  and fair general elections of May 1993. It goes without saying  that the cease-fire, which was the outstanding and main topic of  this roundtable talk could not be achieved due to the  intransigent opposition of the Khmer Rouge."</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER DROPS RACE TRACK DEAL  </P> <P> After sending six aides to Minnesota to look into a proposed buyout of  Canterbury Downs' bank debt, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has  decided the deal would be too risky to participate in, the Star Tribune  reported in today's editions.  </P> <P> Lawrence Greenberg, a retired Minneapolis accountant who hopes to buy the  Shakopee race track, said he probably will be unable to swing the deal unless a  backup company joins the sons of Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad in buying  the debt.  </P> <P> Although Greenberg said they do have a backup, he would identify that new  potential investor only as a very large, well-known company.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner owns a racing stable and is the former owner of a Florida race  track.  </P></p>

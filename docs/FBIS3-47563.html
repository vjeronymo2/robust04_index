Police suspect a Kanagawa Prefecture-based trading company,  specializing in deals between Tokyo and Pyongyang, exported a  spectrum analyzer which can be converted to military use.    Export of the device is regulated by the Paris-based  Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom),  which tries to control the sale of strategically important goods  to communist countries.    The spectrum analyzer can be used to improve the aiming  precision of weapons, authorities said.    Police also suspect the trading firm applied to the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry for permission to export the  analyzer using false information, the sources said.    Although the device was allegedly exported to Pyongyang by  the Kanagawa-based trading firm, the Tokyo-based maker of the  device was not informed to which country the analyzer would be  sent, police added.    The manufacturer was also not told for what purpose the  analyzer would be used, the sources said.    They did not identify either the manufacturer or the trading  firm.    The sources said police will question persons concerned for  alleged violation of foreign exchange and foreign trade control  law.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Friday that North Korea may use  the analyzer for development of the intermediate-range missile  called "Nodong-1."    The national daily said the spectrum analyzer is able to  measure more precisely the distance between a missile launcher  and a target by analyzing the rebounding of a radar beam.    North Korea last May successfully test-launched a Nodong-1  missile, which has an estimated range of 1,000 kilometers.</p>

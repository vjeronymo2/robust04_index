			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: MIM Holdings returns to the black MIM Holdings, the Brisbane-based metals group, told shareholders yesterday it had moved into the black in October, after reporting an operating loss of ADollars 6.9m (USDollars 4.6m), before abnormal items, in the first quarter of the current year. The company also suggested asset sales may be on the cards. It said all the group's investments had been reviewed and the relevance of some interests to the group's core business questioned. 'You will have noted we have disposed of our shareholding in Evan Deakin Industries . . . we sold our small investment in Lynas Gold . . . these will be followed by others,' said Mr Bruce Vaughan, chairman. Questioned later about the possible sale of coal assets, he said the group was 'turning every stone over'. 'Maybe coal is a big stone that takes a bit of turning over. It is being looked at in accordance with all the other options we are considering,' he said.</p>

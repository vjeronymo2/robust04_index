			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alma Rosa Baez at the Mexican Finance Secretariat </F> from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Text] Good afternoon. The Finance Secretariat has issued a  short communique that reads as follows:    Dr. Pedro Aspe, the finance and public credit secretary, has  appointed Dr. Jose Cordoba Montoya as the Mexican representative  to the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], which has its  headquarters in Washington. Dr. Jose Cordoba was chief of the  Office of the Presidency of the republic until today.    The Finance Secretariat has not released any more details on  this information. It is important, however, to tell our  listeners that the IDB governors will meet in Guadalajara from 8  to 13 April. Mexico is hosting this meeting. It will be the  first official event handled by Mr. Jose Cordoba Montoya.  Cordoba Montoya was the chief of the Office of the Presidency of  the republic and, until today, was in charge of all the advisers  of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    The IDB is very important within the international economic  sector. It groups all nations, especially developing nations. At  least 23 countries are expected to attend the meeting in  Guadalajara. Representatives of all those countries will meet  with the IDB in that city. Jose Cordoba Montoya will probably  have to move to Washington because all the governors handle  their countries' IDB concerns from its headquarters. This is the  information we have now.</p>

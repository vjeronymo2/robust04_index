			<p>BFN     [Text] June 13, IRNA -- Iran's ambassador to Tokyo, Hoseyn  Kazempur-Ardebili here today denied a KYODO report that Iran was  test-firing N. Korean missile.    KYODO on Sunday quoted a U.S. weekly, "U.S. NEWS AND WORLD  REPORT," that Japan was urging Iran to stop the missile test.    In a letter to managing director of the International  Department of KYODO news service, the ambassador said the United  States has launched a campaign to pressure Japan and other  industrial countries to limit their commercial activities with  Iran by raising such allegations.    "Regarding our nuclear program, as part of its post-war  reconstruction, Iran has sought to repair its damaged industrial  infrastructure. Major damage was inflicted on Iran's power  generation facilities. To deal with this urgent problem and to  meet the growing demand of the population, Iran has looked to  other sources. Major investments have been made in the past 20  years in nuclear power generation and it is natural to continue  and build on these investments for the immediate and prospective  power needs of the nation," the ambassador said.    "Our nuclear facilities have been visited and inspected by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and their peaceful  applications have been verified," said the ambassador.</p>

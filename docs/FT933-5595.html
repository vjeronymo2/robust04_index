			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cray bid values P-E at Pounds 16.24m CRAY Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software systems group, yesterday launched a recommended all-share offer for P-E International which values the management and computer consultancy group - one of Europe's oldest - at about Pounds 16.24m. The planned acquisition will represent a further significant expansion of Cray's existing computer services business and highlight the continuing process of reshaping under way in the computer services and management consultancy sectors in the face of mounting competition. The deal also represents Cray's second sizeable acquisition in 12 months. The Berkshire-based group, which operates through three divisions, acquired the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m in August last year. Cray is offering one new share for every two P-E shares valuing the group at 74 1/4 p per share. Yesterday P-E shares closed up 10p at 75p while Cray, which was reported to be active in the market picking up at least one institutional shareholder's entire holding, closed 1p lower at 148p. The company has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from P-E's directors and its largest shareholder, the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, who together hold about 16 per cent of the issued share capital. If completed the deal will double the size of Cray's systems division, which comprised 19 per cent of continuing group turnover last year, and create a combined business with annual revenues of about Pounds 70m. Mr Roger Holland, Cray's chairman, said: 'The acquisition of P-E will consolidate Cray's computer systems and software products business as a major participant in its markets and enable it to provide a wider range of software products from a more efficient base.' Mr Holland said he had first approached P-E about a merger two years ago, but at that stage his advances were firmly rejected. For P-E, which yesterday also announced a Pounds 896,000 pre-tax loss (Pounds 515,000 profit) on turnover of Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 35.3m) for the six months to June 30, the deal represents an opportunity to tie-up with a financially strong partner. P-E, which omitted its final dividend last year after profits tumbled to just over the break-even level and is also omitting its interim dividend, has been struggling to cut costs and reorganise its management while also investing in new business areas over the past 15 months since Mr George Cox stepped in as chairman. Although he acknowledged that P-E might have needed to tap the market for additional funds to continue with its reorganisation and expand into new business areas, he firmly rejected suggestions that the deal represented a 'rescue'.</p>

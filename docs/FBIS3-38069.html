			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>   [Text] Washington, 25 Feb -- The arrest of CIA staffer  Aldrich Hazel Ames, who has been accused of spying for Russia,  has "in no way affected" the visit to the United States of a  group of Russian members of parliament and representatives of  the law and order bodies, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned  from the head of the delegation, Mikhail Mityukov, first deputy  chairman of the State Duma.    The group of Russian representatives, which is in the United  States to learn about fighting organized crime and protecting  intellectual property, has had meetings with high-ranking  representatives of the FBI and the State Department. They were  received by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and U.S. Commerce  Secretary Ronald Brown.    "There have been no contacts on this problem, and in any  case  we are not empowered to hold meetings with anyone on these  issues," Mityukov declared. "I think this isolated case should  not sully the pretty friendly level of relations between our  countries. It will be examined and studied by the appropriate  bodies, both Russian and American, after which we shall be in  possession of real information. I think this case is being too  much politicized".</p>

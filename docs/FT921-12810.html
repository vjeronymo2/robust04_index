			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (22): Don't let the tax tail wag the dog - How to pick them / Investors should ask themselves two crucial questions when looking at the charges levied on the different forms of Pep on the market IT IS tempting to buy anything that has a 'tax-free' label on it. All other things being equal, you should indeed save tax. But all other things are usually not equal. So do not commit the cardinal sin of 'letting the tax tail wag the investment dog'. This can easily happen when investing in Peps. They are free of both income and capital gains tax, so you cannot ask for more tax efficiency. But they cost a lot to administer. In the early years of the Pep scheme, when only Pounds 2,400 could be put into a plan, investors soon became disenchanted. Attempts at active portfolio management with sums this small were doomed to failure. Minimum dealing charges of maybe Pounds 30 or Pounds 40, when switching between holdings of around Pounds 400, made it almost impossible to make a profit, let alone deliver the full value of the tax incentive. Understanding of Peps is now more sophisticated. But you must ask yourself two questions before looking at the charges levied on the different Peps on the market. What is your own tax position? You only need to pay capital gains tax if you sell shares or other securities for gains, after indexation, of more than Pounds 5,500 in one tax year. Thus you need to be a very keen, or wealthy, private investor before it will apply to you. If there is no realistic chance of your paying any CGT in the near future, the exemption from income tax is the only relief you will receive. What investments do you already hold? If you do not have much money salted away in long-term investments, then diversification within your Pep takes a high priority. But if you have a large equity portfolio, you will probably have to pay CGT, and Peps must be judged using different criteria. Taking these considerations in turn, people who do not pay CGT should look first at the income, or yield, from a Pep. Growth is important, of course, but they are not buying extra tax concessions by paying for the administrative charges of a Pep manager. Instead, they are cutting their potential gain, by paying so much of the initial investment on Pep charges. David Wells, of accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, illustrates the costs and benefits of the tax savings as follows. Typical opening charges on a Pounds 6,000 Pep would be 5 per cent, plus VAT, plus a 0.2 per cent commission for buying the shares. This comes to Pounds 363.80. A direct purchase of shares might cost around 1.75 per cent in commission, according to Mr Wells. This would only knock Pounds 105 off the initial investment. These figures in themselves should dampen the spirits of people planning to use Peps to invest for growth. Next, Mr Wells looked at annual management charges, which are typically 1 per cent, plus VAT. This comes to Pounds 70.50. 'You need a tax saving of at least that amount to justify the extra cost of having a Pep,' he says. That means that this Pep would need a yield of 3.13 per cent before the savings in income tax for a 40 per cent taxpayer outbalanced the extra costs. If you only pay 25 per cent income tax then you need a higher yield before a Pep becomes worthwhile. Mr Wells' conclusion is clear: 'The emphasis of our Pep recommendations should be on income-orientated plans with low initial charges. Higher charges may, of course, be justified by superior performance, but this will be proved only with hindsight.' This rigorous approach is a good antidote for those who leap at the 'tax-free' label. Considerations such as these have led to a breed of 'high-yield' or 'income' Peps. They achieve their yield by combining a group of high-yielding equities (those which have particularly high dividends in relation to the share price) with income shares of split-capital investment trusts. Roz Barder, editor of Chase De Vere's Pep Guide, says that a 6 per cent yield for an income Pep is typical, although some more speculative plans may be able to offer yields approaching 10 per cent. These yields are good, but Mr Wells' figures show that they are far from spectacular. If you do not already hold a large variety of investments, then a Pep investing in unit or investment trusts makes sense. You are only allowed to put Pounds 3,000 into one of these Peps (except for new issues), which may be a disadvantage, but you automatically buy into a wide spread of equities. Past performance tables allow you to make an informed choice of fund manager. Most important, the vast majority of unit trust Peps, according to Ms Barder, make no extra charge for investing via a Pep than they would if you invested direct. Few charge more than an extra percentage point. If you wanted to invest up to Pounds 3,000 in a unit trust anyway, then this neatly delivers you from the agonies of choice - there is no point in not making the investment via a Pep. Finally, if you regularly need to pay CGT, and have an existing portfolio of equities, then Peps are best approached as a tax-free 'pocket' for part of your portfolio. Before the end of each tax year, transfer up to your maximum allocation into a 'self-select' Pep. You only need look at one criterion here - charges. The less the annual and initial charges, the better the Pep will be. The joker in the pack of all these careful calculations is the possibility of a Labour government. As reported on page 4 of this Review, Labour has not ruled out retaining Peps, but it has also not ruled out abolishing them. It has pledged to honour tax reliefs on all plans opened before it takes office. Higher top rates of tax, which Labour has pledged to introduce, might make Peps a handy tax shelter. All their advantages, for those in the top income tax band, would automatically be increased. A cut in the threshold before CGT is paid would also make Peps more valuable. These are cogent arguments. But none of them provides any reason to pay more in charges than you have to.</p>

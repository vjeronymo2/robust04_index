			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Next week in Bonn Chancellor Helmut  Kohl and President Boris Yeltsin will have to talk about the way  in which the last Russian soldiers will be bid farewell to in  Germany on 31 August. An exchange of letters about the planned  ceremonies, which in the German view have already been agreed  on, has not been concluded yet, Government Spokesman Dieter  Vogel told journalists on Friday [6 May]. This also seems to  confirm the criticism of a celebration in Weimar expressed by  Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the  Western Group, in an interview with DPA on Thursday.    Vogel said the celebration in Weimar is just intended to  recall the "century-old cultural cooperation," while the actual  farewell ceremony for the soldiers will take place in Berlin, as  demanded by Burlakov and agreed with President Yeltsin.  However, the farewell parades for the Western allies and the  Russian troops will indeed take place separately, the government  spokesman stressed. The festive farewell to the U.S., British,  and French soldiers will take place in Berlin on 8 September.  John Major, Britain's head of government, has accepted Kohl's  invitation.    Yeltsin's official visit will begin in Bonn on 11 May; on 12  May, Ascension Day, Yeltsin will visit the Cathedral in Speyer,  and on 13 May he will go to Stuttgart.</p>

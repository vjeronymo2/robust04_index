			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi creditors meet Bank of Italy officials LEADING bank creditors of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group met Bank of Italy officials yesterday as the collapse in the company's share price took on a new political dimension. The meeting came against signs that foreign banks, which have lent to Ferruzzi, might be invited on to the five-bank committee of leading creditors. Mr Guido Rosa, the local head of France's Societe Generale and chairman of the foreign bankers' association in Italy, may join the talks as the foreigners' representative. The Bank of Italy has moved into the fray as the scale of Ferruzzi's financial difficulties have become more evident in recent days. The group and family holding company is known to have total borrowings of about L31,000bn (Dollars 20.9bn). Brokers are asking why warning bells at the Bank of Italy, which is supposed to supervise the scale of bank lending to individual companies, did not sound earlier. Separately, Mr Vincenzo Visco, deputy chairman of the finance committee of the upper house of parliament, strongly criticised the rescue operation being mounted by Mediobanca and the other leading bank creditors. Mr Visco, briefly finance minister in the new Ciampi government, drew attention to the use of public sector banks to rescue a private company. 'I don't believe taxpayers' money . . . can be used by Mr Cuccia with the ease to which he has accustomed us in the past'. Mr Enrico Cuccia is Mediobanca's honorary chairman. Other critics of the lifeline, which remains shrouded in mystery, have pointed to the possibility of public sector banks swapping loans to Ferruzzi for equity - potentially nationalising the company at a time when Italy is supposed to be privatising its state-controlled banking sector. The attacks came against a further day of sharp falls for shares in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) the main holding company, and its subsidiaries. Ferfin stock plunged a further 16.6 per cent to L494.8 from L593.5, while shares in Montedison, the main industrial subsidiary, dropped to L750, making for a cumulative drop of over 23 per cent since Friday's close. Investors showed their hostility to this week's surprise rights issue by Fondiaria, the Ferruzzi-controlled insurance group, by marking its shares down by almost 8 per cent to L22,201 from L24,101. Fondiaria stock has now tumbled over 17 per cent since the deal was announced late on Monday. The precipitous falls and the fact that many of Ferruzzi's operations are backed by attractive industrial assets has not yet triggered any bargain hunting, although prices recovered somewhat in after-hours' trading. The explanation lies partly in the widespread cynicism towards Mediobanca, which has a reputation for ignoring minority investors, and the continued silence about the rescue plans. Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of the Consob companies and stock exchange watchdog, yesterday said brokers' reactions have been 'excessive and premature' in view of the fact that details of the rescue were not yet available. However, the legacy of hostility in the bourse towards Mediobanca and opacity of the Ferruzzi rescue project means investors are still willing to ditch shares at almost any price. That sentiment has hit stock in the five most exposed creditor banks and the market in general, which has fallen for four days running.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guiyang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The carrying out of  a poverty-relief program over the past decade has resulted in 40  million people in China's impoverished mountainous regions  emerging from poverty and much improved local public facilities.    A report by the State Planning Commission says that under  the  program some 6,800 km of roads and 7,855 bridges have been  built, and 82,000 km of roads upgraded in nearly 10,000 villages  in 18 impoverished regions in Shanxi, Shaanxi and other  provinces.    The program also supplied pure water to 27.72 million people  and 18 million heads of cattle, and increased the area of  irrigated farmland by 2.23 million ha [hectares] and hydropower  generating capacity by 330,000 kw, the report says.    The program, called "relief in exchange for work", differs  from the traditional poverty-relief programs in that the help  does not come in form of money, but in form of material input by  the state or consumer goods in exchange for farmers' labor.    In this way, the report says, the government can save the  cash it badly needs for construction while overstocked  industrial products can find consumers.    Since 1984 the Chinese Government has put into the program  20  billion yuan-worth of grain, textiles, consumer electric  products and household hardware. In return, farmers have put in  hundreds of millions of labor/days.    The report says the program marks a change in the  government's policy. Rather than providing aids in cash, the  new policy aims to improve the infrastructure of the  impoverished regions and implant the possibility of  self-development.    In Guizhou Province in southwest China the past few years  have witnessed the building of 7,200 km of roads and 525 bridges  under the program. The report says Guizhou is the greatest  benefiter of the program.    The province also gets one fifth of the one million tons of  grain provided annually by the government to the ethnic-minority  areas in the central and western parts of China. The grain is  used to pay farmers working to make new terraced farmlands or to  upgrade hilly land.    The report says some 76,000 ha of high-yield farmland has  been created in the province over the past two years. It  predicts that by the end of the century the province, now  suffering from a serious grain shortage, will be able to produce  enough grain to feed itself.    Since 1991, when massive floods caused tremendous losses to  east China, the government has launched a program to repair and  build water-conservancy projects on seven rivers and five lakes  in the region.    The projects, involving 10 billion yuan-worth of industrial  products in exchange for farmers' labor, will be completed by  1995.    The report says that the construction materials and tools  are  usually provided by local governments.    The report says China's poverty-relief program is highly  appreciated by international organizations including the World  Bank, which depicts the program in a report as good way to  create job opportunities in impoverished areas and to build  rural infrastructure facilities.    The report disclosed that, starting this year, the  government  will launch a new program codenamed the "87 Poverty Relief  Project", so-called as it will strive to pull 80 million people  from the poverty line over seven years. The project will  require the input of two billion yuan-worth of industrial  products a year.</p>

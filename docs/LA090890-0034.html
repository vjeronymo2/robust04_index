			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'YEAH, I MEAN IT!' GATES SAYS OF IDEA TO SHOOT DRUG USERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates refused to back away Friday from his  suggestion that casual drug users be shot to death, telling hundreds of LAPD  officers and supporters at a noon luncheon, "Yeah, I mean it!"  </P> <P> The chief's pronouncement on recreational drug use has drawn mild to harsh  criticism from city officials. Some said they have grown used to such  "Gates-isms" -- deliberately outrageous statements made to shock the public and  draw attention to an issue.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley said Friday of Gates' remarks about casual drug users: "I'm  not going to dignify that statement by a response."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky had more to say about Gates. "He must have been  smoking some pretty bad stuff," he said. "He ought to explain himself. . . . I  think for the chief of police of any American city to make such a suggestion is  outrageous and ridiculous."  </P> <P> Despite the growing controversy, Gates appears entrenched in the job he has  held for more than 12 years, and city leaders expressed little desire to rein  him in. Most said they did not take Gates' remarks literally.  </P> <P> But Gates, in his first public appearance since he told a Senate committee  earlier this week that casual drug users "ought to be taken out and shot," said  Friday he stood by his controversial proposal if it would end drug abuse in  this country.  </P> <P> Asked if he had any regrets about his testimony in Washington on Wednesday, the  police chief said: "Absolutely not. Are you kidding?"  </P> <P> "That's one of our problems in America," he added. "We don't speak the truth.  We're so frightened of opening our mouths in this country. Every politician in  the nation is afraid to come out and say anything in strong terms.  </P> <P> "Well, I'm not afraid. I said it. I'm glad I said it."  </P> <P> Gates' own son, Lowell Gates, has a history of drug problems and a criminal  record dating back a dozen years, including a 1988 conviction for being under  the influence of cocaine.  </P> <P> "He is an addict," Chief Gates said. "He's not a casual user. He was a casual  user, and that's what leads to addiction. And I think everybody ought to  recognize that all the poor addicts shot themselves already. They don't need us  to execute them.  </P> <P> "He's an addict," the chief said. "He shot himself."  </P> <P> But Gates was particularly critical of casual users, describing them as  traitors and hypocrites for allowing drug abuse to continue in this country.  </P> <P> "I simply am trying to call that to our attention," he said. "There are people  dying all over this country, and we've still got people who just want to party.  I think they're hypocrites. I think if we want to prosecute a war on drugs,  we've got to get serious about our disdain for those who continue to sustain  this war and aid the enemy.  </P> <P> "And that's what all the casual drug users do. I want casual drug users to  recognize exactly how treasonous I think their acts are. All they are doing is  contributing to sustaining the war effort. They're aiding and abetting the  enemy. They're supporting the enemy. They're giving money to the enemy."  </P> <P> However, Gates conceded that his proposal to shoot weekend drug users would  never fly. "That's not going to happen," he said. "Everyone knows that. But it  sure got their attention, didn't it?"  </P> <P> He also blasted the press, especially The Times, for its reporting on his  comments about casual drug users. He said the newspaper mentioned only his  comments about marijuana smokers, although he also suggested in his testimony  that cocaine users be executed as well.  </P> <P> "It's typical of the Los Angeles Times," he said. "They don't even tell the  truth. All you mentioned was pot."  </P> <P> Gates made his comments to reporters as he arrived at a luncheon for Los  Angeles police officers being awarded the department's Medal of Valor. He  opened his formal speech by saying, "Would all the casual drug users please  rise?" a remark that drew long and sharp laughter from the hundreds of officers  and Police Department supporters at the Bonaventure Hotel.  </P> <P> Gates has aroused controversy with his statements almost since the beginning of  his tenure as police chief. In 1980, he suggested that his SWAT team could  rescue the American hostages in Iran, prompting an unappreciative communique  from the State Department.  </P> <P> Later, during a closed dinner meeting of deputy district attorneys, he  described a local television newscaster as "an Aryan broad." He publicly  apologized after the word got out, saying he meant the description "in jest."  </P> <P> In 1982, he upset the black community when The Times quoted him on the use of  the carotid chokehold. "We may be finding," Gates said, "that in some blacks  when a (carotid restraint) is applied, the veins or arteries do not open up as  fast as they do on normal people." He later conceded that it was a poor choice  of words.  </P> <P> While council members Friday criticized Gates for his most recent statement,  none said they would call for his resignation and most said they believe he is  a good police chief.  </P> <P> Councilman Richard Alatorre, chairman of the council committee that oversees  the Police Department, said he takes Gates' statements with a grain of salt.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it's in the typical style of Daryl Gates. . . . It's kind of  Gates-ism. He shocks people into reality," he said.  </P> <P> Gates' strength with council members apparently is founded in his longtime  attention to the complaints and needs of their council districts.  </P> <P> "He's been very responsive whenever I've had problems with officers in my  area," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina. Councilman Robert Farrell said he was  "shocked" by Gates' recent statement, but added that Gates is "a very good  administrator. . . . He's responsive to me."  </P></p>

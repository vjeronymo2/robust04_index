			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Peace talks with Mexican rebels to start today Peace talks between the Mexican government and the Zapatista rebels are scheduled to begin today, in an effort to persuade the rebels to end formally a conflict which began on January 1 with the seizure of half a dozen towns in the southern state of Chiapas, reports Damian Fraser in San Cristobal de las Casas. However, there were few indications yesterday of an early agreement as significant differences remained between the two sides. The peace talks are to take place in the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas. Yesterday, Zapatista delegates, including Sub-commandant Marcos, the rebels' military strategist, arrived in San Cristobal. They will spend the night there before starting negotiations with Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's peace envoy. A truce has held for more than five weeks but the continuing presence of armed Zapatistas has destabilised Chiapas, displaced an estimated 20,000 people from their homes, and inspired opposition to the government throughout the country. Sub-commandant Marcos said that the Zapatistas would only lay down their arms after the government had enacted national democratic reforms and agreed to broad political autonomy for regions of Mexico populated by indigenous people. He suggested that, while such changes were not made, the Zapatistas would not sign a peace accord. Mr Camacho said that he could not negotiate with armed rebels on such issues and that to do so would not guarantee peace in Chiapas. 'A solution that is only aimed at the Zapatista army would destabilise Chiapas. There has to be a solution that satisfies the Zapatista army but also meets the concerns that are fundamental for other sectors,' he said. The government seems to intend to offer rebels some land, greater economic aid for the region, and perhaps changes among some local political leaders. Mr Camacho believes that any further concessions might undercut support within the government for the peace process and lead to a conservative backlash. 'These negotiations will be very difficult. These are people who took the decision to begin an armed struggle and for whom political negotiation is a total change of strategy,' Mr Camacho said.</p>

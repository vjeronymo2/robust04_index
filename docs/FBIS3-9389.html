Senada Cumurovic has the details:    [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of today's  meeting, Assembly Secretary Avdo Campara announced that the  assembly meeting will be held on Monday, 28 March. Deputies of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament will be able to express their  views on the documents of the Washington agreement and adopt  decisions on the future work of the assembly. Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic will speak at the assembly meeting on the  political elements of the Washington agreement, while the expert  portion will be expounded upon by Kasim Trnka, minister of the  judiciary.    In the second part of today's meeting, Dr. Trnka briefed the  assembly deputies on the section of the Washington agreement  that applies to the future work and setup of the assembly,  pointing out that two significant (?aims) have been broached in  the chapter on transient provisions: Bosnia-Herzegovina's  international subjectivity and the internal continuity of  institutions, especially the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Since there is a possibility that the 28 March meeting could  turn into a constitutional assembly, Minister Trnka expounded on  this possibility:    [Trnka] This means that during the debate about the  proffered documents, the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina may in  fact turn into a constitutional assembly, which consists of  deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly elected in the 1990  elections whose term of office is still valid. This assembly  would function as a constitutional assembly. One should take  care not to [words indistinct] that the constitution is adopted  in a way that the consensus of deputies who feel as Croats and  the deputies who feel as Bosniaks be devalued. However, this  national consensus is not sufficient. What is also needed is a  two-thirds majority of the overall number of deputies. This in  fact means that all other deputies have the same right to vote.    If this constitution, which is for the time being only a  proposal [words indistinct] political agreement, is adopted,  then the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will continue its work  having two functions -- as the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina which is going to continue to adopt decisions  concerning the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  international relations and the Assembly of the Federation,  whose competences encompass only the territory that is, by  definition, populated by the majority Bosniak and Muslim  population and, regarding its factual borders, (?when borders  are definitely established) in the talks with the third side and  in the talks about canonization of this federation.    [Cumurovic] After providing an explanation, Dr. Kasim Trnka  answered several questions from the deputies. Questions focused  on, for example, how the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  defined in the agreement and who is supposed to pay war  reparations. Dr. Trnka said that the agreement used the term of  the territory with the majority Serbian population and as for  war reparations, they are to be reimbursed by the state. [Words  indistinct] establish the ways how to obtain the funds.    The deputies today were informed that (Nazim Koledar) has  been released from the camp, while Irfan Ajanovic is still  (?detained). Concerning this, as well as some other cases, the  Human Rights commission will meet and discuss the release of  prisoners according to the already reached agreements.</p>

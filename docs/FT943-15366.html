			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: US economy Uncertainty remains over US economic policy. Yesterday's employment data and President Clinton's remarks on the importance of not undermining the economic recovery pointed in opposite directions. The faster-than-expected employment growth gives the Federal Reserve every excuse to raise short-term interest rates. But Clinton's comments suggest the White House, at least, will not be in favour. While bond prices plummeted in response to the employment data, the dollar initially held up well. Equities on both sides of the Atlantic advanced. But after Clinton's remarks, the dollar slid and US share prices retreated. In the circumstances, the chance that this weekend's G7 summit will mount any co-ordinated action to prop up the dollar seems minuscule. The most that can be hoped for is unilateral action on interest rates in the next couple of weeks by the Fed. But it is hard to see a Fed move on its own doing much to boost the dollar since a rise in short-term interest rates to 6 per cent is already being discounted. If the Fed takes no action, the markets would be even more worried. It is true, as Clinton said, that there is so far no evidence of inflation. Pay inflation is still at 2.5 per cent. But the Fed's policy stance this year has been to anticipate rather than react to inflation. A failure to raise rates would risk sending the dollar even lower and bond yields higher. With all that in prospect, it is hard to see equities opening on a positive note on Monday.</p>

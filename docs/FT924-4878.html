			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / BCT to shut down Tessa scheme BIRMINGHAM Capital Trust, a small banking institution licensed by the Bank of England, is shutting down a Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa) scheme after suffering a 'major erosion' of its capital base, and continuing losses. Depositors in the Tessa scheme, which offered a fixed interest rate of 12 per cent over five years, have been advised to transfer their balances - with the interest they have earned to date - to another bank or building society. BCT told depositors in a letter dated Friday that 'after much thought and formal discussions with the Bank of England' it had decided to close down the Tessa scheme. It said losses had made it prudent to examine the Tessa's viability. The letter said BCT made losses in 1990 and 1991 'due to the prevailing economic climate . . . This resulted in a major erosion of the capital base of the company. Despite the fresh injection of capital, further losses are continuing to occur'. The Financial Times was unable to contact directors of the company for comment yesterday. The Bank of England said it could make no comment about any action it had taken over BCT, a licensed institution under the 1987 Banking Act. BCT has recommended depositors in the Tessa scheme - which was initially offered in January last year but was later reported to have been withdrawn - to transfer funds to a Tessa variable interest account at the Dudley Building Society. BCT's letter said it had made special arrangements with the Dudley Building Society, which has assets of about Pounds 65m, to transfer accounts to its variable interest Tessa. This is currently paying an interest rate of 10 per cent. The Tessa offered by BCT was among the most attractive fixed interest Tessa schemes for depositors when such schemes were first offered in January last year. However, it was reported to have been withdrawn shortly afterwards. Deacon Hoare, a small licensed banking institution in Bristol, went into liquidation this June after suffering losses on high interest saver accounts. It had offered among the highest variable interest rates on a Tessa scheme.</p>

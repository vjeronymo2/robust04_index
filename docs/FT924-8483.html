			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Australia prepares for labour reform battle: Victorian state-wide general strike shows weaknesses in union support AUSTRALIA'S trade union movement sent a powerful warning yesterday to conservative political leaders planning radical reform of the country's 90-year-old centralised industrial relations system. About half a million workers in Victoria, the second most populous state, obeyed union calls for a 24-hour strike against reform legislation introduced by the state's newly elected conservative government. Mr Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, claimed that the strike was a foretaste of the industrial chaos which would engulf the country if the conservatives win the federal election due by June. However, while the strike crippled the public service, it failed to stop work at more than a handful of private-sector companies, suggesting that the unions' ability to mobilise effective opposition is limited. This weakness could be crucial to the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition, which is drawing up plans for similar reforms in other states and at federal level. Mr John Hewson, the federal conservative leader, knows that winning the election will depend partly on his ability to persuade voters that reform is both necessary and achievable without undue pain. Conservative officials claimed yesterday that the partial failure of the strike shows that a determined government with a clear mandate could achieve change without prolonged industrial disruption. Mr Jeff Kennett, the premier of Victoria, said the strike was pointless in the face of the public support for his proposals that was demonstrated by the landslide state election victory over Labor in October. But the conservatives face a more difficult task in demonstrating to a sceptical workforce that their proposals to scrap nearly a century of centralised control of the workplace are necessary. Under the existing system, pay and conditions for about 80 per cent of workers are governed by federal and state industrial relations commissions with wide-ranging judicial powers. The commissions can order compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes, and have the power to fine or imprison workers and managers who refuse to accept judgments. Traditionally, unions and employers briefed lawyers to appear before the federal commission once a year to argue for or against an across-the-board increase in wages for all workers. Most workers are also covered by occupational 'awards' ensuring, for example, that plumbers of similar experience receive comparable wages no matter where they work. Until recently, the system paid little regard to productivity or individual employers' ability to pay. It also discouraged profit-sharing and performance-related pay, except for those managers exempt from award conditions. However, the system has begun to change in response to international competitive pressures resulting from the gradual reduction of tariff protection for Australian industry. The annual basic wage case has been abandoned, the commissions have redefined their role as protectors of minimum standards, and the number of separate awards has been streamlined. For example, 388 job classifications in the metals industry have been reduced to 14. An element of productivity bargaining has been achieved by encouraging employers to pay 'over award' rates to productive workers, and by amending the legislation to allow limited bargaining at company or plant level. Union rationalisation has cut the number of unions from 326 in 1986 to 250, helping to streamline bargaining and reduce demarcation disputes between unions. Moreover, the Labor government has negotiated a series of accords in which the unions traded pay restraint for tax cuts and improvements in government services such as medical care. The result has been a 60 per cent fall in the number of industrial disputes and a cut of 8 per cent in real unit labour costs since 1983. Big companies such as National Australia Bank and Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) have been quick to negotiate productivity agreements. However, the changes are less popular with small and medium-sized businesses, which account for the bulk of Australia's economy. Mr Ian Spicer, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says that most of the productivity agreements are 'quite un-inspiring'. The chamber, which represents most smaller businesses, says genuine productivity bargaining is hampered by a requirement that agreements must not leave workers worse off and that this significantly reduces potential gains for employers. The commissions also retain the power to amend agreements and even block them, as the federal commission did in a recent case involving Qantas Airways. The federal conservative coalition's proposals would encourage a decisive shift to productivity bargaining by removing the power of the commissions to vet agreements or order compulsory arbitration, except with the consent of both employers and workers. The proposals would also end compulsory trade union membership, and scrap the accord system, significantly reducing the role of the trade unions in running the economy. However, the coalition would enshrine minimum wages and conditions in law and has stopped short of the Victorian government's proposals to ban holiday bonuses and impose a cooling-off period on strikers. The state government, backed by a big parliamentary majority, is unlikely to back down, raising awkward questions about what the unions should do next, especially when control of events passes from the Victorian unions to the more moderate Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president, describes the coalition's proposals as 'a return to the ratbag world of industrial relations,' but his most recent attacks have been laced with indications that the unions may compromise. 'If there is a change of government at the next election, the ball is in the coalition's court,' he said. 'The union movement will not pick an industrial relations brawl. But if we are backed into a corner, there is the capacity for (Australia) to lose everything we have achieved.'</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The June 3 massacre in Beijing is having lasting effects in Hollywood. An  agreement between Gibraltar Releasing Corp. and China Film Corp. calling for  the Cannes Film Festival hit, "Rising Storm," to be the first film released  simultaneously in the United States and China has been scrapped and locations  for another Gibraltar film, "Crime Lords," have been shifted from Beijing to  Taipei and Hong Kong. Director Frankie Schaeffer and "Rising Storm" star Wayne  Crawford were in Beijing in late May, and departed the country just prior to  the June 3 government crackdown. "The atmosphere in China was very open and  very exciting when we left," said Crawford, "but now, China is not the place to  be working on location for three months." Shauna Snow  </P></p>

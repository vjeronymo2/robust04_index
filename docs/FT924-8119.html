			<p>921112 FT  12 NOV 92 / Three dead outside Yugoslav army headquarters One ethnic Albanian was killed and two Serbian soldiers were wounded yesterday outside the Yugoslav army headquarters in Pristina, capital of the mainly Albanian province of Kosovo, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. An eyewitness said the shootings occurred after three men approached a guard, stabbed him and shot another soldier in the stomach. Other soldiers returned fire, killing a 26-year-old ethnic Albanian. The other two assailants, one of them wounded, escaped. A conflicting statement from the Democratic League of Kosovo, the main Albanian party, said the sentries had provoked the three passers-by. Mr Saqir Saqiri, a leader of the DLK, said: 'We are used to such daily provocations, Serbia wants provocations.' The incident comes amid growing concern that Kosovo could be the next region of former Yugoslavia to erupt in ethnic war.</p>

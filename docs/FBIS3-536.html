He gave that interview in the city of Huambo, on the  Angolan Central Plateau. Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi noted that  a peace accord should be secured as a matter of urgency because,  in his words, 30 years of war is far too much and there is a  need to avoid further bloodshed.    The president of UNITA also expressed the belief that Angola  will enjoy peace in the future. In this regard, Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi said that UNITA has made many concessions at  the Lusaka peace talks.    At another point in his interview with the French newspaper,  the president of UNITA noted that it was absurd to continue  making war while peace talks are continuing. He said, quote, I  am well aware that it makes no sense to make war while talking  peace, unquote.    Looking back to the September 1992 elections, Dr. Jonas  Savimbi said that responsibility for the failure of those  elections must be laid at the door of all Angolan political  forces, the West -- which did not help -- and the United  Nations, which did not have the necessary ability to operate in  a country as vast as Angola which, to add to the problem, had  just come out of a 16-year war.</p>

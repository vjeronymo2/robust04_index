			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BELGIANS DOUBT STORY THAT FOUR HOSTAGES WILL GO FREE  </P> <P> A Beirut newspaper said Tuesday that the radical Palestinian faction of  terrorist Abu Nidal would release four Belgian hostages today.  </P> <P> A Belgian government source dismissed the report by the newspaper al Lima,  however, saying that "it is not the first time this paper has had a story like  that."  </P> <P> In Geneva, meanwhile, Swiss relief worker Elio Erriquez arrived home after what  he described as 10 months of "living death" as a hostage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "Detention is like -- and I think I'm not exaggerating -- living death . . . .  A dog was better than we were," he told reporters at the airport in Geneva as  he struggled to hold back tears.  </P> <P> Erriquez was handed over to Syrian security men in Muslim West Beirut late  Monday by a group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Faction. He was  turned over to the Swiss ambassador in Damascus early Tuesday.  </P> <P> The front-page report on the Belgians, attributed to unidentified Western  diplomatic sources, said the four would be released today in a deal that  includes the release of convicted Palestinian terrorist Sa'eed Nasser "by a  special pardon signed by the king of Belgium."  </P> <P> It said the deal was worked out between Belgian officials and the Revolutionary  Council of Fatah and that a Belgian press team is to arrive in Lebanon "in the  next few hours to cover the release of the four hostages." It did not disclose  further details.  </P> <P> The four, reported captured in 1987 aboard their boat off the Israeli-occupied  Gaza Strip, are Emmanuel Houtekins; his wife, Godelieve Kets; their son,  Laurent, and their daughter, Valerie.  </P></p>

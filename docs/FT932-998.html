			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Smith New Court issue welcomed as profits double BUOYANT volume in the UK stock market helped boost Smith New Court's pre-tax profits to Pounds 38.7m for the year to May 7, up 110 per cent on last year. The enthusiasm generated by the UK securities house's record profits ensured a warm welcome for its announcement of a Pounds 41.2m rights issue, its first since 1985. The two-for-seven issue is priced at 210p per share. Smith New Court's share price gained 35p to close at 285p yesterday. Most of the company's profits were generated in the second half, after a quiet period last summer cut profits to Pounds 6.7m for the six months to October 30. Since then a series of profitable placements (bought deals accounted for 6 per cent of gross revenues) and an upswing in UK and overseas stock market volume have contributed to the strong performance. 'The markets have been kind to us,' admitted Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, citing strong performance in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the US as well as the UK. Mr Marks said that commissions and corporate fees accounted for just under 50 per cent of profits, with the rest still provided by marketmaking activities. Following recent expansion in overseas markets, the split between domestic and foreign business was also even, he added. The capital provided by the rights issue will fund further growth in the UK and overseas in the existing businesses of marketmaking, agency broking and corporate broking. In addition to the rights issue, both the Rothschild Group and CMCO (formerly Carl Marks &amp; Co) are reducing their holdings through a placement of new ordinary shares and existing convertible preference shares with institutional investors. Rothschild's holding of fully diluted capital will fall from 38.7 per cent to 26.5 per cent as a result of these transactions. The board is recommending a final dividend of 5p per ordinary share, bringing the total dividend to 6p, up 33 per cent on the previous year. The company's return on capital improved from 17 per cent last year to 28 per cent. Earnings per share, fully diluted, were 36.2p, an increase of 118 per cent over the previous year. Lex, Page 18</p>

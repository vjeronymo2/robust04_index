			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ELEVENTH SUMMER BY CARLO GEBLER (FIRESIDE: $7.95)  </P> <P> The homey odors of the Irish countryside permeate Carlo Geb-ler's coming-of-age  story. After his mother's death, 10-year-old Paul Weissmann is sent from his  father's home in London to his grandparents' farm.  </P> <P> His gentle grandmother channels all her pent-up affection into her love for  him; his grandfather is a hard man who treats Paul only slightly less harshly  than he does his wife. But the grandfather's drunken binges teach Paul things  he otherwise never would have learned, opening his eyes to the darker realities  of life: to cheating, degradation, the dark power of alcoholism and,  ultimately, death, when the old man's neglected cigarette burns down the family  farmhouse. Gebler evokes the lilt of Irish speech without stooping to the  cliches of writing in dialect.  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley in US alliance LAURA ASHLEY, the international fabrics, fashions and furnishings group, has signed a 10-year contract with Federal Express entrusting its worldwide distribution arrangements to the US logistics company. The deal is estimated at Pounds 150m. The business logistics arm of Federal Express will assume joint respsonsibility for Laura Ashley's supply chain, helping to ensure the most efficient delivery of goods from the retailer's international network of suppliers to its 500 stores in 28 countries. Federal Express will also work on developing a global home delivery service by September 1993, enabling Laura Ashley to deliver goods direct to shoppers within 24 to 48 hours. This service will use Federal Express's courier services in the US and the rest of the world but will mainly rely on sub-contractors in Europe. Federal Express announced last week that it was heavily restructuring its European parcels delivery operations with the loss of 7,000 jobs. Mr Jim Maxmin, Laura Ashley chief executive, predicted the move would greatly improve the company's operating efficiencies and would at a minimum save Pounds 3m in planned systems development costs. Additional benefits would result from working capital improvements and the ability to respond more quickly and flexibly to customers' requirements especially on the home furnishings side, he said. As a result of the business alliance, Laura Ashley will shut three warehouses in the Netherlands, the US and Milton Keynes with the loss of 60 jobs. The company will take a Pounds 4.5m exceptional charge in its accounts for the year to January 1992 - booked as a post-balance sheet event.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN ANTONIO HANDICAP;  </P> <P> PINCAY RIDES SUPER DIAMOND TO VICTORY  </P> <P> Two veteran horses ran first and last in the $272,100 San Antonio Handicap at  Santa Anita on Sunday, with Super Diamond scoring a 1 3/4-length victory while  Cutlass Reality, the favorite, trailed in the seven-horse field.  </P> <P> Super Diamond, a 9-year-old gelding with a history of leg problems, shook off  Cutlass Reality at the top of the stretch and held off Frankly Perfect through  the stretch to give jockey Laffit Pincay his 10th victory of the meeting.  </P> <P> Cutlass Reality, a 7-year-old, went off at 23-10, slightly shorter than the  entry of Frankly Perfect and Payant. It was Cutlass Reality's first start since  he won the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park on Dec. 10.  </P> <P> The race before that, the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in November,  Cutlass Reality ran poorly on a muddy track. His handlers considered scratching  him Sunday because the track, hard hit by rain last week, was listed as good.  Cutlass Reality faded from contention with a quarter mile to go and finished  about 10 lengths behind Super Diamond.  </P> <P> Super Diamond, expected to run next in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on  March 5, paid $13 to win as the fourth betting choice in a crowd of 38,601,  running 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4/5. He is the oldest winner of the 51-year-old San  Antonio.  </P> <P> Frankly Perfect finished second, two lengths ahead of Cherokee Colony.  </P> <P> The winner carried 121 pounds, five more than Frankly Perfect and one more than  Cherokee Colony. Cutlass Reality carried 124.  </P></p>

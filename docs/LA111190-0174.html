			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROXY POWER IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH;  </P> <P> STOCKS: INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE ASSERTING THEMSELVES, BUT SEVERAL FACTORS  FAVOR MANAGEMENT IN THE EXPENSIVE BATTLE FOR CONTROL.  </P> <P> Invoking the cause of corporate democracy, New York investor Martin E. Tash and  his backers last month gained control of the board of directors of Gradco  Systems Inc. by winning the hearts and minds of shareholders in a contentious  proxy fight.  </P> <P> Two months earlier at Comprehensive Care Corp., a group including a former  company executive from Orange County waged a successful proxy battle, gaining  control of the St. Louis-based company's board and ousting the chief executive  officer.  </P> <P> Such victories by dissident shareholders are making companies respect the power  of the proxy. Still, there is no consensus that the proxy is the best weapon  for shareholders to use against entrenched corporate management.  </P> <P> Dissidents are winning more proxy fights -- the solicitation of shareholder  votes by opposing slates -- and increasingly are targeting small companies.  They say interest in proxy fights has been fueled by the collapse of the junk  bond market -- which funded many takeovers -- shareholder unhappiness with  falling stock prices in a slumping economy and a general increase in activism  by institutional investors.  </P> <P> But proxy fights remain the exception and not the rule. Such battles are too  expensive for most investors to launch, and the rules tend to favor management.  The tender offer is still the best tool for a takeover, investment experts say.  </P> <P> These issues have prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider  reforming the proxy process to make it easier for shareholders to make their  voices heard. Such changes could make the proxy a more potent weapon.  </P> <P> "This was supposed to be the season of the proxy fight, but the numbers have  been pretty constant (compared to previous years)," said Lilli Gordon, managing  director of the Analysis Group, a shareholder advisory service in Belmont,  Mass.  </P> <P> In the first 10 months of this year, dissident shareholders launched 38 proxy  fights, according to Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) in  Washington. That compares to 27 in all of 1989 and 56 in 1988.  </P> <P> "My sense is 1991 will be a very busy season, and I think the profile of the  proxy fighter will change beyond corporate raiders in the 1990s," Gordon said.  "People who have kept low profiles in the corporate arena will launch the  battles."  </P> <P> She expects more and more institution and individual investors -- those with  large stock holdings and who are unhappy with management decisions or response  to outside proposals -- to put forward their own board nominees in opposition  to management candidates.  </P> <P> Still, the chances that a publicly owned company will face a proxy fight are  slim. Richard Wines, senior vice president at Georgeson &amp; Co., a New York  proxy consulting firm, says that fewer than 1% of the nation's 13,000 public  companies will face a proxy battle in any given year. He said tender offers --  a friendly or hostile bid to obtain the company's stock at a set price --  remain far more likely.  </P> <P> But in the proxy battles that are being launched, challengers are meeting with  greater success than in the past. This year, dissidents won 34.2% of the fights  monitored by IRRC in 1990, compared to 31.6% management victories and 34.2%  neutral outcomes such as settlements. That compares to 21% dissident victories,  60% management victories, and 19% neutral outcomes in 1988.  </P> <P> As a result of the increased success of dissidents, Wines said he urges  companies to attempt to stave off proxy fights by taking steps to identify who  their large investors are and to learn their concerns.  </P> <P> Of the proxy fights launched this year, 24 involved battles for full board  control. Dissidents fared worse in such fights, winning only 25% of the time,  compared to 50% management victories, and 25% neutral outcomes.  </P> <P> But proxy experts said more dissident gains are hidden in these numbers, noting  that settlements generally involve some kind of concession by management and a  measurable gain in influence for the dissidents.  </P> <P> Even the possibility of shareholder revolt has prompted some management teams  to make concessions with only the threat of a proxy fight. Such was the case at  Costa Mesa-based Emulex Corp., sources said, when Fred B. Cox, co-founder and  chairman, agreed to give up the posts of chief executive officer and president.  His move came after the company reported a $3.1-million operating loss in April  and an outside venture capitalist who had previously attempted to take over the  company regained a seat on the company's board of directors.  </P> <P> "If you look closely at the goals of the dissidents, you find that they use the  proxy fight as a tactic to achieve them," Gordon said. "This year they got  their way two out of three times."  </P> <P> Her firm identified six motives for launching proxy fights: acquiring the  company; seeking board approval of a sale of a company; forcing a change in  corporate policy without a sale or liquidation; replacement of management;  monitoring board activities; and changing the company's governance structure,  such as repealing anti-takeover measures.  </P> <P> While Gargantuan battles, including corporate raider Harold Simmons' attempt to  take control of Lockheed Corp., grabbed the headlines this year, more smaller  companies were besieged by rebellious shareholders. Only nine of the proxy  fights launched this year involved Fortune 500 companies.  </P> <P> "This proxy season there were a lot of high-profile battles," said Howard D.  Sherman, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a company  that advises institutional clients on proxy voting in Washington. "I'd expect  next year it will filter down to smaller companies as the awareness spreads."  </P> <P> One reason is simple economics. If a company's earnings suffer and its stock  price falls, shareholder unrest rises, said John J. Giovannone, an attorney who  advises companies about proxy law at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> In addition, there is a growing activism among institutional investors, who  closely watch the bottom lines. While institutional investors -- insurance  companies, pension funds, money market funds and others that invest huge pools  of money -- often are content to be silent investment partners, more and more  become vocal in demanding that companies protect shareholders' interests. One  such institutional activist is the California Public Employees Retirement  System, or Calpers.  </P> <P> The institutions can become "kingmakers" in proxy battles. Though they rarely  lead the fights themselves, the institutions favor independent boards and are  often courted like royalty in proxy fights because they control big blocks of  stock.  </P> <P> Their activism is reflected in the dramatic increase in shareholder proposals.  The American Society of Corporate Secretaries (ASCS) in New York said its 2,400  member companies report that shareholders submitted 739 proposals during the  year ended June 30. Five years ago, only 442 proposals were submitted by  shareholders in the group.  </P> <P> Most of the proposals pertained to issues of changes in corporate ownership,  shareholder rights, executive compensation, corporate governance and social  issues such as the environment, said Richard Pyle, vice president of the  society. He said this year that votes in favor of such proposals reached record  highs.  </P> <P> At Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp., management defeated Simmons' bid for board  control, but it promised to add three new directors to represent institutional  shareholders. It also approved four Simmons-sponsored proposals to rescind a  poison-pill plan, renounce greenmail, institute confidential voting and opt out  of Delaware's anti-takeover law.  </P> <P> Calpers backed Simmons in the fight, a clear sign that institutional investors,  who control about $2.6 trillion in investments and own roughly 18% of all  stocks, are no longer blindly casting their votes in favor of management  proposals, Sherman said.  </P> <P> At Gradco, an Irvine-based maker of copier and printer sorter equipment, all  but one of a dozen institutional investors voted with the dissidents. Those  shareholders were upset with huge stock losses and a controversial plan to  restructure the company. Tash and his supporters claimed the plan would have  enriched management at shareholders' expense.  </P> <P> The Tash-led group won majority control of Gradco, prompting the immediate  resignation of the company's founder and chairman, Keith Stewart.  </P> <P> At CompCare, the operator of a chain of chemical dependency and psychiatric  treatment centers, dissidents were dissatisfied with the company's financial  performance and won majority control in a proxy fight that lasted eight weeks.  The dissident committee was headed by Portland securities broker Les  Livingston, who had invested more than $1 million of his firm's cash in  CompCare stock in anticipation of a merger that later fell through.  </P> <P> Both Gradco and CompCare were vulnerable because of their bleak financial  performance, but proxy fights are expected to increase throughout the nation  regardless of the state of the economy, experts say.  </P> <P> John C. Wilcox, managing director of Georgeson &amp; Co., said that proxy  fights may see a resurgence because more shareholders are demanding that boards  serve as independent liaisons between the shareholders and management rather  than tools of management.  </P> <P> But some dissidents protest that there are roadblocks in their way. Ralph  Whitworth, president of the 64,000-member United Shareholders Assn. (USA) in  Washington, complains that the deck in proxy fights still remains stacked  against dissidents.  </P> <P> "You won't see the effects of proxy activism until you have a reform of the  voting process," said Whitworth, whose group was founded by corporate raider T.  Boone Pickens in 1986.  </P> <P> The proxy fight can be less disruptive, less expensive and more efficient than  the traditional tender offer, Whitworth said. And the dissident can achieve his  goals if he succeeds in swaying the votes of a few large institutional  shareholders.  </P> <P> As a takeover tool, the proxy vote suffers from some drawbacks.  </P> <P> Management can use company funds to finance its own proxy campaign. Gradco  spent about $1 million on an investment banking firm, a public relations firm  and a proxy solicitation service in an unsuccessful effort to fend off Tash,  who spent $400,000.  </P> <P> Moreover, the rebellious shareholders are often on the outside looking in,  unable to access confidential information or even lists of shareholders and  therefore sometimes unable to come up with their own alternatives to management  proposals.  </P> <P> To fend off proxy rebels, management can take such defensive steps as giving  directors staggered, three-year terms, eliminating the shareholders' right to  call a special meeting, making it costly to remove members from the board or  expanding the board, Sherman said. And just as they did in lobbying for  anti-takeover laws, companies can lobby for state laws to limit the proxy  battle as well.  </P> <P> "You have to have a lot of money to wage a proxy fight," said Randy Young,  president of Everhart Corp., a Santa Ana venture capital firm and a member of  USA. "There's no question where the odds lie."  </P> <P> Thus, the victories of dissidents such as Tash, who used no proxy solicitation  service but rather relied on a groundswell of disgruntled investors, are all  the more surprising.  </P> <P> In the coming year, some experts say the odds could change. The SEC is taking  proposals on proxy reform from a wide variety of groups, including USA,  Calpers, the American Bar Assn. and the ASCS.  </P> <P> USA has proposed that the SEC require companies to endorse confidential voting,  provide shareholders access to proxy materials and shareholder lists, and  require shareholder votes on devices designed to protect management, such as  poison pills. Whitworth said the number of dissident victories would be  dramatically higher if such reforms were adopted.  </P> <P> But ASCS spokesman Richard H. Troy said the existing process, in which  individual states can adopt their own proxy laws, works just fine. The  association is a staunch management supporter and frequent foe of USA.  </P> <P> "It would not be wise to open up the proxy process completely to the small  group of rich investors," he said. "The businesses would spend a  disproportionate amount of time engaged in proxy fights every year."  </P> <P> Troy also said that granting rights to shareholders with large stakes would  unfairly create two tiers of stockholders. Dissidents say such rights, such as  cumulative voting rules that allow large stockholders to vote their shares in  such a way as to guarantee a seat on the board, ensure they can have a say in  corporate affairs.  </P> <P> Wilcox said that creating a proxy system that is out of kilter with the way  private companies are run would dampen the appeal of going public, and he said  it would be wrong to condemn the system based on the past lopsided victories in  favor of management.  </P> <P> "That's like judging the legal system based on the number of acquittals or  convictions," Wilcox said. "The proxy is a tool to make management accountable.  But it would be economically non-productive to have a contested election every  year. These aren't like little countries with political parties."  </P> <P> The SEC has already loosened its restrictions on what issues are appropriate  for shareholder proposals in proxy statements. Despite objections from  companies that say the issues are day-to-day management issues, the agency has  allowed several shareholder resolutions on golden parachutes, confidential  voting and shareholder advisory committees.  </P> <P> In entertaining some sort of change, SEC officials say they want to improve  corporate governance to boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DISSIDENT VICTORIES IN 1990 PROXY FIGHTS  </P> <P> ALLEGHANY CORP., New York:  </P> <P> Dissident: Allan P.

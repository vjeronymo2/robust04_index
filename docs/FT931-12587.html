			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading PROFIT-TAKING, talk of a large rights issue and a poor gilts auction all combined to force a retreat in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,863, just ahead of Tuesday's strong close, and early good buying sent it climbing to 2,870 by mid-morning, at which point the contract was trading at a healthy premium of about 30 points. However, profit-taking and disappointment with the gilts auction led to a reversal in the fortunes of March, and it drifted lower for the next few hours. The afternoon saw further falls in the contract which were brought about by speculation of a big rights issue and the tentative opening on Wall Street. March closed at 2,854, down 6 from its previous close but around 15 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover, although less than Tuesday's heavy figure, was healthy at 11,996 contracts. Volume in the traded options was once again high, reaching 51,746 lots, with a large part of the total attributed to the expiry of several of the January stock options. The FT-SE 100 option was busy at 15,255 contracts, as was the Euro-FT-SE 100 option at 3,137. Asda was the most actively dealt stock option with 2,448 lots. It was followed by British Gas at 2,279. BP and Hanson were also busy.</p>

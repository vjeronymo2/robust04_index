			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rachel Sylvester: "Jailed Britons `Conned' Into </F> Carrying Narcotics"]    [Text] Britons are being duped into smuggling a drug which  is legal in the United Kingdom but banned in others, say Foreign  Office officials.    At least 25 Britons have been arrested in the past six  months  in Scandinavia, charged with carrying khat, a stimulant that is  banned in America and most European countries.    Paul Watson, 34, from London, was arrested on Friday in  Helsinki, Finland, for possessing 80 kilos of the khat plant  leaves.    He told Finnish police he was en route to Stockholm and that  this was his second trip as a courier.    Drugs support agencies fear that London has become the  centre  for an illegal trade in khat.    The Foreign Office suspects that a single organisation is  employing the couriers because nearly all the arrested  Britons--ranging in age from 24 to 59--have come from the  Heathrow airport area in west London.    Release, the drug charity, said it had received dozens of  calls from Londoners who had been offered &pound;50 to  &pound;150 to  carry khat abroad, mainly to Scandinavia and the United States.  Some had answered small ads in local newspapers.    Khat--Catha edulis forsk--is a privet-like plant  that produces mild euphoria when its leaves are chewed.    It is widely grown in the Horn of Africa, particularly  Somalia and the Yemen, where chewing its bitter leaves is part  of the culture.    Greengrocers sell it in Britain, particularly in areas with  Somali and Yemeni immigrants. A bunch of leaves costs &pound;4.  It  raises blood pressure, increases heart beat and suppresses  appetite.    Catherine Perez Phillips, a spokeswoman for Release said:  "When people are asked to carry the drug they are not being told  the truth. They are told that what they are being asked to do is  legal."    Six Britons are still held in Oslo awaiting trial. Among  them  are Raymond and Joanne Edwards, from London, who were arrested  at Oslo airport on April 7.    They said they had been offered &pound;50 each for the  trip, and  that this was the second time they had acted as couriers for the  same agent.    Seven others arrested in Norway have been released and  deported.    Six more Londoners are in prison awaiting trial in Sweden,  three in Finland and three in Denmark.    British embassies are worried that the trafficking is  becoming such a problem that the Scandinavian governments will  make an example of some of the Britons by jailing them.    Until now the authorities have adopted a relaxed attitude  and  those found guilty of smuggling khat have only been deported.    A 1980 UN report said that prolonged chewing of khat can  lead  to dental and gastric diseases, cirrhosis of the liver,  hypertension, migraine and cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

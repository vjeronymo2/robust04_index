			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Amdahl sees share price tumble after profits warning AMDAHL, the US computer systems company, saw its share price tumble, by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 1/2 , after a profits warning, Reuter reports. The company said it expected next month to report a first-quarter loss 'substantially larger' than analysts' average estimates. The company declined to estimate the size of the projected loss for the period, to March 26, but a survey of analysts' estimates suggested a loss of 3 cents per share. Amdahl attributed the shortfall in earnings to price competition and erratic demand.</p>

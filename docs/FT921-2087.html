			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Number-cruncher prepares to break the mould: Peter Marsh talks to the new chief of the Central Statistical Office MR BILL McLENNAN, the Australian statistician who is the new head of the government's Central Statistical Office, has an outgoing style unusual for a senior UK civil servant. Asked about his past, Britain's statistics supremo hands out not a list of pre-vious jobs but an 11-page assessment of his personality, provided by a management consultancy. While the squash-playing number-cruncher is not shy about baring his soul to the world, he has also promised an open debate about the work of the CSO. The office's main task is to monitor the economy on behalf of the Treasury, which takes overall responsibility for the agency. The CSO is expected to come up with accurate and timely figures on a vast number of variables, from the balance of payments to sales of do-it-yourself goods. Mr McLennan, who is 50, wants the CSO to put a new emphasis on marketing its statistics both to other parts of the government and to people in the business world. 'If the statistics aren't what people want, they might as well not exist,' he says. The new CSO boss was headhunted from the post of deputy director of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, where he worked for 32 years. He has come to Britain with his wife - also a statistician - who has secured a job in the Treasury. As well as being in charge of the 1,200-strong CSO, Mr McLennan takes on responsibility for the output of 500 government statisticians in other parts of Whitehall. The 500 are part of the Government Statistical Service. To prepare for his job Mr McLennan read through every news report he could find which has mentioned the CSO since 1988. He says the reports indicate that the CSO has been 'under pressure', largely because of complaints by MPs and the City that too many of its statistics are inaccurate and prone to revision. The less-than-positive tone of the news coverage and the office's somewhat dozy image are partly due to the reclusive nature of Sir Jack Hibbert, Mr McLennan's immediate predecessor as CSO chief, who retired at the end of February. Sir Jack disliked publicity and was viewed as a thoroughly pleasant, though less than dynamic, civil servant. Mr McLennan is a more vigorous character. The personal assessment which he hands visitors emphasises his 'enthusiasm for ideas', although it says his planning might be improved if he did more 'deep personal thinking'. The document also says Mr McLennan is 'impetuous', 'impatient' and may 'ruffle people's feelings'. Reflecting this outgoing style, Mr McLennan has no problems about speaking to newspapers 'on the record' rather than insisting, in the manner of most Whitehall mandarins, that he must not be quoted. It seems his approach might jar with the traditionally secretive style of Whitehall, which is especially marked at the Treasury. But the panel which selected Mr McLennan contained two of Whitehall's most senior figures - Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, and Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary - and his appointment may imply that the Civil Service establishment is keen to encourage a little more openness. In his new job Mr McLennan will be helped by expansion already in train at the CSO which is aimed at improving its statistics. The office's annual budget is due almost to double, from Pounds 19.6m in 1989-90 to Pounds 37.3m in 1992-93. Over the same period staff will increase by nearly 400. 'Now we've got to perform,' says Mr McLennan, indicating a tougher approach to management than is normally associated with Whitehall. He also hints that the agency might increase the charges for its data - much of which is given away free or at low prices - partly to raise money for the government but also to keep staff on their toes by bringing them closer to customers. As to the challenge of his job, Mr McLennan is not backward in expressing enthusiasm. He describes one statistical series he devised in Canberra - an analysis of Australian population trends put on a laser disc to be read by computer - as a 'beautiful product'. He adds: 'I'm a bit of a crusader. The public perception of statisticians as dull backroom boys is all wrong. Having good statistics about a country is a fundamental part of how it organises itself.'</p>

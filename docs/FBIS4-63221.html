			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Planes From the Korean </F> Conveyor Belt"]    [Text] Russian airplanes will soon be produced by plants  in South Korea, thanks to a joint company set up by the South  Korean "Khendz" [name as transliterated] corporation and the  Russian A.S. Yakovlev Experimental Design Bureau. Production of  "Yak" aircraft is expected to begin in the course of the year.    The "Khendz-Yak Aerospace" joint venture, in which the South  Korean side will have a 51-percent share and the Russian  experimental design bureau 49 percent, plans to produce  medium-sized and small aircraft. It is expected that in the  future the joint venture will be able to sell its output abroad,  notably in the United States and European countries.</p>

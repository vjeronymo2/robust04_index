			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slow revival forecast for cocoa prices HISTORY COULD be repeating itself in the depressed world cocoa market, according to Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man. The market, which has been buffeted by low prices and overproduction for the past few years, is now in a similar state to the mid-1960s, when stocks were also at record highs and prices at record lows. 'Although prices rose, the recovery was insufficient to stimulate production or curb consumption growth,' says Gill in its latest cocoa market report. It predicts several years of deficits, and 'as a result, the general trend in bean prices through to the mid-1990s will be up rather than down'. Gill &amp; Duffus has cut its world production forecast for 1991-92 to 2.24m tonnes from a September estimate of 2.32m tonnes, mainly because of a deterioration in prospects for Nigeria. The forecast for the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, has been reduced by 40,000 tonnes to 710,000 because of dry weather. The total deficit - the first after seven years of surplus - is now estimated at 177,000 tonnes, compared with the earlier forecast of 148,000 tonnes. This will still leave closing stocks for the year at 1.35m tonnes. World consumption will continue to rise, by 2 per cent to 2.39m tonnes for 1991-92, Gill predicts. 'Looking forward to 1992-93 we expect another year of record consumption as prices remain low in real terms and western economies recover from recession.'</p>

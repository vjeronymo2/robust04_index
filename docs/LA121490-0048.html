			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: TARZANA;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL FINED FOR TOXIC GAS EXPOSURE  </P> <P> State job-safety inspectors have fined a Tarzana hospital nearly $5,000 after a  technician was exposed to a suspected cancer-causing gas leaking from a machine  used to sterilize surgical instruments. But Cal/OSHA officials dropped more  than $12,000 in additional fines against Tarzana Regional Medical Center after  deciding that they could not prove the hospital didn't have proper mechanical  controls to prevent future leaks, a spokesman said. The hospital was cited on  Oct. 2 for 18 violations of state worker-protection laws, including five repeat  offenses.  </P></p>

Due to different  conditions in the development of the national economy, the  economic and technical development in various regions is  unbalanced. Under the conditions of market economy, we must  understand that because of differences in various regions, there  can be major differences under certain conditions. However, if  the economic differences are excessively large in various  regions, they would have an adverse impact on social stability  and development. Therefore, we must follow the principle of  giving consideration to both balanced development and efficiency  in forming a reasonable pattern for the distribution of the  productive forces.  <H5>  Widening Regional Economic Differences </H5>   Since the beginning of the reform and opening up program,  China has scored economic achievements which attract worldwide  attention. Tremendous economic achievements have been attained  in various regions throughout the country. However, such  development is unbalanced. The rate of growth is the greatest in  China's eastern region where economic and technological  foundations are good, while this rate is comparatively low in  the central and western regions where economic and technological  standards are fairly low. As seen from the average annual growth  rate of gross national product between 1980 and 1991, the ratio  among China's eastern, central, and western regions is  16.72:15.2:14.78 with the eastern region nearly 2 percent higher  than the western region. The accumulative difference in rate of  growth has again widened the once diminishing regional economic  differences.    There are almost no changes in the ratio of population in  China's eastern, central, and western regions during the past  decade. Nevertheless there are notable changes in the ratio of  gross national product in these regions. The ratio in 1980 was  52.2:31.2:16.5. The ratio in 1991 was 55.8:29.3:14.9 with the  ratio in the eastern region raised by 3.6 percent and the  central and western regions lowered by 1.9 percent and 1.6  percent respectively. Influenced by the differences in economic  development, the gap in residents' incomes in various regions is  also widening. Let us take the income of peasants as an example.  The ratio in 1980 between the average per-capita income of  peasants in five provinces and municipalities directly under the  central government with the highest income and that of the five  provinces and autonomous regions with the lowest income is  1.98:1 (assuming the average per-capita income of peasants in  the provinces and autonomous regions with the lowest income is  1). These figures rose to 2.88:1 in 1991. As seen from the  eastern, central, and western regions, the 1980 ratio of average  per-capital income of peasants in these three regions was  1.39:1.11:1; while that in 1991 rose to 1.71:1.06:1.    In China's existing economic structure, nearly half of the  gross national product is contributed by secondary industry, and  nearly 90 percent of the added value of secondary industry is  contributed by industry (manufacturing industry). Therefore, the  rate of industrial growth is extremely important in the  development of the entire national economy. There are  significant differences in the rate of industrial growth among  the eastern, central, and western regions. The rate of average  annual rate of growth between 1985 and 1990 was 1.39:1.05:1.  This difference brought about changes in the regional structure  in terms of total industrial output. The percentage in the  eastern region rose from 60.3 percent in 1985 to 62.7 percent in  1990, while that in the western region dropped from 12.75  percent in 1985 to 11.91 percent in 1990. Due to various  reasons, the growth rate of investment in fixed assets in  central and western regions is relatively low. From the  long-term investment point of view, this trend is not so  favorable. The rates of growth of investment in fixed assets in  China's eastern, central, and western regions from 1982 to 1991  were 19.69 percent, 16.15 percent, and 18.18 percent. In 1991,  61.46 percent of the additional investment in fixed assets was  made in the eastern region.    Since the beginning of this year, China has continued to  maintain a high rate of growth in its economic development. The  gross national product in the first quarter rose by 14.1 percent  over the same period in 1992. According to accumulative figures  compiled from January to April, China registered a rate of  growth of 23 percent in industrial production. However, the  pattern of unbalanced economic developments in various regions  remains unchanged. In some districts, economic development is  still quite sluggish. Those areas that were economically  backward in the past are still lagging behind others, and their  ratio in economic increments continues to drop. The gaps between  the eastern region and the western region and between the south  region and the northern region continue to widen. Let us take  industrial production as an example. According to accumulative  figures compiled between January and April, the rates of  industrial growth in the eastern, central and, western regions  were 28 percent, 14.5 percent, and 13.6 percent respectively;  and the increments in industrial production in the eastern  region accounted for 77.5 percent of the total increments in  industrial production. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and  Guangdong provinces alone made up 61 percent of the total  increments in industrial production. According to accumulative  figures compiled between January and April, the rates of growth  of investment in fixed assets in state-owned units in the  eastern, central, and western regions were 77.5 percent, 48.3  percent, and 46.4 percent. About 70 percent of the increments of  investment in fixed assets in state-owned units were in China's  eastern region, and 44.7 percent of such increments were in  Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong provinces.  <H5>  Reasons for Widening Regional Economic Differences </H5>   There are objective reasons for the unbalanced development  in  China's different regions such as historical and natural  conditions and so on. However, we must not neglect the influence  of the macroeconomic policy on backward areas.    From the financial resources point of view, the state has  placed emphasis on the development of China's coast areas in the  eastern region since the implementation of the reform and  opening up policy. Large investments are made with excellent  economic results. Meanwhile, attracted by the high financial  returns, funds have unceasingly flowed to the coastal areas in  Southeast China from various localities. Let us take  Heilongjiang Province as an example. Cash flowed out of the  province totalled 1.3 billion yuan during the first quarter of  this year alone. In 1992, funds flowed out of Shanxi Province to  the coastal areas in the form of loans and fund-raising reached  1 billion yuan. This flow of funds has provided the developed  coastal provinces with ample funds for construction, while money  supply falls far short of demand in backward regions.    From the industrial structure point of view, the central and  western regions are important ones where there are abundant  resources of energy and raw and semi-finished materials. These  regions also supply major production facilities. In these  regions, prices and production are more strictly controlled by  the state plans, and there are more mandatory plans for  production targets, while the processing industry is not well  developed. Within the industrial structure in the eastern  region, the processing industry and the industry of consumer  goods are given priority. Production is almost completely  regulated by the market. There are less state mandatory plans  for production targets, and prices are set by enterprises  themselves. Under the current situation whereby the pricing  structure has not been rationalized, the central and western  regions provide low-price energy and raw materials, while paying  higher price to buy processed products and consumer goods. This  has created a form of exchange at unequal value with the eastern  region. Funds are being transferred to the eastern region from  the central and western regions, thus hampering the economic  development in the backward regions.    From the point of view of flow of professionally trained  personnel, professionals and technical personnel have always  been leaving the backward regions to the developed areas for the  past ten and more years. Between 1983 and 1992, more than 5,000  technical personnel of all kinds have been transferred out of  Ningxia through the normal procedure. Between 1990 and 1992,  6,638 cadres including 31 high-ranking and 566 middle-ranking  professionals were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in other  provinces. Among the transferred cadres, 56.4 percent of them  were transferred to work in coastal cities, while 43.6 percent  of them were transferred to work in large cities in China's  interior provinces. The shortage of qualified personnel greatly  affects the economic development and the process of  modernization in central and western regions.    Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, it is  impossible for China's different regions to develop with the  same speed. Adequate regional differences are conducive to  arousing the enthusiasm of various localities to develop their  own economy and compete with one another. However, if the gaps  are excessively wide and are continuously widening to create  "polarization," such gaps may adversely affect economic,  political, and social stability. Therefore, a major task of the  state in exercising macroeconomic control is to make use of  economic, administrative and legal means to keep the regional  differences within the limits that are acceptable by the society.  <H5>  Several Proposals </H5>   1. Encourage Central and Western Regions To Look for  New Fields for Economic Growth First of all, we must  vigorously develop town and township enterprises. Right now, 40  percent of per-capita peasants' net income in the country comes  from non-farming industry, while 80 percent of such income in  coastal developed areas comes from town and township  enterprises. Meanwhile, the total output value in town and  township enterprises in central and western regions accounts for  less than 5 percent of that of town and township enterprises in  the whole country. Therefore, the central and western regions  must regard the development of town and township enterprises as  an important measure to stimulate the economic development in  these two regions and make use of local resources to manufacture  their unique commodities. To further develop the economy in  central and western regions, town and township enterprises there  must undergo a stage of unusual development by leaps and bounds.  Second, they must take advantage of their geographic  superiority. Those backward areas in the border region have fine  conditions to develop border trade. They must develop their  local processing industry through border trade and turn their  geographic advantage into industrial superiority and form an  industrial structure that benefits both China and the  neighboring country. Third, it is necessary to pay attention to  commodity circulation and promote production. The scale of  market affects the production scale. Thus, it also affects the  economic scale. The key in promoting economic development is to  attach importance to commodity circulation and marketing. The  current major task of the central and western regions in paying  attention to commodity circulation is to further improve the  market structure.    2. Permit Central and Western Regions To Adopt More  Flexible Measures in Implementing Policy on Ownership  System. The ratio of the public economic sector,  particularly the state-owned economic sector, is far greater in  the central and western regions than that in the developed  areas. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the economic  sector which is not state-owned, particularly the non-public  owned economic sector, to develop itself. While making the  state-owned economic sector predominant and regarding the  public-owned economic sector as the mainstay, we must adopt all  kinds of measures to promote the development of all other  economic sectors. We should treat all other economic sectors on  an equal basis.    3. Adequately Increase Investments in Central and  Western Regions. Right now, China's eastern region is more  capable of developing itself. The state may consider gradually  shifting its investments westward, and increase investments in  central and western regions with emphasis on communications,  transportation, and energy, and raw material industries. While  taking into consideration the mutual economic benefits in all  regions, we must set up and develop a system of division of  labor in various regions, encourage and support the processing  industry with local raw materials, and force the processing  industry in the eastern region to turn out more products with  higher added value and high technology and export-oriented  products in order to upgrade the industrial structure in China.    4. The State Must Not "Demand Uniformity in Everything"  in Exercising Macro-Control. In exercising macroeconomic  control, the state should give more preferential treatment to  economically backward regions while taking into full  consideration the actual situation in the backward regions where  economic growth has just started and there are differences in  economic development in different regions. The percentage of  economic increments contributed by the backward regions is  fairly small. These regions have little overall influence. If  the measures adopted by the state in exercising macroeconomic  control are excessively severe, they may deal severe economic  blows to the backward regions, although their effects in cooling  off the overheated national economy may not be so obvious. Many  backward regions are worried that the policy and measures to  "demand uniformity in everything" may "chop off the tails of the  developed regions, while cutting off the heads of the backward  regions" and that it will thus make the backward regions lose  another opportunity to develop themselves.</p>

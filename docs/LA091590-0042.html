			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS ENLIST IN SAUDI FORCES; SIZE COULD DOUBLE  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of men have flocked to military recruiting centers over the  past two weeks in a major public mobilization that could eventually double the  size of Saudi Arabia's armed forces and place at least six new divisions along  its most vulnerable borders.  </P> <P> The recruitment effort comes amid controversy within King Fahd's government and  widespread public dissatisfaction over Saudi Arabia's historic reliance on a  relatively small army paired with a well-equipped, technologically  sophisticated air force -- a combination that proved alarmingly inadequate when  170,000 Iraqi troops threatened the kingdom on its northern border with Kuwait.  </P> <P> Military officials have sketched a new political map of the troubled Persian  Gulf region that now shows potentially hostile frontiers not only with Iraq but  with Jordan and Yemen as well. Moreover, they see the kingdom facing a  1-million-strong Iraqi army that must be countered not only with sophisticated  jet fighters, the flashy mainstays of the Saudi military, but also with  infantry and tanks.  </P> <P> Over the past few weeks, senior officials and outside military advisers have  begun discussing a military buildup that would triple the size of the  37,500-member army and give Saudi Arabia an overall force of at least 120,000  men -- nearly twice the 67,500 men now in the field with the army, the national  guard and the air force.  </P> <P> Some consultants are calling for an armed force as large as 300,000 men, with  new divisions deployed to counteract potential threats from Yemen and Jordan,  both of which have provided some backing to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in  the conflict over Kuwait.  </P> <P> "We are living in times when anything can happen," one Saudi official said.  "People are saying, 'We spent billions of dollars building this whole country  up, and now we can't defend it? What is this"  </P> <P> Controversy within the Arab world over the deployment of U.S. forces in the  kingdom also has pointed up potential weaknesses in the Saudis' quiet  confidence that the United States, Canada, Western Europe and other nations  dependent on Saudi oil could be counted on to send troops in the event of  trouble -- an unwritten pact that has guided Saudi military policy to a  surprising degree in recent decades.  </P> <P> "A lot of Saudis are suspicious of foreigners," a Western diplomat said, "and  they're very suspicious of foreigners in their country with lots of weapons,  and they're especially worried about a large American force that is growing  stronger every day in an area that is most vital to them -- the eastern oil  fields."  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia found itself without a single complete division when Iraq began  massing troops on the Saudi border after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The deployment of three divisions, or about 36,000 men, at Hafr al Baten, Saudi  Arabia's northern military base, would have been enough to counter Iraq's  initial movement of seven divisions into southern Kuwait, some analysts said.  </P> <P> "It would have taken Saddam Hussein nine divisions to give us a good fight,"  one said. "It would have meant we could have probably held him off for weeks,  if not more, instead of this situation where we found ourselves with absolutely  no defense against him."  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's military policy grew out of a decision at the beginning of the  historic oil boom to spend the bonanza on developing the kingdom, rather than  building a large army.  </P> <P> The thinking at the time, according to Saudi officials, academics and outside  analysts, was that Yemen and South Yemen provided the only credible border  threats, and those, before unification, were negligible.  </P> <P> Iran grew into a menace after its Islamic revolution in 1979, and Iraq had  hinted on occasion that it had designs on the kingdom. The ill-fated solution  to both problems was to spend billions arming Iraq as an ally against Iran.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's a secret that there was a debate in Saudi Arabia about the  size of the army, and many people felt we should have a much larger army than  we ended up with," said Dr. Bakr Abdullah Bakr, rector of King Fahd University  of Petroleum and Minerals and one of the most influential personalities in  Saudi Arabia's powerful Eastern province.  </P> <P> "Some said we are surrounded by friendly nations, and there are more important  things to spend our money on than building up a massive war machine. I think  this argument has won in the past, but I'm not sure it will in the future."  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia spent $536 billion between 1975 and 1985 building an elaborate  array of highways, airports, universities, skyscrapers, industrial facilities  and communications systems. And while it put large outlays into equipping an  air force rivaling most others in the world, the number of ground forces was  kept relatively small -- much smaller than the armies of nearby countries in  the region, Israel, Egypt, Syria, Iran and Iraq.  </P> <P> Some outside analysts say Saudi monarchs deliberately kept the army small and  separate from the national guard, which reports directly to the crown prince,  to avoid potential military threats to the monarchy. One Saudi official said  that was indeed a factor in keeping the two forces divided through the 1960s,  but he and several other officials denied that it played any role in  present-day decision making.  </P> <P> In recent years, Saudi Arabia wagered that it would be able to counter most  likely outside threats by building a series of large military facilities in the  north, south and east of the kingdom from which a well-equipped air force could  be deployed, depending on the direction of the threat.  </P> <P> A key part of the strategy was an unwritten expectation that outside forces,  particularly U.S. forces, could be called on in the event of major trouble. To  accommodate outside help, huge military cities at Hafr al Baten and in the  Eastern province were built far larger than would ever be needed by Saudi  forces alone, several analysts said. And the Saudis over the years developed a  quiet strategy of acquiring U.S. military equipment, spare parts and training  that, according to one U.S. official, has made the armed forces of the two  countries virtually "interoperable."  </P> <P> "We always knew our friends in the United States would help us," a Saudi  official said. "The only question was when, and how fast. Now we know."  </P> <P> One Western diplomat equated the Saudi expectations with the kingdom's huge  importation of foreign labor to handle many high-tech jobs and do much of the  manual labor for which it is difficult to recruit Saudis.  </P> <P> "The Saudis have always done that," he said. "They just buy people. The whole  country is made up of slaves."  </P> <P> But Saudi officials bristle at any suggestion that the multinational force now  deployed in the Saudi desert consists of hired hands. One government official  said Saudi Arabia was willing to finance a large portion of the U.S. military  deployment from the beginning but was slow about offering direct payments to  avoid the perception that the Americans were being bought.  </P> <P> "The Americans don't like to be thought of as mercenaries," he said.  </P> <P> Bakr, the university rector, said the relationship was more comparable to the  historic, interdependent working relationship between the Americans and the  Saudis in the oil industry.  </P> <P> "The relationship between America and Saudi Arabia has been, throughout the  past five decades, a contractual relationship, where the Saudis employed  American expertise to help them develop and paid them well for that," he said.  </P> <P> "We don't want to overburden the American economy, if it is within Saudi  Arabia's ability to share in the cost. We are beneficiaries here, and it's only  fair to lessen the burden on the American taxpayer," he added. "We don't want  to be like the Israelis and just be a sinkhole for American aid at the expense  of American taxpayers."  </P> <P> In the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent outside military  buildup, all these policies are being reexamined.  </P> <P> "Definitely there has been a change in the thinking, and not only at the level  of the king and Prince Sultan (ibn Abdulaziz, the defense minister). It has  been at the level of the people on the street," said one Saudi official close  to the defense minister.  </P> <P> "The people in the military all are convinced now the armed forces have to be  increased in number. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to have a reasonably  large number. Definitely it's going to increase, and it's going to increase by  a pretty large number."  </P> <P> King Fahd recently ordered the opening of recruitment centers and also called  for the mobilization of women in some military-related jobs. In the first week,  10,000 men volunteered in Eastern province, and another 40,000 have signed up  in Riyadh. Recruits are in four-week training courses throughout the kingdom  and afterward will return to their regular jobs to await possible call-up. The  king has stopped short of announcing any formal increase in the size of the  armed forces.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced they've made a decision in their mind, but the political  leadership, when they make a decision, they like to be very slow and very  deliberate," a Saudi close to the government said. "They hate to be seen as  reacting to a crisis."  </P> <P> Some outside analysts say that despite the overwhelming early volunteer  response, the Saudis may have difficulty in recruiting a large permanent army.  The oil boom accustomed many Saudis to seeking jobs as bankers and businessmen,  not infantrymen, they said.  </P> <P> "People like to be officers," a Western diplomat said, "but do people like to  be enlisted men? It's the type of thing that I think Saudis are really going to  have to get used to."  </P> <P> "We always had a problem recruiting people in the army, because the Saudis  don't like wearing uniforms," a senior Saudi official conceded. "We don't like  to be organized. We're better implementers than organizers."  </P> <P> A Saudi recruit with a high school education can expect to earn about 4,000  riyals a month, or about $1,050. But some Saudi officials said housing and  children's education benefits provide attractive incentives, particularly for  desert tribesmen who see military training as an honorable pursuit.  </P></p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (3): Most companies depend on exports - Andrew Hill reports that Flanders has moved away from dependence on agriculture and textiles A STRONG and open economy has always formed the foundations of Flemish pride  -in the middle ages, for example, when Bruges, Ypres and Ghent built their prosperity on wool, and again in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the city of Antwerp was a thriving mercantile centre. The resurgence of the Flemish economy since the mid-1960s, when per capita income in Flanders overtook Wallonia, has given the whole region a psychological boost. Flanders has moved away from dependence on agriculture and textiles; it has developed late 20th century industrial assets in sectors such as chemicals, car assembly, metals, food processing, machinery and high technology. Gross regional product in Flanders in 1988 (the last time it was calculated) represented nearly 60 per cent of Belgium's gross domestic product. But the very openness which has characterised the Flemish economy, is now taking its toll on a region which exports 75 per cent of its production, and accounts for more than 70 per cent of Belgium's total exports. Sales into Germany, Flanders' biggest trading partner, have dropped in absolute terms by 5 per cent over the last year. A global slump is doubly unkind to the Flemish economy, and particularly its dominant industrial groups. Not only are most of Flanders' companies - and, of course, its ports - dependent on export business, many of those companies are themselves foreign-owned. With the outlook grim on their home territory, investment by Flanders' biggest employers - Volvo, Ford, Volkswagen, BASF, Bayer, Monsanto, Alcatel, IBM, to name just a few - has slowed down, and new investment by foreigners is deterred by gloomy forecasts of Belgian wage costs. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that Belgian labour costs will have grown by 38 per cent between 1988 and 1994, against 18 per cent in the US. More damagingly for Flanders, wage costs in neighbouring France and the Netherlands are expected to grow by only 30 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. 'There's much more investment in southern Europe and eastern Europe now,' laments Mr Wim Van der Beken of the Flemish Employers Association (VEV). The result is an unaccustomed surge in unemployment. In the 1980s Flemish unemployment dropped sharply, but since the beginning of 1992 the unemployment rate in Flanders has increased from 8.8 per cent to 10.2 per cent. For once, the proportion of unemployed people in Flanders is growing faster than in Wallonia, although the rate in the southern part of Belgium (19.4 per cent) is still much higher. The immediate outlook is not good, but Mr Erik Buyst, an economist with Kredietbank in Brussels, says that Flanders is well-placed to take advantage of any improvement in the economy. He points out that capacity utilisation in Flanders is quite high: 'That means that if there is a big increase in demand you will need additional investment to cope with that increase, and additional investment means new jobs.' Meanwhile, the recession is undermining the Flemish government's traditional bullishness about the Flanders economy because, in spite of constitutional reform, the main levers of economic power - monetary, financial, price and income policy, for example - remain in the hands of central government. Many Flemish politicians and economists hope that it will not be long before Flanders wins responsibility for social security expenditure in Flanders - it is a constant gripe of Flemings that they have to 'subsidise' payments to unemployed Walloons. They are also hoping for wider fiscal and financial autonomy including, perhaps, control over some of Belgium's looming national debt. However, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian National Bank and himself a Fleming, believes this would be a step too far. Belgium's regions have much work to do before more fundamental economic responsibilities are split up. To illustrate the point, Mr Verplaetse cites recent speculation against the Belgian currency, based on (misguided) fears among foreign investors that constitutional reform would give too much budgetary control to the regions. 'In November, for the first time, Belgium got a triple-A international credit rating,' says Mr Verplaetse. 'I'm sure that if all the regions and communities asked for a rating, the average wouldn't come to triple-A, even though the debt is the same.' For the time being, then, the Flemish government can only concentrate on areas where it has undisputed competence. Most importantly, that means keeping its own budget within the norms laid out by the central government. But it also means encouraging the industrial economy in the region, by granting support to companies to stimulate economic expansion, renewing or restructuring particular sectors, and easing the immediate pain of the downturn. In the short term, for example, it was the Flemish regional goverment, and not the Belgian government, which stumped up emergency funds when Daf, the UK-Dutch vehicle manufacturer with a large plant in Flanders, went into receivership in February. In the longer term, the government aims to improve the region's infrastructure, stimulate research and development, reduce the administrative burden on business, and encourage 'clusters' of complementary businesses which can help each other grow. These are the main lines of the economic package outlined in the government's recent strategy document for the next decade, Flanders-Europe 2002, which was launched in March. Flemish employers like the strategy, because it at least represents an effort to provide continuity of policy in the often turbulent world of Belgian politics. But they realise that for the most part they will have to rely more on their own resources than on direct management of the most important economic indicators by a sympathetic regional government. That means coping with the stresses and strains of an open economy, as well as reaping the benefits. For example, as the European slump has closed in on Flanders, there have been increased calls from some industrialists for a stronger emphasis on Flemish verankering (literally 'anchoring'). Every time a foreign company cuts jobs in a Flemish subsidiary, the feeling is reinforced that Flemish companies should be managed from Flanders and strategic decisions with an impact on the local economy should be kept out of the hands of foreigners. But politically speaking, there is no acceptable way of achieving such an objective, while simultaneously staying open for foreign investment. Companies themselves have to do the work by encouraging the loyalty of shareholders, and attempting to improve profitability. As Wim Van der Beken of the VEV says, the more successful an enterprise, the more decision-making autonomy it is likely to be given by its parents. It is a pretty good metaphor for Flanders' political and economic aims and the way it will try to achieve them.  ---------------------------------------------------- Unemployment rate (%)  ---------------------------------------------------- 1992              Flanders      Wallonia     Belgium  ---------------------------------------------------- January                8.8          17.3        11.0 February               8.5          16.9        10.8 March                  8.4          16.9        10.6 April                  8.2          16.8        10.5 May                    8.1          16.6        10.3 June                   8.1          16.8        10.4 July                   9.1          18.6        11.7 August                 9.4          19.4        12.1 September              9.4          19.3        12.0 October                9.5          19.0        12.0 November               9.8          19.0        12.0 December              10.1          19.2        12.2 1993 January               10.3          19.5        12.4 February              10.2          19.4        12.3  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Kredietbank  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Technology: Throwing light on Indonesia - Solar energy is ideal for the remote islands The village of Telaga Said in north Sumatra has progressed little. Last century, elephants were required to transport heavy loads to it. Today, the preferred means is a caterpillar truck. However, Telaga Said has also been at the forefront of industrial development. In 1895, oil was discovered in the village, giving birth to the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Three years ago R&amp;S, a Shell affiliate, used the village to market an alternative energy source for rural communities - solar power. About 55 per cent of Indonesia's 185m people do not have access to electricity. With the population spread over 13,000 islands the problems of supplying electricity to the remote communities are immense. Donor agencies estimate the cost of extending the grid off the main island of Java at up to Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 2,000) per rural household and say the government's rural electrification programme is responsible for losses made by PLN, the state utility, estimated at Dollars 300m a year. These losses are comparable to those suffered recently by the solar industry which 'has focused 95 per cent on technological development and 5 per cent on product development', explains R de Lange, general manager of R&amp;S in Indonesia. De Lange believes the future lies in supplying single 50-100 watt panels to households. The systems, with proven reliability, can run small appliances such as lights and radios, providing an entree for the 80 per cent of the world's population which lack access to electricity. 'My long-term vision is that all households could use solar energy and the government could concentrate on commercial supply,' he says. In the current Indonesian market of about 20,000 panels a year, companies are struggling to break even. Jonathan Hall, manager of BP Solar in Indonesia, believes the market for solar energy can be divided between 'high-volume single-panel systems and high-margin niche applications'. He says more sophisticated multi-panel units are efficient for supplying rural hospitals, telecommunication installations and village water systems. Companies expect both market segments to grow. With a solar home system retailing at about Dollars 600, the government and foreign donors are taking an interest. A Dollars 30m World Bank loan to provide 40,000 single-panel home installations may be forthcoming, following the recent completion of an Indonesian government Dollars 1.65m pilot scheme which supplied 3,000 homes. An even grander proposal, supported by the research and technology ministry, envisions a Dollars 450m project supplying a total of 50MW over six years to 1m households. But there are significant obstacles to these projects. Once dealer margins are included, the systems are barely affordable. The network of local co-operatives, through which revenue would be collected, is weak and problems of non-payment could arise. The government's project would require greater local content in the systems, which could lead to a loss of quality. Foreign companies are willing to invest in manufacturing facilities in Indonesia but only with guaranteed advance sales. In the higher-margin bracket, BP Solar's sales include a communication system for Java's railway network. R&amp;S is undertaking a Dollars 10m project this year to supply 30-panel systems to a further 270 health centres. Solar energy's long-term viability, however, cannot depend on a clutch of million-dollar, donor-financed, projects. Hall and de Lange agree more emphasis must be paid on product and market development and less to technological research. Some officials speculate the industry, in its early days dominated by significant oil conglomerates, might be better served by companies which could use the technology to broaden their market base, such as in the sale of cheap electronic appliances. However, where such companies have a stake - Philips, the Dutch electronics company, has a holding in R&amp;S and Siemens of Germany has a solar subsidiary  -the link between solar power and product development remains weak. The real battle may be to persuade companies that those without electricity represent a market at all.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gautam Chaudhuri] </F>   [Text] Disenchanted with the internecine squabble between  the two major Jharkhand groups, yet another militant outfit, the  Jharkhand Bahujan Party [JBP], has decided to take up the cause  of the Jharkhandis, preferring, however, to steer clear of the  political muddle for the present and pitching its campaign more  on ideological grounds.    Till now, the new group has limited its activity to the East  Singbhum district of Bihar, stretching from Chandil Dam to  Bahragora. The area has a population of about 1.5 million with a  vast majority of landless tribals.    The immediate plan is to use the base at East Singbhum as a  springboard to extend its activities to the entire Jharkhand  belt, in stages, to ensure that, in the future, the JBP can  challenge the other two major groups, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha  [JMM] (Shibu Soren) and the JMM (Mandi), on the strength of its  mass base.    While Mr Babloo Murmu is general secretary of the JBP, most  of its other leaders had been associated with the JMM (Soren) or  the JMM (Mandi).    According to information received in Calcutta, the JBP has  given an impassioned call for "Save Dhalbhumgarh", in an obvious  attempt to use the sentiments of the local inhabitants in its  favour. The campaign is against all kinds of pollution --  environmental, political, linguistic and cultural.    For this, the party is using folk mediums, like  jhumoor dances, and plays, to reach the people.    Causes dear to tribal life, like deforestation, are being  taken up, to ensure that the campaign embraces all aspects of  tribal life and culture.    The immediate take-off point of the agitation, when it  started about a year ago, was the environmental issue.  Agitations were periodically held in protest against the  pollution of the Subarnarekha river by the public sector  company, Hindusthan Copper.    Public protests were subsequently organized by the JBP  against the World Bank-aided Subarnarekha project. They  protested against the displacement of the local inhabitants for  the project.    The moderate success of the agitations has now emboldened  the  JBP to guide the campaign against economic exploitation of the  tribals in the mineral-rich East Singbhum.    It has taken up other causes on behalf of the tribals. It  protested against the widespread destruction of the forest at  Dalma, Lakhaisari and Paora.    This had disturbed the traditional abode of elephants and  had  forced them to come to the plains of West Bengal, Bihar and  Orissa.    The JBP is opposing the State Government's efforts to  construct irrigation canals in the tribal belt and,  particularly, the onslaught on traditional occupations of the  tribals. This is forcing them to leave their homes and take up  jobs for daily wages.    With the two major Jharkhand groups busy crossing swords  and,  seemingly, falling to the machinations of established parties,  the JBP campaign is said to be gradually gaining ground among  the people.    There is cause for comfort for the JBP because of what they  term "active support being received from a majority of  non-tribals as well".</p>

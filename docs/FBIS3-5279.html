			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 9" program] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Transport announced on 3 March that  Chrysler's Cherokee, a recreational four-wheel-drive vehicle,  would no longer require "vehicle-by-vehicle" inspection when it  is put on sale in Japan. This is part of efforts to increase  imports of U.S. automobiles into Japan.    In the Japan-U.S. economic talks, the United States  condemned  the Japanese system of inspecting imported cars as an invisible  trade barrier. Under the system, every single imported car is  inspected to make sure that it meets Japan's safety standards.</p>

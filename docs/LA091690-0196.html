			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING  </P> <P> The new and improved John Wayne Airport opens its doors officially today. The  focal point of the $310-million airport project is the new domed Thomas F.  Riley Terminal. It is 12 times as big as the old terminal, airport officials  say, adding that there will now be more daily flights, a wider selection of  destinations and the ability to handle double the number of passengers who flew  into Orange County in the past.  </P></p>

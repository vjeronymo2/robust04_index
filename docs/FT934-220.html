			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Management: Facing the future of choice - John Neill continues our series by advancing a model for forging closer ties with customers and suppliers Forecasting a decade forward was tough enough ten years ago, when the world was changing more slowly than it is now. The hazards of doing so can be demonstrated by recalling the management theories which were fashionable then but are rejected today. Mass production ideas, for example, have been replaced with lean thinking concepts. Forward-looking organisations are no longer driven by the 1980s mantras of financial engineering and earnings per share growth. It is worth remembering, too, that while the great academic thinkers advance our knowledge with new management ideas, some of their 'Eurekas' imply old messages masquerading in new language. In trying to crystallise my own thinking, I have started with the basic assumption that the company of tomorrow will have to delight customers faced with a bewildering array of choice. At the same time, they will have to survive in their chosen markets, all of which will be subject to virulent global competition. Work can now be done almost anywhere by almost anyone, heralding new waves of competitive intensity, unparalleled in the experience of many of today's leading companies. Three billion people have entered the global market economy since the demise of communism. Since I contend that our system of democracy and the market economy is in harmony with the human spirit, I expect to see these new market entrants aspire to our lifestyle. In many countries, employment costs are between one tenth and one hundredth of those in Europe and they are now producing high quality products with high technology and high productivity. How will we respond to this new tidal wave of competition? Our conventional way of working - which I would describe as Model A - equips us poorly. It is characterised by short-term, power-based relationships between the company and its stakeholders. Many companies adopt this approach, convinced that it is a superior way of securing competitive advantage. The company's ownership structure is a powerful determinant of its behaviour. Under Model A, the City can and will abandon publicly-quoted companies at the speed of light when they fail to meet the expectations which have been set for them or even if they exceed those expectations (in the belief that their performance is unsustainable). The City itself acknowledges the short-term nature of its approach. Companies striving to meet unrealistic expectations reinforce Model A behaviour in dealing with all their other stakeholders. It should be noted that many of the go-go companies of the 1980s have become the gone companies of the 1990s. During the years between 1986 and 1993, earnings in corporate UK grew by 30 per cent but dividends by more than l00 per cent. This does not lead to world class companies. Study after study demonstrates the vast gap in performance between UK companies and their world class competitors. Look also at the way in which some companies and their employees act. The annual knock down fight between employers and trade unions is fatally flawed because the latter too often demand shorter working weeks and more money without the productivity gains to pay for it. The reality is that the unions often win their short-term, power-based struggle but are then the first to blame the management, the company or the government when massive job losses follow some years later. There is strong evidence that more than 60 per cent of western manufacturing activity is non-value added. This waste cannot be eliminated in a model characterised by short-term, power-based relationships. Confrontation also dominates many company supplier relationships. The focus is on the piece price with the purchasing department taking a tough line and deliberately re-sourcing from time to time to demonstrate their prowess. In the motor industry the contrast with the Japanese - whose companies operate a 'shared destiny' relationship with their suppliers and lead the world in quality and productivity - is telling. There is, in my view, a superior model for long-term competitive advantage which will characterise tomorrow's companies. I will describe it as Model B. In this model, management will utilise and subscribe to the most appropriate philosophies to inspire all their stakeholders to engage in long-term relationships. This will be born out of the conviction that doing so offers a superior way of securing competitive advantage. This Model B company will strive to build lifetime relationships with its customers and realise that to do so, it will need to harness the intellectual energies and creativity of all its other stakeholders. Model B companies will strive to create a community of employee stakeholders who are committed to the company, the customer, quality and continuous improvement. The company of the future will view its suppliers as stakeholders and work with them in close partnership, continuously striving to make its activities from raw material to the end user, as lean and efficient as possible. This company will realise that the vitality of the communities in which it trades and from where it recruits future employees is crucial to its prosperity and will lead or participate in partnership with others in its community for mutual long-term benefit. This is not altruism or a return to the soggy, failed collectivist ideologies of socialism and communism. I am convinced it is the next step in the development of our capitalist system. In Unipart we are trying hard to transform ourselves into a Model B company. We know we have an enormous amount to do but to help us, we have established our own Unipart 'U' (University). Its mission is to inspire people to achieve world class levels of performance. We know we must change our ability to reskill our stakeholders if we are to stand any chance of arriving in the next century successfully. The author is group chief executive of Unipart</p>

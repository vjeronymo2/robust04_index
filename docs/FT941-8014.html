			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Unions 'a force for change' Unions are now 'a positive force for change' in making the UK industry globally competitive, a senior union leader said last night. But workers needed the legal right to workplace representation that their counterparts in Germany and Japan have if industry was to achieve a new partner-ship between capital and labour, said Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, the country's largest manufacturing union. 'A legal right to representation at the place of work would be a giant step towards eradicating the British disease instead of just suppressing the symptoms as successive governments have done. Good legislation is a catalyst for change,' Mr Jordan said in a speech in London. He emphasised that this was 'not the same thing as a right to recognition for unions'. But if that caused non-union employers to look at the thinking and practice of modern trade unionism, they 'would discover Britain's biggest industrial world-class companies are overwhelmingly unionised'.</p>

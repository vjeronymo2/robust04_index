			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW 'BENT';  </P> <P> STARK SHOT;  </P> <P> HARD-HITTING CONCENTRATION CAMP DRAMA DISPLAYS THE INTENSITY OF THE PLAZA  PLAYERS.  </P> <P> Lust, sex and love figure strongly in Martin Sherman's "Bent," but trust,  fidelity and betrayal combine to form the strongest images. First produced in  1979 and a 1980 Tony nominee as best drama, the play is Plaza Players' current  production.  </P> <P> It's also a fine example of the kind of intense, dramatic theater that often  distinguishes the Ventura-based company from other local community theater  groups. Sherman has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts,  but the subject matter here would guarantee the author and director Michael  Maynez places on Sen. Jesse Helms' hit list.  </P> <P> The play opens in a Berlin apartment; it's 1934, and the terrors of the Third  Reich are becoming increasingly apparent to members of the city's gay  community, including a small-time operator named Max and his lover, Rudy.  Homosexuals were one of the many groups singled out for persecution under  Hitler, and Max and Rudy quickly find themselves among the victims on June 24,  "The Night of the Long Knives."  </P> <P> By the beginning of the second act, Max is a prisoner at Dachau, disguised as a  Jew to avoid what he believes to be the even harsher treatment he'd receive if  his sexual preference was discovered by prison officials.  </P> <P> Whatever else its merits, "Bent" is not the feel-good hit of the fall season;  the subject matter is unremittingly grim, and the climax is inevitable.  </P> <P> It's not a very good play; it's heavy-handed in its polemics and awkwardly  crafted. The second act is virtually a two-man discourse, more reminiscent at  times of "Who's on First?" than of Samuel Beckett as the author probably  intended. And perhaps it depends too much on an audience that's already  sympathetic -- Sherman's description of the sex act is graphic enough to be  off-putting, though the most graphic scene of all is one of the play's most  inspired moments.  </P> <P> "Bent" is an important play, however; it's important in its serious treatment  of a formerly taboo subject and as a pioneering effort to bring such subject  matter to Broadway. Noble intentions were what probably earned it that Tony  nomination; the more uplifting "Children of a Lesser God" won the award.  </P> <P> The tragedy is not always deeply dramatic: The first act plays more like a  farce until a pair of SS officers shows up to disturb the mood, and there's  some ironic wit in the prison scenes as well -- humor that helps round out the  characters and makes their fate even more disturbing.  </P> <P> Hugh McManigal is impressive as Max, a role originated by Ian McKellen in  London and developed by Richard Gere when the play moved to Broadway. As the  effeminate dancer, Rudy, Larry Gund creates an amusing character who takes on  deeper dimensions as the play progresses. James D. Thompson plays Horst, a  prisoner who does not deny his homosexuality; and Alan Price plays Greta, a  straight man who headlines a drag show in which Rudy occasionally dances.  </P> <P> Some of the supporting characters are played with less distinction, though  Sherman's stark dialogue doesn't really invite or encourage richly dramatic  readings. Clipped delivery, on the other hand, sometimes sounds a bit  ludicrous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> "Bent" plays at 8 p.m. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 24 at the  Plaza Players Theater, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Old Town Livery courtyard) in  Ventura. Tickets are $6 on Wednesdays, $7.50 on Fridays and $8.50 on Saturdays.  For reservations or information, call (805) 643-9460.  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France seeks to stem US cultural avalanche FRANCE brought its campaign to save Europe from Hollywood to the European Parliament in Strasbourg last night, and it was quite a show, writes David Gardner in Strasbourg. The Euro-MPs suspended their plenary session to flock into one of the most crowded meetings in the city's recent memory. It was hosted by Mr Alain Carignon, France's communications minister. But the real draw was the constellation of French cinema stars he had in tow: a cast including Gerard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, and the director Claude Berri. Mr Carignon pleaded for audiovisual trade to be taken out of Gatt's Uruguay Round negotiations, to preserve Europe's 'cultural specificity' and diversity, in the face of the Hollywood avalanche burying European, especially French, cinema. In 1979, US films accounted for 31 per cent of cinema ticket receipts in France, whereas in 1989 the US take was 57 per cent. 'French films work,' a French Gatt negotiator said, 'but they are only attractive within a system which allows them to survive'. France wants to be able to continue subsidising its cinema, and to require its national TV stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made programmes. EC legislation recommends that member states put on a majority of European programmes, and EC trade negotiators reckon that getting some form of 'cultural specificity' enshrined in Gatt will impede unilateral sanctions from the US. Mr Carignon's companions were having none of this. 'We should not allow the Americans to deal with us the way they dealt with the redskins,' Mr Berri exclaimed. 'If the Gatt accords succeed as currently framed, the European cultural identity has had it,' he added, using a slightly earthier verb.</p>

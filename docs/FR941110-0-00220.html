			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We already require the State to transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid residents to another facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in immediate jeopardy terminations. In fact, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid residents, the State is paid up to 30 days of FFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the safe and orderly transfer to another facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities after termination. We have not accepted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment that the State be held liable for its action during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such transfer. A State's liability should come under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purview of State law. We have no statutory basis to hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States liable for such actions. Therefore, we have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included this provision in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, representing a State Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Aging, stated that the language in the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding transfer of residents is inadequate and provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of minimum requirements for States. The twelve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements listed have all been covered by the preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters except for the following two instances. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter recommends that a facility that is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated be monitored daily and also recommends that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing counseling for residents include follow-up post-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer counseling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the suggestion that facilities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the process of being terminated be monitored daily is well-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intentioned, the specifics of transfer plans are under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purview of the States. We are not mandating that the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take specific action other than that already required and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unlikely they could implement this suggestion given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty of how long the process will take and how much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding they will have available. Regarding the suggestion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that follow-up post-transfer counseling be provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents, again it is the State that determines which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services are provided for transfer of residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Informal Dispute Resolution (&sect;488.331)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble to the proposed rule, we specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asked for public comment about the desirability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of establishing a formal conflict resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process whereby providers dissatisfied with survey findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could request a review of the deficiencies after the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and prior to the formal administrative and judicial review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes. We also acknowledged the existence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous informal opportunities providers currently have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the survey process to challenge survey findings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the official deficiency statement, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving the official deficiency statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``conflict'' resolution has been changed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``dispute'' resolution in this final rule to be consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with terminology used in the Administrative Dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1990 and Executive Order 12778,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which encourage such a process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters believe that a dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is necessary. A few do not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The majority of commenters in favor of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispute resolution process contend that there is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no means for providers to resolve conflicts with survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings short of costly litigation. Most say that they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either not afforded the informal opportunities to resolve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflicts to which we referred in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, or that the outcome of those opportunities is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predetermined and, therefore, of little value. Also, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cite the ADRA of 1990 and Executive Order 12778 which (they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim) direct Federal agencies to develop dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms in an effort to reduce costly and lengthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litigation. A few commenters believe such a process could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also serve as a means to measure surveyor quality assurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of comments supporting a process suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA mandate an informal dispute resolution process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while less than one-third preferred that HCFA mandate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal one. Several commenters suggested that HCFA adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current dispute resolution process of a specific State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for example, Ohio or Louisiana. These commenters contend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that existing programs in specific States have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful in resolving conflicts about survey findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Others suggested that HCFA require that each State establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State-specific process, in order to give States the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to work within their existing administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework. Commenters proposed that since most States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already have some type of dispute resolution process, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need only to require that it be formalized; in other words,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in written form and publicly recognized. Commenters also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that HCFA establish one process to be used by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. These comments were presumably based on the belief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a single process mandated by HCFA is the most effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means to ensure that consistent opportunities are offered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a consistent manner to all nursing home providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissatisfied with survey findings. The proposals we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received for a single process varied in extent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sophistication and included suggestions that the dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution process:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Offer resolution opportunities at specific times during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey (for example, conduct daily exit conferences or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicate at the time a deficiency is identified), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cease offering opportunities beyond specific events (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, after the exit conference or after the issuance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deficiency statement);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide multi-tiered opportunities that could include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring of corrections and mandatory revisits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

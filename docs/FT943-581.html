			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 19,500 to five-month low Stocks plummeted in thin trading to their lowest levels since April as arbitrageurs unwound positions following a plunge in index futures prices, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average fell 345.47 to finish at 19,468.89, the first close below support at 19,500 since April 4. After reaching the day's high of 19,822.16 during the morning, the index declined to a low of 19,404.18 in the final half-hour of trading. On September 19, when the Nikkei 225 last approached the 19,500 mark, public funds moved in to arrest the decline. This time, public funds, comprising state run postal savings and insurance, seemed to remain on the sidelines. Volume was an estimated 231m shares, little changed from Monday's 239.41m. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 22.46 to 1,562.75, while the second section lost 5.59 at 2,231.43 in volume estimated at 5.99m shares. Losers surged ahead of winners by 769 to 227, with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE Nikkei 50 index gained 2.63 at 1,279.43. As on Monday, most traders stayed on the sidelines, reflecting uncertainties surrounding the US-Japan framework talks and Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. Yesterday was also the last trading day for delivery of September index futures. The thinness of the market made it vulnerable to a wave of afternoon selling that began with futures traders closing positions. The ensuing decline in futures prices triggered dumping of speculative stocks and unwinding of arbitrage positions. The resulting price slide was accelerated by index-linked selling and rumours that Morgan Stanley was cutting the weighting of Japanese stocks in its portfolio. Japan Telecom, being closely watched ahead of next month's listing of Japan Tobacco, fell Y30,000 to another low of Y4.02m. Other telecommunications stocks were mixed. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y1,000 to Y884,000, but DDI, which lost Y8,000 on Monday, rallied Y7,000 to Y878,000. Steelmakers suffered losses in some of the heaviest trading of the day. Nippon Steel, the volume leader, edged down Y2 to Y385. Kobe Steel slipped Y5 to Y326, Kawasaki Steel lost Y6 to Y432 and NKK ticked down Y1 to Y289. Electricals also came under fire. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30 to Y1,600, Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,040, Hitachi Y10 to Y955 and Oki Electric Industrial Y5 to Y755. In Osaka, the OSE average slid 257.66 to 21,843.87 in volume of 36.3m shares. Roundup Lassitude afflicted several of the region's equity markets, as investors sat on their hands in advance of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. However, there were one or two winners. HONG KONG closed mildly weaker in drowsy trading, the Hang Seng index easing 33.39 to 9,610.24 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.50bn to HKDollars 2.85bn. HSBC, the most active issue, lost 25 cents at HKDollars 87.50. It was followed by Hongkong Land, down 10 cents at HKDollars 19.35, while Hong Kong Telecom was 10 cents off at HKDollars 15.50. Sino Land, the most active of the new index entries on Monday, retreated 12.50 cents to HKDollars 8.625, and Johnson Electric declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 21.50. SYDNEY was nervous about interest rates as the All Ordinaries index dipped 16.2 to 2,013.8. Resources issues were dragged down by falls in the golds sector following a bullion price decline in New York, and by lower commodity prices in the US. The gold shares index dropped 46.5, or nearly 2 per cent, to 2,343.8. Newcrest Mining lost 29 cents at ADollars 6.50 and Placer Pacific 5 cents at ADollars 3.93. SINGAPORE took a last minute dive and the Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 9.97 to close at 2,289.84. The fall was caused mainly by a loss of 60 cents in Cycle &amp; Carriage to SDollars 12.80, and a 30-cent retreat to SDollars 11 by Sembawang Corp. Before that, investors seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve meeting could yield at most a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates, and that this would be acceptable. MANILA combined fears of another rise in US interest rates with worries about delays in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which could put more pressure on the Philippine government deficit. The composite index ended 9.93 down at 2,934.27. BOMBAY, also risk-averse, fell on fears of a plague attack in western India. Following Monday's halt in trading, the BSE 30-share index lost 51.97 at 4,444.56. SEOUL registered a strong rebound in blue chips as the composite index finished 6.89 better at a new closing high of 1,052.01. In spite of the rise, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 452 to 367. KARACHI, similarly, majored on index heavyweights as the KSE 100 index rose 17.48 to 2,237.65. Investors took positions in energy and synthetics, said a dealer.</p>

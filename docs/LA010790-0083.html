			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CYPRESS GETS 500TH VICTORY BY DEFEATING GOLDEN WEST  </P> <P> Cypress College had a comfortable lead, then survived a couple of scares to  defeat Golden West, 75-69, in an Orange Empire Conference basketball game  Saturday at Cypress.  </P> <P> It was the 500th victory in the 24-year history of Cypress' program. Cypress  has a record of 500-223.  </P> <P> The Chargers led at the half, 41-32, and increased their lead to 49-38 with  about 15 minutes left.  </P> <P> But Golden West was able to cut the lead to 53-52 with 11:10 remaining despite  playing only seven players because of illness.  </P> <P> But the Chargers then went on a 9-0 run to lead, 62-52.  </P> <P> "When were were up by 10 a second time I thought we were in pretty good shape,"  Cypress Coach Don Johnson said. "But we took some poor shots and didn't have  the boards to back up the misses. When you're up by that many points you need  to work to take better shots."  </P> <P> Golden West, which outrebounded Cypress, 42-39, drew close again when Ric Van  Scoyce made a three-pointer, was fouled, and made the free throw to complete a  rare four-point play, and cut the lead to 62-56 with 6:18 left. Van Scoyce  added another basket a minute later and the lead dwindled to 64-61.  </P> <P> But Cypress' Vince Hizon made a layup, and teammate Brian Kenney twice made  some impressive moves to the basket for open layups and Cypress led, 70-64,  with two minutes left.  </P> <P> Hizon led Cypress (16-3 overall, 2-0 in conference play) with 20 points. Kenney  and Eric Pauley each added 12 for Cypress.  </P> <P> Golden West came into the game with a four-game winning streak but the Rustlers  were without sophomore forward Kevin Andersen, who is averaging 13 points a  game. He missed the game because of illness. Several Golden West players have  been ill this week and Golden West Coach Jim Greenfield said he had only four  players healthy enough to practice Friday.  </P> <P> Center Alex Kreps replaced Andersen in the lineup, playing almost 38 minutes,  including all of the second half. He finished with a team-high 19 points and 12  rebounds. Craig Rice had 17 points and Van Scoyce had 14 for Golden West (14-7,  1-1).  </P> <P> Orange Coast 65, Fullerton 55 -- Alan Schlines scored 23 points and had 10  rebounds to lead host Orange Coast (12-5, 1-1). Chip Hanlon added 14 points and  seven rebounds for OCC, which broke a four-game losing streak. Darryl Griffith  had 14 points and Roy Joseph 12 for Fullerton (8-10, 0-2).  </P> <P> Riverside College 104, Saddleback 83 -- Xavier Edison scored 22 points off the  bench to lead visiting Riverside. Corey Cothrine also came off the bench to  score 16 for the Tigers (12-9, 1-1). Charles Lockard led Saddleback (7-11, 0-2)  with 29 points and seven rebounds.  </P></p>

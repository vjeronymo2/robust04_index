			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: A first class 'School for Wives' - Theatre At the still core of Jonathan Kent's excellent new Almeida production of Moliere's often uproarious 1662 comedy, The School for Wives, is a beautifully tranquil performance by the young actress Emma Fielding. She plays Agnes, the girl whom the cynical middle-aged Arnolphe has had reared in perfect ignorance. He believes that most women are successfully adulterous because they are clever; and that he will avoid becoming a cuckold by marrying this girl, of whose lack of cleverness he is assured. But Agnes, from her window, has seen Horace; the two have fallen in love; and . .  . Agnes is not a large role, but Fielding invests her with wonderful radiance and simplicity. Strength of character, too. ('You can keep someone ignorant but you can't keep them stupid,' Fielding has remarked about the role in a radio interview.) When she argues with Arnolphe, her calm common sense has more force than his energetic duplicity. We are made to feel powerfully that his selfish schemes are a crime against nature itself. Standing wide-eyed and speechless at her window (a position which Jonathan Kent makes the chief motif of his production), she becomes a symbol of true innocence. All those who loved Fielding's performance as the child prodigy in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia this year should see her in this role; and one hopes to see her soon in larger parts. But so much about this production is marvellous. It is a pleasure, even before the start, just to look at Peter J. Davison's set. The little French 17th-century two-storey house at its centre, and all that surrounds it, are a precis of old Paris, in ravishing sub-terracotta hues. Peter Mumford's lighting makes the different times of day register to fine effect - and, when rain falls (before the play and throughout the penultimate scene), that looks gorgeous too. The play's main role, and the leading agent of its comedy, is Arnolphe. He is a hilarious oxymoron: a clever fool, a daft cynic, a self-defeating self-server. Ian McDiarmid (who is, with Kent, the Almeida's joint artistic director) catches all this in a performance of terrific virtuoso energy. His dynamic range, the musicality of his pacing, the inventive characterfulness with which he listens: these become lynchpins of the whole production. A pity that, as the play proceeds, he goes over the top a few times - notably when overcome by happy startlement as he listens to Horace's trusting plan to place Agnes back in his (Arnolphe's) own power. But he always shows that Arnolphe's character is essentially destructive, and he often makes this funny - as when, unwittingly, he strangles his two servants; or when he bangs his own knees together in a spasm of rage. Kent uses the Richard Wilbur translation, a perfect example of how to make rhyming couplets (pentameters) wittily urbane without milking laughs from the rhymes themselves and without sacrificing the sense of basic good manners that underlies the play. And Kent's direction brings out all the panache and brio in the play, which runs without an interval for 90 minutes. If you know Wycherley's The Country Wife (1675), a more thoroughly funny play, you can see how much it takes from The School for Wives, but Kent shows admirably that Moliere's play is actually the less cynical and more humane of the two. All the supporting roles (with the exception of the notary, overdone by Charles Lewsen) are delightfully played. Perhaps my favourite feature of all is Carol Macready's performance as the selfish maid Georgette; I love the way a scheming smile gradually illumines her fat, silly face, and the slatternly way she uses a Wolverhampton accent. But no, perhaps my favourite feature is the thick-rimmed pair of lunettes that Davison has given her to wear. They come straight out of period French theatre designs, by the way, and they perfectly give Georgette an air both blinkered and goggling. At the Almeida Theatre, N1, 071-226-7432. Until January.

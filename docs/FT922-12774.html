			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Digging a path out of the trough: Signs of hope for construction equipment About six months' supply of hydraulic excavators is piling up outside factories and at dealers' yards worldwide, according to the UK head of one international supplier of construction equipment. The stocks of unsold equipment bear witness to a global recession in the construction equipment industry. For a sector that has always found it difficult to face head-on the problems of overcapacity, they provide a counterpoint to the ballyhoo of the world's largest construction equipment exhibition, Bauma, in Munich last week. 'Last year was bad for the industry. All our weaknesses have been exposed. Apart from Germany, it went all the way through the system,' says Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive of VME Group, the big Swedish/US producer. VME and other big suppliers agree that, over the past two years, reunified Germany has been a lifesaver for the industry. On the back of eastern Germany's need to develop its infrastructure, reunified Germany now accounts for 37 per cent of the western European equipment market, against 18 per cent for west Germany in 1989, said London-based Corporate Intelligence Group recently. As German growth begins to level off, the first sparks of life elsewhere are beginning to appear. Last week, the salesmen at Bauma were desperately fanning the flames. Inquiries from non-German visitors to the stands were higher than expected. The result was a mood of hope, rather than the expectancy that characterised Bauma in 1989, when many markets boomed. Since then, recession has spread from Australasia to North America, the UK and more recently continental Europe. On top of that has come the collapse of housing and construction markets. In the UK, says a Scottish equipment buyer, 'you can virtually name your price'. In the US, the Illinois-based analyst Manfredi &amp; Associates estimates that 1991 was the second-worst year on record. Outside Germany, European markets slipped badly last year, and business conditions in Scandinavia are dire. The collapse of communism has converted the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries into long-term prospects but snuffed out immediate opportunities. Even in Japan, equipment sales are falling. The hydraulic excavator market, the largest in the world, is running at around 45,000 units a year against the normal 60,000, says Mr H. Jay Takahashi, an international sales manager at Hitachi Construction Machinery. 'Everything went down right after the political scandals,' he says. Overall, the world construction equipment industry lost money heavily last year  - the leader, Caterpillar, suffered a Dollars 404m (Pounds 234m) loss, its first since 1984. A number of companies are in trouble, although only the handful of publicly quoted suppliers such as Tenneco, currently restructuring its JI Case subsidiary, are forced to disclose their difficulties. On the whole, however, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the industry is to blame for its problems. Well-used to roller-coaster trading conditions, it is financially weakened by overcapacity of perhaps 20 per cent, while its structural fragmentation leads to duplication of effort. Big companies such as Caterpillar, VME and Case have been forced to rationalise in the recession. Cat has shed 2,400 white-collar jobs in the past year, and has been in an acrimonious labour dispute that now appears to be ending after efforts by mediators to restore peace. The rationalisations are partially frustrated, however, by an unwillingness among smaller European producers to give up their independence or forge links with competitors to rationalise manufacturing capacity and products. And while German reunification has kept the industry going over the past year, it may also encourage smaller German beneficiaries to defer strategic decisions which could collectively lift prices and profits. The larger companies, meanwhile, have realised that restructuring and cross-border co-operation must continue as each pursues the same objective  -a viable presence in the world's three main markets of North America, western Europe and Japan. An announcement may be made soon on the most important deal being negotiated, a three-way European joint venture between Fiat of Italy, Hitachi and Deere of the US. But it is rumoured Deere has pulled out, unhappy about distribution arrangements for the backhoe loader it was due to contribute to the venture. Of other deals in the pipeline, the most important involves the future of O&amp;K, the German construction and mining equipment subsidiary of Hoesch, the German steel group being taken over by its domestic rival Krupp. Observers believe that Mannesmann Demag of Germany is the strongest contender for O&amp;K's loss-making construction equipment side, although other potential purchasers such as VME have been mentioned. The third big question mark surrounds Clark Equipment's lift truck business, up for sale since the autumn with a product range that could tempt European or Korean rivals. Such deals might help the industry avoid over-producing when next it hits a downturn. Meanwhile, the market outlook is beginning to improve, albeit somewhat patchily. Mr Glen Barton, Caterpillar group president, says there are early indications the US market is looking up, and last week's Fed fund rates reduction should help the housing market. The projected rate of recovery for the US economy is slower than normal, good year'. Elsewhere, the improving economies of Latin America, excluding Brazil, are the only growth spot other than Germany. Most of Europe remains in recession, although Mr Barton says the Italian market is 'reasonable' and sees 'a little bit of stability in Spain'. For many at Bauma, though, the immediate question was how long can the German boom last  - growth is already slowing after the surge of equipment buying last year. Mr Michael Michaelis, export manager at Liebherr, the German-Swiss producer which has been one of the leading beneficiaries of reunification, is untroubled: 'The German boom will end, but by then other markets will have picked up.' The early signs suggest he could be right.</p>

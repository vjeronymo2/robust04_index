			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COLD WAR IS NOT OVER,' BUSH ADVISER CAUTIONS;  </P> <P> SCOWCROFT SAYS NEW ADMINISTRATION IS SKEPTICAL OF SOVIET 'PEACE OFFENSIVE,'  WILL WARN ALLIES  </P> <P> Declaring "the Cold War is not over," President Bush's national security  adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Sunday that the new Administration views Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "peace offensive" with deep skepticism.  </P> <P> Scowcroft said that Gorbachev's announced plan to cut Soviet military forces  and military spending is driven by "awesome" economic and political problems at  home and is at least partly inspired by a desire to drive a wedge between the  United States and Western Europe.  </P> <P> He said that one of the Bush Administration's first foreign policy priorities  will be to chill the euphoria created by Gorbachev's initiatives and persuade  the European allies not to be blinded by "wishful thinking" about Soviet  intentions.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's moves represent "a recognition on his part that he badly needs a  period of stability, if not definite improvement in the relationship, so he can  face the awesome problem he has at home of trying to restructure that economy.  That's his basic objective," Scowcroft said.  </P> <P> "I think, also, he's interested in making trouble within the Western alliance,  and I think he believes that the best way to do it is a peace offensive, rather  than to bluster the way some of his predecessors have."  </P> <P> In his first television interview in the new Administration, on ABC's "This  Week With David Brinkley," the former Air Force general gave a sweeping  overview of the foreign affairs challenges facing Bush in his first months in  office.  </P> <P> Scowcroft said the Bush Administration will follow up on the Reagan  Administration's opening to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser  Arafat, although he showed lingering skepticism about Arafat's motives in  stating that he has renounced terrorism and accepts Israel's right to exist.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that the important thing is to try to probe and find out what  Arafat has in mind and how sincere, in fact, this conversion is," he said.  </P> <P> Scowcroft opposed an early meeting between Arafat and incoming Secretary of  State James A. Baker III, throwing a damper on a flurry of Sunday press reports  from the Middle East that spoke of efforts to arrange such a meeting.  </P> <P> A state-run newspaper in Abu Dhabi said that Egypt has invited Baker to visit  the region to pave the way for an international peace conference and meet with  Arafat during the visit. A Saudi Arabian newspaper reported that consultations  are under way to prepare for a Baker-Arafat meeting in Tunis in mid-February.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arafat Meeting 'Premature'  </P> <P> "I think it would be premature to meet at such a high level until we have a  better indication of where Mr. Arafat may be going," Scowcroft replied when  asked specifically about the subject.  </P> <P> Scowcroft also said that the United States will conduct a deliberate review of  defense and arms control policy before returning to strategic arms reduction  talks (START) with the Soviet Union. Bush will not automatically adopt the  Reagan Administration's negotiating positions, he said.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to slow down or delay . . ," he said, "but they're going to  be our START talks, our proposals, and we have to make sure that, in fact, they  are ours and we're comfortable with them."  </P> <P> Scowcroft also deplored the spread of chemical and biological weapons as a  "very, very serious problem," but he admitted that he is not optimistic that it  can be halted.  </P> <P> "It is a problem akin in its scope to that of nuclear proliferation because  these weapons, especially in city attacks and in anti-population attacks, can  be every bit as devastating as nuclear weapons, and they are much harder to  control because the plants to produce them are, in many cases, like  pharmaceutical plants, like insecticide plants. It's a terrible problem," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Libya Chemical Plant  </P> <P> He would not say whether the United States is seriously considering a military  strike to destroy a suspected chemical weapons plant under construction in  Libya. "I'm not about to make that choice now," he said.  </P> <P> Scowcroft also said he is not optimistic about prospects in El Salvador, where  the democratically elected president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, is in failing  health and the violent right wing is experiencing a resurgence.  </P> <P> He said the situation in the small Central American country is analogous to  that of 1981, when the Marxist-led insurgency began what it called a "final  offensive" toward overthrowing the government that was met by bloody repression  from the right.  </P> <P> Scowcroft's remarks about Gorbachev's skillful manipulation of opinion in  Western Europe were echoed on the same television program by Democratic Sen.  Sam Nunn of Georgia, the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee.  </P> <P> Nunn said Gorbachev's "rhetoric" would likely amplify calls in the United  States and Europe for a reduction in defense spending and cuts in troop levels  stationed on European soil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call for Alertness  </P> <P> "Gorbachev may unmake NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) if we're not  alert as to what our future holds and if we're not certain that the (Soviet)  forces have been reduced before we start relaxing in the alliance," Nunn said.  </P> <P> Nunn, whose committee this week begins confirmation hearings for former Sen.  John Tower as secretary of defense, said that Tower is in for "some tough  questions" about his personal life and possible conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> Since leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower has represented half a dozen major  defense contractors as a Washington lobbyist and adviser. Questions also have  been raised, although no charges have been proven, about alleged drinking and  womanizing by Tower.  </P> <P> "We are checking into a lot of allegations floating around," Nunn said. "We're  checking into the conflict of interest." But he indicated that Tower is "well  qualified" and said he expects him to be confirmed.  </P></p>

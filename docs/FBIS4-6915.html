			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Take Global View of Unemployment Problem"] </F>   [Text] If there are two key words in the current world  economy, they are "competitiveness" and "employment." How will  the unemployment problem of 35 million people in the leading  industrial nations be dealt with? The labor ministers conference  (employment summit) in Detroit of the Group of Seven leading  industrial nations agreed to act in concert to create jobs.    We appreciate their having set up a plan to create jobs  through healthy macroeconomic policies, market opening, and  technological innovations, and by rejectiving employment  protectionaism, a trap which we tend to fall into because of our  eagerness to protect our own employment potential.    The employment problem is casting a dark shadow across the  economies of leading industrial nations. Although the U.S.  economy is on the road to recovery, it is not breaking free from  a limiting "growth in joblessness." The recovery of the U.S.  economy has begun with rationalization of companies that focused  on downsizing the work force. However, the shift to new job  areas is not progressing smoothly, and people continue to  experience job dissatisfaction brought on by lower real wages.    The countries of the European Union (EU) which have  double-digit unemployment are burdened by structural  unemployment among youthful laborers. With the influx of  refugees, the unemployment problem is acute politically. The  situation is one of "today's joblessness, tomorrow's  lawlessness" (INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE). Although Japan's  unemployment rate is low, with adjustments in employment gaining  momentum, employment practices put in place since World War II  are being undermined.    What each leading industrial country is being confronted  with  by the employment issue is a result of changes in the world  economy. In the globalization of the world economy, the  countries of Central and South America and Asia have entered on  stage as exporting countries by maintaining a manufacturing base  with low wages. This is linked to a structure of excess supply  and capacity among the leading industrial nations. While the  economic development of the emerging countries widens the  horizon of world markets, it threatens unemployment among the  leading industrial nations.    The danger underlying this situation is that we fall into a  protectionist trap in order to maintain employment levels and to  enhance competitiveness. For that reason we appreciate and value  the attitude of the leading industrial nations in cooperation to  solve the employment problem.    No doubt the key to expanding employment is macro economic  policy. At the employment summit, expectations were in  particular focused on Japan's expansion of domestic demand. To  stimulate domestic demand is Japan's own choice and it is also  tied to alleviating the worldwide employment problem.  Unfortunately, only the minister of labor attended the  employment summit; the minister of finance and minister of  international trade and industry decided not to attend. If it  was out of fear of pressure on Japan to increase domestic  consumption and to open Japan's markets, it was too makeshift an  approach. But had it been decided that the employment problem  should be left to the responsibility of the Labor Ministry, that  would lack in economic common sense.    That the employment summit was not quite satisfactory is  probably because the cooperative action was left to the  responsibility of each individual country. They could have  exchanged ideas further on the concept of a "global new deal" to  create jobs sponsored by U.S. labor unions.    In the post-Cold War world economy, if we are to eliminate  the employment crisis as the topic of greatest common interest,  we must doggedly hasten to write a global prescription to effect  a cure.</p>

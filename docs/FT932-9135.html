			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / No regrets as British watch ERM turmoil SPAIN'S troubles in the European exchange rate mechanism have prompted a ripple of satisfaction among British industrialists. Seven months of lower interest rates, a competitive pound and signs of economic recovery have left the ERM with few friends among businessmen. 'I'm happy that Britain got out of the ERM when it did,' says Mr Bill Ebbert, chairman and managing director of the Vauxhall car group. 'The devaluation has made our plants considerably more competitive. I would not jump back in again if it meant the pound moving up to some arbitrarily high level.' Many company directors - even those who originally supported ERM membership  -believe re-entry is a long way off. The chairman of a large retailer says: 'The problem about the ERM was that it was always fatuous to base the country's economic policy around the single goal of bringing down inflation. A broader perspective is required, which could involve a set of detailed policies for a range of industrial sectors.' Even the Confederation of British Industry, a former ERM enthusiast, now doubts the merits of an early re-entry. 'I think it is fair to say that re-entry to the ERM is not our number one priority,' says Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of CBI forecasts. 'Our view is we should not rejoin the ERM until certain conditions are met, namely more convergence between the economies of Europe and further German rate cuts.' Mr Michael Atkinson, finance director of Oxley, a small electronics company, says: 'We haven't found the floating exchange rate a particular headache. We can take precautious by buying currencies on the forward market to cover certain large transactions.' But amid the enthusiasm for a flexible exchange rate, one or two voices stand out. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of the UK arm of Nissan, the Japanese car maker, says: 'Business needs a stable exchange rate, but how you achieve this is up to the government and the central bank.' 'We are not leaping up and down with joy about being out of the ERM,' says the finance director of a scientific instruments exporter. 'There was a certain stability there. All we have had now is a short-term boost. Although rates were perhaps too high, a stable environment is obviously the best one to do business in.' Michael Skapinker adds: Spain's share of the UK package tour market is expected to grow as a result of the peseta devaluation - even though the effect will not feed through to holiday brochure prices until summer 1994.</p>

Frau Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the SPD's financial  spokeswoman,  said that if the German parliament was unable to insist on  eliminating Britain's entire rebate, "then at least the German  contribution must cease."    The SPD, hoping to turn the issue into a major bone of  contention in an election year, argues that the costs of German  reunification have reduced the nation's relative wealth in  Europe.    "We have moved from second to sixth place, on a level with  Britain. At the same time, we pay the lion's share of Western  aid to East Europe and the former Soviet Union," Frau  Matthaeus-Maier said.    "It was a serious omission by Chancellor Kohl that he did  not  negotiate away Britain's rebate at the 1992 Edinburgh summit."    Herr Theo Waigel, finance minister, under intense pressure  to  act, agreed to demand a review of Germany's EC contributions,  which came to 9.14 billion [U.S. trillion] pounds last year,  including 460 million pounds to help fund the EC rebate to  Britain.    A Finance Ministry official said yesterday there were  constant discussions in the EC over reducing German  contributions, "but Frau Matthaeus-Maier must remember that her  popular demand must be politically feasible .    "We must not forget that any such changes are subject to a  unanimous vote -- and that includes Britain's agreement."    With opinion polls showing a steadily decreasing enthusiasm  for European monetary union, Bonn could be forced into taking a  tough stand on the issue.    Even Bavaria's Christian Social Union, sister party to Herr  Kohl's Christian Democrats, has expressed reservations about  European political and economic union, and lent its backing to  the SPD's call for an end to the British rebate, in a rare  example of cross-party unanimity.</p>

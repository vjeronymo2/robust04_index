In the 12-month period ending July 1993, there  were 171 new cases among women, an increase of 22 percent over  the previous year. Among men, 1,408 new cases were recorded, a  rise of only 8 percent.    The figures do not, however, suggest that an epidemic of  heterosexual AIDS is yet under way. Only nine women are recorded  as having caught AIDS from a partner in the UK outside the  high-risk groups, against ten in the previous 12 months. The  great majority of sexually transmitted cases were caught from  partners abroad (76) or by drug users sharing needles (32). The  total of AIDS cases in the UK since reporting began in 1982 has  reached 7,842 (7,264 male and 578 female), of whom 4,893 have  died.</p>

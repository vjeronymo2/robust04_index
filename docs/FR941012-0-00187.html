			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal regulations for highway routing of Class 7 (radioactive) materials, 49 CFR 397, subpart D, remain unchanged by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State and Indian Tribe Jurisdiction Over Routing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States and Indian tribes are required to comply with this regulation if they impose routing designations for NRHM. If a political subdivision of a State wishes to impose NRHM routing designations, the State is required to ensure that the political subdivision follows these regulations, including coordination with and approval by the routing agency designated by the Governor. The State is responsible for all NRHM routing designations that local jurisdictions establish, including resolving any disputes between local jurisdictions. The regulation requires the States and Indian tribes to designate routing agencies who will be responsible for ensuring that all NRHM routing designations are made in accordance, and substantively comply, with the procedural requirements of the Federal standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for States and Indian Tribes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Federal Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation establishes standards which closely follow the specific requirements of 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b) and include procedures for States and Indian tribes to follow if they impose routing designations for NRHM transportation by motor carriers. The Federal standards provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; consultation with other State, local, and tribal governments; through routing; reasonable time to reach agreement between affected States or Indian tribes; not unduly burdening commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing; reasonable routes to terminals; State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors to consider.'' The list of ``factors to consider'' which States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use in regulating routing is contained in &sect;397.71 of this final rule and includes the factors required by 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)(1)(I) and additional factors addressing climatic conditions, congestion, and accident analysis. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. &sect;5112(b)(2), the FHWA will not assign any specific weight to be given by the States or Indian tribes in considering the factors. Additionally, in analyzing these factors, the States or Indian tribes shall use the most current version of ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous Materials'' or an equivalent routing analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Public Information and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5112(c) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically update and publish a list of current hazardous materials highway routing designations. Accordingly, the FHWA will compile and publish annually in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a listing of all hazardous materials routing designations. The FHWA will also maintain a list of all current designations, including additions and changes, and provide this information, upon request, to interested parties. To comply with this requirement, the FHWA is, through this regulation, requiring States and Indian tribes to initially submit, to the FHWA, information on all the existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries. After the initial submission, any new or changed NRHM routing designation shall be submitted to the FHWA 60 days after the routing designation takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use methods such as maps, listings, road signs, or some combination of these measures as may be needed to adequately inform the public of their NRHM routing designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

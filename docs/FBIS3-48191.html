"I will do all I can to restore the suspended bilateral  relations at an early date and promote new relationship based on  the principles of reciprocity and equality," Lin said on arrival  at Kimpo Airport.    He said closer cooperation between the two countries will  serve mutual interests and also contribute to stability and  prosperity in Asia.    South Korea and Taiwan severed formal diplomatic ties in  August 1992 when Seoul entered ambassadorial relations with  mainland China.    Late last year, the two countries agreed to exchange  semiofficial resident missions. Seoul opened its mission in  Taipei on last Nov. 25.</p>

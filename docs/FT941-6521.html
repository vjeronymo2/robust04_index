			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Billiton hit by restructuring costs Restructuring costs at Billiton, the mining and metals business within the Royal Dutch/Shell group, sent its net loss up last year from Dollars 75m in 1992 to Dollars 142m. Gencor of South Africa is at present negotiating to buy Billiton. During 1993 Billiton decided to close underground mining operations at Les Mines Selbaie in Canada and to shut its Toronto office. Several downstream businesses in the Netherlands were sold in line with Billiton's strategy to focus on mining and resource operations. There was an operating loss of Dollars 17m for 1993 with first-half profits eroded by weak metal prices. The mining business suffered an operating loss of Dollars 14m, downstream operations lost Dollars 6m and miscellaneous items, such as currency exchange losses and head office costs, accounted for a Dollars 15m loss. The marketing and trading business made a profit of Dollars 18m. Gencor announced last May it hoped to reach agreement to buy the Billiton assets by the end of 1993 but the negotiations proved more difficult than expected. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, said last week that chances of a successful conclusion were 'better than ever' but Gencor would 'walk away from the deal' if it was not sealed by June 30.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: SKF The shares of the world's biggest ball bearings manufacturer are on a roll. Despite a steepening of first half losses to SKr469m, SKF's shares rose a further 3 per cent yesterday as the Swedish stock market warmed to the cyclical recovery story. As a supplier to Europe's engineering and automotive sectors, SKF should be among the first to benefit from any upturn in industrial demand. Moreover, the company will reap further competitive gains from the krona's depreciation against the D-Mark. There is no doubt, though, that SKF's markets remain severely depressed. The company incurred first half losses of SKr440m from its operations in France and Germany and is tentative about the prospects for improvement. A patchy upturn in the US provides only limited comfort. The worry is that even when demand recovers the easing of competitive pressures will be small. With the likes of Mr Lopez on the prowl at Volkswagen, pricing demands on suppliers are likely to remain intense. Still, SKF is capable of achieving a large measure of its own financial salvation. Although it may be late in the day in comparison with other Swedish firms such as Atlas Copco, SKF is pushing through a drastic rationalisation programme which will shrink its cost base. The market may be right to believe that the company has turned the corner. But it has to look a long way ahead for those heady expectations to be fulfilled.</p>

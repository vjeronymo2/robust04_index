			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 7 Mar (PL) -- After five days of peace  talks here, the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas have  achieved "certain progress" for possible immediate international  verification of the violation of human rights during the  internal armed conflict.    One rebel negotiator assured PRENSA LATINA that supervision  of violations of citizens' liberties is the sole issue making  true progress since the current round of talks began on Thursday.    The source requested anonymity out of respect for the  participants' commitment with the United Nations not to disclose  any information to the media during the talks. Nevertheless, he  let it slip that "tomorrow there will surely be a joint  statement on this issue."    Immediate international verification, however, is only one  of  three issues included in the human rights issue. This in turn  is one of the two points on the negotiating agenda together with  the setting of a general timetable for the process.    So, in five days of alternate encounters by the participants  (pendular system) with UN moderator French Jean Arnault, neither  the creation of an investigation commission on the violations  nor the possibility of an alleged agreement in this regard has  been taken up.    The two sides have not met face to face, only communicating  separately with the mediator. Nevertheless, each delegation  separately admitted "progress" and even Hector Rosada, chief of  the government delegation, talked about "75 percent progress."    Arnault accepted there are differences and decided to  postpone until tomorrow the encounter that should have concluded  today, as the extension of his consultation with the warring  factions warranted the need to engage in one more day of  conversations.    The UN official did not consider important the fact that the  government and the guerrillas had not met together after five  days of talks. "This does not mean incomprehension; it is only  a technical detail," he indicated.    Arnault also indicated that the main stumbling block in  outlining international verification is centered on the manner  in which it is to be implemented. That is, is the verification  done "in the middle of the war or after the cease-fire," he  explained.    On this, there are recent precedents in Central America  where  the United Nations initiated investigations of the violation of  human rights in El Salvador after the signing of the armistice  in January 1992 between the government and the Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front.    Therefore, according to analysts, in no way do the end of  war  actions have to necessarily be a condition to start clearing up  murders, extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, and other  matters in Guatemala.    A document distributed here by the Guatemalan human rights  organizations indicates that from June 1993 to February 1994  there were 43 massacres, 282 murders, 45 persons declared  missing after being arrested, 1,469 arbitrary detentions, and  210 death threats registered in Guatemala. In addition, 19  children were reported missing and 17 infants were found dead,  according to the Guatemalan human rights commission.    Last week, the UN Human Rights Commission that meets in  Geneva, Switzerland, decided to continue its advisory on  Guatemala regarding citizens rights and urged the warring  factions to sign an immediate international verification  agreement on this issue.    In this regard, Arnault commented, "it is clear that the UN  orientation fostered the parties' desire to sign an agreement."</p>

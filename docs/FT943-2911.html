			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 234m so far for B&amp;C creditors Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth, the collapsed financial services group, are to receive interim payments of Pounds 95m, the administrators said yesterday. Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings will receive a dividend of 5p in the pound, bringing their total received so far to 20p or Pounds 234m. Creditors to B&amp;C Group Finance, a subsidiary, will get 2p in the pound, bringing their total to 30p or Pounds 223m. Creditors to Group Finance will receive a further 3p in the pound or Pounds 22m from the sale earlier this week of shares in Celltech, a biotechnology company in which it had a stake. Other dividends have come through the sale of the shares of Exco, the group's money-broking subsidiary which was floated in July. The details came in a report circulated to creditors by Stephen Adamson, Nigel Hamilton and Gareth Hughes, the administrators from accountants Ernst &amp; Young. The administrators have not changed their estimate that total dividends will be about Pounds 1bn. There was no mention of progress on a number of threatened and current legal actions designed to gather additional money for credit-ors. Directors and advisers were subject to strong criticism in a Department of Trade &amp; Industry inspectors' report published last month.</p>

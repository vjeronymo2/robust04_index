			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: J Bibby names executive flotation team J Bibby yesterday named the executive team which will lead the Pounds 75m flotation of its paper, scientific and agricultural businesses next year. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive of Compass Group, the catering and healthcare company, has been appointed non-executive chairman, while Mr Alan Gresty, Bibby's finance director, will become chief executive. Mr Mackay, who once said the role of a non-executive was to create maximum embarrassment with minimum effort, led Compass through its 1987 management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan and eventual flotation. Mr Gresty, who has been with Bibby since 1969, will resign as finance director on flotation. He was appointed finance director in 1985, and has been a director of the company's agricultural division since 1979. Bibby announced plans to float the three divisions in October, in an effort to reduce its Pounds 123m debt. Profits were hit and borrowings spiralled after the Pounds 82m hostile takeover of Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar distributor, last year. Barlow Rand, South Africa's largest industrial group, currently owns 79 per cent of Bibby.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Faber and Peter de Waard: "Employee in </F> Moscow Confirms Donation to Zhirinovskiy; Controversial  Businessman Allegedly Supported Other Parties Too"]    [Text] Amsterdam, 31 Dec -- Anton Nenachov, a Russian  investment consultant and owner of the controversial,  Amsterdam-based company Global Money Management Trust (GMM),  donated money to ultra-right-wing Russian politician Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's electoral campaign. According to B. Van der  Meer, one of Nenachov's employees, the donation amounted to  roughly $50,000. Nenakov has admitted this to Van der Meert.    According to the Moscow office's Dutch employee, Nenachov  also co-financed campaigns of other Russian political parties.  "Nenachov also donated $50,000 to Gaydar, the democratic  candidate," Van der Meer claims. "This is also true for the  other important candidates."    He denies that the 27-year old Nenakov co-financed  Zhirinovskiy's $800,000 campaign through his Netherlands  companies. "There have not been any flows of money through  Amsterdam," Van der Meer says. The Amsterdam-based GMM was  discredited last Wednesday after the Russian newspaper SEGODNYA  reported that Nenachov had sponsored Zhirinovskiy through this  company.    According to the GMM staff member, Nenachov did not pay  Zhirinovskiy on account of his political preference for an  ultra- right-wing politician. "As an entrepreneur, you have to  be pragmatic as far as politics are concerned. Nenachov has one  political preference: money." According to Van der Meert,  Nenachov made the payments in his capacity as a private  individual."    Partly as a result of the fuss raised, the Economic Control  Service [ECD] launched an investigation into GMM's activities  and into its Russian manager-shareholder. The control service  has already contacted De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) about the case.    However, the central bank is not the formal authority  entitled to give instructions to the ECD. This is the purview  of the Finance Ministry, in close consultation with the central  bank. The Finance Ministry said that it is still considering  whether the ECD will be called in.    Nenachov's employee says he is "pleased" with the control  service's investigation. "We will render our assistance. This  way, we will be able to prove our innocence," Van der Meert says.    The ECD investigation will not focus on GMM's and Nenachov's  political sympathies, but on possible economic offenses  committed by the company, in contravention of Article 82 of the  Law on the Inspection of Crediting. The DNB has recently sent a  letter to GMM, in which the bank warned the company not to do  any banking business. To that effect, the bank also invoked  Article 82, which stipulates that non-banks and non-investment  companies are not entitled to attract capital.    This article also forbids institutions established in the  Netherlands to attract money from abroad. GMM is allegedly  involved in large-scale money-raising operations in Russia. The  company, which also has an office in Moscow, has daily  commercials on Russian television.    GMM has already been in conflict with a Dutch institution on  a previous occasion. Some three months ago, the ABN Amro  discontinued its credit relationship with the company. The bank  took offense to Nenakov's assertion in Russia that the GMM  office in Moscow is an ABN Amro Russian subsidiary.    According to Van der Meer, "Nenachov is merely an  enthusiastic Russian, who is not aware that you have to keep  strictly to the rules in the Netherlands. Things are quite  different in Russia." In the Netherlands, GMM is banking with  the U.S. Citibank.    The GMM case has embarrassed Nenachov's adviser. L.  Gribling, a close assistant and employed by the accounting  office Arenthals/Chaudron, has gone on vacation. The office  issued a statement that it will break off its relation with  Nenachov if "illegal practices" are revealed.  Arenthals/Chaudron denies any involvement in the financing of  Zhirinovskiy's campaign.</p>

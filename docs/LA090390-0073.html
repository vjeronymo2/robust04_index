This is a time to take a stand, to find out who's right and  wrong, who's telling the truth and who's lying," White said in Sunday's  Philadelphia Inquirer.  </P> <P> If he doesn't receive the full support of baseball's highest officer, White  said, "It's goodby. I'm going home."  </P> <P> He also challenged Richie Phillips, the head of the umpire's union, over their  contradicting accounts of a meeting last week with umpire Joe West.  </P> <P> "If Richie is right and I'm lying, I should resign as president of the National  League," White said. "If I'm right and he's lying, Richie should resign.  </P> <P> "If I have lied I shouldn't be allowed to hold this office. If he has lied,  (then) in my role as president of the National League, I can't deal with him.  Our jobs should be on the line."  </P> <P> Vincent, who met with White on Friday, did not want to say much about the  matter. "I'm trying to be helpful," he said Sunday. "It's complicated and  unfortunate."  </P> <P> White, in his second year as league president, met last week with West and  Phillips. Afterward, West and White gave contradicting accounts of what was  said.  </P> <P> The meeting focused on an Aug. 22 incident in which West ejected Phillie  outfielder Von Hayes for criticizing another umpire during a game against the  Dodgers.  </P> <P> The Phillies also claimed that West has been too rough with players. During a  bench-clearing brawl against the Mets in New York, West threw Phillie pitcher  Dennis Cook to the ground.  </P> <P> West said White told him he handled the Hayes situation correctly.  </P> <P> After learning about West's comments, White disputed them.  </P></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Thatcher wins bar on book extracts SIR DAVID NAPLEY, Baroness Thatcher's solicitor, last night said he had obtained a High Court injunction against the Mail On Sunday to prevent the paper publishing extracts from the former prime minister's memoirs, Raymond Snoddy writes. The injunction is the latest legal action surrounding The Downing Street Years, due to be published on Monday week. The Sunday Times begins serialising the controversial 800-page book tomorrow. Earlier this week the Daily Mirror published extensive information from the book and successfully fought off legal attempts by the Sunday Times to prevent them doing so. The Mirror on Thursday gave an undertaking not to publish further material from the book. The Mail On Sunday declined to comment last night and it is unclear whether the paper plans to try and get the injunction lifted today.</p>

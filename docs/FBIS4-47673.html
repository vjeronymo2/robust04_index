			<p>BFN     [Text] Klerksdorp April 29 SAPA -- Right-wingers in Western  Transvaal mining towns are hastily selling their possessions and  buying caravans, apparently to move to Hartswater, also in the  Western Transvaal, to join their Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] counterparts before the  election results are released. A second-hand furniture dealer  told of several families, especially in Stilfontein and Orkney,  who were selling off all their furniture in such a hurry they  were accepting any price.    Meanwhile, several other right-wingers in Klerksdorp who  intend staying have been barricading their homes, sometimes  welding thick steel plates on bedroom windows to discourage  intruders.    Some of the houses looked like fortresses and contained  enough emergency supplies to last a long time.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television The cynical will doubtless note how much better the programmes get after Christmas. Tonight you could do worse than stay with BBC2 all evening. Start with The Marriage of Figaro (7.20pm), the first of a three-part transmission of one of Music Theatre London's lovingly outrageous updatings. This is the company that uses young performers, a slimmed-down band and frequently rude translations to get astonishingly close to the heart of Mozart. Tonight's Figaro transforms the lecherous Count into a Tory Eurocrat, the slimy go-between into his permanent secretary and the frumpish Marcellina into a National Trust manageress. The vocal lines will be scrupulously observed. More nuptials in Three Fights, Two Weddings and a Funeral (9.50pm), the wedding video of Pauline Calf perpetrated by her brother Paul, both better known as Steve Coogan of Alan Partridge fame. Like Figaro it is directed by Geoff Posner. And Rab C. Nesbitt fills the gap at 9pm if you have a Glaswegian interpreter.</p>

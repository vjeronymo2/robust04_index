			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Right way to reform the CAP 'reform' There is something priggish about the claims of British ministers to be more liberal and more free-market than any of their opposite numbers in the European Community - although that would not be difficult. Scepticism is amply justified by the British government's reaction to the MacSharry plan for reforming the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). The plan is a remarkable attempt by the EC's agriculture commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry, to decouple payments to farmers from agricultural prices, and thereby to furnish some support for farmers without having to rig the structure of world food markets. The direction of the MacSharry plan - towards transparency and away from market rigging - is surely one that nearly all gradualist reformers have advocated. Indeed, the commissioner will have his work cut out getting his ideas through meetings of ministers beholden to the farm lobbies. If he is entitled to support from any government, it is surely the British, which has far and away the smallest proportion of its citizens working on the soil. Yet as recently as last Wednesday, February 12, Mr John Gummer, the British agriculture minister, was pouring cold water on the proposals at  -you will never guess - the annual general meeting of the National Farmers Union. I might as well state - before he dictates a letter to the Financial Times - that Mr Gummer's complaint is that income payments will be biased towards the low income farmers, and away from the more prosperous and efficient ones who predominate in British agriculture, and who are influential beyond their numbers among the shire Tories. It would surely be best to welcome the MacSharry proposals and concentrate on the distribution of income support. The MacSharry proposals do, however, need a different kind of reform. To see why, recall the deficiency payments which were used to support British agriculture before the UK joined the Community in 1973. The system was less bad than the CAP, because: the cost was obvious to the taxpayer, and thus self-limiting, and the British consumer paid for imports at world market prices rather than at prices rigged by import levies and the like. Even then, superficial minds argued that the cost of the policy could be reduced by shifting the burden from the taxpayer to the consumer by higher prices - an error known as fiscal illusion. The real problem of the old British system was different. It was that, as deficiency payments were tied to agricultural proceeds, farmers were given wrong signals about market demand for their products. The MacSharry plan suffers from a similar defect. This is shown in Reforming the CAP, a paper by Professor Stefan Tangermann, of the University of Goettingen, recently published by the Institute of Economic Affairs*. The professor even manages to find a reason for coupling payments at least partly to farm output and income, rather than treating them purely as social security or redistribution towards the poor. This is because farmers have been 'trapped' into the present scale of production by a CAP which gave them false reassurance. The change that Professor Tangermann advocates is shifting the basis of income support from current production to a past reference period before reform, for example, the average of 1989-91. This seemingly trivial alteration would, at a stroke, banish all incentive to produce on an inappropriate scale by fossilising the basis for payments to farmers. This would allow farmers to respond to world market signals, thus incidentally facilitating the Gatt negotiations. A further great advantage is that it would no longer be necessary to make income support conditional on farmers' setting aside land for non-farming use - as payments would no longer have anything to do with current production. Forcing farmers not to use land is like dumping coffee in the sea or imposing early retirement - all stupid and ultimately immoral forms of compulsory waste, imposed because policymakers cannot think of better ways of coping with market-clearing prices. The exact basis for income payments to farmers is a matter of political haggling to which elementary economics can contribute little. But it can contribute something to the question of whether to tie the payments to the farm or the individual farmers. The Tangermann proposal is to make the payments to existing farmers for a period of, say, 15 years, but to allow the rights to them to be bought and sold. The accompanying IEA publicity talks about farmers being given lump sum compensation, for instance bonds which might be worth Pounds 150,000 for a farm of 240 acres. This is slightly misleading, and could put off finance ministers, whose budgets are based on primitive cash flow concepts. The bonds arise from making the MacSharry payments transferable. All that governments and the Commission need do is to legalise a market. It is easy to show that the worldwide race to protect farmers is self-defeating, and any benefits go not to working farmers, but to landowners. The land lobby is influential partly because economy-watchers, from finance ministers to economic journalists, are too busy to look more than occasionally at the intricate details of this one particular sector, and fear to trip up over the details. Yet ending the scandal of the CAP could make far more difference to economic welfare than the difference between the worst and the best conceivable annual government budget in Britain, and other Community countries. *2 Lord North Street, London.</p>

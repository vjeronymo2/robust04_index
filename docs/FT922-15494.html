			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Watts Blake falls 27% and 'hard year' ahead PRE-TAX profits at Watts Blake Bearne, the world's largest supplier of ball clay, fell by 27 per cent, from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 5.67m, in the year to December 31. Mr John Pike, managing director, said the results should be considered against a background of falling demand for ceramic products in most of Europe and North America. Sales, however, rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 56.4m). Exports to the Far East rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 4m. The group said it had decided last month to increase its investments in the area underlining its confidence in the future profitability of the Far East operations. Turnover fell in both the UK and the US, mainly due the recession on both sides of the Atlantic. In Devon Clays, for example, sales of ball clay for facing bricks and china clay for paper fillers fell significantly. Trading profit fell from Pounds 7.66m to Pounds 6.42m. Mr Pike said that while certain markets could start to improve the group was assuming that 'another hard year lies ahead'. Net borrowings increased to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 4.7m), with interest payable of Pounds 746,000 compared to Pounds 94,000 received. Earnings per share fell from 26p to 18.9p. However, a final dividend of 6.6p gives an unchanged total of 9.3p.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO PUT EATERY IN PICO HOUSE DRAWS FIRE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: CHICANO ACTIVISTS AND OLVERA STREET MERCHANTS SAY $15-MILLION  PROJECT THAT INCLUDES RESTAURANT WILL DISRUPT THE MEXICAN FLAVOR OF EL PUEBLO  DE LOS ANGELES PARK.  </P> <P> The southern portion of El Pueblo de Los Angeles park -- where the last Mexican  governor of California built the city's first hotel -- is targeted for a  $15-million revitalization program to upgrade an area that has been mostly  unused for the last 40 years.  </P> <P> Included in the ambitious project, which faces a final decision by the Los  Angeles City Council within a month, is a French restaurant to be built in the  Romanesque-style Pico House. The luxurious hotel was built in 1869 in what is  now the northern end of downtown by Pio de Jesus Pico, who was governor of Alta  California when it joined the Union after the Mexican War.  </P> <P> The restaurant -- intended to duplicate the opulent French eatery that was once  in the hotel -- is seen as an anchor to the proposed collection of office  space, shops and cultural exhibits designed to attract visitors to the place  where Los Angeles was founded in 1781.  </P> <P> "I think it's a terrific project where we can blend the commercial (use) with  the culture of the area," said Bruce Phillips, president of the Santa  Monica-based development firm that has proposed the project.  </P> <P> But, when it comes to L.A.'s birthplace, things just aren't that easy.  </P> <P> A coalition of Chicano historians, activists and merchants on nearby Olvera  Street has formed to oppose the project, arguing that it threatens to disrupt  the Mexican flavor of the area.  </P> <P> "Do we allow commercial interests to run rampant in a publicly declared  historical site?" asked Dr. Marta Lopez-Garza, a sociology professor.  </P> <P> The opponents have promised to take their case to the public, beginning with a  news conference today. On Sunday, they plan a petition-signing rally in front  of the Pico House.  </P> <P> The group opposes a restaurant in the Pico House, whether it be French, Mexican  or something else. Instead, the historic building should be used as a museum of  Mexican culture and art, the coalition says. A Mexican art gallery already is  on the building's main floor.  </P> <P> The opponents also contend that the four investors backing the project -- a  group known as Old L.A. -- obtained extremely low rents through a lease  agreement approved by the city's Parks and Recreation Commission. The lease  provides for rents starting at $100,000 per year.  </P> <P> Merchants on Olvera Street pay much higher rentals, they say, adding that their  tab is nearly $1 million paid annually to the city. "I think it's a sweetheart  deal," said Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn.  </P> <P> The issues in the looming battle over the proposal, commonly referred to as the  Pico-Garnier project, are similar to the outcries over the proposed upgrading  of Olvera Street, across the Pueblo Plaza from the Pico-Garnier project.  </P> <P> Some Latino insiders fear that the acrimonious public fight over Olvera Street,  which has quieted down for the moment, could be repeated over the Pico-Garnier  project. The fight over Olvera got so emotional at one point that Councilman  Richard Alatorre and fellow council member Gloria Molina, who represented the  area while in the state Assembly, got into a shouting match in a committee  meeting.  </P> <P> "It's not going to do anybody any good to get into a bloodbath type of thing,"  said Deputy Mayor Ed Avila.  </P> <P> In recent years, the southern portion of El Pueblo park, consisting principally  of the Pico House, the Garnier Building, the Merced Theatre and the Masonic  Hall, has been largely dormant while Olvera Street, the Mexican marketplace  that was created out of an alley in 1930, flourished.  </P> <P> Since World War II, several renovation efforts failed either because of lack of  financing or the maze of government agencies with jurisdiction over the park.  Until last February, the park was governed by the city, the county and the  state of California under a joint-powers agreement.  </P> <P> But the arrangement proved cumbersome and the city agreed to take over control  of the park.  </P> <P> Some government efforts to upgrade the buildings were never completed. For  example, the Garnier Building still awaits completion of major seismic  rehabilitation work begun almost a decade ago.  </P> <P> In 1984, the Old L.A. investors signed a 25-year lease with a 10-year option to  develop the block. But the 1986 federal tax reform act took away some of the  group's incentives and prompted new negotiations. Those talks resulted in an  agreement earlier this year that gave Old L.A. a 25-year lease with an extended  option of another 25 years. That agreement must be approved by the City Council  for the project to move forward.  </P> <P> Phillips, head of the Santa Monica-based Grand American development firm, has  met with project opponents over their concerns in recent months, but that did  little to convince them that the project is a good thing.  </P> <P> "I think they're premature," he said of the opposition.  </P> <P> Phillips said the Old L.A. group, headed by businessmen Albert T. Ehringer and  Robert J. Morris, is willing to change the French restaurant to another type of  eatery. But it will not give up the space for a Mexican museum or art gallery.  </P> <P> "It's a prime (restaurant) location and I think that should be its use,"  Phillips said.  </P> <P> Dr. Rodolfo Acuna, a Chicano studies professor who is chair of the Mexican  Conservancy, countered: "An art gallery would eventually pay for itself. They  (the city's Establishment) pour a lot of money into the Music Center. Why  shouldn't some of that money be poured into an arts center for Mexican  culture?"  </P> <P> Phillips has offered to build a 3,000-square-foot wing of the Garnier Building  for such a purpose, but opponents say that offer is inadequate.  </P> <P> It is unclear which city panel will oversee the project.  </P> <P> Alatorre and Molina have agreed to support the creation of the seven-member  "authority" to oversee the park to end the heated wrangling over Olvera Street,  which had been under the control of the parks commission.  </P> <P> Acuna would like the new authority to oversee the project. But Alatorre,  mindful that Old L.A. already has a lease, is not so sure. He says parks  commission approval should stand as long as more cultural exhibition space is  included in the project.  </P></p>

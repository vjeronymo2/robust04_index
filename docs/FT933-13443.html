			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Enlarged net fails to make a big catch - The apathy of small investors to the government's plan for wider share ownership HARDLY a privatisation goes by without a minister talking about Britain's share owning democracy. The government's third and last sale of BT shares is no exception. In the run-up to the trading of the partly paid shares, which starts today, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, frequently cited the flotation as evidence of the government's commitment to 'widening and deepening share ownership'. The government justifies wider share ownership on the basis that it involves individuals directly in the economic success of UK companies as well as allowing them to build up security for the future. On that basis, say government advisers, the retail investors will today be pleased to have bought their shares and should have the added satisfaction of making a small profit. Yet with most of the big privatisations completed the evidence suggests that the government has failed in its objective. The government points out that the number of small shareholders has increased from around 3m in 1979 to peak at 11m in 1991, although it has recently fallen back to 9.26m, which government advisers blame on the recession. In percentage terms the proportion of the adult population owning shares is around 21 per cent compared with just 9 per cent in 1979. Institutions, however, account for a bigger percentage of shares in privatised companies than ever before. According to the partly-government funded ProShare, which tracks share ownership, pension funds and insurance companies hold more than half of all shares in privatised companies compared with 20 per cent held by small shareholders. Mr David Jones, chief executive of ShareLink, the telephone-based stockbroker which is about to float on the Stock Exchange, says the problem is of the government's own making. He believes concepts such as 'share owning democracy' and 'widening and deepening share ownership' are not sufficiently defined by ministers for the public to know whether they have succeeded or failed. His own evidence suggests that retail investors currently have a greater appetite than ever to buy and sell shares. This is borne out in ShareLink's pre-tax profits, which rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.1m in the year to March 31 without any privatisations or big share issues. It was the privatisations that the government hoped would bring about a cultural change in share ownership. But there seems to be a reluctance by investors to go on and buy shares in other companies after taking part in a privatisation issue. ProShare's figures show that 72 per cent of all retail investors hold shares in only one or two companies. The government has sought to rectify this by extending the concept of share shops first used in the 1991 BT sale. Ministers hope that many retail investors who buy shares in BT3 will be enticed by their broker, building society or bank, to buy shares in other companies. Mr John Cobb, chairman of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, describes the decision to extend the number of share shops from eight to around 150 as a 'significant step forward'. Many of the share shops, however, are less enthusiastic. Mr Tony Vine-Lott, chief executive of Barclays Stockbrokers, says: 'The share shops have not been adequately put across by the government or its advisers.' Of the 1.66m people applying for shares in BT3, 978,000 decided to go through a share shop as opposed to registering with the Share Information Office. Where the government has had more success is in its efforts to entice retail investors to buy shares in a privatisation issue when there is little possibility of making a big profit on the first day of trading. Less than 10 per cent of the 1bn shares bought by retail investors in the last BT sale were sold during the first month of trading. That compares with more than 35 per cent of shares sold in the regional electricity companies in the first month of trading. Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, says the Treasury's policy of tight pricing has eliminated the possibility of 'stagging', whereby investors only bought shares in privatised companies to sell on the first day of trading. The chances of making such a profit on BT have been virtually eliminated by the government, notwithstanding the retail investors' 10p discount on each of the three instalments. The majority of retail investors buying shares are expected to remain long-term holders of BT. After the initial privatisation of BT in 1984 the telecommunications company had 2.1m small shareholders. This fell to around 1m four years later. Following the second sale of government shares in 1991 the number of individual shareholders in BT rose to 2.6m. This has recently fallen to 2.2m. But the rate of attrition is slow compared to the early privatisations. British Aerospace, for example, one of the first companies to go public in 1981, attracted 26,000 retail investors, which slumped to just 3,000 soon after the sale. This is success of a kind, but it is not what the government hoped for when it embarked on its wider share-ownership campaign in the eighties. When all the razzmatazz of today's flotation is over the government still has to persuade hundreds of thousands of BT shareholders to buy and sell shares in other companies. The evidence to date suggests that BT3 will not halt the inexorable slide in the proportion of individuals owning shares.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            BT3 - PROVISIONAL ALLOCATIONS TO NON-EMPLOYEES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number           Qualifying BT       Non-shareholders      Public applied          shareholders        applying through    application for            applying through                             forms            Share shops   Share info  Share shop  Share info                            office                  office  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 120             120         120          120        120      120 200             200         200          200        200      150 300             300         300          300        270      180 400             400         400          400        300      210 500             500         500          450        330      nil  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 600             600         600          480        360      nil 700             700         630          510        375      nil 800             800         660          540        nil      nil 900             825         690          570        nil      nil 1,000           840         720          585        nil      nil  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1,500         1,020         840          600        nil      nil 2,000         1,110         900          nil        nil      nil 2,500         1,200         960          nil        nil      nil 3,000         1,350       1,020          nil        nil      nil 4,000         1,650       1,200          nil        nil      nil  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 5,000         1,800       1,350          nil        nil      nil 10,000 &amp;         30%**       20%***      nil        nil      nil above  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Max 30,000 ***Max 20,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy Conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasible policy alternatives for achieving consumer product energy efficiency. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;No New Regulatory Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Informational Action <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Product labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Consumer education <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Prescriptive Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Financial Incentives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Tax credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Rebates <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Proposed Approach (Performance Standards) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant energy savings at reasonable costs, and has been compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented for these eight products. This is essentially the ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case, between the years 1996 and 2030 there would be expected energy use of 443.6 quads of primary energy, with no energy savings and a zero net present value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the heading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of informational action. They include consumer product labeling and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's public education and information program. Both of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives are mandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate the energy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model this possibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be lowered by 5 percent for purchasers of these eight products. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in energy savings equal to 1.7 quads, with expected consumption equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 441.8 quads. The net present value is estimated to be $2.7 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these eight products, prescriptive standards are assumed to be implemented as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards at one level below the performance standards. The lower standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level entails slightly smaller expenditures for tooling and purchased parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the economic impacts that are expected before the implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date should be slightly smaller for prescriptive standards. This resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy consumption, between 1996 and 2030, of 389.2 quads, and savings of 54.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quads. The net present value, in 1990 dollars, was $92.3 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax credits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense for higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tax credits to consumers showed a change from the base case, saving 3.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quads with a net present value of $6.0 billion. Consumer rebates showed more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sizable changes; they would save 4.5 quads with a net present value of $8.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers for the production of energy-efficient models of these eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances. In this scenario, an investment tax credit of 20 percent was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed. The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect; the energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption estimates are 442.8 quads with savings equal to 0.7 quad, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net present value equal to $0.8 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of this scenario is so small because the investment tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit was applicable only to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The firms' fixed costs and most of the design improvements that would likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be adopted to manufacture more efficient versions of these products would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve purchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an investment tax credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first one, the proposed energy conservation standards were assumed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntarily adopted by all the relevant manufacturers in 5 years. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second scenario, the proposed standards were assumed to be adopted in 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. In these scenarios, the 5-year delay would result in energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption by these appliances of 388.0 quads, energy savings of 55.2 quads,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a net present value of $97.1 billion; the 10-year delay would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 398.4 quads of energy being consumed, 44.8 quads being saved, and a net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present value of $76.6 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the energy conservation standards by these appliance manufacturers, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

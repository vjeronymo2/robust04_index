			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED STRIKERS WILL VOTE ON TENTATIVE ACCORD  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp. and negotiators for 935 union workers who have been striking  Lockheed facilities in Upland, Chino and Ontario have reached a tentative  agreement on a new contract, company and union officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Negotiators for Local Lodge 821 of the International Assn. of Machinists  accepted a three-year wage and benefit offer Tuesday night and will submit the  proposal for a ratification vote Saturday.  </P> <P> If approved, the agreement would end a strike that began March 12.  </P> <P> Machinists at the three plants voted to strike after rejecting a proposal by  Lockheed Aircraft Service Corp. Leaders of the union local said the offer was  inferior to a three-year pact accepted March 4 by about 18,000 machinists at  Lockheed manufacturing plants in Burbank, Sunnyvale, Calif., and Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> The two sides, assisted by a federal mediator, compromised on a number of  issues after a nine-week impasse, said Bob Gregory, a union negotiator. For  example, union workers at the Burbank plant were given a $2,500 signing bonus.  Gregory said Lockheed had initially offered no signing bonus to his workers,  but the two sides eventually agreed to a $2,000 signing bonus.  </P> <P> Burbank workers received a 4% wage increase. Under the proposed pact negotiated  Tuesday, all of the striking workers would receive a 5% bonus during the first  year. Some striking workers would receive a 3% wage increase during the second  and third years of the contract and others would receive bonuses amounting to  5% of their salaries during that two-year period. The two sides also  compromised on a cost-of-living formula, Gregory said.  </P> <P> Lockheed officials had said that the firm could not afford to match the  Burbank-Palmdale offer because the Upland, Chino and Ontario operations are not  production facilities. More than 1,000 supervisors and salaried employees  maintained some operations during the strike, involving the maintenance and  modification on Air Force aircraft.  </P> <P> Lockheed would not provide details on the proposed contract.  </P></p>

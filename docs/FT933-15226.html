			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P falls to Dollars 17m in first term GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a 25 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings before special charges. The company, which has come under fire from the New York state employees' pension fund for a lacklustre profits record, reported earnings of Dollars 17.05m, or 45 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22.8m, or 60 cents a share, last year. The 1992 figures were turned into a Dollars 157.4m loss by Dollars 180.2m of unusual non-cash charges. Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 3.28bn, compared with Dollars 3.3bn, and the 1993 figures were helped by over 11 weeks of sales from over 40 Big Star stores acquired in late March. The gross margin rate rose to 28.7 per cent from 28.55 a year earlier. Same-store sales in the quarter dropped 0.8 per cent, but the company pointed out that this was an improvement from the 3.1 per cent drop in the fourth quarter. Mr James Wood, chairman, said same-store sales showed an improving trend in a very gradually improving economic climate. Chevron, the US oil group, is to sell its 71-year-old headquarters building at 225 Bush Street in San Francisco's financial district as part of its corporate restructuring, agencies report from San Francisco. The group has about 2,000 employees in San Francisco.</p>

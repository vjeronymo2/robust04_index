			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Visionary seeks an equal chance: Lech Walesa, the Polish president, who begins a state visit to Britain today, outlines his hopes for his country's future in an interview with FT writers Poland's first democratically elected president, Mr Lech Walesa, arrives in London today for a three-day state visit. He is a complex mixture of intuitive vision, political shrewdness, religious conviction, unexpected naivety - and personal charm. It is a combination which helped him play a key role in the collapse of communism, and is now being used to win Poland a place in Europe and woo foreign investment. Last week in Warsaw he talked to FT correspondents about Poland's hopes and fears, starting with the prospect of 2m unemployed before the year is out. Q: Will you have to ask Poles for 'blood, sweat and tears'? A: I don't agree with this perspective. Poland can't afford unemployment. It has so much work to do, so many needs. Our problem is not over-production but shortages. We have an educated society but antiquated systems and machines. That's why we need help from abroad. Even if Poland had twice as many people we could not catch up with the west in 20 years. So let foreign business come here, then there won't be unemployment and I can save the country. Are you saying there won't be unemployment? No, no. There could be more than 2m unemployed. The point is there should not be any, given the size of our needs. What will you be seeking in Britain? I'll be doing some blunt talking. Europe is not Europe without Britain, but there are mistakes in western thinking. Europe fears that we'll take away markets. But I'm convinced there is work for all here in Poland for 10 years just to fill in the gaps in our economy. We should learn to assess our potential on a Europe-wide scale. Look at Nowa Huta (a big steel works). Its pollution is destroying Krakow. Shouldn't we give up producing steel and buy from France which has non-polluting factories? But then France has to help find work for the 60,000 who lose their jobs. We allow imports of all goods but the west is not buying ours. Why are we being punished? We could end up like Romania which has nothing but shortages. If we don't find a common language my farmers won't allow the import of food from the west. But this is not what should be happening. We want to join the European institutions. But Europe is afraid to let us in. Yet, it's so simple. We should all stand at the starting line as if in a race. I'll be on a bicycle, others on tractors, some in cars. Who wins is his affair. That's the thinking we should have - everyone should have an equal chance. Computers should have a hand in all this. The computer should fire a public starting signal. It should not be a confidential one so that someone gets an unfair lead. That places a lot of faith in computers. Comecon tried that and failed. That's true. But the first fruit is always full of worms. What do European leaders say when you make these points to them? No one has countered my arguments yet. They may complain that the way I put my views is too brutal but no one has found convincing counter-arguments to my vision of European development. Do you see these leaders as short-sighted? No, but things are changing so fast, and they can't take all factors into account. I have a great advantage. I'm not tied to any party. Politicians as a rule are limited by their political affiliations and programmes. It is said you model yourself on Pilsudski. (Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, who gained enormous popularity by defeating the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw in 1920 and later established an increasingly authoritarian regime in the inter-war years.) Is that right? No. Of course, I respect Pilsudski. But I'm a different person. Look at the contrast in our achievements. Pilsudski won great victories with enormous losses and people were very enthusiastic. We have achieved an enormous victory over communism without bloodshed - but people aren't happy. We've achieved so much and so subtly. We've handed Europe victory on a plate, and the opportunity to link all Europe up on a healthy basis. Yet just look what Europe is doing. (At this point the president screws up his face in a gesture of fastidiousness and waves his hands from side to side.) It does not want to get involved . . . it hums and haws. Generations have fought for this great chance. Well, now we have it. The question is, Will we screw it up? Everything ought to be possible - entry into Nato, into the European Community, everything. But what are we doing? Just waiting for the next earthquake. It's amazing. Incredible. If there'd been the usual victory with corpses all over the place there would have been enthusiasm. Somehow everything has changed. It used to be the Germans who did the fighting and the Jews the trading. Now it's the Germans who are fighting for peace, the Jews who are fighting and the Poles who are trading. Maybe that's why things are upside down, everybody is playing unfamiliar roles. What about the situation to the east? This is a new era. Of course, new nations and social groups want their freedom. They are casting aside their chains. Take the Czechs and Slovaks. Now they're arguing. But this is just the initial phase. After that they'll start coming together again. Modern economies transcend national boundaries and dangers like Chernobyl are also no respecter of borders. Five years ago I said that the Soviet Union had only one option - to dissolve itself. But no one took me seriously. I'm now saying that it will dissolve but come together again on new principles, on logical principles. As for Poland, we need foreign investment because it also gives us security. Having a Frenchman or an Englishman here with his factory is like having a division of troops. You in the west have over-production. You can make money out of our shortages and our stupidity - and we have plenty of that. We can't just escape in your direction because it is already full up. I want to turn round the escape routes. That's where business can be done. Business should come here rather than wait for people to flee west. Come and set up a factory here. Make money. Some people say, 'Walesa is selling Poland cheap'. Our people are intelligent but we received our education under communism. We need western help to show us how to do things. We don't want charity or sentiment. We have to be taught in the brutal school of life. The quicker we start the quicker we'll learn. You won power because the communists could not deliver economically. But aren't things getting worse for many? If I was to run for election now I'd get 90 per cent. The new government (led by the prime minister Mr Jan Bielecki) is full of competent people. True, they are from the third division. They're not well-known. But that's how I wanted it. They want to join the first division and they'll work hard to get there. You know how the first division acts. They sit there smoking their pipes and thinking about things. That's OK in other conditions but not now. I'm a man who gets down to resolving problems. I don't ask whether it's the done way or not. I raise issues. People don't always understand my motives. But the president must always have answers and propose his own solutions - he can't allow himself to be taken by surprise. I'm not taking a conventional approach and you should be careful how you assess what I am doing. My role is a fluid one, searching for solutions and forcing people into democracy. Let parliament get angry. Let them rebel. I want to force people to think. I want to provoke them out of the theories of communism. After 50 years of communism you cannot just impose a better system on people. The thing is to provoke them and point them in the right direction. But if there was a threat (to democracy) and events go in a wrong direction then something decisive would have to be done. We won't get to democracy with an apathetic society. People have been fooled by politicians in the past and have to understand what's going on. That's why I provoke them into arguing and thinking. I don't want them sitting on sofas smoking pipes. That's for 50 years' time. Interview by Anthony Robinson, Martin Wolf and Christopher Bobinski</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian antimony and wolfram in crisis THE BOLIVIAN antimony and wolfram industries are in a state of crisis following saturation of their markets in North America and Europe. Up to 3,000 workers in wolfram production, which is under the most immediate strain, are set to lose their jobs unless a rescue package can be arranged. Mr Rolando Jordan, general secretary of the Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation for private mining concerns in Bolivia, blames the situation on the aggressive dumping of these semi-processed metals by China at rock-bottom prices on the international market since March this year. 'This sophisticated dumping by China has hurt us very badly and has effectively closed the market for such metals', he says. A Bolivian delegation is currently lobbying both North America and the European Community to extend anti-dumping measures against products containing Chinese metals. In the meantime four or five of the Medium Mines Association's 22 companies could cease to be members by the year's end according to Mr Jordan. As far as the immediate situation is concerned, Bolivian mining minister Alvaro Rojas says he is 'analysing the possibilities of finding financing which would maintain wolfram production and thus avoid closures'. One estimate puts the sum needed at about Dollars 3.5m. As Comibol, the state mining corporation, no longer produces wolfram, the sectors hit hardest by the present collapse in the market will be the small and medium mines and co-operatives. Total wolfram production last year was 1,264 tonnes, worth some Dollars 6.7m. This figure was up slightly from 1990 but down from 3,195 tonnes produced in 1982, then worth about Dollars 33.9m. Antimony production last year was 9,107 tonnes worth Dollars 13.9m, again up on 1990 but down from 13,612 tonnes in 1982, then worth Dollars 24.4m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] During a joint session, the legislative chambers  have approved the law on public credit requested by the  executive for a sum exceeding 156 billion bolivares.    [Reporter Cecilia Cayone] The only thing pending now is for  the executive to adopt the necessary procedures to implement  this so that public employees may receive the salary increase  ordered by former President Ramon Jose Velasquez. Gustavo Tarre  Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee,  said that the National Congress made only a small change to the  law submitted by the executive.    [Begin Tarre recording] The only modification made by the  National Congress to the executive's request was to grant 300  million bolivares to programs for Lake Maracaibo's eastern coast  bearing on the (?survival) of that area. Some 60,000 people,  living with the danger that the dike could break, have to be  relocated. Although that program requires a lot more money than  that, the Congress made this contribution. This decision, in  conjunction with assistance already rendered and that was  budgeted for next year, should resolve once and for all the  problems affecting a region whose petroleum riches contribute  the largest percentage of Venezuela's budget. [end recording]    [Cayone] By the end of this month or during the first  quarter  in June, public employees will be able to begin collecting their  salary increase.</p>

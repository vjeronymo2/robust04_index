			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH'S $300-BILLION DEFENSE PLAN SLASHED BY HOUSE PANEL  </P> <P> President Bush's plans for nearly $300 billion in defense spending next year  came under attack today on Capitol Hill as the House Budget Committee passed 21  to 14 a $1.24-trillion Democratic-written budget that slashed $8 billion from  the President's plan for Pentagon spending.  </P> <P> The full House is scheduled next week to debate the Democratic proposal to  shift the Pentagon money to domestic programs.  </P> <P> The committee's action represented the fullest statement of budget priorities  by Congress' majority Democrats since the Warsaw Pact disintegrated.  </P> <P> "The President's budget virtually ignored the opportunities presented by the  dramatic changes taking place in the world," committee Chairman Leon Panetta  (D-Carmel Valley) said. "This budget meets that challenge head-on.  </P> <P> "We have a chance to restore the traditional peacetime priorities of our nation  at a time when we are faced with tremendous economic challenges at home and  abroad," Panetta said.  </P></p>

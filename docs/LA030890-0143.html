			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: ALL-AMERICAN TARVER LEADS PARADE AGAIN AS SANTA CLARA  MARCHES ON  </P> <P> It was the equivalent of a first-round knockout. Any fan who arrived late need  not have bothered paying admission.  </P> <P> Minutes into the Southern Section 2-AA Division basketball final at the L. A.  Sports Arena on Saturday, Santa Clara High held a 12-2 lead over Verbum Dei.  </P> <P> The score was 16-2 after the first quarter.  </P> <P> For Shon Tarver, Santa Clara's 6-foot-5 senior guard, Verbum Dei was just  another team with which to toy. With seemingly no effort, Tarver scored on  layups, slam dunks, three-point shots and free throws.  </P> <P> At halftime, Santa Clara led, 38-18, and Tarver had outpointed Verbum Dei,  22-18.  </P> <P> Has there ever been a more one-sided Southern Section final? Has a single  player ever dominated so completely?  </P> <P> The final score was 76-48. Every Santa Clara player saw action. Tarver, a  Parade Magazine third-team All-American, left the game with 5 minutes 47  seconds to play. He had 31 points, 12 rebounds, four blocks and three assists.  </P> <P> Tarver dashed to the bench and gave Coach Lou Cvijanovich his best two-handed  slam on the palms. Santa Clara's 11th Southern Section basketball title was  well in hand.  </P> <P> "It was an easier game than I expected," Cvijanovich said.  </P> <P> With Tarver at his finest, there was never any doubt.

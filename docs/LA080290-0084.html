			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTC CHIEF BACKS OFF $500-BILLION FIGURE FOR S&amp;L BAILOUTS  </P> <P> Resolution Trust Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, seeking to reverse an  impression he left earlier this week, disagreed Wednesday with estimates by  private forecasters that the savings and loan bailout will cost $500 billion  once all the bills are in.  </P> <P> Instead, he said, he agreed with projections by the Administration that the  cost of the bailout could run $90 billion to $130 billion, plus $70 billion or  so in interest costs.  </P> <P> Seidman told a television interviewer Monday that he agreed with estimates by  the General Accounting Office and some private forecasters that the total tab,  including interest, could climb "in excess of $500 billion."  </P> <P> But Wednesday the RTC chairman told reporters that he was merely trying to  suggest that "you can come up with any number you want" if you stretch out  interest payments enough. "I would not say the cost is in excess of $500  billion, and I don't believe I said that," he said.  </P></p>

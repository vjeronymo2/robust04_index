			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Compromise reached on tropical timber pact Fifty tropical timber producing and consuming nations are due today to adopt a new accord on timber trade and conservation after four rounds of arduous negotiations spanning two years. But the deal has failed to win the approval of conservationist pressure groups. The pact, which succeeds the 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement, is expected to come into force in February 1995, for an initial period of four years. Success was finally achieved after the two sides reached a compromise on producer demands that temperate timber as well as tropical timber should be subject to the same forest preservation requirements. Under the pact, all tropical timber exports are supposed to be extracted from sustainably managed forests by the year 2000. Consuming countries, which include the US, the European Union, Canada and Russia, will issue a 'formal statement' pledging to respect comparable conservation guidelines for their own forests. However, the statement is not part of the new accord and is not legally binding. Consumers have also agreed to set up a fund, known as the 'Bali Partnership Fund', to aid producers in their efforts to meet forest conservation objectives. No target figure for the fund is set in the draft agreement. Environmental groups, concerned about the degradation of temperate forests, have expressed disappointment that temperate and boreal woods are to be excluded from the pact. The Dollars 7.5bn a year trade in tropical timber - logs, plywood and veneer sheets - represents about 10 per cent of total timber trade. 'Both producers and consumers agreed behind closed doors to a compromise which will leave the world's forests as endangered as ever', the World Wide Fund for Nature said on Monday. The possible inclusion of timber from temperate and boreal forests in the new agreement will come up for discussion again in 1999. Negotiators suggested that producers were likely to be reluctant to renew the pact if there was no clear movement by consumers towards sustainable forest management by that time.</p>

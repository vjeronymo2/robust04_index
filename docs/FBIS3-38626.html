			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia today established diplomatic relations with  Skopje under the name the Republic of Macedonia. The Czech  Republic intends to do the same. French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe said in Athens that France will promote the resumption of  the Athens-Skopje talks.    A short time ago, the government said it is strongly  dissatisfied with Russia's decision, which was made as the  Skopjean Government continues its provocative policy.  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the  government made its positions known to everyone and the  international community should have realized that Skopje must  change its stance to maintain security and stability, something  that will benefit it as well. Correspondent Dhimitrios Latsios  reports:    [Begin recording] [Latsios] Russia reportedly informed the  Greek ambassador in Moscow that it intended to establish  diplomatic relations with Skopje a week ago. Moscow believes  that the name the Republic of Macedonia is used because Russia  has long recognized the neighboring state with this name. The  Russian officials who contacted the Greek side noted that this  move does not go against Athens and the Russian Foreign Ministry  deemed that it could not be postponed, because the European  partners recently made moves, forcing Russia to act to maintain  its Balkan interests.    After meeting Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the French  foreign minister referred to Skopje saying that France wants the  Athens-Skopje dialogue to resume and will promote it through the  diplomatic delegation it recently established in Skopje.  Papoulias denied that there is a U.S. initiative on Skopje.    [Venizelos] Talks could continue under UN auspices if Skopje  made the right goodwill moves; they are not a Greek demand or  request, but an obvious prerequisite derived from international  law. Again, we call upon Skopje to comply with this obligation.  [end recording]</p>

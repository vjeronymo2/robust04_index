			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Michel Lamy: "Juppe Hopes To Obtain </F> European Code of Good Conduct From Athens"]    [Text] Today marks the first official meeting in Athens  between the French foreign minister and the European Union  Presidency. The risks of "skidding" off course appear to be  diminishing.    How can a country so far removed from the diplomatic and  economic criteria of the European Community serve as a center of  initiatives during its Presidency of the European Union? During  an official visit to Athens today, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  would like to be given some assurances. Admittedly, the strong  anxiety prevalent in Brussels regarding the six-month term of  Greek administration has diminished somewhat.    After several explosive statements -- aimed primarily at  German Chancellor Kohl -- the government under Andreas  Papandreou is now displaying a spirit of conciliation.    Greece must serve as a "bridge" between the Balkans and the  Twelve, assured newly elected Socialist Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou on 23 October 1993 during his inaugural speech before  the Parliament. Words, uttered in the wake of an impassioned  electoral campaign, matched by statements on the "defense of  national integrity and the consolidation of Hellenism." Which  ultimately boils down to the Macedonian question, and the  quarrel regarding the name of the Republic of Skopje. The  establishment of diplomatic relations by the Twelve at the end  of December, just before the Greek Presidency, will in fact have  helped to defuse the situation. Andreas Papandreou has just  announced his desire to resume negotiations with Skopje, and the  nationalist virulence has dropped a key. The de-escalation is  such that the conflict has almost deteriorated into deciding the  question of flags.  <H5>  On Track for Enlargement </H5>   Consequently, the pact of stability sought by France to  stabilize the respective borders and protect the relevant  minorities -- the conference has been scheduled for May --  should be well received. Anyway, Athens remains pro-Atlantic  above all, and their U.S. ally is particularly cherished -- even  if only to checkmate Turkey.    Joint actions in the name of common foreign and security  policy are also planned, vis-a-vis South Africa or Russia for  example. Furthermore, formal accession to the WEU [Western  European Union], the armed wing of the Union, is well on the way.    The main concern in the treatment of more specifically  "European Union"-related dossiers is enlargement, i.e., the  candidacy of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Athens  subscribes to the main principle, namely that the Community's  achievements should be respected. The Greek Presidency also  intends to accelerate negotiations aimed at keeping to the 1  March deadline. The only point of friction is the Greek  Government's decision to create a committee of wise men to lay  the foundations for the major institutional reform planned for  1996. Paris fears it will proceed along false trails and come  up with formulae favoring the...small countries. The "large"  countries are currently drawing up a strategy aimed at avoiding  any drifting or impasse. Germany, France, and Spain, which will  follow Greece with their subsequent presidencies, intend to  constitute a triumvirate in an attempt to ensure that the chosen  strategies are continued in the long term.    When it comes to the respective interests of the two  capitals, Alain Juppe has no particular grievances. The Greeks  are rather firm when it comes to launching protective  procedures, and agriculture does not really lend itself to a  row. So should he allow himself to be seduced by Greek  goodwill? Alain Juppe will test its robustness in the course of  his talks.    Incontestably, the international image of the Greek  Government and of its leader is not very strong. When he last  left office, Andreas Papandreou left behind a virtually bankrupt  country, merrily flouting any budgetary discipline. Financed  primarily by the European Union -- the net transfers from  Brussels represented approximately 20 percent of Greece's net  foreign currency receipts -- Athens ought to undertake to  respect a European code of good conduct. At least until the end  of June.</p>

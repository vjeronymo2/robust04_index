			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Sunday Times price slashed The Sunday Times announced last night that it was halving the price of the paper to 50p tomorrow, Raymond Snoddy writes. The move immediately raised fears that Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, intended to intensify the national newspaper price-cutting war from his flagship daily titles The Sun and The Times to his dominant title in the sunday broadsheet market, The Sunday Times, which routinely sells more than the combined sales of its immediate opposition at an average 1.2m per Sunday. However, the price cut has been co-ordinated with the serialisation of The Prince of Wales - A Biography which starts its three-week run tomorrow. All the signs last night were that News International has cut the cover price of the newspaper to boost sales during the serialisation of the royal book. The company declined to say how long the price cut would last, but it seemed extremely unlikely that it would run beyond the serialisation unless astonishing circulation gains are achieved. Although sales of The Sun and The Times have risen, it is highly unlikely that the increased sales have covered the loss in revenue. To consider selling The Sunday Times for 50p for longer than a token period would seriously affect the company's income.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Carbide fights plastic decision US chemicals company Union Carbide has challenged yesterday's go-ahead from the European Commission for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture between the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison. The two European companies had made last-minute concessions on their control of polypropylene manufacturing technologies in order to overcome accusations that they would breach EU competition law. But Union Carbide said it was considering an appeal to the European Court. 'We do not share the European Commission's view that the changes to the proposed venture eliminate anti-trust concern,' said the company. The joint operation, known as Montell, will have a market share estimated by Shell at 18-19 per cent, making it easily the world's biggest polypropylene manufacturer. Polypropylene is a tough plastic widely used by the car industry for such items as bumpers and battery casings. The Commission approved the deal on condition that Montedison kept control of Spheripol, its proprietary method for the polypropylene manufacture. Shell Oil, the US arm of Royal Dutch/Shell, already has control over another manufacturing technology, Unipol, through a separate venture with Union Carbide. The concessions put forward ensured Montell would not contravene EU competition rules, said the Commission.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSINESS SALES, INVENTORIES RISE SLIGHTLY IN AUG.  </P> <P> U.S. business inventories increased 0.5% in August while sales advanced 2.1%  during the month, the Commerce Department announced today.  </P> <P> Huge inventories are usually a sign of hard times ahead, but businesses seem to  be keeping their stockpiles of unsold goods under control.  </P> <P> "We are not heading toward a major inventory correction that would lead the  economy into recession," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank  in Pittsburgh. "Businesses are better able to keep a firm hand on their  inventories."  </P> <P> In July, inventories climbed 0.7% and sales dipped 0.4%, according to the data  compiled by the department's Census Bureau.  </P> <P> Inventories totaled $806.48 billion in August against $802.15 billion in July,  and sales totaled $551.86 billion in August against $540.37 billion in July,  adjusted for seasonal factors.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department also said in its monthly report that the  inventory-to-sales ratio, which tracks product delivery time, slipped to 1.46  in August from 1.48 in July.  </P> <P> Retailers' inventories scored the biggest gain in August, a 1.3% jump, hinting  perhaps that consumers were more conservative with their money after Iraq's  invasion of oil-rich Kuwait early in the month.  </P> <P> "Consumers are becoming cautious about spending," said Cynthia Latta, an  economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. "By the time they fill up  their gas tanks to go to the mall, they don't have enough money to spend at the  mall."  </P></p>

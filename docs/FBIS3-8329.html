The  ceremony, which took place without the participation of the  press, was marked by the presence of Romanian Prime Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu. The ceremony was also attended by Lieutenant  General Niculae Spiroiu, former minister of national defense,  and other members of the leadership of the Ministry and the  Superior Military Council of the Armed Forces.    After the ceremony Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca granted  an  interview to our reporters in which he expressed the hope that  his dialogue with the military will be a very good one. The  appointment of a civilian as head of the Defense Ministry, Mr.  Tinca said, is part of a process aimed at modernizing our  various structures, a process that we assumed by ourselves, as  it was not imposed but rather merely suggested by European  bodies.    Tinca also expressed his hope that the Armed Forces will  benefit from his experience as a diplomat in its relations with  parliament, the political parties, and other state bodies. He  said that he will promote values such as calmness, tactfulness,  sincerity, honesty and noted that he preferred open discussions  to the benefit of the Armed Forces and the country.    At noon today at the headquarters of the Romanian Interior  Ministry, in the presence of Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and  members of the Interior Ministry Collegium, a ceremony was held  to install new Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila.    In his speech Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu presented the  personality of the new minister, pointing out that the  appointment of a civilian personality to lead that ministry is  part of the broad process of the country's democratization and  its adaptation to the practices and standards of the advanced  democracies.    After assessing the previous activity of the Ministry as  positive, Vacaroiu thanked the former interior minister,  Lieutenant General George Ioan Danescu, who was appointed state  secretary and deputy of the interior minister.    New Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila stated that he will  firmly act to continue reform and to boost the efficiency of  actions aimed at fighting the phenomenon of infractions and the  scourge of corruption and at ensuring law and public order.    Lieutenant General George Ioan Danescu mentioned a few  issues  in which the Ministry of Interior achieved progress over the  past year and pointed out that in his new capacity he will work  to improve the entire activity of the Ministry. The newly  appointed interior minister is currently holding a news  conference.</p>

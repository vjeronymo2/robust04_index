			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television Thirty years ago, helpers at the community centre for Bangladeshis in London's Brick Lane had to read and write love-letters for their clients. Now they negotiate for billion-pound property developments. This is just one of the changes identified in Story of a Community (Channel 4 at 11.35pm), first of a fascinating two-part documentary on the Bangladeshi community in this ramshackle corner of east London which is now 'the heart of Bangladesh' for thousands of its inhabitants. 'Who now remembers the massacre of the Armenians?'. Goebbel's famous rhetorical question today should hardly need any answer - outside Turkey that is, where the nicest, most cultivated folk will earnestly assure you that no such event ever took place. Secret History: The Hidden Holocaust (Channel 4 at 9pm) returns to this melancholy chapter in the history of the genocidal twentieth century. Actress Helen Mirren's many admirers will need no urging to switch on for the second half of Prime Suspect (ITV at 9pm), repeat of a memorable and prize-winning thriller.</p>

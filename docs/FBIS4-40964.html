			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Livshits: "Anyone Who Wants To Buy a </F> House Can Pay by Installments. Aleksandr Livshits, Head of the  Russian Federation President's Group of Experts, Comments on the  Latest Edicts Aimed at Developing the Reforms"]    [Text] The edicts signed by the president affect the  interests of millions of Russians. In the first place, this  relates to documents offering people new opportunities for  solving the housing problem.    Three edicts were signed: on housing credits, on housing  certificates, and on the sale of unfinished houses. As for  housing credits, government decree No. 1278, dated 10 December  1993, approved the statutes on granting Russian citizens in need  of better housing conditions free subsidies to build or acquire  housing. Consequently, it is a matter for the government, which  must keep its word.    More significant is the edict on housing certificates, which  enables anyone wishing to do so to buy housing by installments.  Under the president's edict, corporate bodies that have the  requisite documents, a plot of land, and a house that is in the  process of being built, are entitled to issue a new type of  security, a "housing certificate," provided they have gone  through the obligatory Finance Ministry licensing process and  their activities in connection with the certificates are  guaranteed by a bank or some other credit institution.    Any Russian citizen will be able to buy a certificate and  pay  for it gradually, initially, for example, by buying one square  meter, thus gradually accumulating the housing space. The  certificates are absolutely liquid, that is, they can be sold.  But if a citizen has accumulated 30 percent of an apartment,  then under the Statutes he is entitled to apply to the issuing  body (the one that bought up the property) and conclude a  contract for the apartment, bearing in mind that the remaining  forms of payment are already regulated. Certainly, further  instructions are needed from the Finance Ministry and Central  Bank, but the way is clear to making it easier to tackle the  housing problem.    On the one hand, there are now people who have money and  want  to buy apartments. On the other hand, we have finished or  almost finished construction projects and houses. Construction  organizations are building or are prepared to build. The idea  behind housing certificates is that they bring together the  interests of those who want to buy apartments and those who have  housing to offer. But all this must be strictly supervised by  the state.</p>

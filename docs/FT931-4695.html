			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / BES sponsors reject attack from Labour SPONSORS of the Business Expan-sion Scheme defended it yesterday after Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, called for a 'misuse' of the scheme, which has already raised Pounds 266m, to be abolished in the Budget. He said on Monday that a scheme using loans to BES investors turned 'the misery of the repossessed homeless into a tax-avoidance opportunity'. Investments in BES companies, which buy property and let it under assured-tenancy provisions for at least five years, are eligible for income tax relief at the investor's top marginal rate. Mr Brown complained about a legislative loophole, first exploited last September, which allows loans to be made to BES investors using only the value of their BES shares as security. These loans have made it possible for top-rate taxpayers to pay only basic rate tax and to leave their investment after six months rather than the five years originally intended. Large lenders have avoided bad-debt write-offs by transferring their repossessed housing stock to BES companies. Lenders which have taken advantage of the scheme include Barclays Bank, TSB, Bank of Scotland, Bank of Ireland, Hill Samuel, and Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Britannia, Leeds Permanent, National &amp; Provincial, and Portman building societies. A total of Pounds 266m has been raised via loan-backed schemes since they were introduced last September, and between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m is available for investment. The potential cost to the Treasury could exceed Pounds 200m for this tax year alone. Mr Ian Pugh, a BES analyst with the Allenbridge Group, one of the two main intermediaries dealing with BES investors, describes the loan-backed schemes as 'pure arbitrage'. Shares are sold for Pounds 1 and after six months loans are offered, typically of 74p or 75p per Pounds 1 invested. For top-rate taxpayers, who should have received 40p tax relief for each Pounds 1, this means an annualised return of about 25 per cent. The loans are repaid by the BES shares once the normal five-year qualifying period has elapsed. Meanwhile the lenders have received very cheap finance. The schemes have attracted heavy demand. Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson Fry, which launched the first non-recourse loan scheme in conjunction with TSB Mortgage Express, said: 'It's good for people whose houses have been repossessed because the property is sold for the higher of two independent valuations.' He said the schemes were good value for the government compared with the alternative of direct subsidies. Only Pounds 250m of the Pounds 750m allocated by the government to housing associations last autumn to buy housing had been used to buy repossessions, with about 5,000 properties being bought. Mr Fry's views were echoed by Mr Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES Association. 'The figures are straightforward,' he said. 'Ten thousand properties (Pounds 500m) through BES, with private investors contributing, costs the government Pounds 200m in tax relief at 40 per cent. Five thousand houses as a direct grant cost Pounds 250m. Which method is more efficient at helping to get liquidity, and hence confidence, into the housing market?'</p>

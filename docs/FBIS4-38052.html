			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Turnabout in Rabin's Position"] </F>   [Text] Up until several days ago, there was a consensus  that the government, with its commitment to the principle of  freedom of religion and free access to the holy sites of all  religions, would prevent Yasir 'Arafat from visiting the Temple  Mount (Haram al- Sharif). The prime minister's announcement,  made public in two Friday afternoon newspapers, came as a  surprise and created a new situation.    "As a Muslim, 'Arafat, is entitled to visit Jerusalem, just  like any other Muslim. If he wishes to pray, that would be his  right. There would be a problem of timing and arrangements, but  in principle our reply would be positive." That is how Yitzhaq  Rabin responded when asked whether he was inviting 'Arafat to  visit Jerusalem. The prime minister avoided responding in the  negative, and by putting the stress on 'Arafat's right -- "like  any other Muslim" -- to worship in a place holy to the Muslims  (the al-Aqsa mosque), it could be seen as an invitation. The  reservations about timing and arrangements appear to be minor  points compared with the positive reply in principle.    Is the prime minister so naive as to believe that the PLO  leader's appearance at Haram al-Sharif would not be far more  than just a religious event? We should not think he is being  naive: He does not need too much imagination to foresee how  'Arafat's praying at the al-Aqsa mosque and his visit to the  Dome of the Rock would have an impact on the Muslim population.  They will be elated by his visit, East Jerusalem will become a  PLO bastion, and the Arabs in the territories will regard  Israeli permission for the visit -- supposedly meant to honor  the Muslim holy places -- as a move toward the Israel  Government's agreement to the guest's nationalist- political  demands for Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem. That is  how Arafat's appearance, under the guise of being a Muslim  pilgrim, will be seen in the Arab world as well.    Israel's commitment to freedom of access to the holy places  of all religions, as expressed in the Declaration of  Independence, is, of course, known to the prime minister. He is  right in saying that "we cannot insist on united Jerusalem being  Israel's capital without permitting freedom of access to members  of other religions." But expressing a readiness to permit  'Arafat to worship on the Temple Mount at this time does not  necessarily evolve from that understanding.    Has the prime minister been won over to the opinion of  former  adviser Jacques Neriya that 'Arafat might be offended if Israel  refuses to permit him to pray on Haram al-Sharif, considering  the fact that Rabin, in his Strasbourg speech, invited Mu'ammar  al- Qadhdhafi to fulfill that religious decree? Did Rabin plan  to permit the PLO leader to precede the Hashemite king? In his  newspaper interview, Rabin mentioned al-Qadhdhafi, President al-  Asad, and the Saudi monarch, and his failure to mention the  Jordanian monarch is striking in that context. Can Rabin's  willingness to compromise with the PLO leader be explained by  his understanding that it is impossible to keep him restricted  to Jericho?    It is difficult to believe that the prime minister is  unaware  of the political consequences of 'Arafat's praying at the  al-Aqsa mosque. What right does he have to denounce opposition  spokesmen who "say that such visits (meaning Nabil Sha'th's  visit, which the government prevented) put into question  Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem, which is a big mistake."  Up to Friday, Rabin thought just like those leaders of the  right-wing parties.    In view of the possibility that Yasir 'Arafat might be  coming  to pray at al-Aqsa, the attempts to restrict PLO political  activities in East Jerusalem seem impractical. We can insist  that "no body with a role in the Palestinian Authority will be  located in Jerusalem," but if 'Arafat is permitted to come to  Jerusalem's Old City, how will we be able to complain about the  activities of Faysal al-Husayni and his friends?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from  16 NATO countries agreed here today to develop "constructive  relations" with Russia, which they believe can make an important  contribution to European stability and security.    In a joint communique released at the end of the North  Atlantic Council meeting, the alliance reaffirmed its strong  support for political and economic reform in Russia and  recognized the important role Russia can play on a wide range of  issues.    "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual  respect,  benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said  the communique.    NATO foreign ministers especially expected that Russia will  also join the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program and work out  an "extensive and far-reaching individual plan, corresponding to  its size, importance, capabilities and willingness to contribute  to the pursuit of shared objectives."    The PFP program, unveiled at January's NATO summit in  Brussels, was designed to prevent a security vacuum by offering  Warsaw Pact countries the prospect of eventual membership of the  alliance, but this was interpreted by Russian nationalists as an  attempt by the West to extend its influence into Russia's  frontiers.    During the one-day NAC spring meeting held in Istanbul, NATO  ministers reviewed the implementation of the January summit  decisions and voiced their particular satisfaction with the  positive reception of the PFP initiative.    In the context of PFP, the first peace-keeping exercises  will  take place this autumn in the Netherlands and Poland, said the  communique.    However, the NATO ministers maintained that the dialogue  with  former Warsaw Pact countries mof [must of] course, affect NATO's  right to take its own decisions on its own responsibility by  consensus of its members."    In a bid to enhance the alliance's ability to respond to  crisis, NATO ministers vowed to continue their work on the  "combined joint task forces."    Concerning the conflict in the former Yugoslavia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], the joint communique urged the  parties to reach a political settlement at the negotiating table  and not on the battlefield.    The North Atlantic Council called for a full and timely  implementation of the existing disarmament agreements.    A number of other regional issues including tensions in the  southern Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international  institutions were discussed as well at the NAC meeting.</p>

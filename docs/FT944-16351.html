			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 1.4% to end above 20,000 level Buying by arbitrageurs and overseas investors lifted prices, and the Nikkei 225 average gained for the third consecutive day, rising above the 20,000 level for the first time in a month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index advanced 268.26, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,089.72 after a day's low of 19,846.77 and high of 20,115.22. Arbitrage buying and purchases of blue chip shares by foreigners countered selling by financial institutions and investment trusts. Volume totalled 280m shares, against 199.3m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 16.76, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,600.60 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.96, or 1 per cent, at 293.22. Advances led declines by 812 to 193, with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 1.80 to 1,319.96. 'Improving economics, the currency movement and the approach of the final leg of the Japan Tobacco fiasco is encouraging investors,' said Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg. He added that although around 70 per cent of prospective buyers in Japan Tobacco were expected to have given up their purchase rights, this reflected the inadequacy of the new issues system and not the stock market's current level. Traders also said fears of over-supply from the JT listing had been alleviated by reports that the Ministry of Finance would refrain from offering unsold shares from the second round of subscriptions on the market at the time of the stock listing. Japan Telecom, the telecommunications operator, rose Y100,000 to Y3.99m, while DDI moved up Y45,000 to Y933,000, recovering the Y900,000 mark for the first time in a month. Mitsubishi Bank, which will be taking a majority stake in Nippon Trust Bank, a financially troubled trust bank, climbed Y70 to Y2,620. Overseas investors bought chemical and steel shares. NKK, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y3 to Y290, while Mitsubishi Chemical gained Y18 at Y567. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 171.15 to 22,286.19 in volume of 17.2m shares. Roundup Strength overnight on Wall Street helped many of the region's markets to advance. TAIPEI ended sharply higher on hopes that the government would take action to prevent a further fall in the market, which has been rocked by default payments over the past week. The weighted index rallied 371.07, or 6 per cent, to 6,495.78 in TDollars 87.66bn turnover. Hualon was the most active issue and rose by the daily permitted 7 per cent limit to TDollars 19.90, but Taiwan Tea, a subsidiary, fell TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 63. HONG KONG finished 1.8 per cent up but off the day's highs following a late surge in afternoon trade on buying of China-related stocks and Hong Kong Telecom on expectations that the group would announce a China venture along with Cable and Wireless later in the day. The Hang Seng index added 170.03 at 9,532.35 after an intraday peak of 9,549.22. Hongkong Telecom put on 85 cents, or 5.5 per cent, at HKDollars 16.25. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong rose 61.95, or 4.7 per cent, to 1,380.80. In the opposite direction, Ming Pao, publisher of one of Hong Kong's best read upmarket newspapers, fell 5.5 per cent after a two-day suspension prompted by revelations that Mr Yu Pun-hoi, the chairman, had a criminal record. The stock lost 30 cents at HKDollars 5.20, after HKDollars 5. SEOUL finished at a second consecutive record high as blue chips rebounded strongly, overcoming selective profit-taking. The composite index rose 11.00 to 1,089.66, responding to comments by the finance minister that rules for foreigners' stock investment would be eased from next year. SINGAPORE extended Tuesday's rebound as investors were cheered by Wall Street's sharp rise and receding fears of a Gulf war. The Straits Times Industrial index moved forward 23.08 to 2,368.31. KUALA LUMPUR continued to rally on technical buying, fuelled by the overnight Wall Street surge, and the composite index improved 8.71 to 1,137.00. However, volume was limited, with investors cautiously awaiting the outcome of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) supreme council meeting late in the day where the recent clash between the prime minister and an UMNO youth leader was expected to be discussed. MANILA was supported by a late round of bargain hunting on expectations of strong corporate earnings in the third quarter. The composite index gained 23.51 at 2,970.46. SYDNEY drifted lower, showing little response to the overnight Wall Street rise. The All Ordinaries index eased 1.0 to 2,002.6 in turnover of ADollars 408.7m. WELLINGTON was led higher by Telecom, up 12 cents at NZDollars 5.35, and leading forestry stocks which were helped by a strong US lumber futures market. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 31 to 2,056.80.</p>

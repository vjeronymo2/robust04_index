She replies, "OK, but don't forget  the chip card." Benjamin routinely pays the baker with the card.    "Where did you last see a doctor?" asks the physician in  Munich. He is talking to the tourist from Hamburg who is having  heart trouble. Instead of answering, the patient inserts the  medical insurance record chip card into the physician's  computer, releases the data stored in the chip using his  personal identification number, and allows the doctor to read  the patient's history.    "Please insert your chip card," requests the screen of the  new arrival. Only after comparing the typed code with the code  stored on the chip card does the computer network become enabled  for the user.    Paying, storing, unlocking. The variety of applications of  the plastic card is virtually inexhaustible thanks to the  integrated chip that may contain a complete minicomputer. The  handy medium is opening completely new possibilities of drumming  up customers primarily for the service branch. "The present  applications are just scratching the surface," says  Hans-Dietrich Kreft. He is the managing director of Angewandte  Digital Elektronik (ADE) from Dassendorf in North Germany. Kreft  is one of the most committed trail blazers of the chip-card  technology. The untiring promoter was among the winners in 1987  of the innovation prize of the German economy. Today, he can be  certain that the chip card is conquering the world with mass  applications.    The Europeans, in particular the French and Germans, are the  front runners. They have an important advantage, "the larger  domestic market," says Winfried Gaal. He is the product manager  at Giesecke &amp; Devrient (G&amp;D), a chip-card manufacturer  in Munich.    After successfully introducing the phonecard, the Germans  are  now reaching for the chip twice with the medical-insurance chip  card and a new Euroscheck [check guarantee] chip card. While the  electronic substitute for the medical insurance record card will  be introduced starting on the first of January 1994, the new  'ec' chip card will presumably be available in 1995, according  to information from the banking branch. About 120 million chip  cards will be necessary just for these two applications.    The European electronics industry, which has not exactly  been  spoiled, is the beneficiary. "The chip card can become a new  pillar for the European semiconductor industry," predicts Ulrich  Hamann. He is the director of marketing for chip-card ICs at  Siemens AG.    Besides Motorola as the only non-European, just Siemens,  Bull, SGS-Thomson and Philips possess the necessary know-how and  fabrication capacities at this time. Due to this, the ranking of  vendors is unusual for electronics conditions. With 30 per cent  of the market, both Siemens and Motorola are running neck and  neck, followed by SGS-Thomson and Philips. Hitachi appears in  fifth place as the first Japanese chip manufacturer. It has a  skimpy six per cent of the market. The Europeans have fallen by  the wayside in the triad competition. However, they may be able  to experience another success story with the chip card similar  to that for the GSM standard for cellular telephones. This has  proven to be an export hit.    In any case, the timing of the market introduction is  perfect. The insurance card does not appear to make sense at  first glance because the potential of the chip is not fully  exploited. Only the data present on the medical insurance record  card are stored. The physician prints out a standardized form  with these data and continues to handwrite his services on this  form. However, this is just what the semiconductor manufacturers  want. On the one hand, "Using these relatively simple chips, we  can learn how to stabilize our production process," according to  the Siemens expert Hamann. On the other hand, the corresponding  readers and physician's computers will create an infrastructure  that will subsequently enable the use of more demanding chip  cards.    Consequently, the big bang in the card industry is set.  Market surveys by Siemens claim that the world market for the  chips the size of a finger nail will grow from 160 million marks  last year to almost 1,000 million marks in 1997. Of this amount,  the German chip manufacturer wants half. Axel Hartstang is the  managing director of the German subsidiary of Motorola. He  expects that sales of less than 50 million cards currently will  grow almost ten times to more than 400 million within five years.    In this respect, the chips are only a fraction of the  business. They must be integrated into the card and personalized  for the individual user by special service providers. For image  reasons, marketing strategies allow the plastic substrate to  accept high-quality printing. In addition, the system operates  only with readers.    With the domestic market and technical lead, the Europeans  have the best chance of dominating the world market over the  long term. Card producers such as G&amp;D, Orga Kartensysteme,  Oldenburg, Gemplus and Schlumberger are already supplying their  products to the burgeoning markets in Australia, Brazil, South  Africa and Hong Kong. Success is beckoning Siemens even into the  lion's den. The conglomerate from Munich is on the verge of  completing deals with Dai Nippon Printing and Toppan, two of the  largest printing firms in the world. The company from Munich is  to supply chips to Japan. The chips will be installed in cards  there.    The Europeans have also been working flat out on chips that  offer processors and complex operating systems (so-called  controllers). Courageously, they are now defying Motorola, the  vendor previously dominant in this sector. These open systems  form the prerequisite for so-called multifunctional cards. Such  cards allow not only one special application but can even be  equipped with new functions later.    Consequently, according to the plans of the Central Credit  Committee (ZKA), the owners of the new 'ec' cards will not just  be able to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines and make  telephone calls. These cards will also function as electronic  wallets. To allow for the transfer of small amount such as  paying for bread, the chips are loaded with specific sums which  can be paid out little by little. For larger amounts, a credit  line is stored on the card. Even the primitive medical insurance  chip card will be extended to a comprehensive patient card over  the long term. Then, it will store data regarding accidents and  portions of the medical history in addition to management  specifications.    Such multifunctional cards could also work as tickets for  buses and trains. While buying the correct ticket at an automat  is more of a game of chance today--primarily in strange  cities--the electronics does everything for the user of the chip  card. "Because of this, we are hoping to reduce the inhibition  threshold and get more customers to use public transportation,"  says Achim Muller. He is the managing director and consultant  for the cities of Luneburg and Oldenburg.    Without having to study any sort of schedule, the rider  inserts his card into a reader when entering and exiting. The  central computer can then not only determine the cheapest fare.  Frequent riders also get a discount. In Luneburg, no rider pays  more within 30 days than the price of a monthly ticket.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Moscow force to fight mafia ARMED men in ski-masks and camouflage uniforms were yesterday presented as the Russian interior ministry's New Year gift to the people. Major-general Mikhail Yegorov, the first deputy minister, said the men - a few of them on display at a news conference yesterday - were part of a new rapid deployment force set up by presidential decree to fight the mafia. A government gift of 19,000 extra men plus helicopters, armoured vehicles and various weapons would help local police combat ordinary crime when necessary, he said. General Yegorov added that the government had also provided funds for extra judges to try cases in addition to auditors to examine crooked documents. 'The best present which law enforcers can offer is the exposure of criminal groups and to give people the feeling they will be safe walking the streets on New Year's Eve,' said the ministry's press officer. A video was then shown to journalists to illustrate various cases of corruption and organised crime uncovered around the country as a result of the government's drive against corruption. Gen Yegorov said about 3,000 criminal organisations, with tens of thousands of members, were operating in Russia - many with foreign connections. Half their revenue was spent on bribing officials. Of 1,541 criminal cases of official corruption, 400 were linked to organised crime. Bribe-taking had gone up 27 per cent on 1991, with large scale theft up 6.4 per cent. Three hundred officials had been sacked for violating another presidential ban on combining government service with private business activities. According to the interior ministry, the most corruption is in the banking system - which has been defrauded of billions of roubles by criminal gangs with support from banking officials. It was also prevalent in state organisations responsible for raw materials, the privatisation of state property, and the conversion of military factories to civilian uses. The interior ministry has also uncovered a number of cases of corruption within the military involving the illicit sale of military equipment and within the judiciary. Gen Yegorov said that ultimately corruption was a 'social' problem - whose causes - such as the low pay of civil servants and law enforcers  - also need to be addressed.</p>

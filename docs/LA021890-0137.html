			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEP RIGHT UP: SEE A SPACE SHUTTLE ROCKET HIGH;  </P> <P> SPACE: WATCHING A SHUTTLE ROCKET SKYWARD  </P> <P> This state has its share of offbeat spectacles: gator wrastlin' in the  Everglades. Conch-shell blowing in the Keys. Baseball in March everywhere.  </P> <P> But one of Florida's most stellar sights is the earthshaking, fire-belching  blastoff of a space shuttle.  </P> <P> Few can resist the chance to see a rocket burning toward the stars. The sheer  majesty of a liftoff has caused truckers piloting 18-wheelers to stop dead in  their tracks on Interstate 95. Night launches, in particular, draw viewers by  the tens of thousands.  </P> <P> But day or night, a scheduled launch is reason enough for visitors to make a  detour to the Kennedy Space Center area on Cape Canaveral.  </P> <P> Before every shuttle launch, and often before commercial rockets lift off from  Kennedy Space Center, the parks, roadways and beaches of Titusville, Cocoa  Beach and Cape Canaveral clog with spectators.  </P> <P> Impromptu recreational vehicle encampments pop up along U.S. 1, parks fill at  absurdly early hours and fast-food joints do land-office business. Souvenir  hawkers make the rounds with T-shirts, caps, models and anything else that  might sell.  </P> <P> From every direction, binoculars are trained on the distant launch pad (several  are used at Kennedy Space Center), where the shuttle lies pointing toward the  sky and bathed in beams of bright light.  </P> <P> Weather -- and whether it will permit a successful launch -- is often the major  topic of conversation. On the clear night before the January launch of the  Columbia the skies seemed promising, but forecasts were iffy. (Morning clouds  would postpone the launch until the following day.)  </P> <P> "There's a ring around the moon," said one elderly shuttle watcher, looking up  at a cloud-circled moon. "That means something about the weather, but I forget  what."  </P> <P> Some spectators become instant experts on such arcana as the launch window (the  precise time frame within which liftoff must occur), satellite deployment and  recovery, and other space shuttle mission tasks.  </P> <P> During the wait, portable TVs and radios are tuned to keep up with  late-breaking developments at NASA's Mission Control.  </P> <P> Once the countdown begins in earnest, suspense sets in as all eyes turn to the  launch area. As the countdown enters its final phase, the spectators join in.  "5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . liftoff," they chant.  </P> <P> First there is eerie silence, as if somebody forget to flip the switch. Then  flames ignite the sky. Seconds later a dull roar rattles across the flats. The  earth shudders. A barely seen craft rises, tracing a fiery parabola across the  sky and trailing a smoky signature in its wake. The crowd cheers. Space shuttle  Columbia has just lifted off.  </P> <P> To see the launch, thousands had to first grapple with the question: Where to  watch?  </P> <P> Before choosing, they had to decide whether they wanted a glimpse of the rocket  as it lifts off from the pad, or a good view of the booster rockets dropping  off. And they had to select a site from among the literally hundreds of spots  peppering more than 20 miles of beach front.  </P> <P> Many seasoned spectators rate the booster drop the most impressive sight. And  for that, the preferred spot is Jetty Park in Port Canaveral.  </P> <P> There, a ridge hides the liftoff but the rocket, once airborne, usually passes  almost directly overhead and -- while still in sight -- drops its boosters over  the Atlantic. (Just to put things in perspective, by the time you're back in  your car, the shuttle might be flying over Africa.)  </P> <P> Though the small park is a bit harder to find than some of the other viewing  spots, and traffic is likely to hem you in a bit longer, the view is good  enough to lure newspaper photographers from throughout Central and South  Florida.  </P> <P> Capacity at Jetty Park is limited to 500 or 600 cars, so arrive early.  Campgrounds there are often already full with overnighters sleeping in tents or  RVs.  </P> <P> Those who would rather see the moment of liftoff should head for U.S. 1 in  Titusville and get a parking spot there early. Binoculars are a must; the site  is nearly 15 miles from the launch pad. The town allows parking along U.S. 1  for 24 hours before a scheduled launch (RVs lined the road the night before the  January liftoff of the Columbia).  </P> <P> The best spots are south of the junction with Florida 402, especially Sand  Point Park and Bird Watchers Park. Get into position at least two or three  hours before launch time.  </P> <P> The drawback to watching from Titusville is that after blasting off, the  shuttle rocket often veers south and east away from you.  </P> <P> Other hot spots for shuttle watching include sites along the Banana River, the  waterway separating Cape Canaveral from mainland Florida, particularly on  either side of the Florida 528 causeway.  </P> <P> A somewhat more relaxed setting might be Cocoa Beach Pier, where you can settle  back in a restaurant and watch the launch over a meal.  </P> <P> If a shuttle launch doesn't fit into your vacation plans, or if you would like  to learn a bit more about the space programs before seeing a liftoff, you can  get in an appropriately starry state of mind at Kennedy Space Center's  Spaceport USA. It's on the grounds of the Kennedy Space Center on Cape  Canaveral.  </P> <P> Upon entering the park, visitors are greeted by a forestry grove of upright  rockets. You will feel like a Lilliputian lost amid the massive Gemini-Titans,  Atlas-Agenas, Deltas and Junos.  </P> <P> Head to the numerous displays of space artifacts scattered throughout several  buildings. Before getting too engrossed, buy tickets for the spectacular Imax  movie "The Dream is Alive" and/or the Space Center bus tour. For either  attraction, waits may be upward of two hours.  </P> <P> In some of the display areas it is back to the dawn of the Space Age via  Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules, space suits, moon rocks and such. You will  also get a glimpse of high-tech space spinoffs -- telecommunications, plastics  and electronics gear that have changed the way we live. In one exhibit you can  poke your head into the simulated cabin of a shuttle vehicle.  </P> <P> Despite all the displays, the Imax movie is the star of the Spaceport show.  Shown on a 5 1/2-story screen, "The Dream is Alive" features stunning footage  shot in space by astronauts.  </P> <P> From its thundering takeoff scenes to the final walk-in-space sequences, this  is the movie that truly portrays the sense of wonder in the exploration of  space.  </P> <P> You will see technicians cry with joy as rockets bound into the sky, watch  astronauts cope with floating food and witness godlike vistas of planet Earth  as seen from orbit -- all in incredible razor-sharp, big-as-life detail.  </P> <P> The bus tours pale by comparison. There are two choices for this rather  lifeless two-hour jaunt. One visits the sites of current manned missions, while  the other provides a history of the early space program. Mostly what you will  see are lots of huge utilitarian buildings and some outsize machinery.  </P> <P> There are scheduled photo stops as well as stops at assorted displays. Though a  shuttle was on the launch pad during a recent visit, even on the bus's closest  approach the rocket-mounted shuttle was far too distant for a good picture and  was completely obscured by the gantry, the metal framework that provides access  to the shuttle.  </P> <P> After finishing the tours, you can stop in at Spaceport restaurants with such  cutesie names as the Lunch Pad and the Orbit Cafeteria.  </P> <P> Or you can battle the crowds in the souvenir shop, vying for shuttle cups,  mugs, pens, matches or patches. While you are there, you might grab an  Astronaut Space Dinner (freeze-dried beef stew, corn and chocolate pudding) to  sustain you on your own shuttle vigil.  </P> <P> This promises to be a banner year for liftoff lovers as NASA embarks on its  most ambitious program since the mid-'80s. This year the space agency will  blast 10 shuttle vehicles into orbit.  </P> <P> (Columbia lifted off Jan. 9; nine more launches are scheduled).  </P> <P> The next launch is set for late February. There's another in late April. For a  list of upcoming liftoffs, write to NASA, BOC-155, Kennedy Space Center, Fla.  32899.  </P> <P> Those who plan well in advance can write for a special pass permitting them  onto Space Center grounds for the closest possible view of a launch (about  seven miles from the launching pad).  </P> <P> About 2,000 free passes are issued for each launch date. They are parceled out  on a first-come, first-served basis. Those who write now could, with luck,  secure a space for a summer launch. For reservations or more information, write  to NASA Vehicle Passes, PA-PAS, Kennedy Space Center, Fla. 32899.  </P> <P> For information about visiting the Space Coast area of Florida, write to  Brevard County Tourist Development Council, P.O.

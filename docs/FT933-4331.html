			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Mates on board The last time Observer spoke to Lord Kingsdown, just before he retired as governor of the Bank of England in June, he said he would love to return to the private sector, though in his self-deprecating way he said he did not have a clue whether any big companies would wish to have him as a non-executive director. Yesterday the former Robin Leigh-Pemberton, chairman of NatWest till becoming governor in 1983, landed a directorship at Glaxo, the pharmaceutical company. There he will join Lord Howe, the former Geoffrey Howe, who has not played an insignificant role in Lord Kingsdown's past career. For it was Lord Howe who, as chancellor of the exchequer, offered Lord Kingsdown the governorship just before Christmas 1982.</p>

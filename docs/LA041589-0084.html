			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA TRACK TEAM WILL FACE BIG TEST  </P> <P> UCLA's four-year dual meet winning streak in track and field will be in  jeopardy at Drake Stadium today when the Bruins face Louisiana State and  Houston in a double dual meet.  </P> <P> UCLA has won 41 straight dual meets, one short of the school record set in  1972-76. To break the record, the Bruins would have to beat both LSU and  Houston.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Bob Larsen said he is not optimistic, particularly when discussing  LSU, because of injuries to three of his best athletes -- quarter-miler Steve  Lewis, sprinter Mike Marsh and hurdler Derek Knight.  </P> <P> Marsh, who ran 10.07 seconds in the 100 meters last weekend at Gainesville,  Fla., to set the school record, and Knight are expected to compete, although  the number of their events might be limited, but Lewis, the 1988 Olympic gold  medalist in the 400 meters, is doubtful.  </P> <P> "This is probably our toughest challenge in the last two years," said Larsen,  whose record in dual meets as UCLA's coach is 39-0. "Even if our people weren't  injured, we'd be saying (LSU) was a team capable of staying right with us."  </P> <P> Houston has an improved team led by Leroy Burrell, who recently won the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. indoor championship in the long jump and  finished second in the 55 meters.  </P> <P> UCLA's women also will compete in a double dual meet against LSU and Houston.  LSU won the national championship last year, beating runner-up UCLA by three  points. The Tigers are led by sprinter Dawn Sowell, who set the NCAA record in  the 100 meters last weekend with a 10.93 at the Texas Relays.  </P> <P> Field events will begin at 11:15 a.m., running events at 1:30 p.m. RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

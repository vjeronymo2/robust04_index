			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / An experiment to find a panacea for recession: The forays by bulk chemical groups into the speciality market The arrival last week of Laporte, the UK's largest speciality chemical group, in the takeover battle for Evode, one its brethren, has cast an unaccustomed light on the speciality chemicals sector. During the mid-1980s speciality chemicals groups became highly fashionable. In the previous recession, European and North American commodity groups had enviously eyed the performance of speciality groups. The concept behind speciality chemicals is quite simple, says Mr Ken Minton, Laporte chief executive. Whereas commodity chemicals are sold on price alone, specialities are sold for other considerations. The business differs from bulk chemicals because it is research-orientated, changing the product to meet the customer's need. With the advantage of low capital investment, higher than average growth rates and profits, speciality groups appeared inoculated against economic downturns. Imperial Chemical Industries, the international chemicals group, created a specialities division after estimating that in Europe and the US, the average return (operating profits as a percentage of average total assets) of speciality operations fell from 20 per cent in 1980 to 13 per cent in 1983. Those of bulk businesses dropped from 10 per cent to 2 per cent over the same period. The theory was that the European and North American commodity groups could acquire these speciality groups to offset the worst effects economic downturns. 'Virtually without exception, the commodities groups saw specialities as a panacea. During the mid-1980s, they launched themselves lemming-like into the sector,' says Ms Hilfra Tandy, editor of Chemical Matters, an industry newsletter. So much for the theory. During this recession, the reality has been rather different. Expectations among the large chemical groups that their speciality chemicals operations would balance the effects of cyclical commodity downturns have largely been dashed. While most small speciality groups have continued to prosper during the recession, the speciality divisions of most large chemicals combines have performed poorly. 'To be frank, the specialities experiment has been a disaster,' says Mr Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter. Take, for example, the operating margins of ICI's speciality chemicals division which fell from 9.3 per cent in 1989 to an estimated 3.8 per cent last year. The division is expected to be in loss in the fourth quarter of 1992. Meanwhile, in France, Rhone-Poulenc's speciality division had operating margins of 5 per cent in 1989, was in loss the following year, and generated margins of only 0.6 per cent in 1991. Its results are expected to have improved during 1992. The poor results of the large groups compare with margins of 14 per cent last year at Laporte and 16.3 per cent at Allied Colloids, another UK speciality group. Such comparisons are not totally fair. Defining a speciality chemical business is not easy. What might be defined as a speciality by ICI, could be interpreted as a commodity chemical by Allied Colloids. Moreover, different speciality operations offer varying margins. However, it is true to say that speciality chemicals businesses have fared better in small rather than large companies. One the reasons for the relative failure of the large groups is their inability to appreciate the cultural differences between commodity and speciality chemicals. 'A speciality customer is prepared to pay more because the supplier has a monopoly, or has a better product, or his salesmanship is better. A bulk chemical manufacturer is obsessed by production - cutting costs to improve margins. But for specialities, marketing becomes far more important than production chemistry,' explains Mr Minton. The key to marketing is to produce small batches of products specifically designed for the customer. The effect, according to Mr Minton, is that the customer is prepared to pay a premium for the tailored product. Mr Minton claims most large groups failed to understand this when they acquired their speciality groups. This reduced the speciality businesses' ability to react quickly to market demands. Mr Wamsley gives the example of the respective polyacrylamide businesses of Dow, the US giant, and Allied Colloids. He says during the mid-1980s Allied Colloids was generating 20 per cent growth a year and enjoyed high margins while Dow, Allied's main competitor, was losing money. 'Dow just couldn't compete. Allied was fast, flexible and customer-orientated. It was devising products for the customer. Dow had a range of products which it then sold. What's more it didn't provide the same levels of service,' says Mr Wamsley. The bulk companies were not discriminating when making acquisitions. 'The bulk chemicals groups were so large that they had to acquire large numbers of these small niche companies to make any difference to their overall performance. In the rush to acquire, some businesses were not well understood - some were rash,' says Mr Michael Bennett, director at consultants Arthur D Little. According to Mr Wamsley, some groups have decided the impact of specialities was negligible and could not justify the time, effort and costs involved in running them. For example, Union Carbide, the US giant, has disposed of most of its non-bulk activities. The proposed split of ICI into two groups, Zeneca with the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities operations, and the rump keeping the bulk chemicals business, is part of the trend. Not all believe the 1980s speciality strategy was mistaken. Ms Jackie Ashurst, European chemicals analyst at broker James Capel, says investors and the companies themselves may have been too impatient. Building up speciality businesses requires research and development effort as well as time. Although they have not proved successful in this recession, non-bulk chemicals may well triumph during the next downturn.  -------------------------------------------------------------       SPECIALITY CHEMICAL OPERATING MARGINS (PERCENT)  -------------------------------------------------------------                       1987     88     89     90    91     92*  ------------------------------------------------------------- ICI                    9.6    8.6    9.3    4.1   3.9    3.8  ------------------------------------------------------------- Laporte               10.9   13.3   14.3   15.6  14.0   14.2  ------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids       21.4   19.1   18.0   16.3  16.3   17.2  ------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids financial year-end is March of the following year.

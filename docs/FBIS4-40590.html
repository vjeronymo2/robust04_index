			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report in the "Position" column: "Andrey </F> Kozyrev: Hopeful Signs Are Emerging"]    [Text] Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  has described the situation around the DPRK as "tense."  According to him, Pyongyang's actions "contain a potential of  direct threat to Russia's security." This concerns its  statements on pulling out from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and the IAEA (true, no official documents have been  submitted yet) as well as the North Korean specialists' recent  "reloading" of their nuclear reactors, which, experts believe,  makes their inspection virtually impossible.    The minister said yesterday in the State Duma that the  emergence of a nuclear state in a "zone of tension," such as the  Korean Peninsula, and also in immediate proximity to our  borders, directly affects Russian interests. The situation is  complicated by the fact that the majority of "threshold" states  (i.e., those that are practically ready to produce nuclear  weapons) are located close to Russian Federation borders. So  far, Andrey Kozyrev said, they do not announce their nuclear  status, and it is important that "none of them should openly  defy the nonproliferation regime." "A precedent would be  impermissible," he stressed. According to the minister, we  already have a neighbor comparable in its nuclear-space  potential to the "superpowers" (presumably India -- P. Zh.).    One of the last resorts to influence North Korea, Kozyrev  said, are sanctions, and if "the DPRK goes to the end in  withdrawing from the nonproliferation regime, then the  international community will simply have nothing left to do" but  apply them. Talking about the position of China (which has so  far objected to sanctions), the minister noted that the PRC  unequivocally favors a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and here  "our positions coincide," although "there are nuances about the  details."    At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev stated, Russia continues to  insist on an international conference on the DPRK. Therefore  there is no question about an immediate imposition of sanctions  so far. Especially considering that, according to Kozyrev,  "signs for a hopeful turn of events seem to be emerging." The  Russian minister was advised about them by his U.S. counterpart  Warren Christopher, who was briefed by Jimmy Carter upon the  latter's return from the DPRK.</p>

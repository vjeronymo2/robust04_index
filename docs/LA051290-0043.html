			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES ON SOUTH AFRICA SHEDS SOME NEW LIGHT ON DARK SPOT IN WORLD  </P> <P> I've read with resentment and contempt the past few days about the plight of  those poor, disillusioned South Africans because they are not allowed to race  against international competition.  </P> <P> I find their plight amusing compared to the millions of blacks there who are  oppressed and persecuted.  </P> <P> I also found it amusing that every Afrikaner interviewed (including Zola Budd,  wonder of wonders) said they were opposed to apartheid. Of course, what else  would they say? To say they supported it would not do much in the eyes of the  world to sympathize with them, would it?  </P> <P> PATRICIA J. VANELLI, Hawthorne  </P></p>

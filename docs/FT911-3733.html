			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chalker to press United Nations to play much more active role - Kurdish refugees BRITAIN is to press the United Nations to inject a greater sense of urgency into the direction of its relief programme for the Iraqi refugees on the Turkish border and in Iran. Mrs Lynda Chalker, minister for overseas development, clearly shocked by the 'horrendous' conditions she saw for herself at the end of last week, is to make urgent representations at the UN headquarters in New York. She will see Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, today. Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, will have parallel talks in Geneva with Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN delegate in charge of the refugee programme in Iraq and Kuwait. Mrs Chalker warned the Commons yesterday that the role of British troops in creating safe havens for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq would extend over 'several months'. She called on the UN to play 'a much more active role right away'. She made it clear that, if necessary, she would go beyond normal diplomatic niceties to ensure that Mr Perez de Cuellar was in no doubt about Britain's concern. Mrs Chalker, who acknowledged that local UN representatives were making strenuous efforts, stressed: 'It is at the centre and the top where me must get things sorted out.' Describing the plight of the Iraqi refugees as 'truly harrowing' she said the assistance being provided was greater for those on the Turkish border than for those in Iran. She announced that Britain would make an initial contribution of Pounds 2m to help the refugees in Iran, from the Pounds 20m programme pledged by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Britain wants the UN and other international agencies to join in a drive to at least double the rate of delivery of supplies for the refugees. MRS CHALKER rejected Labour charges that she had been wrong to link efforts to secure the release of British hostages held in the Lebanon with the provision of aid for the refugees. She insisted she had not linked the two issues, but claimed she would have been open to criticism if she had not referred to Britain's anxiety to secure the hostages' earliest possible release.</p>

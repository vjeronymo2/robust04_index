			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Belgrade's price: 205% a month inflation: Kerin Hope assesses the consequences of a year of UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro BELGRADE cab-drivers have no objection to changing a 5m Yugoslav dinar note, now that a 10-minute ride through sparse traffic in the city centre costs a million dinars. A year after UN economic sanctions were imposed against Serbia and Montenegro, their most tangible effect is hyper-inflation on a scale not seen in Europe since the aftermath of the Second World War. According to official figures, the monthly inflation rate reached 205.4 per cent in May, compared with 114.4 per cent in April. After a 56 per cent decline in real wages over the past year, the average monthly salary in Serbia is equivalent to just Dollars 20. 'The government blames speculators for the explosion in inflation, but it is itself responsible: it is furiously printing money to cover the budget deficit and to keep basic state enterprises going,' says Prof Tomislav Popovic, director of the Belgrade Institute of Economic Sciences. More than 1m workers, about 40 per cent of the Serbian workforce, who were laid off by closures of factories hit by sanctions, are still being paid 80 per cent of their salary, although there are complaints that payments are several months late. Soaring inflation has created a booming illegal foreign exchange market around Belgrade. To bolster their dwindling reserves, some state banks resort to sending employees into the street to buy hard currency for dinars from black market dealers. Many Serbian companies now exchange their cash flow into hard currency on a daily basis to keep operating, says Mr Dragisa Petrovic, owner of Zi Strong, a private savings bank. 'I started this business to conserve my capital after I had to stop exporting because of sanctions. It could be much bigger, but I'm afraid the government may soon clamp down on private credit institutions,' Mr Petrovic says. The impact of tighter sanctions, in force since late April, is clearly reflected on the black market, where the rate against the D-mark has fallen from 62,000 to 400,000 dinars. It is now more difficult for Serbian companies to evade the embargo by using false import and export documents purporting to come from Bosnia and Croatia, which are both exempt from sanctions. Moreover, the new ban on transit trade through the rump Yugoslavia has closed a loophole by which goods from Greece or Bulgaria, apparently destined for central Europe, wound up on the Serbian market. About Dollars 1.5bn in Serbian and Montenegrin assets held abroad has been frozen, with another Dollars 4bn in debts owed to Yugoslav companies abroad. 'The tighter sanctions are hitting the economy very hard. We are at the point where even though sanctions don't apply to imports of medical supplies, we don't have enough hard currency to buy what we need,' says Mr Zoran Ilic, deputy minister for foreign trade. Gross national product in Serbia and Montenegro is forecast to drop by about 30 per cent this year to around Dollars 8bn. This will mainly be due to a drastic fall in industrial output, already down by 40 per cent in the first five months of 1993. However, only a small decline in agricultural output is expected, despite a prolonged drought and shortages of fertiliser, which are blamed on the sanctions. This year's wheat harvest will easily cover needs for the next year, although sugar production will fall, according to government forecasts So far, the embargo on oil sales to Serbia and Montenegro is proving more of an inconvenience to car-owners than a disaster for manufacturing. With electricity production largely covered by coal and hydropower, Serbia's own oil output can be used to keep basic industries working. 'We haven't yet reached the point of total economic collapse. But at the present rate of decline, we'll get there at some point in the next six months, with people having to start selling their assets in order to buy food,' Prof Popovic says.</p>

For the AG [shareholding company], on  the other hand, the balance will probably be zero. Ferdinand  Piech, chairman of the board of directors, said that the yield  targets for the entire year will be balanced for the corporation  (in 1993 it suffered a loss of DM1.94 billion), while the AG is  to exceed last year's amount of DM71 million. During the first  quarter, deliveries to customers all over the world expanded by  4.7 percent to 838,000 units. While orders received rose by  11.8 percent on the large European markets during the first  quarter, in Germany they went up by 54 percent. Piech said that  the price reductions of "DM1,000 to DM1,800" largely put an end  to the wait-and-see attitude regarding orders and that  Volkswagen is increasingly benefiting from its own development.    After the massive reduction of investments last year (DM4.8  billion following DM9.3 billion the year before), this year a  volume of DM5-9 billion is to be invested. [passage omitted]</p>

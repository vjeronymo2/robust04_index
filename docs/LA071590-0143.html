			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'VOTERS GIVE CONGRESSMEN GOOD REVIEWS'  </P> <P> The impression one gets from the results of the Times Orange County Poll on  voters' attitudes toward Orange County congressmen ("O.C. Voters Give  Congressmen Good Reviews," July 9) is not that these lawmakers are popular, but  that their performance is predominantly uninspiring.  </P> <P> While it is true, for example, that Dannemeyer received the highest favorable  rating (33% of those polled), 67% of voters either had no opinion of him or  found him unfavorable. Opinions regarding the other congressmen showed even  greater indifference. What this all seems to say is that what is truly  conservative about Orange County is not necessarily its politics, but its  enthusiasm for its politicians.  </P> <P> JOHN McGOWAN  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

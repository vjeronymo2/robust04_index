			<p>BFN     [Text] The executive branch said yesterday it firmly  disagrees with a request from Congress to urgently seek the  appointment of a UN rapporteur for the country.    Even though he recognizes the Congress' right to make the  request and respects the congressional resolution, presidential  spokesman Felix Loarca reiterated that the resolution runs  counter to what has been determined by the international  community.    He noted that the 50th Session of the UN Human Rights  Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, maintained the position of  appointing an independent expert adviser for Guatemala, ruling  out the possibility of appointing a rapporteur or other drastic  action in recognition of the government's efforts.    Loarca said the government's intentions and steps to  consolidate democracy and to continue with the national peace  and reconciliation process are clear to the people and the  international community, and, therefore, the call from Congress  runs counter to this.    As for the congressional decision to condemn the executive  for the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla, he said he does not  have any substantive comments to make because he believes the  people can draw their own conclusions after the government  showed clear signs of its concerns to guarantee the safety of  Guatemalan citizens.    He said a series of problems have been generated in the  country over the past three decades; in turn, it is unfair to  blame this government for the situation when its democratic  commitment has been demonstrated through abundant proof and  evidence.    He said Congress sometimes overlooks the scope of the  problem  and people start thinking we have a magic wand to solve this  problem, when, in actuality, it has been less than a year since  we received a government facing one of its worst crises ever.    As for death threats against other deputies, Loarca said the  government condemns all types of violence, regardless of who is  carrying it out. Likewise, he called upon those people promoting  these kinds of actions to reflect on the serious damage they are  inflicting on the democratic reconciliation process.</p>

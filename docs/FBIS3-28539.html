			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu has pushed forward his plans to visit the United States  for decisive talks on the North Korean nuclear problem that will  determine whether Seoul and Washington choose a diplomatic  solution or U.N. sanctions, ministry officials said Tuesday.  Han leaves on Wednesday instead of Sunday, bound for the U.S.  capital first instead of Canada for critical consultations with  U.S. leaders before heading to Canada and Mexico.    Part of the trip's purpose is to strengthen economic  relations with all three parties of the North American Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to tap South Korea's market entry  possibilities.    At the same time, the trip precedes the Feb. 21 "deadline"  when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of  Governors meets to discuss North Korea's non-compliance with  nuclear inspections.    Ministry officials said Han will raise the issue of the  current tone of U.S. press reports accenting inter-Korean  tension and the possibility of a clash. He plans to request  prudence on Washington's part so that reports are not premature  on policies yet to be adopted or issues under sensitive  negotiation.    The American press has been playing up what it sees as  growing calls for punitive action against North Korea for  refusing nuclear inspections, such as U.N. economic sanctions.    Seoul remains concerned that any rash action against the  closed Stalinist state might provoke a violent clash between the  two Koreas, which have already experienced the fratricidal war  of 1950-53.    The foreign minister will be in Washington from Feb. 9-13  and plans to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and new Defense Secretary  William Perry, among others.    The foreign minister is expected to stop over at the United  Nations to discuss sanctions against North Korea with Secretary-  general Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    While in Canada Feb. 13-16, Han will meet with Prime  Minister Jean Chretien.    In Mexico, he is to meet President Carlos Salinas and hold  foreign ministers' talks with Manuel Tello Macias during his  Feb. 16-19 stay.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Inland Revenue says tax privacy will remain PLANS to contract out the operation of computers used for assessing income and corporation tax will not threaten the confidentiality of personal or commercially-sensitive information, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. Information relating to the Queen and other members of the royal family is unlikely to be processed by outside contractors. The tax affairs of MPs, members of the security services and other politically sensitive individuals will continue to be handled by a special high-security wing of a Cardiff tax office. Mr Steve Matheson, the Revenue's deputy chairman, described as 'disinformation' reports that tax information would be less secure. All information processing would be carried out in the UK under security requirements at least as strenuous as those now applying to the Inland Revenue, he said. The Revenue would monitor the contracts to ensure compliance with its requirements, with the right to carry out spot checks on the processing centres. Two bidders - both US-owned - are left on the shortlist for the contract, which will be worth between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn over 10 years. One is a consortium of International Business Machines UK and Computer Sciences Corporation, Europe. The other is EDS-Scicon. The winning bidder will take over more than 2,000 Inland Revenue information technology staff. It will be responsible for managing the Revenue's computer systems, which include 13 data centres, three development centres and 50,000 terminals in tax offices. It will also modernise and upgrade the systems in partnership with the Revenue. Civil servants will continue to be responsible for examining tax returns, assessing liabilities and making any judgments that are necessary. Individual tax returns and company files will not be handed over to the IT contractor. The IT centres will process tax data keyed in by the civil servants and issue assessments, notices, tax demands and repayments. Mr Matheson said that it would be impossible for employees of the contractor to access the data or copy documents printed out without leaving clear evidence of interference. The department already had complex procedures to stop staff looking at the files of taxpayers and companies to which they were not entitled to have access. The successful contractor would be required to have procedures at least as rigorous. All three companies left in the bidding had excellent track records in handling confidential data, Mr Matheson said.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour left demands full debate LABOUR leftwingers are set to exploit the vacuum left by the leadership election by demanding more freedom to express their differences with the front bench when MPs meet for the first full parliamentary party meeting tomorrow. The growing pressure for a right to express constructive dissent follows from a widely held belief that Mr Neil Kinnock's regime was too tough in silencing party loyalists who differed on policy issues. Members of the 100-strong Tribune group, once designated leftwing but widely seen as a support group for Mr Kinnock in the final years of his leadership, are also expected to re-establish their independence. Moves are afoot to introduce a new rule that would preclude frontbench members from holding office. The Campaign Group, depleted in recent years to about 20 members, is also expecting some recruits from the 60-odd new MPs. Party leaders are expected to face some criticism at tomorrow's parliamentary party meeting on the conduct of the general election campaign.</p>

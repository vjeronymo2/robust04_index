			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Honda in motorcycle tie-up with Piaggio HONDA of Japan yesterday moved to strengthen its position in the European motorcycle market by announcing an alliance with Piaggio, the Italian manufacturer, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Piaggio, which makes the Vespa scooter as well as mopeds, motorcycles and small commercial vehicles, is Europe's largest maker of motorcycles. Honda, which already has a wide-ranging technical collaboration with Peugeot of France, is the world's leading motorcycle manufacturer, with a world market share of about 40 per cent. It sells about 3.5m motorcycles a year worldwide, made in 33 plants. Motorcycle sales, particularly the strong growth in exports to the rest of Asia, have helped Honda weather the downturn in its Japanese car sales. Under the basic agreement between Honda and Piaggio, working groups will be set up to examine product development for the European market. 'The objective is to establish a collaborative working relationship focused on new product development in small and mid-sized motorcycles,' said Honda. The Japanese company will also provide some key components for Piaggio, such as engines for the company's Gilera range of motorcycles. The two companies also plan to co-operate in the design, manufacture and procurement of standardised parts for use in their motorcycles for the European market.</p>

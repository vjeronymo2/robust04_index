He left Shenzhen  yesterday, 22 January, after a half-month inspection tour here.    Two years ago, from 20 to 22 January, Yang Shangkun, then  state president, made an inspection tour in the same city.  During that visit, he toured Xianhu Botanical Garden on the  western slope of the Wutong Shan in the northeastern outskirts  of Shenzhen on 22 January with Deng Xiaoping, who at that time  happened to be in Shenzhen on his south China tour. The two  visitors planted two banyans at the botanical garden before they  left. At that time, many Hong Kong reporters came to Shenzhen  from the other side of the border to cover their inspection tour  here. Deng Xiaoping made some remarks in Shenzhen during that  visit. He said that "it is necessary to blaze new trails" and  "to speed up the pace a little bit," and that "China will have  no way out but to carry on with reform." Later on, these  remarks initiated a great tide of deepening reform and expanding  opening-up nationwide. The two banyans that Deng Xiaoping and  Yang Shangkun planted at the Xianhu Botanical Garden have  attracted more than 1.3 million visitors over the past two  years, many of whom have pictures taken beside the trees.    The timing of Yang Shangkun's revisit to Shenzhen has  aroused  much speculation that Deng Xiaoping may do the same.  Furthermore, at this moment the mass media in Shenzhen by and  large are publishing pictures and reminiscences of Deng  Xiaoping's last visit to Shenzhen. The huge painting of Deng  Xiaoping erected at Lizhi Park is now being repainted, and this  has drawn even more concern from the public.    Yang Shangkun's arrival in Shenzhen on 8 January was not  covered by the local press. The mass media have not reported on  Yang Shangkun's activities in the city until today: On the  morning of 12 January, he toured the Shenzhen Wildlife Zoo in  the company of Wang Zhongfu and then met with Guangdong  Provincial Party Committee Secretary Xie Fei that afternoon. On  the morning of 16 January, he had an inspection tour of Shekou  in the company of Yuan Geng, and on the morning of 17 January,  he visited the Shenzhen Golf Club in the company of Li Youwei  and Li Hao. On the morning of 19 January, he visited two  high-tech companies -- Anke and Huawei -- in the company of  Huang Liman and, on the morning of 20 January, he visited the  Kaifa Science and Technology Company accompanied by Yang  Guanghui. On the afternoon of 20 January, he joined the  officials in charge of Shenzhen city in a forum held at the  Shenzhen City Government Complex. On the morning of 21 January,  he heard another briefing on government work by Wang Zhongfu,  the principal official in charge of Shenzhen city, and then  wound up his inspection tour and left Shenzhen on 22 January.    This time, Yang Shangkun had a fairly long stay in Shenzhen  and visited quite a few places. He told Shenzhen's leading  officials that he had special feelings for the city. At the  time when the central authorities decided to introduce a special  policy into Guangdong, he was working with the Guangdong  Provincial Party Committee. From that time on, he visited the  special economic zone [SEZ] from time to time. His general  impression is that Shenzhen has changed every year, and the city  has undergone still greater changes this year. He hoped that  Shenzhen will make more progress. This year, the state has  introduced many major reform measures which call for rapid  progress to be achieved within a short time and which cover a  wide range of fields. One will need to study new issues,  overcome new difficulties, sum up new experiences, and actively  and prudently push ahead reform, opening up, and economic  construction in the SEZ.    Shenzhen City Mayor Li Youwei thanked Yang Shangkun for his  concern and support for the Shenzhen SEZ. Li said that the  Shenzhen people will live up to the high hopes of the  revolutionaries of the older generation and build the Shenzhen  SEZ into a still better city.</p>

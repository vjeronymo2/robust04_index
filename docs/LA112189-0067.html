			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER AGENCY BONUSES APPROVED  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council approved a $26.2-million fiscal 1990 budget Monday  for its nonprofit computer agency that includes $49,500 for bonuses and  suggestion awards for agency managers and employees.  </P> <P> The budget continues the San Diego Data Processing Corp.'s record of  distributing far more in bonuses, proportionately, than any of the city's  quasi-public agencies or the city itself.  </P> <P> The agency has given out more than $200,000 in bonuses to its employees over  the past five years, including $10,000 payments to Executive Director Robert  Metzger in fiscal 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Metzger and Councilmen Bruce Henderson and Ron Roberts defended the payments  Monday as necessary to keep the agency competitive with private-sector computer  firms in attracting and keeping top personnel. But Councilman Bob Filner  suggested that the bonuses were excessive when added to top executives'  salaries.  </P> <P> Metzger, for example, will be paid about $111,000 during the fiscal year that  concludes June 30, 1990, and will be eligible for a bonus equal to 10% of his  salary.

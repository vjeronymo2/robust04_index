			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / People: How Dede Brooks made a bid for Sotheby's summit The rise and rise of Diana D. Brooks has reached its only possible summit - this 43-year-old banker, invariably known as Dede, now runs Sotheby's, the world's largest fine art auction house, which next year celebrates 250 years of existence, writes Antony Thorncroft. Last week it was announced that she was taking over from Michael Ainslie as president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings. Only Alfred Taubman, the chairman and chief shareholder, wields more power and his major concern has always been his shopping mall empire. Despite its prestige, Sotheby's is little more than a diversion for Taubman. Dede Brooks (top right) joined Sotheby's in 1979 from Citibank. Her skills were first devoted to the financial side in New York and she masterminded the deals which brought to Sotheby's such lucrative estates as the Impressionist pictures of the late Doris Havemeyer. But remorselessly she snapped up the top managerial jobs and only last April was made president and ceo of Sotheby's international auction business. Since then she has been touring the world, spending much time in London which, both for historical and geographical reasons, is vital for Sotheby's future. New York may have replaced London as the main auction centre, but London is the key to Europe; and it is on the continent, as well as in the Far East, that Sotheby's seeks growth. Her final apotheosis is not expected to limit Dede Brooks' travelling. A tall, lively woman, who somehow manages to enjoy a happy marriage to a venture capitalist and look after two children, she has boundless energy and enthusiasm. She likes to mix freely with her staff and is totally lacking in side or superiority. Her own art collection is eclectic - ranging from antiquities to Latin American art. Dede Brooks' timing at reaching the top could prove impeccable. Sotheby's has been hit badly by the recession, and in its nine months' figures for 1993 it was still registering a loss. But recent successful jewels auctions in Switzerland and art sales in New York should ensure a profit in the final quarter of the year. It is a smaller Sotheby's work force that Dede Brooks leads but all the signs are that she will oversee an upturn in its fortunes.</p>

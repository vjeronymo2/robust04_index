			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: BK Vision to raise SFr200m in rights issue BK VISION, the specialised investment holding company created last October by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group, is raising SFr200m (Dollars 152m) in a rights issue. BK Vision's strategy, which has aroused some controversy in Swiss financial circles, is to hold significant stakes in a small number of banks and financial institutions with a view to influencing their management. BK is already one of the largest shareholders in Union Bank of Switzerland. Its only other holdings at the end of April were in Leu Holding, Zurich Insurance and Banca del Gottardo. The net asset value of BK yesterday was SFr728m. The rights issue is on the basis of one new share for every three held at 160 per cent of par value. The bearer shares closed yesterday in Zurich at SFr950.</p>

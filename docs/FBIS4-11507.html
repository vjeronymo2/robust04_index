			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio Noticias" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Rafael Caldera has sworn in new directors  for FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and  the General Bank Superintendency--Norys Aguirre and Tesalio  Cadenas, respectively. After they were sworn in, both officers  ruled out controls on foreign exchange. They also said they  intend to evaluate the assistance given to banks as well as the  proposals made by Gustavo Roosen, special commissioner for  financial reforms.    FOGADE Director Norys Aguirre stressed her institution's  duty  to restore confidence in the financial system, and she said that  currently the state is the greatest FOGADE contributor. She  referred to strategies by the leadership of FOGADE by announcing  reforms to the law that created this fund.    [Begin Aguirre recording] Basically there are two  strategies.  One is the short-term strategy, and this is the immediate  solution to the current banking crisis. The long-term strategy  deals with reforms, and if these are needed I will be the first  person to propose them, as I have done up to now, through  Congress to the government, in due course. I am not afraid to  make changes. If a complete FOGADE reorganization is needed,  this will be done. [end recording]    For his part, Tesalio Cadenas admitted that the General Bank  Superintendency had faults that failed to prevent greater  control--in other words, stricter control--of the Venezuelan  financial system.</p>

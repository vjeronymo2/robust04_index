			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Inflation in HK at lowest for six years Hong Kong is expected to produce its lowest annual inflation rate since 1988 this year. The government has revised its inflation forecast down to 8 per cent for the year from a previously estimated 8.5 per cent. The easing of inflationary pressures was not, however, seen as a harbinger of slower economic activity. The government left unchanged its forecast of a 5.7 per cent real expansion in the economy for 1994. The revised inflation forecast came with the release of the government's quarterly economic report which showed that gross domestic product expanded by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the second quarter of the year compared with a year earlier. This was a slightly slower rate than the 5.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Inflation has been one of the government's biggest political problems. Its easing appears in part to be a combination of a slower growth in personal consumption and reduced activity in Hong Kong's residential property market. Prices for flats have eased by 10-20 per cent since a package of measures was introduced to curb speculative activity. The colony's growth rate has been propelled by a strong external trade performance. Exports, for which more recent data are available, were up 11 per cent in real terms in the third quarter, while re-exports were 14 per cent higher in real terms than in the previous corresponding period. Growth in retained imports of capital goods was 17 per cent in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, compared with a real growth of 6 per cent during the first half.</p>

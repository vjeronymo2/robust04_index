			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Management: Business airs a new image - UK companies have discovered the potential of running their own TV networks The clock on the television screen shows 8.15am. An egg is broken into a frying pan as the credits roll to jaunty music. Smiling presenters on sofas exchange quips about the cricket score. The familiar run of news snippets, phone-ins and quizzes begins. This is breakfast television with a difference. The jugs of orange juice, the squashy sofas and the relentless cheer are all the same. But the audience is not a few million casual viewers in their dressing gowns, but a few hundred suited BMW car salesmen concentrating hard. The questions are not about show-biz, but about the tax advantages of leasebacks on cars, and the relative costs of leather upholstery in the latest Rover and Mercedes models. Broadcasting information to staff in different locations has been commonplace in the US for a decade, where there are about 120 private company networks. But in the UK companies are only slowly discovering the potential of business television. BMW, which was among the first to establish its own network in 1990, is still finding new uses for the medium. Its latest initiative, 'Breakfast with BMW', was launched this summer to combat the recent decline in sales. The idea is that salesmen share their hottest sales tips on live television, and compete with their colleagues to sell more cars and to win a holiday in Bermuda. The result, according to the BMW 'weatherman' who takes the sales temperature in different parts of the country, is that the sun is coming out almost everywhere. BMW is not the only car company to use television to spread the word to a far-flung audience. Ford has been broadcasting weekly programmes to around 400 dealers for nearly a year, and more recently Renault has joined the game. The car industry has espoused the medium more quickly than others partly because it is not frightened by technology, but mainly because its success depends on motivating a loose network of franchised dealers. However, in the last year large companies in other industries went on the air for the first time: Texaco, Zeneca and Texas Homecare set up their own television networks, while Asda launched itself on the radio waves. These companies hope broadcasting will prove to be a good way of spreading company news, sales information, product launches and training. According to Doug Larner of Imagination, which produces programmes for Ford, television can get across both operational and strategic messages. It is immediate and involves everyone - it is also flexible, as different people can be talked to in different voices, he says. Some companies use their networks as much for international conferences and meetings as for company news broadcasts. At Zeneca, ICI's pharmaceuticals offshoot, the satellite link has already reduced the cost of business travel. 'In the past someone might be out of the office for five days for one day's meeting in the US and Australia and you'd wonder if they would be fit to make decisions when they arrived,' says David Burkhill-Howarth of Zeneca. Business television is also being sold as a means of implementing change programmes, by communicating boardroom views directly to the workforce. Pearl Assurance recently borrowed the BMW network to talk to 3,500 salesmen about the company's new strategic direction in a live programme, followed by a question-and-answer session in which salesmen could air their views. Kevin Gavaghan, director of Visage, which makes programmes for both BMW and Pearl, argues that companies make an enormous effort to communicate with their customers, but relatively little when it comes to communicating with staff. Larner believes that companies tend either to smother staff with information or not to communicate at all; and for both defects he argues that business television can be an answer. When Ford audited its communications three years ago, it found its dealers were receiving 16,000 pieces of paper every week, 40 per cent of which came from Ford. Television has replaced some of the paper and has also made it easier to distinguish between the messages that matter and those which do not. But surely the same end could be achieved with video? Television has a magic that video does not have; and, more importantly, it can transmit messages immediately. Merrill Lynch found its network in the US paid for itself on Black Monday 1987 when it was able to issue timely instructions to its salesforce. Regular television programmes also have their own momentum; each programme can dip into various subjects without having to tell the whole thing from beginning to end. Live television has the further advantage in that it allows the viewer to speak back. Both Ford and BMW have used this to effect in televising car auctions. However, one problem with business television is to make sure that people actually watch the broadcasts. According to Lander, this has been overcome at Ford. Managers know that vital information may be transmitted at 11am on Thursday and so they work their diaries around that date. Many even arrange their management meetings for that time, to be able to discuss the broadcast afterwards. The BMW breakfast show solved the problem by getting the presenter to telephone dealers live to see if they were watching. If they were, they won the use of a special sports car for the weekend. Business television is not cheap. To equip each site might cost between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 10,000 depending on the quality of the screens, decoders and satellite dishes, while the air time costs around Pounds 1,500 an hour. While these costs are falling, and will fall further, they are dwarfed by the main cost, which is producing the programmes. Visage estimates that each BMW programme costs about Pounds 12,000 on average to make. Some networks are trying to keep costs down by making the programmes in house, whereas others fear that unless the programmes have the professional stamp of an outside production company staff will not take them seriously. Many companies are cautious about making the large investment in the equipment. National Westminster Bank is experimenting with a series of programmes produced by Imagination every few weeks, but distributed on video. The videos have a magazine format and include small sections of staff training and motivation. If they catch on NatWest could be the first clearing bank on air. Yet business TV does not suit everyone. Quite apart from the price - which puts it out of the range of all but the largest companies - it is essential for audiences to be in the right place at the right time. Business television experiments for GPs failed because doctors move about too much. 'We are never going to see exponential growth,' says Stuart Baxter of Maxat, the largest satellite operator. 'Business television is aimed at big, blue-chip companies. No one is going to create a new budget for it. Instead they see it as saving money in other areas - communications, travel or training.'</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Four Scottish constables arrived in Boston to calm families who say they cannot  put to rest loved ones killed by a terrorist bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 until  the victims' personal belongings are returned to them. The senior police  officers wanted to ease the pain and confusion felt by many families of the 259  victims whose possessions have been withheld during the investigation of the  Dec. 21 plane explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland. Assistant Chief Constable  Paul Newell said he and his fellow officers also wanted to quell rumors that  investigators had destroyed victims' property. He reassured more than 100  people who had gathered that many of the victims' personal belongings would be  returned. So far, police have found and catalogued more than 11,000 items  strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Despite protests from anti-nuclear activists, two nuclear generators were  hauled under tight security to the shuttle Atlantis' launch pad at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida, for installation aboard the $1.4-billion Galileo  Jupiter probe scheduled for blastoff Thursday. Galileo is powered by a pair of  radioisotope thermoelectric generators -- RTGs -- that convert the heat  produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium 238 dioxide into about 570 watts  of electricity. The devices have no moving parts and they are built to survive  launch accidents intact. Earlier in the day in the nearby town of Cape  Canaveral, a handful of anti-nuclear activists carrying signs and wearing gas  masks stood on street corners in silent protest. The presence of nuclear  generators aboard a space shuttle has generated controversy from groups who  fear a plutonium release in the event of a launch disaster.  </P></p>

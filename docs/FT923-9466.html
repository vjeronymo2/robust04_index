			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Norwegian insurer proposes new chairman MR ANDERS ECKOFF, an Oslo lawyer, has been proposed as the new chairman of the board of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, to replace Mr Thorleif Borge. The proposal offers a seat on the board to Mr Rune Brantinger, president of Sweden's Soedra Skogagarna, while four existing Uni board members have been asked to stay on. An extraordinary meeting on August 10 of Uni's board of representatives is widely expected to endorse the proposal for a new board. Uni's board tendered its resignation at the end of last month when Mr Jan Erik Langangen announced his surprise resignation. In recent months, Mr Langangen had been sharply criticised by shareholders for his decision to invest NKr4.7bn (Dollars 805m) to acquire a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer, then failing to succeed in his strategy to create a pan-Nordic insurance alliance with Skandia at its centre. Uni's biggest shareholders earlier said a new board must recapture power over the company from its executive leadership, where it had languished under Mr Langangen. The proposal of Mr Eckoff comes as a surprise. Several shareholders had wanted Mr Torvild Aakvaag, a board member and chairman of Norsk Hydro, to replace Mr Borge. His appointment would have restored credibility and confidence in Uni, they said. Mr Eckoff, 49, has broad experience from 'clean-up' jobs within Norway's industrial sector and is a member of the board of Elkem, the big Norwegian light metals producer. Mr Georg Krogh, an executive representing Uni's sixth-biggest shareholder, said the appointment of Mr Eckoff could restore Uni's credibility. One priority for the new board will be to decide the fate of Uni's executive management, loyalists to Mr Langangen.</p>

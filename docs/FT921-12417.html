			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Stockholm wary of proposed Volvo merger VOLVO, Sweden's largest industrial group, has announced plans to merge with Procordia, the food and pharmaceutical company partly owned by the Swedish government, in a SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.73bn) deal, the largest in the country's history. Last night, however, doubts were being cast over the deal by the Swedish government, which is the second-largest owner of Procordia. Mr Per Westerberg, the country's industry minister, said that if the government's recently appointed advisory privatisation commission, which is examining the deal, advised against the merger today, he did not see how it could go ahead. The proposed conglomerate would carry the Volvo name, with assets valued at SKr130bn, turnover of SKr115bn and 105,000 employees. It would be Sweden's biggest private employer, with activities ranging from cars and trucks to health care products, food processing, alcohol, tobacco, hotels and restaurants. When the plan was announced on Saturday, it was immediately criticised for lack of industrial logic by the privatisation commission. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive chairman who will chair the new company, said it would mean Sweden had 'an enterprise with resources enabling it to participate in the current process of industrial change in Europe'. Mr Soren Gyll, Procordia's head, is to be president and chief executive of the new company. Mr Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's current president and chief executive, has been named as his deputy. Volvo already owns 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.7 per cent of the voting shares. The Swedish government, with 34.2 per cent of equity and 42.7 per cent of voting rights, so far has not given its approval to the deal, which is structured as a reverse takeover of Volvo by Procordia. Last Friday the privatisation commission rejected the first offer made by Procordia, arguing that the terms were too favourable to Volvo shareholders. Under the revised offer, Procordia is offering nine of its A shares for four of Volvo's A shares, and nine B shares for four Volvo B shares. It is also bidding for Volvo's convertible debentures on a comparable basis. The offer is valued at SKr38.7bn based on Procordia's share price at close of trading on the Stockholm bourse on January 24. After full conversion it is designed to provide Volvo shareholders with a 22 per cent average premium to the market price. Volvo's strategic French partner Renault has agreed to the proposed merger, although its own stake in the Swedish group will be halved to 4.2 per cent as a result. The offer is subject to acceptance by 90 per cent of Volvo's shareholders and to approval by Procordia shareholders. Volvo and Procordia want the government to sell or reduce its own stake in the company. Unless ministers agree, the Swedish state would have an estimated 25.6 per cent equity in the 'new' Volvo , but retain about 45 per cent of voting rights. The prospectus will be available on April 20 and the subscription period will last from May 4 to June 1. It is hoped the new company will be registered on 22 June.

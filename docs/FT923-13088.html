			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Several dozen private groups show interest - Potential Buyers SEVERAL dozen private-sector companies have expressed interest in the future of British Rail, with their focus divided between train services, stations and the freight and parcels businesses. The bidder with highest profile has been Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways. Within a week Virgin plans to put forward a pilot scheme for running express trains between London and Edinburgh, stopping only at Newcastle upon Tyne. Virgin believes that for similar fares to those charged by BR it could offer a faster service with free meals and entertainment of airline standard, such as television screens for every seat. Business travellers would be offered facilities such as faxes. Virgin wants to hire trains from BR, refurbish them and pay a track fee. If the pilot scheme succeeds it envisages offering similar services to four or five British cities, competing with airlines. Large numbers of travellers have been lured from rail to air but Virgin believes many could be won back, not least because of increasing delays at Heathrow. Stagecoach, the Scottish bus operator, has already started an economy service which operates five nights a week between London and Scotland, leasing two carriages on BR scheduled trains. The company might also be interested in InterCity services, franchising of local services and buying stations. However, the Perth-based company is waiting to study the fine print of the white paper and resulting legislation  -particularly the still undecided track fees. It said: 'We could be interested in everything or nothing - it all depends on the terms.' Other bus operators which may be interested in bidding for services include Badgerline, which runs bus services in Wales, the Midlands and the south of England, and Yorkshire Rider. Apart from Virgin, the name most often linked to the rail sell-off is BAA, the privatised airports operator which has made a commercial success of developing retail outlets at airports. BAA said it was interested in railway stations, but emphasised it would continue to focus on its airport business. There are obvious similarities between airports and railway stations, but BAA pointed out there were also significant differences. Air travellers were in BAA's terminals for an average of one hour, with all the opportunity for shopping which that implies. Many rail travellers spend only two or three minutes in stations. The spending power of railway passengers also contrasts markedly with that of air travellers. BAA said 90 per cent of passengers using Heathrow are from ABC1s. BAA, which is funding 80 per cent of the Pounds 235m Heathrow-Paddington link, is talking to other investors such as Virgin and British Airways after the privatisation process put a question mark over BR's contribution of the remaining 20 per cent. Virgin would like to run its own trains on both the Gatwick and Heathrow link, and BAA is also interested in the Victoria-Gatwick line itself. The main obstacle to any widespread sale of stations is the property slump. BR co-operated with several developers in the 1980s boom, getting London and provincial stations refurbished in exchange for giving space to offices and shops. The present oversupply and depressed price of property is likely to prevent any rapid take-up of BR stations and surplus land, which includes many acres of goods stations and sidings - often in prime inner-city sites. In the longer term, however, these sites could prove attractive for hotels, offices, car parks and distribution centres. One property analyst said: 'In the bull market, land values were high enough to justify building over railway tracks. It will be a long time before people plan to do that again.' The part of BR that could attract most interest is rail freight, which already has the highest level of private-sector participation. Nearly 40 per cent of the fleet is privately-owned wagons. Tiphook, the container group, is interested in extending its freight wagon business, and Cargowagon, the German-owned group, also wants to expand. Other possible entrants are the port companies and shipping groups. National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generating companies, are interested in running their own coal trains. Charterail - a company set up by BR, the engineering group GKN, and financial institutions Electra and Gartmore - welcomed the white paper. It said it would increase the proportion of rail freight. Mr Robin Gisby, Charterail's managing director, said: 'We now look to the detailed legislation to ensure that costs of access to rail for freight operators stand comparison with those incurred by road hauliers for access to the road network.' BR's parcels business is likely to attract the attention of leading players in the UK market such as United Parcel Service, TNT and Securicor.</p>

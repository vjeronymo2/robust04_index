			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Rail workers in the CGT  [General Confederation of Labor] labor confederation have called  on employees of the national SNCF [French National Railroad  Company] rail system to stage protest actions on April 7 to  defend employment, the CGT Federation announced on Thursday [31  March].    It said the forms of the protests were to be discussed  locally, but could include work stoppages.    Referring to protests by French young people against a  government plan for low-wage youth employment, now dropped, the  CGT communique said that "By acting to halt job cuts" at the  SNCF and "in defending the future of rail facilities," the rail  workers "are carrying on a struggle similar to the one waged by  young people, who demand only the right to live and the right to  stable and useful employment."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johanneburg April 13 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] on Wednesday [13 April] night said it rejected the  notion that it should agree to preconditions set by the  government before it could participate in mediation to solve the  constitutional dispute.    These preconditions, said an IFP statement, were that the  party agree to national elections being held on April 26, 27 and  28 and that any agreement on constitutional amendments not be  implemented until after the elections. "The IFP has agreed to  consider the possibility that the issue of the election date is  not to be raised during mediation, but cannot agree under any  circumstances to the imposition of this precondition in breach  of all previous agreements related to international mediation."    Regarding implementation of any agreement on constitutional  amendments, the IFP said: "The African National Congress/South  African Communist Party alliance and the National Party are now  requesting that the IFP agrees on an implementation procedure  which would effectively pre-empt and prevent the  participationehf the IFP in the election process."    Any agreement on constitutional amendments would be  "delivered to a constituent assembly after elections, rather  than being translated into constitutional amendments prior to  elections".    "The IFP would not be represented in such a constituent  assembly and it would be forced to operate as an  extra-parliamentary force," the statement said.    It continued: "The IFP stresses the fact that the final  purpose of international mediation is to create the basis for a  political compromise which will enable the IFP to participate in  elections."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Korean situation tops  the list of international problems that interest Japanese people  in connection with the nation's defense, a government survey  showed Sunday [15 May].    The survey by the Prime Minister's Office showed that 34  percent of respondents said they are interested in the Korean  situation. Relations between the United States and Russia, and  Russia's military deployment on islands it holds off Hokkaido,  Japan's northernmost main island, each recorded 31 percent.    On the Korean peninsula, tensions are high because of  international disputes over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  project.    The Middle East situation led the list at 56 percent in the  previous survey in 1991, when the Gulf war occurred.    In the January survey, the ninth of its kind since 1969, the  Prime Minister's Office polled 3,000 people aged 20 and older  throughout Japan on their awareness about the Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) and defense issues. Sixty-nine percent responded.    Concerning SDF participation in peacekeeping activities  overseas, 48 percent said they approve such action, up from 46  percent in the previous poll, while 31 said they oppose it, up  from 28 percent.    Asked about future roles the SDF should play, 34 percent  cited dispatch in the case of natural disasters, while 24  percent emphasized protection of national security.  International contributions stood at 22 percent.    On the scale of defense capabilities, 66 percent favored  maintaining the current level, up 4 percentage points from the  previous survey.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "Competitors of Russia are  actively trying to drive us out of the world weapons market",  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets told a government  meeting on Thursday and proposed to grant arms producers certain  rights in trading weapons themselves.    "The state programme of arms production and export needs a  serious revision for the benefit of producers", he stressed.    According to Soskovets, there is "an abyss of  misunderstanding" between arms producers and exporters and  suggested to grant the producers "certain rights in selling  their products independently".    "It is hard to explain to directors of defence enterprises  which are the property of the state why the problem of financing  is so acute in the industry when only one of the enterprises has  in its warehouse submachine guns worth 200 million dollars and  there is a big demand for them in the world", Soskovets said  after returning from the Republic of Chuvashia where he visited  defence enterprises.</p>

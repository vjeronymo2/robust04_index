			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on BP renewed ACTIVITY in BP again dominated the market with shares in the oil company plummeting as the board met City analysts to discuss the fourth quarter figures announced on Thursday. The meeting failed to assuage worries in the UK market about the group's dividend paying ability. BP shares slumped to 253p at their lowest point - immediately news began to filter out from the analysts meeting - but later stabilised and moved up strongly as American support appeared. At the close the stock price was 6 off at 268p. Turnover reached a massive 62m shares, exceeding even the 40m traded on Thursday following the disappointing profits and dividend statement. The market hit BP shares even before analysts attended the usual post figures breakfast meeting. Analysts left the meeting in sombre mood, some pointing out that the market would be wrong to underestimate the strength of the Horton-Simon-Browne-Seal management team at BP. But most remained gloomy about prospects. One said it looked as if shareholders were set to take the pain after the BP management's attempts to reduce costs had failed - 'I got the feeling they're quite prepared to cut the dividend,' said one. Another said he had gone to the meeting looking for reassurance and 'come away with none.' Reuters advance News and information organisation Reuters Holdings recovered nearly all the ground lost in its pre-results dip as investors reacted to a positive presentation in the US on Thursday afternoon. The shares hit 1140p at one stage before easing to close 20 better at 1135p on heavier than normal turnover of 2.7m. A number of US analysts are believed to have increased their forecasts for the company's 1992 profits as hopes are pinned on an imminent announcement about the launch of Reuters' new Dealing 2000-2 automated trading system. Advertising agency WPP Group picked up 25 to 83p reacting to heavy US buying overnight. WPP ended 46 per cent higher in New York on Thursday, with just over 1m shares traded. Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell fell 16 to 233p following a 1992 profits forecast cut by securities house Williams de Broe. Pearson eased a penny to 769p after announcing that it had sold its stake in Pickwick Group to Carlton Communications for Pounds 13.06m. Pharmaceuticals firm SmithKline Beecham fell 18 to 937p on the back of heavy selling in New York. However, Glaxo gained 7 to 815p on expectations that it will report healthy profits of Pounds 700 to Pounds 725m next Thursday in first-half results that will be flattered by US dollar strength. Nervousness ahead of full-year results on February 27 affected ICI which fell 17 to 1265p despite positive comment. A presentation to analysts by Hanson which was described as 'on the positive side of neutral', and which included confirmation of Lord White's successor, helped the shares to remain firm at 199 1/2 p. Lonrho firmed 2 to 127p on heavy turnover of 13m. Shell retreated 11 to 467p, after 462p, as the market turned its eyes to Shell's figures next week. Turnover in Shell reached 14m, the highest single day's activity since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait triggered a surge in oil prices. But specialists pointed out that the slide in Shell shares was unwarranted 'Most of the problems at BP are purely BP specific,' said one. British Gas, on the other hand, attracted strong support, closing 1 1/2 firmer at 240 1/2 p on turnoverof 6.7m as a number of institutions balked at the prospect of a dividend cut at BP and switched into Gas. Bass was the leading feature of the brewing sector, rising 12 to 531p on turnover of 3.7m shares. This followed the apparent success of the company's presentations to institutions in Scotland. Cider producers gained some relief from a decision, by the European Parliament, after a period of uncertainty about the drink's tax position. HP Bulmer rose 11 to 274p and unlisted stock Merrydown gained 5 to 380p after the European Parliament recommended that cider be given a duty category of its own, rather than being classified with wine. In the food manufacturing sector, brokers Panmure Gordon and Salomon Brothers were fairly bullish about Dalgety, but the shares rose only 1 to 367p, on suggestions that growth in the consumer foods division is likely to be tempered by poor conditions in the flour milling market. Profits for the half-year to December 31 will be announced on Monday, and are expected to be around Dollars 52-55.5m, compared with Pounds 51.7m previously. A half-year dividend of 7.3p, against 7.15p has been forecast and earnings per share of around 17.6p compared with 16.9p. Hillsdown Holdings fell 2 to 157p after its subsidiary Towers and Co, bought Tendercut Meats, a Southampton based meat products company, for an undisclosed sum. Earlier this week it was announced that Unigate had sold its chicken operation to Buxted Poultry, another Hillsdown subsidiary. Tate &amp; Lyle gained 3 to 416p, recovering part of Thursday's losses resulting from profit downgrades by brokers. Leisure group Ladbroke continued to attract attention ahead of its results next month. County NatWest is recommending a switch out of Rank Organisation prior to it going ex-dividend on February 24 for holders who have benefited from the rise in the shares since the results. The broker forecasts a 6 per cent dividend increase at Ladbroke and believes the group offers better short-term value. Rank lost a penny to 692p, while Ladbroke gained 1 1/2 to 222 1/2 p. Holiday groups Owners Abroad and Airtours rallied as the effect of Thursday's large placing in the latter receded. Traders also drew attention to growing optmism over Owners' figures due next week. Airtours rose 8 to 253p, while Owners added 5 to 114p. A buyer of 1m shares in British Aerospace helped to swell the day's turnover to 5.4m as the shares hardened 3 to 271p. Nerves about the 1991 dividend have, however, surfaced in some quarters ahead of next week's results. Dividend worries at Rolls-Royce sent the shares falling 3 to 137p late in the session. Securities house Smith New Court, believes, however, that 'Rolls will hold the dividend.' Smiths Industries bounced from recent weakness to add 2 to 263p. The stock is the top buy in the aerospace sector for agency broker, Panmure Gordon, and is included in its engineering quarterly review received by investors yesterday. P&amp;O gave up another 13 to 378p as fears over the dividend and worries about Chelsfield, its joint venture partner in Pall Mall Properties continued. Volume reached 1.7m. BAA recovred from from Thursday's falls, which followed a Kleinwort Benson profit downgrading. The shares firmed 4 to 565p with Kleinwort and County NatWest reported to be positive on the stock.

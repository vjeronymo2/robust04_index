			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: REVVING UP  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a handful of other biker pics are being tuned up.  </P> <P> * Kent Anderson, an ex-Green Beret who wrote a Vietnam novel called "Sympathy  for the Devil," is penning "Bad Iron," about an outlaw bike gang, for producer  John Milius at New Line.  </P> <P> * Larry Ferguson is writing "Sid," based on a true story of a cop who went  undercover to infiltrate an outlaw motorcycle gang; he and Ned Tanen will  produce for Paramount.  </P> <P> * Over at New Visions, Taylor Hackford is mulling the purchase of a biker  script.  </P> <P> * Not to be out-revved, Sylvester Stallone (who once took Barbara Walters for a  spin on his bike) has a biker project in hand, according to a source.  </P> <P> * And Walter Hill's got another biker pic on the boards called "American Iron."  </P> <P>  Don't expect any of these films to mention the most famous of the outlaw bike  gang. The Hell's Angels have their name and logo under copyright and trademark  protection. Pat H. Broeske and Kirk Honeycutt  </P></p>

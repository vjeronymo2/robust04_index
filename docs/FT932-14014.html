			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warned on aerospace R&amp;D funding LEADING aerospace and defence equipment manufacturers have warned MPs that Britain will be squeezed out of international markets unless the government provides adequate resources for technological research and development. GEC-Marconi and Dowty, two of the leading companies in the sector, have told the cross-party Commons trade and industry committee that the British government's support for the sector still lags well behind that of European companies. Their stance will increase the prospect that the committee will endorse a report from the DTI's aviation committee, which includes civil servants and industry representatives, for Britain to develop a national strategic technology acquisition plan (NSTAP). The companies are still waiting for the minister's response to the plan. The committee, which is conducting an investigation into the future of British aerospace companies, will hear evidence from executives of the two companies later today. GEC-Marconi suggests in a written submission that Britain risks losing the technological lead it enjoys in several areas of electronics. The company says a dialogue between government and industry is needed to identify clearly the 'core technologies' which are vital both to defence and to Britain's overall economic well-being. It adds: 'British industry is already invited to participate in several European collaborative technology programmes but has to find its own share of the funding with little or no help from the government . . . Other European companies receive substantial financial support from their governments.' The same theme is taken up in the evidence submitted by Dowty, which says that government support is required to bridge the gap between the City's preoccupation with short-term performance and the much longer-term view necessary in a high-technology industry. Dowty says that a partnership between government and industry is essential to ensure the competitiveness of UK companies. It calls for more government finance for research and development, particularly through so-called demonstrator projects and improved help for exports through credits and defence support activities. The company adds: 'Dowty fully supports the NSTAP as offering a constructive joint government/industry approach which can provide vital underpinning for a revival of the UK aerospace sector.' The MPs will also hear evidence today from the Manufacturing Science Finance union, which warns in its written evidence that on current trends structural, financial and competition difficulties 'will almost certainly see the UK replaced by Germany or France as Europe's leading aerospace nation'.</p>

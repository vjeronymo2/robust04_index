			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages in quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] There is an all out dispute between the ruling  coalition and the opposition parties. Two questions are at the  center of the dispute; the presence of neofascist ministers in  the government and the chairmanships of the Senate committees.    Nicola Mancino has attacked the government bitterly and said  that he sees the risk of an authoritarian tendency in Italy.  Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left,  has criticized President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for giving the  go-ahead to neo-fascist government ministers. Occhetto has also  attacked Gianfranco Fini and said that the idea of changing  Italy's borders is dangerous and typically fascist.    However, the bitterest dispute concerns the Senate  committees. The elections of the chairmen of the committees are  due to take place tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti reports:    [Masotti] Disputes and arguments are also raging within the  ranks of the ruling coalition. The National Alliance, which is  in dispute with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio over his  refusal to postpone the Senate committee contest, is threatening  to vote solely for its own candidates.    However, the main bone of contention is the setting up of a  new opposition grouping, the Democratic Left, which withdrew  from the mixed Senate group in order to make life more difficult  for the ruling coalition.    [Libero Gualtieri, leader of the Democratic Left --  identified by screen caption] "The mixed group could not be a  neutral group at the same time as being the arbiter of a  political dispute."    [Masotti] This means that the numbers, which were precarious  in the first place, have changed for the ruling coalition. The  political positions in the Senate have now become more radical.  The Northern League has vetoed the idea of having opposition  group chairmen in charge of the watchdog committees and has also  ruled out the proposal of Nicola Mancino.    [Francesco Tabladini, Northern League -- identified by  screen  caption] "Today the situation with this group which has been set  up in order to manipulate the votes means that the political  reality and our willingness to cooperate will need to be  rethought."    [Masotti] Between the Northern League and Forza Italia there  remains the dispute over the Senate Public Works and  Telecommunications Committee, although Umberto Bossi and Silvio  Berlusconi are negotiating to unblock the impasse.    [Enrico La Loggia, Forza Italia --identified by screen  caption] "I am sure that the problems we have had because of  certain stances which were taken up by the Northern League will  be overcome very soon."    [Masotti] Tomorrow is the day of reckoning and agreements  will be at best only limited.    [Giuliano Ferrara, minister for relations with parliament --  identified by screen caption] "Each party will vote for its own  candidates and the best candidates will win."</p>

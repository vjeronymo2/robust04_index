			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Portugal lifts curb on capital movements PORTUGAL is to lift restrictions on capital movements imposed last year to prevent investment from overseas upsetting the country's monetary targets. The Bank of Portugal said that all remaining restrictions would be lifted in three phases by the end of the year. The first phase will come on August 31, when Portuguese borrowers in foreign currency will be excused the obligation to deposit 25 per cent of the money in interest-free accounts with the central bank. Foreigners will be allowed full access to the Portuguese money markets from December 31.</p>

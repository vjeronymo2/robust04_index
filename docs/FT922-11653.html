			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Liberty fall to Pounds 5.7m fuels speculation over control UNCERTAINTY surrounding the largest and potentially hostile shareholder in Liberty was heightened yesterday as the fabrics retailer and manufacturer unveiled a 21 per cent drop in annual profits. A spokesman for South African-born Mr Brian Myerson, whose investment vehicle Concerto Capital holds 15 per cent of Liberty, said the businessman's original plans to call for an extraordinary meeting were still in play. However, Mr Myerson did not intend formally to request it in the immediate future. Mr Myerson called for the meeting in February to propose a new chief executive and provide a cash injection which would dilute the Liberty family's stake, which stands at more than 51 per cent. Speculation over Liberty's future was bound to resurface as the group revealed a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.23m to Pounds 5.66m in the year to February 1. The fall was cushioned by a 44 per cent drop in interest charges to Pounds 696,000 as the group cleared its Pounds 6m net debt. Turnover fell from Pounds 92.5m to Pounds 84.9m. Mr Harry Weblin, chairman and chief executive, said the 117-year old group had survived 'the deepest and longest recession since 1945'. Retailing took the brunt of the profits decline, falling 62 per cent to Pounds 823,000 at the trading level, as sales slipped only 4 per cent to Pounds 54.4m. The Gulf war had severely affected sales for the first three months of the year. 'There was simply no tourist business,' he said. Mr Weblin also blamed the impact of the uniform business rate for the disproportionate fall in retailing profits. This had cost the group Pounds 250,000 last year, he said. The converting and wholesaling business suffered less sharply, with sales down 19 per cent to Pounds 22.7m and trading profits some 25 per cent lower at Pounds 3.4m. The bright spot for the year was the joint venture in Japan, where profits were 41 per cent higher at about Pounds 1m, on turnover of Pounds 6m. During the year the group began closing loss-making US operations, although it plans to retain the New York store. Mr Weblin said Liberty would pursue licensing operations in the US. Signs in the UK were encouraging, meanwhile, with retail sales 'well ahead of last year'. Mr Weblin warned, however, that 'any return to normal trading is going to be gradual'. The final dividend is 5.35p for a total of 7.2p (6.9p). Earnings per share fell from 26.13p to 20.77p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement of the ANC Youth League, on its 18th congress to </F> be held at Vista University 14-17 January, issued by the ANC on  the SAPA PR wire service]    [Text] The 18th congress of the ANC [African National  Congress] Youth League [ANCYL] will take place at Vista  University, Soweto, starting on Friday, 14 January 1994 and end  on Monday 17th January 1994. The congress will be opened by the  president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela on Friday morning.    Congress will also receive reports from the president,  secretary general and treasurer general of the ANC Youth League.  The morning session on Friday, namely, the addresses by the  president of the ANC and the president of the ANC Youth League,  shall be open to the media and the public in general. The rest  of congress shall be in closed session, with the exception for  the closing address by the new president of the ANC Youth League  which shall be in open session.    The closed sessions shall deal with the reports of the  secretary and treasurer generals and the different commissions  and their plenary sessions. There will be four commissions  which shall in turn have sub-commissions.    The four commissions are:    I. Youth and a democratic South Africa.  A. The ANCYL post elections. B. The youth and the RDP  [Restructuring and Development Program]. C. Building a  national youth council. D. Government participation by youth.  E. Memorandum on the need for a youth ministry.    II. Strategy and tactics    III. Constitutional amendments    This commission will address the question of the autonomy of  the ANC Youth League, which will also deal with the general  relations between the ANC Youth League and the ANc, particularly  with the ANC being in government    IV. Elections and violence    Other issues to be dealt with are the ANC Youth League and  the world youth movement as well as the financial self  sufficiency of the ANC Youth League.    The congress will be attended by 1,550 representatives,  representing 235,301 paid up members, and an additional 25  observers that are expected from the international community.  There will be five (5) youth delegates from each of the camps  of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  that are outside the country.    There will also be elections for a new national executive  committee. Congress is expected to adopt key resolutions on the  education crisis, the violence, elections, and on organisational  questions affecting the ANC Youth League. Primary among these  will be question of establishing branches of the ANC Youth  League at tertiary learning institutions and schools. The state  of organisation in the coloured, Indian and white communities  will also be a subject of discussion. Because the last two  years have not seen a significant improvement in the  participation of women in our structures, the challenge to  ensure greater involvement of young women in the activities of  the organisation shall occupy a high place in our agenda.    The 18th congress should mark a turning point in the history  of youth politics in South Africa. It shall be the task of our  congress to ensure that the ambiguous role that has been played  by the youth since the unbanning of the liberation movement is  discarded. The congress will have to redefine the role of the  youth not only in the transition, but also in a post-apartheid  South Africa.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 5 (CNS)--The exchange rate of the  renminbi made known by the People's Bank of China has stood firm  at around one U.S. dollar against RMB 8.7 since the unification  of the exchange rate of the renminbi started on January 1 this  year. An authoritative source from the sector said that the  phenomenon showed a steady transition of the exchange rate of  the currency, seen as a solid foundation for a number of  measures for the restructuring of the foreign exchange  administration system to be adopted.    With the implementation of the unification of the exchange  rate of the renminbi, the currency has a floating exchange rate  decided by the market. The People's Bank of China makes public  an exchange rate of the renminbi every day by making reference  to the exchange rate involved in trade among banks on the  previous day. The exchange rate of one U.S. dollar against RMB  8.7 has been the price seen in the swap market since the  beginning of last year, meaning little fluctuation in the swap  market following the practice of unifying the exchange rate of  the renminbi. The foreign exchange market has proceeded  normally and the price of the curency remains stable. The  exchange rate of 8.7 yuan is regarded as the bottom line for the  renminbi with a fluctuation rate of not more than 0.1 yuan.    Before the establishment of a unified foreign exchange  market  among banks, swap markets for foreign exchange which are  considered a transition move still play an important role across  the country. Individual business entities undertaking the trade  of foreign exchange, however, have withdrawn from the market  while most foreign trade companies as well as import and export  companies have employed a wait-and-see practice and therefore  seldom take part in transactions in the market through means of  brokers, resulting in a small traded volume in the foreign  exchange market.    Conversion of foreign exchange certificates into renminbi  has  returned to normal following a brief market fluctuation in the  wake of a decision halting the issuance of the certificates.    Stability in the market after the unification of the  exchange  rate of the renminbi is because such reform was line with the  market economy system. There is need by the authorities for  some problems arising from the new practice. Improvements  should be made in order to offer sound conditions for the  restructuring of the foreign exchange administration system.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POLICEMAN TESTIFIES SEEING NO DRUGS ON BARRY VISIT  </P> <P> A third member of Mayor Marion Barry's police protection unit testified at  Barry's cocaine and perjury trial Friday that he saw no drugs on a trip to the  Virgin Islands.  </P> <P> Detective Ulysses Walltower, a 20-year police veteran, said he saw no cocaine  or other drugs used on a trip with Barry to St. Thomas in March, 1988.  </P> <P> Barry had gone there in connection with a personnel project that his city had  with the U.S. Virgin Islands.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Barry's defense team called two other members of the Barry  protective detail who said they saw no cocaine or other drugs used by Barry on  that four-day trip.  </P> <P> But as the other policemen testified, Walltower also said he was not in Barry's  company every moment of the trip in a hotel or during a boat ride.  </P> <P> A convicted drug dealer, Charles Lewis, testified at Barry's trial they used  drugs in the Virgin Islands and four women also gave testimony to seeing drugs  there.  </P> <P> But Walltower said he saw Barry in the company of no women other than a city  employee who went on the trip.  </P> <P> Barry, 54, is on trial on 10 charges of cocaine possession, one charge of  conspiracy with others to get or buy cocaine and three charges of perjury for  allegedly lying to a grand jury about Lewis' alleged connections to drugs.  </P> <P> The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is 26 years in prison and a  $1,850,000 fine -- a penalty unlikely to be imposed on any first-time convicted  drug offender.  </P> <P> In office for 12 years, Barry announced recently he would not seek a fourth  four-year term.  </P> <P> Walltower was the fourth defense witness among an estimated 14 that Barry's  chief lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, said would be called before concluding the defense  case.  </P> <P> Prosecutors ended their case Wednesday after calling 25 witnesses, 10 of whom  said they saw Barry use cocaine scores of times between 1983 and Jan 18, 1990  -- the day Barry was arrested by FBI agents in an elaborate hotel sting after  videotaping him allegedly smoking addictive crack cocaine.  </P> <P> As he has done every day of the seven-week trial, Barry sat at the defense  table intently following each witness.  </P> <P> His wife was in the first row of spectators looking on without expression.  </P></p>

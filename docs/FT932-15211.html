			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Rail strike looms as talks break up after eight minutes BRITAIN'S railway network is set to be closed down tomorrow by a second 24-hour strike after the breakdown of talks between British Rail and the main RMT rail union last night. Talks lasted only eight minutes before breaking up in acrimony. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, accused BR of 'bully-boy tactics' and of being 'totally intransigent'. He said Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, had been 'abusive' to him. 'I have never been treated like that in 35 years in the industry . . . There is no chance of averting tomorrow's strike.' Sir Bob said he did not believe the union was 'interested in negotiating a settlement'. He accused the RMT of playing politics in an industrial dispute. He was 'very disappointed' at the union's position which he said had hardened since Tuesday. 'I saw no point in prolonging the meeting,' he added. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee relations director, accused Mr Knapp in a letter of following 'a political, not an industrial, agenda' which ignored the interests of railway workers and focused on the 'narrow sectional interest' of the RMT's executive. 'Your action is the biggest threat to jobs that the BR board now has to confront', said Mr Watkinson. He urged Mr Knapp to reconsider calling the strike. Sir Bob confirmed that BR - in retaliation for tomorrow's strike - would scrap the check-off system under which union dues are deducted from railway worker's pay packets and sent to the unions. The RMT will have to find another and more expensive way of collecting their membership subscriptions which bring Pounds 500,000 a month. The angry exchanges between BR and RMT last night indicate a sharp escalation in the dispute. Today BR meets the train drivers' union Aslef to try to resolve their dispute, but it seems likely that Aslef will also go ahead with its stoppage tomorrow. Hopes of a settlement of the dispute over union demands of a guarantee for no compulsory redundancies and use of contract labour faded during the day as attitudes hardened. BR expects to lose a further Pounds 10m gross, and freight business contracts worth Pounds 1bn are at risk, as a result of tomorrow's stoppage. Last night BR released its final bargaining position. It told the RMT that it 'did not foresee the need for compulsory redundancy amongst existing general staff during the next couple of years, providing that staff avail themselves of the opportunities for redeployment and retraining spelt out in the various rail agreements and there is full co-operation with any programmes of voluntary severance.' BR added that there was less certainty over jobs in the rail workshops, though every effort would 'continue to be made to avoid any compulsory discharge of staff'. It went on to assure the RMT that it had 'no plans for a major extension to the use of contractors in the area of track maintenance during the next couple of years'. BR confirmed there would be no compulsory redundancies over contract work. Finally, it promised to consult the RMT on preparing track and signalling maintenance staff to meet the 'emerging requirements' of the railway network as it underwent privatisation. Both sides last night accepted that the differences between them over compulsory redundancies had come down to 'the order of words in a sentence'. But the RMT continues to insist on a moratorium on contract work, something BR refuses to accept.</p>

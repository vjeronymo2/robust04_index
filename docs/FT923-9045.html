			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / British bookmakers can't separate Bush and Clinton PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton are neck-and-neck in the race for the White House, according to British bookmakers. Ladbrokes is offering odds of 4-5 (bet Pounds 5 to win Pounds 4) on both candidates. The latest prices reflect growing support for Mr Clinton in recent months. At the end of May, he was languishing as the outsider at 4-1, with Mr Ross Perot, who subsequently withdrew, at 3-1 and Mr Bush at 1-2. Mr Bush's odds, meanwhile, have been on the drift - in mid-March, his price was as short as 4-11.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount The aura of unreality surrounding the bidding war for Paramount has only been marginally dispelled by the two rivals thumping more hard cash on the table. Viacom's move to match QVC Network's tender offer must give it the edge, at least momentarily. With Paramount's board remaining impervious to QVC's blandishments and a poison pill defence in place to frustrate a hostile bid, QVC has now been manoeuvred into a position where it either raises or folds its hand. There remains a real possibility that the bidding will climb. Urged on by eager allies, QVC seems determined to press ahead. The prospect of another buyer entering the fray cannot be ruled out. Already, both declared suitors are prepared to pay a premium of more than Dollars 3bn over Paramount's pre-bid market value. That premium alone is more than the market worth of either Viacom or QVC. The justification for such generosity is based on the synergies offered by the rapidly converging world of multi-media and the scarcity value of Hollywood studios. But it will require an extraordinary harmony of interests among the winning group to justify the price. A coherent alliance of media and telecommunication companies could perhaps make the sums stack up. There is less chance that a rag-bag of allies hastily assembled during the heat of a bid will be able to make the Paramount deal pay.</p>

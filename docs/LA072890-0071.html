			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN OKS NEGOTIATION OF TREATIES WITH BALTICS  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the reformist president of the Russian Federation, agreed  Friday to negotiate treaties with the three Baltic republics, bypassing the  Soviet government's central authority, Baltic officials said.  </P> <P> In the republic of Byelorussia, the parliament declared that its laws take  precedence over Soviet law and that Byelorussia has the right to its own armed  forces, the official Tass news agency said.  </P> <P> The developments came as setbacks to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  plans to glue together his country's 15 republics in a new confederation.  </P> <P> Byelorussia is considered to be among the least reform-minded republics, but it  followed Russia, the Ukraine and the Baltic republics in declaring its  sovereignty.  </P> <P> While the Byelorussian parliament was approving its declaration of sovereignty,  the presidents of the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia met in  Jurmala, Latvia, with Yeltsin, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Negotiations between the three Baltic states and Russia must start  immediately," the Estonian News Service said in a report on a statement issued  by the presidents.  </P> <P> "After the talks, treaties will be signed between each Baltic state and Russia  on political, legal, economic, scientific and technical, and cultural aspects  of mutual relations, on relations between nationalities and citizenship."  </P> <P> The treaties should be ready in six to eight weeks, it said.  </P> <P> Latvian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recognition of the  Baltic republics' independence by the Russian republic likely would be  contained in the treaties, but it would not take effect until the agreements  are completed.  </P> <P> Signing of formal agreements between Russia and the independence-minded Baltic  republics would be a strong blow by reformers to Gorbachev's efforts to draft a  new agreement binding the Soviet republics together. The Baltic republics do  not want to participate in negotiations on the new agreement because they have  declared their intention to be independent countries.  </P> <P> A Russian-Baltic accord would signal a serious challenge by Yeltsin to  Gorbachev's leadership. It could lead to other direct agreements among  republics that would exclude the Soviet government and circumvent central  authority.  </P> <P> Members of Latvia's parliament quoted Yeltsin as saying in a meeting with  Latvian officials on Thursday that "Latvian independence definitely must be  recognized in the first, political section of our treaty."  </P> <P> A Latvian delegation was expected to go to Moscow on Monday to begin talks with  Yeltsin's Russian government.  </P> <P> Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania and  Arnold Ruutel of Estonia also met Friday to discuss their approach to the  negotiations on the new agreement binding the Soviet republics. But no  statement emerged.  </P></p>

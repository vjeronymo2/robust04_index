			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Mideast impasse WHEN EXPECTATIONS of rapid progress are raised in Middle East peace negotiations, bitter disappointment can not be far behind. So it has proved in the last 10 days, as Israelis and Palestinians have moved towards a thoroughly predictable impasse in their Washington talks on arrangements for Palestinian self-government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The latest round started with what seemed to be a fair wind, generated in large part by the election of a more conciliatory Israeli government under Mr Yitzhak Rabin. But the relatively calm and businesslike atmosphere of the bilateral negotiations has served merely to highlight vast differences on matters of substance. Further concessions from both sides will be necessary to avoid a breakdown. At issue is the body which Israelis and Palestinians agree should be set up to administer the territories during a five-year transitional period. The Palestinians want a fully-fledged authority with legislative powers and control over land; the Israelis have proposed a much more limited arrangement with domestic administrative powers but no say in security, foreign affairs or the running of Jewish settlements. This is no semantic dispute. It goes to the heart of the aspirations and fears on both sides. The Israelis say that by demanding a legislative authority, the Palestinians are seeking to pre-empt future negotiations on the final status of the territories and set up the nucleus of an independent state. The Palestinians reply that by circumscribing their self-rule so narrowly and reserving the right to continue building settlements, appropriating land and extracting water in the West Bank and Gaza, the Israelis are allowing themselves the scope to consolidate their hold over the territories in perpetuity. Both sides are missing the immediate point. What they are discussing is a transitional arrangement to enable Israelis and Palestinians to show they can live together free of violence, intimidation and interference. The Israelis need to be assured that a self-governing authority can not constitute a threat to them. Equally, if the word autonomy is to have any meaning, the Palestinians can not be asked simply to administer existing Israeli occupation laws; they have to be given the ability to initiate, or amend, legislation in their own right. Above all, though, Israelis and Palestinians will have to recognise the need to avoid being completely dogmatic about the ultimate outcome. If they try to predetermine the outcome of final-status negotiations that will only start in three years at the earliest, they will get nowhere.</p>

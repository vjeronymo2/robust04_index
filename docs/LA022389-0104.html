Marcos, his family and associates said it filed graft and corruption charges  against Marcos' brother-in-law. The Presidential Commission on Good Government  said it filed criminal charges against Benjamin Romualdez, younger brother of  Marcos' wife, Imelda, for having amassed about $280,000 by holding four  government posts at the same time for 10 years. In the first criminal case  filed against a Marcos relative, Romualdez is also facing civil charges in  connection with the recovery of the estimated $10 billion alleged to have been  plundered by Marcos during his 20-year rule. However, the whereabouts of  Romualdez, who fled to the United States when Marcos was overthrown, is not  known.  </P></p>

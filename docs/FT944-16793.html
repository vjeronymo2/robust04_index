			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Powell predicts slide towards united Ireland Devolution for Ulster could act as a stepping-stone to a united Ireland, Mr Enoch Powell, the former Tory cabinet minister, warned yesterday. As supporters of full integration of the province into the UK stepped up their campaign urging ministers to embrace their viewpoint, the octogenarian Mr Powell used a rare appearance on the conference fringe to condemn the government's Northern Ireland policy. The government had simply come up with a new version of the game-plan that had been in place for decades: 'Give Northern Ireland a new identity and we will soon get it out of the United Kingdom,' he said. The object of the conference, involving Ulster's main constitutional parties, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, hoped to convene was 'to recommend a measure of self government for Northern Ireland which will . . . enable it to be associated with the Irish Republic even more directly than it was by the Anglo-Irish agreement'. His assertion came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told the party that the government's position was founded on 'an impregnable rock of principle' - that Northern Ireland's future depended on the wishes of its people. Britain and Britain alone was responsible for the government of 'this part of our country', Mr Hurd stressed. Aides said Mr Hurd's comments were directed at Washington rather than Dublin. Addressing a sympathetic audience of rightwingers, Mr Powell - the Ulster Unionist MP for South Down for 13 years until 1987 - attacked Washington's role in current efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the province. 'The US has ordained that the UK government is to use its best efforts to satisfy the IRA and the territorial ambitions of the Irish Republic,' he said. He predicted that the IRA would resume violence if it decided it would not achieve its objectives peacefully. Questioned by Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland minister, on whether he would urge people to vote against proposals incorporating 'some element of devolution' if they were backed by three of the four main political parties in Ulster, Mr Powell replied simply: 'Yes.' The role of the US was also attacked by Lord Tebbit, another former cabinet minister, who said President Bill Clinton thought he could 'push us around even in Northern Ireland as though this was a Caribbean banana republic'.

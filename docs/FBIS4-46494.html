			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "West Helping Us Get Rid of </F> Surplus Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] Jonathan Aitken, Britain's minister for defense  procurement, has stated in parliamentary hearings that his  country has dispatched to Russia its first consignment of  supercontainers for transporting nuclear weapons. This was  reported by the British Defence Ministry Information Service.    The consignment consists of 10 of the promised 250 special  containers. Moreover, 20 armored trucks will be sent to Russia  to transport specific loads such as nuclear warheads. London is  helping Moscow to safely transport withdrawn nuclear weapons  with a view to accelerating their dismantling and destruction.  The British Government has allocated 35 million pounds for this  purpose. This was stipulated in a 9 November 1992 bilateral  agreement.    The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the British report.  Moreover, it said that we had already received not 10 but 48  supercontainers, which arrived the other day on a British  commercial vessel at the port of St. Petersburg. Admittedly,  they were not all handed over to the military -- six containers  are being kept by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, which  is the main recipient of such foreign aid in our country.    Apart from the supercontainers and the armored trucks,  Britain has promised to supply us with five reserve prime  movers. One of them has been being tested on our roads for a  year now and, I was told by the military, has proved to be quite  a reliable vehicle, able to meet the technical demands made of  it.    The people I spoke to at the military department refused to  show any photographs of the British equipment or to give its  performance. They stated that confidentiality on these matters  is a requirement of the joint memorandum and one of the  conditions for the safe shipment of nuclear weapons from their  bases to the railroad and the recycling plants.    Nonetheless, they said that the supercontainers are  outwardly  almost indistinguishable from the ordinary 10-cubic-meter  containers used for shipments by rail and sea, and the armored  trucks are almost no different from international refrigerated  trucks. Except that their off-road capability and engine power  are far greater than those of ordinary vehicles, and the armored  cab is capable of protecting the nuclear weapon from bullets and  grenade fragments in possible acts of terrorism or sabotage.  The supercontainers are also protected against fire. Even if a  major fire is raging around them, the air around the warhead  does not reach a critical temperature.    Apart from Britain, the United States, Germany, and France  are also giving us help in getting rid of our surplus nuclear  weapons, and an accord exists with Italy -- an agreement has  been signed but has not yet come into force.    The U.S. Government has allocated $400 million for these  purposes. The German leadership contributed 10 million German  marks [DM] last year for Russia to ensure the safe shipment and  temporary storage of nuclear weapons and to draw up plans for  processing and recycling weapons-grade plutonium and uranium.  This year it has provided another DM9 million, some of which  will go to Ukraine.    But, the military told me, not a single cent, penny, or  pfennig has crossed the CIS borders. All the money is still in  the United States, Britain, France, and Germany. Naturally so.  In helping Russia and the other former Union republics that  still have nuclear weapons on their territory to get rid of  their surpluses, Western governments are at the same time  securing major orders for their own firms and providing work for  their own plants.    Of course, the people I spoke to said, we could get by  without their help, but then it would take many a long year to  get rid of the nuclear weapon overhang.    Whereas previously we would transport up to 20 nuclear  weapons a year with many natural precautions and in conditions  of heightened secrecy, now, for instance, more than 2,000 such  warheads have to be withdrawn from Ukraine in the space of three  or four years. In the two months since they began to be  evacuated, 180 warheads have already been withdrawn on three  trains. This is not only very labor-intensive work but is also  very costly.    Incidentally, foreign aid has not yet been used for these  shipments, while the cars intended for the nuclear weapons have  been in service for 15-20 years already, new cars have not been  built for years, the track on which they will run has also not  been repaired for a long time, and if it were not for Western  aid it is not clear where all the funds would come from. The  military budget could not afford it.    At the same time, my interlocutors stated that Western aid  accounts for just a few percent of the total volume of work that  is being done and will have to be done by Russia itself and its  military and civilian specialists. Back in 1991 a special  20-year federal program was drawn up for enhancing the security  of nuclear weapons, recycling surplus weapons, and burying the  fissionable material. It required expenditure of 240 billion  rubles in 1991 prices.    Today the figure would be quite different. Perhaps this is  why the program has still not been ratified by the Russian  Government, although it has not been rejected.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Hurd urges caution in EC: Premature transfer of more power to Brussels will be resisted BRITISH determination to resist premature moves to confer more authority on the institutions of the European Community was underlined in the Commons yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. In a dismissive reference to reports that Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had already drawn up proposals for a supranational executive in Brussels, he said they had not been made known to the British government or considered by the commission itself. Mr Hurd, speaking in the resumed debate on the Queen's speech, said there was no case for changing the timetable agreed at the Maastricht summit, which provided for further discussions about the com-munity's institutions in 1996. He said smooth progress towards EC enlargement through the entry of Austria, Sweden and Finland should be a priority for Britain's presidency of the EC, starting on July 1. Mr Hurd hoped Britain's presidency would prepare the way for negotiations to be concluded with the three applicant countries next year so that, after the necessary ratification procedures in 1994, they could become EC members in 1995. He acknowledged that their arrival would require changes in the number of commissioners, the voting rights of the council of ministers, and membership of the European parliament. Mr Hurd insisted: 'I can see no advantage whatever in having a sort of permanent negotiation on the institutions of the community'. He envisaged that by 1996 consideration would be given to a second wave of new entrants to the EC, possibly including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. The foreign secretary said the EC had enough on its plate without arguing about its institutions. He urged it to concentrate on solving pressing financial and trading problems and completing the single market. Mr Hurd also called on Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi to draw a 'clear, certain, permanent line under the history of his support for terrorism'. If the two Libyan officials named in the warrants issued in connection with the Pan Am aircraft destroyed over Lockerbie were handed over to the Scottish or US authorities the position would be 'transformed'. Mr Hurd gave an assurance that they would not be subject to any interrogation while awaiting trial in Scotland and confirmed they would have the right to remain silent throughout the proceedings. Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, again pressed for more aid to be provided for the republics of the former Soviet Union. He warned of the risk of turmoil in the republics worse than that now occurring in the former Yugoslav republics.</p>

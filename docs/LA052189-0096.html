			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT STILL ELUDES BARGAINERS; TEACHER STRIKE NEARS WEEK 2  </P> <P> The third round of bargaining talks in the Los Angeles Unified School District  teachers' strike produced no settlement Saturday, with little time left to  prevent the walkout from entering its second week.  </P> <P> "I don't know where it's going to lead, but negotiations are continuing,"  school board President Roberta Weintraub said after a three-hour negotiating  session Saturday night at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel downtown. The talks are  scheduled to resume this afternoon and Weintraub stressed that today will be "a  decisive day."  </P> <P> Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said: "The teachers  want a settlement . . . but they're not willing to capitulate at this point."  </P> <P> Earlier Saturday, the district school board and a council of union leaders held  separate meetings to review bargaining positions and similar gatherings are  planned for early today.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable sources said that both sides face risks if the strike goes into a  second week. The union would lose some bargaining strength if a significant  number of teachers drift back to work because of money worries. On the other  hand, the school board would feel increased pressure for a settlement from  angry parents and community leaders.  </P> <P> School Supt. Leonard Britton has said that a settlement would have to be  reached by noon today for schools to be back to normal on Monday. And even if a  contract were signed today, officials fear that it would be difficult to get  the word of a settlement out.  </P> <P> Entering the Saturday afternoon meeting of his staff at union headquarters near  MacArthur Park, Johnson disputed an earlier pessimistic report about the  bargaining from district negotiator Dick Fisher.  </P> <P> The union chief charged that Fisher's statement that talks were not progressing  well was calculated to scare strikers back to work. "We are making proposals  and counterproposals," Johnson said. "How can you say that is not going well?"  </P> <P> Under the supervision of a state mediator, the talks have been held on three  consecutive nights.  </P> <P> The school board, which has been sharply divided on settlement terms, met in  closed session for about 90 minutes Saturday afternoon at the Bunker Hill  offices of its law firm, O'Melveny &amp; Myers, to review bargaining proposals.  No vote was taken, officials said.  </P> <P> School board member Alan Gershman, leaving that meeting, compared the strike to  a chess game in which the pawns have all been sacrificed. "The students have  been hurt. . . . Hopefully, we are going to end soon," said Gershman, who is in  a tough campaign for reelection in a June 6 runoff in his Westside district.  </P> <P> Citing a news blackout, officials from both camps refused to give details of  the proposals for a settlement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Representatives on Call  </P> <P> The union's House of Representatives is on call today for a ratification vote  if a contract is ready. If a contract is approved by those representatives  today, teachers would go back to work on Monday and hold a full membership  ratification vote soon afterward, officials said.  </P> <P> After a seven-hour bargaining session Friday, Weintraub said she was "neither  optimistic nor pessimistic" about a quick settlement, but said she thought the  negotiating was "getting to the point where the issues are clearly defined."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, parents are becoming increasingly upset about the strike's effect on  their families. Some are skipping work or taking their children along to their  jobs rather than send them to understaffed campuses. According to the district,  more than 600 parents have called the district urging a settlement.  </P> <P> Student attendance dropped drastically during the week, as youngsters wearied  of substitutes and a diet of movies and makeshift readings. On Friday, only  259,128 of the 594,000 district students were at the morning attendance roll.  About two-thirds of the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses, counselors and  librarians remained on strike.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Strikers Expected  </P> <P> On Saturday, Johnson said he expected some attrition in the number of strikers  if the walkout goes into a second week. But he added that he had "no doubt that  the strike will remain strong."  </P> <P> The talks are surrounded by uncertainty about how much of an enormous state tax  windfall over the next two years will be available to raise teachers' pay.  Other issues include the elimination of school yard duties for elementary  school teachers and the formation of school governing councils on which  teachers would have a majority vote.  </P> <P> The last publicly announced position from the district offered an 8%  retroactive raise for this year, between 5.5% and 8% next year depending on  funds from the state surplus, and 8% the following year. The union's last  public position was for annual raises of 10%, 8% and 8% over three years.  </P> <P> Starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the current top is $43,319  although some teachers earn more for extracurricular duties and teaching summer  school. A state fact-finder's report, released this week and angrily denounced  by the union, described that range as among the best in the state. The report  supported many of the district's positions.  </P></p>

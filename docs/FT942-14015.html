			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Bentsen to press Japan to boost its economy The US yesterday renewed demands for Japan to boost domestic demand in an effort to get its economy moving and bring down its trade surplus. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, warned he would be pressing Japan to do more about its trade surplus at Sunday's meeting in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. 'Maybe the US economy is doing well now despite the drag from that surplus, but it's essential, over the long run, for Japan to help lead global recovery rather than to impede it,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday. 'You saw the February trade numbers. Japan cannot rely on the US market, nor any other foreign market, to boost its economy. It must have its own sustainable, demand-led recovery,' he added. But Mr Bentsen said the US would not seek to bring the value of the dollar down against the yen as a means of improving the competitiveness of US exports to Japan. 'We're not going to try to devalue ourselves into their markets. We are in no way managing the dollar in that regard,' he said. He added that he saw room for further interest rate cuts in continental Europe. US officials said even for Japan, exports only made up a small proportion of output, so domestic demand remained much more important for overall economic growth. The US will also press for more efforts to ease access of foreign goods to Japanese markets as an accompaniment to the boost to demand it seeks. 'Macroeconomic stimulus is much more likely to be effective in reducing the current account deficit if foreign products are freely available,' a senior treasury official said.</p>

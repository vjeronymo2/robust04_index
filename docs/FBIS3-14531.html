The sources said that the invitations have been sent to  Israel and the other states participating in the committee's  proceedings, in accordance with the tradition pursued in the  Madrid formula, which stipulated that the invitation should be  sent by the state hosting the meeting and the cosponsors of the  peace conference (United States and Russia). The sources told  AL-HAYAH that Israel has also been invited among a limited and  select group of states to attend a preliminary meeting at expert  level to be held in Muscat on 5 April.    The sources pointed out that Israel was among the states  that  participated in the researches and proposals which the Sultanate  of Oman had been assigned to prepare within a comprehensive  study on ways of developing sea water desalination technology.  The experts meeting will meet to discuss the stage the study  has reached so far. The sources said that this "distinguished"  participation by Israel and other states in the region,  especially neighboring Arab states like Egypt, Jordan, and the  Palestinians, is a natural thing because these parties are  closely concerned with the issues to be discussed.

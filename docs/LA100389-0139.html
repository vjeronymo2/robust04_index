			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI PEACENIK SENTENCED FOR MEETING WITH ARAFAT  </P> <P> A judge sentenced Israeli peace activist Abie Nathan today to six months in  prison for violating an Israeli law by meeting with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P> Nathan, who pleaded guilty to the charge last week, said he would fight to  overturn the law "even from my prison cell." He received a one-year suspended  sentence in addition to the jail term.  </P> <P> The 63-year-old Nathan operates the pirate radio station "Voice of Peace" from  a ship in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> Nathan stood silent as Aharon Fass, deputy president of the Ramle Magistrate's  Court, read the sentence.  </P> <P> The activist told reporters later that his jailing would not halt his efforts  for Arab-Israeli peace.  </P> <P> "If somebody thinks I'm going to stop . . . they're in for big surprises," he  said. "I hope that public opinion and the people in the streets will understand  that this law is an obstacle to peace.  </P> <P> "I will continue even from my prison cell to protest against this law . . . and  immediately after prison I shall continue to speak to the enemy," he said.  </P> <P> Nathan pleaded guilty Wednesday to meeting with Arafat and other PLO activists  in Tunisia and France in September, 1988. He told the court he knew he was  violating a 1986 amendment to the anti-terror law that prohibits holding  meetings with terrorist organizations.  </P> <P> Reacting to the sentence, leaders of two left-wing political parties, Shinui  and the Citizen's Rights Movement, called for the repeal of the law prohibiting  meetings with the PLO, which Israel refuses to recognize and labels as a  terrorist organization.  </P> <P> The Citizen's Rights Movement said it will propose a law at the next session of  the Knesset to allow meetings with the PLO for the purpose of promoting peace.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde and Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Listened -- </F> But Said Little"]    [Text] Reports from Brussels of a tougher French stance in  the fisheries section of the EU [European Union] membership  negotiations came at the same time as the country's European  Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure began a round trip through the  Nordic applicant countries. Yesterday he met the Norwegian  prime minister, foreign minister, trade minister, and fisheries  minister in separate meetings.    At a subsequent news conference, he used up so much time in  speaking in general terms about France's desire to bring Norway  into the EU, and there was no time to discuss in detail the  problems in the negotiations.    It would not be right to say anything about France's  position  on Norway's fisheries demands before the EU countries have  reached a common position, he said. However, Lamassoure  stressed it was of crucial importance for the EU to arrive at a  common fisheries policy.    "We have to arrive at a single Europe on fisheries, not two.  Nevertheless, for a certain period we will have to look at what  sort of transitional arrangements are needed," he said.    In the section of the negotiations on agriculture, the EU  has  agreed to reject the Norwegian demand for a gradual adjustment  to the EU's agricultural policy. This runs contrary to the  signals that Gro Harlem Brundtland and Gunhild Oyangen received  during their visits to Paris a few weeks ago.    Nevertheless, Lamassoure did not think that Harlem  Brundtland  had misunderstood the situation in Paris: "There are some  purely technical problems in these negotiations, but I do not  think that we will have major difficulties reaching agreement on  agriculture," he said.    If we are to be bold enough to interpret the French  minister's words, this must mean that France could, when all is  said and done, envisage supporting Norway on transitional  arrangements for agriculture. However, an interpretation of his  general remarks on fish is less optimistic.    The most probable interpretation is that France will go  against Norway's demand that it retain control over fishing  north of the 62d parallel -- in addition to demanding  transitional arrangements on market access -- according to  information received by AFTENPOSTEN in Brussels.    According to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen,  Lamassoure did not touch on the question of French transitional  arrangements for Norwegian market access during the two  ministers' meeting yesterday. Lamassoure largely used his  half-hour with the fisheries minister to listen to the fisheries  demands Norway is making in the negotiations with the EU -- with  full market access from day one of membership and not a single  fish to be given away in quota arrangements as the main points.  The EU Commission will not make known its response to the  Norwegian demands until 17 February.    Olsen is otherwise happy that France has again opened the  door to fish imports from Norway, but wants to wait and see how  the transport of fish will pass off in practice.    "Lamassoure gave assurances that customs controls will  become  a lot easier and that veterinary tests on loads of Norwegian  fish will take a maximum of 24 hours," the minister said.</p>

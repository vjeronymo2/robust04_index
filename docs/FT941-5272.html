			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / China's reforms 'weakened centre' China's economic reforms have caused a dangerous decentralisation of power and contributed to social decay and rising crime, a paper published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies says. 'To borrow the jargon of the European Community, Beijing first adopted 'subsidiarity' as a means to achieve economic growth, and now finds that once power has been transferred to the most logical and efficient level, it is hard to retrieve.' The paper, 'China Changes Shape: Regionalism and Foreign Policy', written by Mr Gerald Segal, an IISS senior fellow, argues other countries need to recognise the decentralisation of power and develop policies for dealing with regional powers in China. But it 'neither predicts nor advocates' China's dissolution. 'Such dramatic dislocation would damage the prosperity of a fifth of mankind, wreck East Asian stability and lead to massive migration. 'Power has been devolved to a range of actors, including township and village enterprises, individuals and even overseas Chinese and other outsiders. Thus there is no simple struggle for control between centre and province.' The paper traces the impact on Beijing of the shift of decision-making power to the provinces. Revenue to the centre as a proportion of the economy has fallen sharply as richer provinces have gained muscle to rebuff successive attempts to redress the balance; the latest is now under way. At the same time, the central government failed to develop financial institutions which could exercise macroeconomic control. 'Beijing could no longer impose austerity measures on the national economy, and rich provinces could raise funds from local investment and abroad.' Provinces increasingly squabble among themselves on economic issues, sometimes seeking to exclude each other's products from their markets, with Beijing apparently powerless to prevent such internal protectionism. Regionalism, the paper argues, could become a more serious political problem following the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 89-year-old paramount leader. 'Perhaps the one certain thing about the succession to Deng is that no successor will be able to don such a strong mantle of leadership.' Mr Segal finds a 'fin-de-siecle feeling' of which the result is social decay, corruption, criminal activity and 'the increasing prominence of secret societies and cult practices'. Some of these features would be diminished if a strong leader were to emerge. Central control of the People's Liberation Army appears secure, but it is increasingly involved in money-making ventures closely linked to the development of individual regions.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Let's drink to boost for tourism Sir, I suggest a boost for tourism that needs no new money, no new 'initiatives', and no new government bodies. Give us intelligent, grown-up, civilised pub hours. Let pubs open on Sunday afternoons if they want to. And let pubs and restaurants serve alcohol until the small hours of the morning. Michael Forsyth is the minister responsible for licensing. As a Scot, he knows they do things better up north, where pubs can open on Sunday afternoons and until 1am. And, as a deregulator, he should be itching to get his hands on these absurd English laws. How about it?

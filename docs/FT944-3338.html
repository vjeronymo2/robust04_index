			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: The price of 'fast-track' - Nancy Dunne on the negotiating trap for Clinton President Bill Clinton received two letters last week illustrating the gulf between lofty free trade goals and political reality. One was sent by the new House Republican leadership. It supported renewing the president's 'fast-track' negotiating authority - under which Congress undertakes either to pass or reject trade pact negotiations without amendment. The president needs that authority to pursue new trade pacts, such as that - announced at the Summit of the Americas at the weekend - to include Chile in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. However, Republican support for fast-track has a price: any thought of negotiating side pacts on labour and the environment, similar to the pacts in Nafta with Canada and Mexico must be abandoned, the letter said. The second letter to Mr Clinton came from Congressman Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House. 'We need to ensure that our policies are not simply viewed by the public as promoting the interests of multinational corporations at the expense of our workers,' he wrote. 'A broad coalition' for passage of fast-track can be found within the Democratic party he said, but 'we must not allow Republicans to treat workers rights and environmental issues as back-seat issues.' Mr Clinton faced a similar bind in his 1992 election campaign when he was forced to take a stand on Nafta. His solution was to promise to negotiate 'side pacts' on labour and environment to discourage US companies from moving production to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labour or non-enforcement of environmental rules. After the 1992 election, negotiations over the labour pact ran into difficulty and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, eventually settled for a deal which stressed co-operation and consultation and permits sanctions only in rare cases after the completion of a complicated complaints process. 'Lewis Carroll, working with Franz Kafka, could hardly have devised a process more surreal,' said the Institute for Policy Studies. Complaints go first to National Administrative Offices (NAOs) in each of the three countries. They can then be referred on through a variety of trilateral councils, committees and arbitration panels that could take more than three years. At the end, the offending party may be fined up to Dollars 20m either in cash or trade concessions withdrawn. Funds collected would be repaid to the offending country to enable it to take corrective action. Thus far, no case has passed the first step. The NAO in Washington has received four complaints, held hearings on two, and refused to take further action on those. To American trade unionists, such as Mr Chris Townsend, of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the process is 'a sham'. But to Republicans, it is a threat to the future of free trade deals. President Clinton will request fast-track authority as soon as Congress convenes in January. He could probably win it with the support of the Republican majority by de-linking labour and the environment from any trade negotiations. But if he does so he will create a rift with congressional liberals who are, at best, unenthusiastic about his re-election in 1996.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Building materials Any lingering hopes of imminent revival in the UK building sectors will have been dashed by yesterday's grim news from Heywood Williams. Recent profit warnings from Taylor Woodrow and Tarmac have underlined the precarious state of contracting and the weakness of demand for aggregates. The announcement by the UK's leading glass distributor that second quarter profits will be well down on last year - only three months after a relatively upbeat financial year-end statement - is a reminder that the so-called light end of the market is in the doldrums too. Yesterday's 12 per cent fall in the Heywood Williams share price will not have made the task of Anglian Windows' advisers any easier. It will be no surprise if today's flotation price for Anglian is pitched rather lower than the level being talked about even a week ago. The reality is that May was a terrible month for the building materials manufacturers and that June is unlikely to have been much better. The best that most companies are now hoping for is second half volumes comparable with the first half, and that the pick up will not be delayed too far into 1993. No wonder Heywood Williams is not prepared to go further than guaranteeing the interim dividend at this stage.</p>

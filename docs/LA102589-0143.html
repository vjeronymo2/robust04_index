Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> $900,000 JEWEL BANDIT ARRESTED  </P> <P> A Colombian national accused of taking part in a $900,000 theft from a Van Nuys  jewelry saleswoman last summer was in jail today after he was spotted by  detectives on surveillance in the Wilshire District, Los Angeles police said  this morning.  </P> <P> Edwin Lopez, 26, who police believe is a member of a ring responsible for $200  million in jewelry thefts in Los Angeles last year, was arrested Tuesday night  and was being held in lieu of $1-million bail, Detective Michael Woodings said.  </P> <P> Lopez was wanted on a warrant charging him with burglary from the auto of  Sandra Smith on Aug. 25, Woodings said.  </P> <P> Smith, a sales representative for Van Lightner Jewelry in Van Nuys, was  carrying the jewels in a canvas bag when her car overheated in Hollywood,  causing her to stop, Woodings said. When Smith tried to get help, four suspects  ran to her car, broke a window, grabbed the jewels and fled. Later it was  discovered that Smith's radiator hose had been slashed.  </P> <P> Fingerprints connected Lopez to the scene, Woodings said. At the time of his  arrest, detectives were watching other members of the alleged theft ring when  they noticed Lopez, he said. The jewelry taken in the robbery has not been  recovered. The three other suspects are at large, Woodings said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Medan, Jun 2 (ANEX/ANTARA) -- Indonesia on Thursday  asked Malaysia and Thailand that a joint planning and studies  should be conducted for the basic infrastructure development of  the Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand Growth Triangle (IMTGT)  cooperation project.    Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade  Hartarto, during the third ministerial meeting of IMTGT  cooperation, said that the joint investment for the basic  infrastructure development will include the development of  telecommunication and transportation systems.    He also said that beside the joint development projects,  there are other four important factors that should be managed by  the three countries themselves for the IMTGT cooperation.  "First, all governments involved should provide a sustainable  support for the sub-regional economic cooperation while striving  to overcome handicaps that may hamper the investment and trade  activities, both in and outside the region" he said.    He proposed that the governments involved should draw up a  list of its development plan priorities so that proper steps can  be taken to avoid conflicts with the IMTGT projects.    Hartarto also stressed the need for the three governments to  discuss and adopt common regulations, laws and procedures for  the IMTGT cooperation. Furthermore, the three governments  should ask its private sectors to increase their roles in  stimulating the IMTGT development project.    Meanwhile, Thailand Deputy Prime Minister for Economic  Affairs Suphachai Phanitchaphak, shared the same view with  Indonesia's, especially that which concerns the private sectors'  important involvement in the development of the growth triangle  area.    He also pointed out Thailand's strong commitment to the  IMTGT  cooperation, saying that they have started to conduct dialogues  in the operational level.    "Operational level dialogues are aimed at establishing joint  cooperation, particularly in trade and investment, integrated  infrastructure development, and fishery sectors," the Thai  minister said.    Malaysia's Minister Abdul Hamid Pawanteh, however,  underscored the importance of increasing the quality of  development for the integrated infrastructure in provinces  within the IMTGT region.    On the occasion, the Malaysian minister expressed the hope  that the next IMTGT meeting scheduled in September or October  this year will be held in Penang, Malaysia.    IMTGT involves two Indonesian provinces of Aceh and North  Sumatera, four in Malaysia, and five of Thailand's southern  provinces.</p>

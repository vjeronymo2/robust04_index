Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity, who is under  investigation following the well-known events of October,  corresponds to the truth. However, they refused to comment on  this event, citing the fact that an official ministry report is  being prepared.    Barkashov was identified in hospital, where he underwent two  operations after receiving gunshot wounds. In his words, he was  shot at from a passing car at 0300 hours not far from the  "Oktyabrskoye Pole" subway station. Someone brought him to  hospital, bleeding profusely. There Barkashov spent a week  before being identified.    The arrested man was transferred to another hospital, under  heavy guard. His condition is serious. But journalists  visiting his wife have reported that he is still conscious.    Stop Press: The Russian MVD Public Relations Center has  announced that, as a result of current investigative measures by  the internal affairs organs on 30 December 1993, Aleksandr  Barkashov, leader of the so-called "Russian National Unity"  movement, was discovered in a Moscow Oblast medical  establishment. He was brought to the Russian MVD hospital, where  he was given medical aid.    The same source said that Barkashov was in hospital in  connection with gunshot wounds received in a certain population  center in Moscow Oblast -- not in the capital, as reported  earlier. Criminal proceedings have been instituted in  connection with the attack on Barkashov.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Shareholders should be more vigilant, active and demanding All shareholders will surely agree with Peter Morgan (Letters, July 31) that the objective of corporate governance is to ensure that companies 'survive and thrive'. But who does what about it when companies don't thrive and the directors' remuneration takes an ever increasing share of diminishing profit, value added or whatever measure you like to use. And let's be clear about it, there are many FTSE-100 companies in this category right now. In the same issue, Lex ('ICI does the splits') points to one solution: 'ICI's demerge plan is a splendid example of how a supposedly hidebound management can be rendered nimble by a sense of threat.' And now we have ProNed's survey of 491 directors adding damning evidence of the inadequacies in the present system. No less than 86 per cent of the directors surveyed were 'dissatisfied with the amateur approach adopted by companies of appointing non-executive directors'. Peter Morgan himself has publicly called for 'shareholders to see and understand the connection between directors' pay and performance'. Every annual general meeting I have attended recently has had shareholders, who do not understand the connection, seeking justification for hefty increases in directors' remuneration against poor performance. The answers are pathetically inadequate. The real reason, never referred to, arises out of the 'non-executive director old boy network' (see ProNed survey). Shareholders have to become more vigilant, more active and more demanding. United Kingdom Shareholders' Association intends to assist them in this process.

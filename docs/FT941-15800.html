			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Singapore finds quay to success - One of the world's busiest container ports is a pioneer in its use of computers On the dock lie 60,000 containers, stacked five high. In one of them is a batch of bicycles en route from Taiwan to Finland. It needs to be found, loaded on to a truck, taken to a quayside crane and put in a designated place in the hold of a particular vessel, one among dozens in the port. All this must happen in minutes. Handling cargoes at Singapore, which rivals Hong Kong as the world's busiest container port, is as complex as managing flights at an international airport. A vessel arrives at and departs from the port on average every three minutes. At any one time, 700 ships are in port. The port is a pioneer in using technology in virtually every aspect of its operations. More than 200 computer and wireless transmission systems monitor traffic, designate berths and loading and unloading times, deal with customs and paperwork, and book bunkering fuel. 'If we hadn't developed our technology then Singapore would no longer be competing as a major port,' says Eric Lui, deputy director of information systems at the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), the government body that runs the port. 'Technology is vital to combat our land and labour shortage problems, to keep down costs and, most importantly, to improve port efficiency.' Recently, the PSA has been concentrating its technological efforts on a computer system that plans and directs all of the port's container-handling operations. The computer integrated terminal operations system (Citos) controls container movement from the freight forwarding agent to the hold of the ship. First, the agent keys into a computer system called Portnet, which gives sailing times of vessels, length of delivery and space available. Then, the agent keys in container contents, weight of goods and the ship required. Using another system called Tradenet the agent can obtain electronic customs approvals and clear other official documents. Through Citos, the agent is given a time to deliver the container to the port. About 6,000 trucks - known in port language as 'prime movers' - enter or leave Singapore port every 24 hours. The gates are fully automated. The PSA says the average clearance time is 45 seconds. 'We give the agents transponders, which are fitted to the top of the containers,' says Lui. 'The trans-ponders are used to register arrival at the gate and transmit messages to a central computer. Cameras at the gates read the container numbers, the driver flashes his ID against a magnetic screen and at the same time the container is weighed.' In less than a minute, the driver receives a computer readout detailing where he should wait for a crane to unload his container. At the same time, the central computer is flashing messages to display screens watched by crane operators and dockside prime mover drivers, telling them where and when to pick up the container, which ship to load it on to, and in what sequence containers should be loaded. Singapore is at the centre of the world's fastest-growing economic region, and container traffic through the port is expanding by about 20 per cent each year. Twenty years ago, Singapore was handling 130,000 TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units - the standard container measure) every year. In 1992, it handled 7.56m TEUs; the figure for 1993 is estimated at nearly 9m TEUs, with a further rise forecast to 15m TEUs by the turn of the century when the first phase of a port expansion plan is completed. The port serves as a regional hub, with feeder services sending goods from Indonesia, India or Thailand for loading onto bigger 'mother ships'. An estimated 70 per cent of the port's traffic is based on such transshipment activities. The PSA claims that technology gives it the edge in many areas. Singapore can have vessels in and out of port more quickly than elsewhere, and officials say the port can turn around a ship carrying 1,000 TEUs in less than 12 hours. Singapore's technology also brings cost advantages, says Lui. 'Because of our serious labour shortage problems, the cost of workers in Singapore is considerably higher than in Hong Kong, which can draw on a plentiful labour supply from China. Yet through using technology, we calculate that the costs to the port user here are half those in Hong Kong.' In spite of the big expansion in port traffic, the PSA has been reducing its workforce and now has about 2,300 employed in port handling activities. Lui says Hong Kong has about 6,000 workers - partly because it has separate terminals and is not one unified port. The PSA does face problems. Other ports in the region, such as Malaysia, have big ambitions and can offer a cheaper service to shippers. Lui also admits that technology cannot cope with everything: experts are still wrestling with how to make full use of spare capacity on dockside prime movers. Nevertheless, Singapore seems confident about its future. The government plans to partly privatise the port, probably this year.</p>

Ciller spoke at a rally where thousands of Kemalists  gathered  in the streets of Istanbul at noon today as a reaction to the  anti-Kemalist initiatives of a group of fundamentalist  parliamentarians. The rally aimed at stressing Turkish citizen's  dedication to the secular and democratic principles of Mustafa  Kemal Ataturk (the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey) and  his reforms.    One reason for the sudden surge of Kemalism was a defamatory  statement made by Prosperity Party (RP) Deputy Hasan Mezarci,  who called Ataturk an illegitimate child and refused to call him  "Ataturk," which means "father of Turks." The name was given to  Ataturk by the Turkish people in 1934 to their hero who led them  to victory against the invaders of the country.    Ciller earlier called for the masses to express their  respect  for Ataturk and their reaction to fundamentalists who attempt to  defame his memory.    She said the people's love of Ataturk has passed from  generation to generation. "No one, not Mezarci, will be able to  erase the love we have for Ataturk from our hearts," Ciller  said.

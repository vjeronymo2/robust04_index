			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Manchester trams beat forecasts Greater Manchester's ex-perimental 'supertram' - unique in Britain because it runs on existing railway lines in the suburbs but takes to specially laid tracks in the streets through the city centre - is proving more successful than forecast. When the first trams ran on the Pounds 132m Manchester Metrolink system in April 1992 they were expected to be carrying about 11m passengers a year by now, but the actual figure is 13m. Recent surveys suggest 47 per cent of passengers leave their cars at home to take the tram, easing traffic congestion and parking problems. Metrolink's success is likely to encourage similar developments in other cities in Britain and abroad. Sheffield has already laid tracks and will begin a supertram service between the city centre and Meadowhall, an out-of-town shopping complex, in about two months. Southampton and Croydon are among about a dozen other places making plans. Manchester's success is also significant because of the method of financing, which will now be used as a model. A consortium of public and private sectors made a competitive bid to design, build, operate and maintain the system at the least cost to public funds - in effect, quasi-privatisation of part of the public transport network. The private sector gets most of its returns long-term through operations, rather than from profits in construction and vehicle supply. It is also obliged to maintain the network. Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive and local authorities took only a 24.7 per cent stake in the venture to keep below the 25 per cent permitted by law for public-sector participation in private companies. The private-sector backers - GEC Alsthom, Mowlem and Amec - then paid Pounds 5m for the franchise to operate the service under contract to the executive, which retained control over policy. Metrolink extensions are planned to Salford Quays and Trafford Park, with later possible links to Rochdale, Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Airport.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sevinc Yavuz, Baran Tural, and Sukran Ozcakmak: </F> "Muslim Societies"]    [Text]  <H8>  Naksibendi Tariqa </H8>   The founder of the Naksibendi tariqa [religious brotherhood]  is Sheykh Muhammad Baha'-al-Din Naqshbandi [Naksibendi]. He was  born in the village of Qasr-i 'Arifan in Bukhara. The  Naksibendi tariqa, which is very active in the Muslim world,  gets its strengths from the fundamental principle of "devotion  to the sheykh." After Sheykh Naqshbandi, the tariqa was led by  'Ala-al-Din 'Attar, Ya'qub Carphi, and Muhammad Parsha. This  tariqa is classified as a simple tariqa to follow, because it  does not interfere with worldly needs such as eating, drinking,  sleeping, marrying, and working. The other fundamental  principles of the tariqa are: Shari'ah, the religious order,  truth, and spiritual knowledge. The first pioneers of the  Naksibendi tariqa in Turkey were Ali Haydar Efendi and Mehmet  Zahid Kotku. There is a Naksibendi tariqa in every city in  Turkey, and there are about 2 million Naksibendi followers in  Turkey. The religious communities of the Naksibendi tariqa are  known to vote for the Motherland Party [ANAP], the Prosperity  Party [RP], and the Grand Unity Party [BBP]. The main  Naksibendi publications are ISLAM, ALTINOLUK [The Golden  Channel], and BIZIM DERGAH [Our Dervish Monastery]. The  following are the religious orders of the Naksibendi tariqa.  <H5>  Menzil Cemaati </H5> Founder: Mehmet Rasit Efendi  Leader: A new leader has not been named since Mehmet Rasit  died.

It believes that alcohol, gambling, and prostitution  are the causes of social collapse. The order has ample financial  means.  <H8>  Nurcu Tariqa </H8>   The founder is Said-i Nursi. Risale-i Nur is the  fundamental work of the tariqa's theoretic and practical views.  Said-i Nursi said that Nurcuism was not a tariqa. In 1907, he  attached the word "Bediuzzaman" (which means wonder of the age)  to his name. Said-i Nursi, the most frequent exile in the  history of the republic, acquired thousands of supporters and  extended his influence to the places where he was exiled. In  addition to the areas where the Kurds live, the tariqa has large  numbers of supporters in northern Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India,  Saudi Arabia, England, and the United States. The Nurcu tariqa  strenuously opposes capitalism and also criticizes secularism.  Said-i Nursi gave significant sermons on social justice, law,  and equality. The tariqa was close to the MNP, MSP, and Justice  Party [AP] in the past. Today, it supports The True Path Party  [DYP] and the ANAP. Its publications are ZAMAN [Time], YENI  ASYA [New Asia], SIZINTI [Leakage], ZAFER [Victory], SUR [City  Wall], and BIZIM AILE [Our Family] newspapers. The tariqa has  many local radio stations and one private television channel  called Samanyolu [The Milky Way] in Anatolia.

A secret code language is used within the  community. Audio and video cassette productions are considered  important.  <H5>  Yeni Nesil Cemaati </H5> Founder: Mehmet Kutlular  Leader: --  Party it supports: DYP  Area where it is influential: Istanbul and Central Anatolia.

It defends democracy and  secularism in the "real sense." It follows an anticommunist  line and favors a national identity in industry.  <H8>  Suleymanci Tariqa </H8>   This was founded by Suleyman Hilmi Turahan, a Muslim judge  of  Silistre. After Turahan, the former deputy of AP, Kemal Kacar  became the first man of the tariqa. The tariqa's specific  tenets are: strength and missionary spirit, legality and  modernism, and discipline and obedience. The tariqa believes  that the Office of Religious Affairs has nothing to do with  Islam, and has declared the Office and the Principles of Ataturk  as foes. The tariqa has about 300 Muslim culture centers. It  plays a role in politics. As far as the order is concerned,  Turkey is Dar-al-Harb [abode of war], and the religious  communities outside its own are not considered Muslims. When  greeting people outside its own, "Essamualeykum" [blight be upon  you] is used [instead of "Selamunaleykum" which means peace be  upon you]. The tariqa supports the DYP and ANAP. By designating  pilot regions in the Mediterranean area, the tariqa gained  substantial amounts of supporters. The tariqa has retreated from  its hard line in recent years. Its present leader is Huseyin  Kumas, and it carries out its activities under the umbrella of  courses and aid associations in schools.  <H8>  Isikci Tariqa </H8>   This is also known as the Turkey Group. It was founded by  Huseyin Ilmi Isik. In his work entitled Saadet-i  Ebediye [Eternal Happiness] he points out the fundamental  principles of the tariqa. After Isikci, the true theoretical  leader of the Isikcilar tariqa is said to be "Feyz alan"  [Knowledge Receiver] Abdul Hakim. The tariqa supports whichever  party on the Right is most likely to come to power, places great  importance on commerce, and considers every kind of commerce  permissible in the name of its struggle. The present leader is  said to be "sincere" businessman Dr. Enver Oren. The tariqa has  weekly and monthly magazines, including TGRT [Radio and  television network of TURKIYE GAZETESI] and TURKIYE GAZETESI,  addressing every sector.  <H8>  The Other Tariqas </H8>   We can group these tariqas under two main headings. The  first group is those that are mystically inclined: Mevlevi,  Rifai, and Cerrahi tariqas. The second group is those that are  radically inclined: Vehabi [Wahhabi] tariqa (greatly influenced  by Iran, Syria, and Egypt), Ihvan-i Muslimin [Muslim  Brotherhood], and the Muslim clergy supporters. While the  radically inclined ones are not able to find much support from  people, mystically inclined groups are gaining support every day.</p>

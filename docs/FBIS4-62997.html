			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- An official dinner was given in  the Kremlin today by the Russian president in honor of Finland's  President Marti Ahtisaari. The heads of the two states made  speeches at the dinner.    The visit by the Finnish president to Russia soon after his  election to the supreme state post confirms that our  northwestern neighbor is making Russia a priority in its foreign  policy, Boris Yeltsin said. We greatly appreciate this and  highly value goodneighborly relations between our countries.    He said that his conversation with Martti Ahtisaari showed  the existence of a high degree of trust and mutual respect. "I  am confident that in the future, we shall also be able to  conduct a productive dialogue, especially where questions of  security and urgent issues of Russian-Finnish cooperation are  involved" he said.    The Russian president paid special attention to the  importance of trade and the economic partnership, saying that  "as before, we attach primary importance to developing our  relations with Finland in this sphere." "The situation seems  most favorable for the interaction of business circles in the  adjacent border regions of Russia and Finland," Boris Yeltsin  said. "Modern forms of cooperation, such as production  cooperation, compensation deals, and joint ventures have already  been tested."    He noted that "an important place in regional cooperation is  occupied by cooperation in environmental protection. The  serious ecological situation that is developing in the Baltic  basin and on the Kola Peninsula requires constant, coordinated  action."    Our scientific, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation also  has room for expansion. "In general, we have a lot to do, but we  look to the future with optimism," Boris Yeltsin said, wishing  the people of the friendly land of Suomi success and prosperity.    "We certainly wish to preserve everything positive that has  been achieved over the decades in our relations and make efforts  toward the further development of our cooperation," Marrti  Ahtisaari said. He noted that the Russo-Finnish bilateral  agreements had been put together in such a way that they  corresponded to the new situation that had arisen since the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, when Russia took its place  as Finland's eastern neighbor. Difficulties had arisen in  economic cooperation between the two countries at that time, but  events had taken an abrupt turn for the better last year, the  Finnish president said. The agreements that had already been  concluded and about which talks were still in progress would  assist in the creation of stability in this development, he  noted.    The Finnish president noted the need to make every effort to  further develop and strengthen international cooperation and  disarmament, which promote world security. Finland will  continue to make its contribution toward strengthening the  structures of cooperation in Europe and settling conflicts that  have deteriorated to the point of armed clashes, he assured his  listeners.    The head of the Finnish state voiced the hope that relations  between Russia and the new independent Baltic states will soon  become stable and good.    The Finnish president expressed his sincere gratitude to the  Russian president for the hospitality shown him in Moscow. He  proposed a toast to good relations between Finland and Russia  and to the happiness of the people of Russia.</p>

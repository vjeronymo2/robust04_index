			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Jitters below a calm surface: The potential impact of the Banesto affair on other Spanish banks A vast red banner bearing the figure eight and a percentage sign covers one side of Banco Santander's office tower in the Madrid financial district. It advertises the latest shot in the mortgage 'wars' among Spanish banks over the past year. 'The largest trading screen in Spain,' says one banker, gesturing at the banner from his office window. The intense competition for retail banking business is one problem facing players in what has been one of the world's most stable and profitable banking markets. A second, potentially larger problem emerged a month ago when the Bank of Spain dismissed the old management of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto). The central bank has now put together a rescue plan to cover a Pta605bn (Pounds 2.9bn) 'hole' in Banesto's balance sheet. The plight of Banesto has raised questions about other banks - particularly those such as Banco Central Hispano, which, like Banesto, holds substantial equity stakes in industrial companies. 'Until there is a full explanation of what happened at Banesto, it is logical to ask which other bank will be next,' says Mr Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of IBCA, the London-based bank ratings agency. Banesto's problems emerged when Bank of Spain inspectors discovered its Dollars 61bn of assets had been over-valued. The provisions made by the bank against loan losses were insufficient and its equity holdings were not worth as much as it claimed. This was despite regular inspections by the Bank of Spain, and monitoring by Banesto's adviser, the US bank J P Morgan. Some observers, however, argue that Banesto was a special case. It was run by Mr Mario Conde, a colourful industrialist whose methods were distrusted by other banks; it expanded its loan book very fast between 1988 and 1991; it was heavily exposed to Spain's recession; and it cut margins between its deposits and loans as it fought to increase its market share. 'Banesto was an exceptional bank, and its problems should not have a big knock-on effect on others,' says Mr Julian Hollis, an analyst at S G Warburg, the London-based investment bank. Others point to steady profits reported by other banks for 1993. 'The high-quality Spanish banks achieved quite a creditable performance last year,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, of securities house Lehman Brothers. Not surprisingly, directors of other Spanish banks agree that the sector is in a good state. Santander last week reported a 17.8 per cent rise in after-tax profits to Pta77.9bn. Mr Juan Inciarte, chief executive, says the fact that banks have maintained profits in the midst of recession indicates their strength. 'The basic profitability of Spanish banks is without question,' he says. The strength of Spanish banks has enabled them to survive the first shocks created by Banesto's problems. But, in spite of the optimism of many observers, the longer-term impact could still be damaging. The plan to clean up and re-capitalise Banesto (see accompanying article) could affect other banks in three ways. First, they will have to increase contributions to the deposit guarantee fund - the state-run scheme which uses contributions from the country's banks to insure deposits - to compensate for the Pta285bn the fund will spend on acquiring Banesto assets. The drag the fund has on banks' earnings had been easing since the last banking crisis; now it will grow. The second effect is that banks have been asked by the Bank of Spain to contribute to a Pta180bn rights issue, buying shares which eventually they will try to sell. The banks could gain from this investment, but if Banesto's difficulties are not solved by the latest recapitalisation, it may have to be rescued again through a takeover. Each of the large banks faces the risk of being prodded into saving Banesto by the central bank. The third effect is less direct. One reason why estimates of Banesto's difficulties have varied markedly is that it is impossible to determine an exact market value of any bank's smaller loans and assets. Banks gradually adjust the value of their assets over economic cycles by making - and sometimes reducing - provisions against bad debt. Because Banesto's assets were so suddenly devalued, some observers believe other banks may be galvanised into taking a more conservative view of their own loans. 'When one bank is declared sick, then others start to re-examine their assets, and some are liquidated,' says Mr Carlos Martinez de Campos, Barclays Bank's director of European retail banking. The effects would have to be very large to weaken the other private banks significantly. Through their large branch networks, Spanish banks have gathered cheap deposits from unsophisticated rural customers. They use these funds to make personal and small business loans at relatively high interest rates. Until Santander broke an informal cartel in 1989 by offering interest-bearing deposit accounts, this ensured one of the highest net interest margins (the profit margin on lending and deposit taking) of any banking market. The banks were also forced by the Bank of Spain to maintain high capital ratios, and make conservative provisions against loan losses. The combination led to high returns on strong capital. But the Banesto incident comes at an awkward time for Spanish banks. The sector has been suffering the consequences of one of the country's deepest post-war recessions. This has pushed the ratio of problem loans to its highest point since the banking crisis of the late 1970s, during which 50 banks had to be bought and refloated by Spain's deposit guarantee fund. There are other uncertainties facing Spanish banks: Competition has increased both for loans and for deposits. Santander's latest mortgage campaign follows similar deposit 'wars'. This has eroded the net interest margin of the top Spanish banks from 4.6 per cent in 1988 to 3.2 per cent in 1992. The fact that the margin in France and Germany is below 2 per cent indicates the potential for a continuing squeeze. Mr Hollis of S G Warburg says that banks face pressure on margins as customers shop around more. The banks may in turn grow better at protecting their margins by using financial derivatives, such as options, but it is likely to be a losing battle. 'The thing you can guarantee is that margins will erode as customers get more sophisticated,' says Mr Hollis. The Bank of Spain's effectiveness as a supervisor has been put under scrutiny for the first time since the 1970s banking crisis, when it was widely perceived to have been lax and ineffective in monitoring banks. Since then, it has generally been assumed to be so rigorous that investors could trust Spanish banks' assessments of their asset value. Following the 1970s banking crisis, the central bank has built up a team of 160 inspectors. Spain has not signed accords drawn up by the Basle-based committee of international bank supervisors because it prefers its own rules. 'International standards are not high enough. They are too imprecise,' says one official. This iconoclastic approach will come under greater scrutiny from investors. The pressure on bank's revenues is not confined to their traditional lending and deposit business; trading income is also under pressure. Banks maintained their earnings last year because they were able to gain revenue from other sources - for instance by increasing earnings from foreign exchange and capital markets operations. Reductions in short-term interest rates also increased the value of their bond portfolios. But such earnings will not recur this year. Mr Jose Garay, director of the Chemical Bank in Spain, says that banks gained enormously from the four percentage point fall in short-term interest rates in 1993. This year, they will be forced to depend on traditional banking operations. 'I think this is going to be a very hard year for some banks,' he says. Banks in other countries have responded to such pressures by cutting costs through reductions in branches and staff. But the potential for cuts is limited. Although Spanish banks have large branch networks, they typically employ relatively few staff in each branch. Furthermore, strict labour laws make it difficult for banks to dismiss staff compulsorily. These factors have made Spanish banks look forward to the end of recession with eagerness. Investors' confidence in the sector has survived the Banesto upset, but it could be sapped by a further squeeze on revenues and the value of assets. For the moment, banks have avoided being tarred with the same brush as Banesto; their grace period may not be indefinite.</p>

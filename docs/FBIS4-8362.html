			<p>BFN     [Text] The negotiations between a Croatian delegation and  representatives of the Serb authorities from the UN-protected  areas, scheduled to resume tomorrow, will not materialize.    Nobody wants to make any guesses about the reasons behind  the  postponement of the negotiations or about a possible new date  when they could take place. Slavko Degoricija, member of the  Croatian delegation, said that the Croatian delegation is ready  for the next round of talks and stressed that the resumption of  the talks depends on the decision of the Serb representatives.  Economic and social issues were to be discussed in this round  of the negotiations.</p>

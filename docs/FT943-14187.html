			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Macy's agrees to Dollars 4.1bn Bloomingdale's merger Bloomingdale's and Macy's, two of the best-known names in US retailing, are to be brought together in a Dollars 4.1bn deal. Their owners said yesterday the merger would create the biggest department store group in the US. The board of R. H. Macy, owner of the Macy's chain, announced it had given in to six months of courtship by Federated Department Stores, owner of the Bloomingdale's chain, and agreed to a merger. The combined company will have more than 300 department stores spread across the US, though it is likely that a small number will close where they overlap. Annual revenues will exceed Dollars 13bn. R. H. Macy has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January 1992. Until recently, it had hoped to submit a plan for a reorganisation that would bring it out of bankruptcy under existing management. In January, however, Federated Department Stores made an unusual takeover bid for R. H. Macy by acquiring Dollars 449m worth of its highest-ranking debt from one of the creditors. The purchase gave it a powerful say in the company's future. Since then, R. H. Macy has been trying to convince creditors that they would be better served by a plan that ensured the company's independence. The argument, however, has been won by Federated, which offered creditors a Dollars 4.1bn package comprising Dollars 378.3m in cash, Dollars 1.9bn in debt, and Dollars 1.8bn of equity in the new Federated/R. H. Macy entity. Subject to their boards' approval of a definitive merger agreement, the two companies will now submit a joint re-organisation plan to the US bankruptcy court by August 1. Since the plan is supported by all the main creditors, including the bondholders' committee, approval is unlikely to be withheld. The companies hope the merger will be completed next January. The new entity will be headed by Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive. However, he will be joined on the board by four Macy directors, including Mr Myron Ullman, current chairman and chief executive.</p>

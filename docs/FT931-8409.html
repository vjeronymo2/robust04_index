			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Whittaker retires from Inchcape At 63, battle-scarred UK motor industry veteran Derek Whittaker has decided to step back from the front line at Inchcape, the international services and marketing group which has a range of motor distribution businesses worldwide. Whittaker is retiring from the board, to which he was appointed in 1986 to oversee all Inchcape's motor business except its Toyota activities. But he will continue to advise Inchcape on motor trade matters, as befits an industry figure who has seen it all - including service with Ford and the former British Leyland in the thick of the UK industry's trench warfare of the 1960s and 1970s. Whittaker who, as managing director of Leyland Cars, helped face down the toolmakers whose strike came close to polishing off British Leyland for good in the 1970s, is succeeded by another great industry survivor. Reg Heath, who steered vehicle distribution group TKM back to health throughout the 1980s, both before and during its acquisition by New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, is now poised to assume all of Whittaker's responsibilities. The ever-cheerful and widely-liked Heath has, however, been on the board since last March, following Inchcape's own takeover of TKM, which continues to sell around 50,000 cars a year through nearly 100 retail outlets. For Heath, it's a long way from the dealer forecourts where he first saw service with TKM's dealer subsidiary, Wadham Kenning, back in 1958. For Inchcape, it's another significant break with the past. Whittaker is leaving less than two years after the departure as Inchcape's chairman of his old British Leyland managing director associate, the late Sir George Turnbull.</p>

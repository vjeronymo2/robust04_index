			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Balterley false accounts prompt fears - A crop of questions being levelled at Spring Ram EVEN THE most bullish of analysts following Spring Ram Corporation, the recession-defying kitchens and bathrooms group, admits that the recent episode of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary raises a number of urgent questions. The questions are being asked of a group that has been one of the outstanding success stories of the past decade, including defying the recession with pre-tax profit growth of 25 per cent last year. From its foundation in 1979, Spring Ram built annual sales to Pounds 194.2m in 1991 and pre-tax profit to Pounds 37.6m. After flotation in 1983, its market value grew from Pounds 11m to Pounds 651m in May this year. Even after the punishment delivered to the share price by the Balterley revelation, the market value is about Pounds 390m and it remains well within the top 350 on the stock exchange. The group has grown organically by building state-of-the art factories on its greenfield sites - all financed from its own resources. Last December it had about Pounds 45m cash, part of which is going towards the latest wave of capital spending. It is still headed by one of the co-founders, Mr Bill Rooney. The other, Mr Bob Murray, resigned in 1990. Strong on marketing, Spring Ram has been much less outgoing when it comes to breaking down its figures. Some analysts have questioned its accounting for such items as stock, depreciation and government grants. Likewise its success in motivating the entrepreneurs who run its mushrooming subsidiaries has a questionable side: the pressure on them to meet ambitious targets is intense. The disclosure of financial irregularities at Balterley Bathrooms - tucked away in a press announcement about an acquisition - wiped nearly Pounds 160m off Spring Ram's market value on November 6. Balterley, acquired in late 1986, lies in Stoke-on-Trent and is comparatively remote from the Leeds-based group's other operations. Although its annual sales amounted to only Pounds 10m, profits have been overstated by up to Pounds 5.6m. Mr Stuart Greenwood, Spring Ram's finance director, says the problem dates back three years, but mostly relates to last year. Balterley appeared to be making 'gross margins of more than 50 per cent and pre-tax margins of more than 30 per cent'. In fact, it fell into losses last year as 'the pricing policy was wrong'. Mr Greenwood describes three areas of false accounting: the value of closing stock was inflated to increase the gross profit; the number of items in stock was overstated; and sales were pushed up by ignoring returns from distributors. Mr Terry Henshall, Balterley's finance director, has been dismissed. Spring Ram stressed there was no element of personal gain. He was acting on an order from the board to build up actual stocks substantially - 'the guy's inflation satisfied a pre-determined requirement,' Mr Greenwood says. The problem came to light during the audit of the 1991 figures by Arthur Andersen. About Pounds 2.1m was deducted from Balterley's contribution to group profits. Up to Pounds 3.5m more will be taken as an exceptional charge in this year's accounts. Against this background, Balterley raises the following questions: Why was the problem not disclosed sooner? It was discovered before the full-year results were announced on March 23, but not mentioned either with these figures or with the 1992 interims released on September 24. It was thought that the correct numbers had been published in the 1991 accounts. Mr Greenwood likens the adjustment between the internal and the published accounts to a typist accidently adding an extra zero to a figure, which was then corrected. When it was realised in May that the correction had been inadequate, the issue of disclosure was mentioned at a meeting with the group's solicitors, Simpson Curtis of Leeds. At that stage it was decided it was too early to announce because the extent of the problem was not known. Arthur Andersen, the auditors, were sent back to investigate. The final report is awaited. During the summer, a variety of bearish rumours circulated and the share price fell from 181p to 104p. The rumours included that the auditors were investigating. Mr Angus Phaure, building materials analyst at County NatWest, says he and a colleague rang on five occasions and were told it was not true. Mr Greenwood says no one asked a specific question 'that hit the target'. He adds that it would not have been right to tell people selectively, rather than making a formal announcement. Should the falsification of the figures have been discovered sooner? Mr Greenwood started with Spring Ram early last year as its first ever group finance director. By May he felt uncomfortable with the book-keeping at Balterley. Later in the year Mr Henshall was asked to leave - but not until he had seen through the year-end management accounts. Mr Greenwood points out that 'to some extent you have to rely on the integrity of the people and the system'. While Balterley's margins were high, it was explained in terms of the substantial premiums commanded by its decorative suites. Production capacity had been expanded substantially between 1988 and 1990, and it was meeting aggressively set targets. Spring Ram's gross profit margin last year was 24 per cent and its operating margin 18 per cent. To achieve these averages the more mature subsidiaries, such as Balterley, must do substantially better to offset the small contributions, or even losses, from start-ups. Has financial control been adequate? Spring Ram makes a virtue of the way it motivates the entrepreneurs running its subsidiaries. They are expected to behave as if they owned them, meaning considerable autonomy. The divisional structure is light and the board lean. It has five directors, but no non-executives. Mr Greenwood says financial controls have been tightened up over the past 18 months: 'We have checkers checking the checkers. I don't think we would be conned for long now.' As for the pressure to meet targets: 'We don't shoot the messenger. The bathroom market is relatively weak and some of the numbers are below what we expected.' Is there any cause for concern in the way the group accounts for stock? Take the three things that went wrong at Balterley: first sales were inflated by a failure to register returns from distributors. Mr Greenwood says sales are counted when a customer orders and accepts the invoice: 'We sometimes hold stuff for a customer, for example during a promotional period. We pre-load it, but they accept that it is their goods.' Provisions are made, and regularly updated, for items sent back or other adjustments made by distributors. In relation to the second problem - the inflated closing stock value - Mr Greenwood says: 'There is a degree of judgment as to stock value.' When looking at cost - materials, labour and attributable overheads - the last is a 'grey area'. Assumptions about overheads and the number of items that will be made give a figure for the overhead per unit. 'If you make more than you thought you would, it reduces the element of overhead in each unit,' he says. But you only realise the benefit when you sell it. Mr Greenwood says the calculations are reworked every month. This is the area the auditors 'crawl over' because 'if you get the stock value wrong, you screw the numbers up'. Third, inflation of the number of items in stock. Mr Greenwood says most subsidiaries now have stock on computer, which runs a more accurate 'perpetual inventory' system, rather than leaving the count to the period end. As Mr Greenwood attempts to be as frank as possible in answering the post-Balterley questions, the share price appears to have stabilised just above this summer's low point. At 106p last night, the group (which pays a tiny dividend) was still on a historic p/e of nearly 15, a small discount to the FT-A industrial group. It can only rebuild its premium rating once everyone is satisfied on these questions.</p>

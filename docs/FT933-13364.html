			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Profile of Lord Rees-Mogg LORD Rees-Mogg, Baron of Hinton Blewitt and former editor of The Times, has always liked novelty and mischief and has argued eccentric views with lucidity and passion, Raymond Snoddy writes. At the same time he has been developing a deeply gloomy view of Britain which he recently dubbed the Scarborough Syndrome after a hotel perched on a clifftop which started to sink into the sea. 'We lose to America in football, to Brussels in European policy, to Japan in industry, to secularism in the Church and our economic policy has been a disaster,' Lord Rees-Mogg wrote recently in The Times. His legal challenge to the Maastricht bill, financed at least in part by Sir James Goldsmith, the financier, brings together all Lord Rees-Mogg's taste for novelty and mischief, passion and gloom in a single theatrical performance in the High Court. He once predicted the coming of an new ice age, before global warming diverted people's attention. He supported former US president Richard Nixon in preference to the Washington Post over Watergate, and more recently co-authored a book forecasting doom and disaster and the end of civilisation. Lord Rees-Mogg is one of the sharpest thorns in the side of Mr John Major, who he described as a 'B-category' PM to be compared with such Tory premiers as Chamberlain and Eden who were so weakened by crisis that they were finally ousted. Lord Rees-Mogg also likes heroes, however grotesque. He finds the pop singer Madonna a more exciting role model than German chancellor Helmut Kohl. But he admires former prime minister Margaret Thatcher much more than Madonna. 'The outstanding example of greatness in modern Britain has been Margaret Thatcher. Her whole image is one of energy, of which as prime minister she seemed to have almost inexhaustible reserves,' he said. Lord Rees-Mogg's profile has been revived as a patrician columnist and controversialist of extreme opinions. Asked recently whether there was any area in which he felt unqualified to make a judgment, he replied: 'Clearly there are lots of subjects on which I am unqualified to talk about. I wouldn't write an article about mountain-climbing.'</p>

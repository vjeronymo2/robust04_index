Tamara surfaced again last summer when the Czech government,  bowing to Western pressure, quashed an attempt to sell six  Tamara systems to Iran. Since then, Tamara has rapidly become  one of the Czech Republic's best-known pieces of military  technology.    Despite being dubbed the "stealth radar," Tamara is in fact  not even a radar. Radar systems "see" by actively bouncing radio  waves off objects, while Tamara is a purely passive system that  detects the radiation and electronic signals inevitably emitted  by even the stealthiest aircraft.    "If a B-2 bomber uses even its altimeter, we'll see them,"  Barak said.    The ability to detect supposedly invisible aircraft like the  B-2 sparks the popular imagination. But, for defense experts,  Tamara's ability to "see without being seen" is a much more  important quality. In the radar-dominated "electronic  battlefield" that has existed since World War II, the ability to  see has invariably meant being seen as well.    As a non-radiating passive surveillance system, Tamara has  effectively broken away from this structure. As a result, some  believe it could radically alter the balance of modern  conventional warfare.    For this reason, some consider Tamara a potentially  revolutionary "weapon."    Tamara uses artificial intelligence to correlate and  evaluate  information. It can even "teach itself" to discern new patterns  and identify new targets, according to Barak.    When discussing Tamara, Barak likes to stress its  non-military applications. Because the system does not radiate  energy, Barak said Tamara could be an alternative to airport  radars in residential areas, where radar saturation could pose  health risks. Tamara could also be useful in monitoring coastal  shipping routes such as the English Channel or the North Sea  coast.    Tesla Pardubice began developing passive Electronic  Intelligence--or ELINT--systems during the late 1960s with an  experimental system called Kopac. This was followed in the late  1970s by the second-generation system Ramona, at least one of  which was sold to Syria. Tamara was developed during the late  '80s.    Only a few Tamaras have actually been sold abroad, Barak  said. "There are 15 sets within Russia [and] some in the Czech  and Slovak republics. The German Bundeswehr (federal army) has  one Tamara and one Ramona."    Barak said that attempts to sell Tamara to Iran began before  he assumed his post. "We haven't had any discussions with Iran  [since that time]," he said. "We cannot sell Tamara without the  permission of the government."    To sell Tamara to Western militaries, Barak said he knows  he'll have to break through both the West's prejudice against  Eastern-bloc hardware and a more powerful prejudice known as the  "NIH syndrome," which applies to products "not invented here."    Does Barak dream of the day when Tamara is part of the  Pentagon's arsenal? Yes.    But, he said, "There is one already in the U.S. somewhere.  It  was bought from another country. I don't know from where."</p>

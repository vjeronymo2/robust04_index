			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Industrial fan integration lifts Howden Shares in Howden Group rose by 4p to 88p yesterday after the Glasgow-based engineering company reported a 49 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 27.6m. The pre-tax figure, for the year to April 30, included a one-off gain of Pounds 1.38m from the sale of a property in Hong Kong. Turnover rose from Pounds 335.1m to Pounds 373.4m. Howden said profits had improved partly because of the successful integration of two industrial fan companies bought last year for a total of Pounds 40m - Novenco in Denmark and Buffalo Forge in the US. The subsequent rationalisation programme involved the closing of 900,000 sq ft of manufacturing capacity in the US, Canada and UK and a reduction in the combined workforce of about 750 employees. Mr Johnny Johnsen, chief executive, said the restructuring had yielded annual cost savings of about Pounds 18m. The result was that the formerly lossmaking North American fan operations, and the lossmaking activities of Novenco in Europe, were now in the black. Order intake was Pounds 389m, an increase of 46 per cent. The highlight was the Pounds 27m tunnel boring machine order won by Wirth, Howden's German subsidiary, for a road tunnel in Taiwan. Wirth incurred a loss of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m because of low orders last year and the cost of a rationalisation programme to reduce its workforce by 250 to 500, which will be completed during the current first half. The group said these savings, plus the impact of the Taiwan order, should contribute to an improved performance in 1995. In the UK James Howden improved profitability and won orders for tunnel boring machines for the Brighton flood alleviation scheme and the Heathrow express line. Mr John Jackson, chairman, said the international spread of Howden's businesses has enabled the group to weather the worst effects of the recession and would bring further reward as the economic recovery developed. Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 6.7p (6p). A final dividend of 1.61p gives a total for the year of 2.43p, an increase of 10.5 per cent. COMMENT Howden's strategy of reducing its exposure to contracting and construction is paying off, with the successful integration of the fans business offering scope for further margin improvement - particularly in the US. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 11. That 14 per cent discount to the market is partly because memories still linger of the group's disastrous Danish tunnelling contract, which caused the share price to plummet and nearly wiped out group profits in 1990-91. The shares should be uprated from their current level in the medium term, as the market learns to view the group as an engineering stock, which should benefit from later-cycle investment.</p>

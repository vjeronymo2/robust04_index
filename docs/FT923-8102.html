			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World News in Brief: Footsie notches up a black mark As the London stock market fell again yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index of the UK's most highly-valued companies notched up a depressing statistic, having fallen for seven consecutive trading days, the longest consecutive fall since it was established at the start of 1984. Yesterday, the index dropped 6.5 points to 2,303.1, making a slide of 117 points since the close of trading on August 3 and taking it to its lowest level since February, 15, 1991. On foreign exchanges, the dollar fell further against the D-Mark despite Tuesday's intervention, dragging sterling lower. The pound was also unsettled by rumours that the chancellor, Norman Lamont, was resigning. Foreign exchanges, Page 23; London stocks, Page 32</p>

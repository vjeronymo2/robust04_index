			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (9): The shift to open systems unlocks sector - Europe, a crisis that knows no national boundaries A series of stunningly defensive, whole-page advertisements from Groupe Bull in Europe's leading newspapers last month highlights the crisis facing the entire European-owned computer industry. They were used to soften the impact of the announcement of Bull's FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.19bn) loss in 1990. Most of the leading players are trading at a loss. Those, such as Olivetti, that are still keeping their heads above red ink, are showing greatly reduced profitability. The crisis knows no national boundaries. Germany: Siemens-Nixdorf chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig warned last month that Europe's largest computer company, formed in 1990 from the ailing Nixdorf Computers and Siemens' computer interests, would not make profits this year as he had hoped, nor was he prepared to say when it would become profitable. The difficulties of assimilating Nixdorf, which had losses of about Dollars 636m in its last year as an independent company, have proved far greater than expected. Comparex, a joint venture between BASF and Siemens selling chiefly mainframes built by Hitachi of Japan, on the other hand, made post-tax profits of DM42m, 31 per cent up on the previous year. France: state-owned Bull's loss is thought to be a record for the industry in any one year. It is made up of a FFr3bn operating loss and restructuring charges of about FFr3.8bn. The company is already well advanced with an ambitious programme of corporate changes designed to restore competitiveness and vitality. It includes cutting the number of manufacturing plants from 13 to five, reducing staff by some 5,000 over the year and rationalising research and development and marketing. Italy: Olivetti has remained consistently in the black, but its profitability has been falling. Its 1990 turnover is not expected to show much advance on the L9.031bn recorded in 1989 and its profits are expected much below the L202.8bn announced that year. It is in the process of trimming 7,000 jobs from the workforce; manufacturing activities are being rationalised both in Italy and the rest of the world as are direct and indirect distribution networks. The Netherlands: Philips is shedding some 50,000 staff worldwide; the resulting restructuring charges forced a loss of Fl 4.2bn last year; the root cause, however, was heavy losses in the information systems division. Now Philips is moving away from computer systems of its own design to those built to industry standards. The UK: International Computers, Britain's largest information technology company, while still generating good profits, was bought from STC by Fujitsu last year, leaving the telecommunications company free to concentrate on its core interests. The deal with Fujitsu came at the end of a series of abortive merger discussions between ICL and several other European-owned computer companies. Apricot Computers, manufacturing arm of the Apricot Group was sold to Mitsubishi Electric of Japan last year. In a surprising reversal of fortune, both ICL and Apricot are now selling UK-designed and manufactured computers in Japan. Smaller manufacturers have been affected by the same malaise. Norsk Data of Norway and Nokia Data of Finland are going through extensive restructuring and job losses in their attempts to return to profitability. The plight of Europe computer makers is, to some extent, a reflection of the troubles afflicting every large computer manufacturer worldwide. Customers, especially governments and the armed forces, are beginning to move rapidly from traditional, mainframe-based data processing systems to so-called 'client server systems' where the computing power is supplied by small computers and workstations networked together. There is growing demand for computers which can easily be connected into client server networks regardless of the manufacturer of origin. Industry standard or open systems are becoming preferred to proprietary designs. The shift in preference from proprietary designs to open systems took place with remarkable suddenness. It coincided with a rapid, but temporary, softening in many of the European markets. Companies such as Nixdorf which had been gearing up on the back of powerful sales of their proprietary systems suddenly found themselves facing weak markets with systems which were no longer in fashion. Europe will remain an important IT market though the US will remain dominant. According to figures from the consultancy Price Waterhouse, the world IT market was worth Dollars 212bn in 1984; the US held 55 per cent, Europe 25 per cent, Japan 10 per cent with a similar percentage for the rest of the world. By 1992, according to Price Waterhouse, the overall value of the market will have grown to Dollars 649bn. The US share will have shrunk to 44 per cent, the European share will have grown to 31.5 per cent with Japan and the rest of the world holding 14 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively. It seems likely that US and Japanese manufacturers will profit from the growth in the European market, however, rather than the local champions. There are sharply opposed views on what, if anything, should be done to support European-owned companies. The French government which owns over 70 per cent of Groupe Bull has agreed to support its restructuring measures, but it understands that the company has to find a partner to share the load. There have been talks between Europe's main players aimed at establishing a single transnational computer company able to rationalise research and development costs and achieve continent-wide economies of scale, but they have all foundered on issue of management and control. Some, looking at the example of Unisys of the US, question whether putting together failing companies is anything more than a recipe for further failure. The European commission recently published a fiercely-debated plan to make the electronics industry more competitive based on training, standards, bilateral agreements and collaborative research and development projects. No new money would be involved. In doing so, it has moved to more of a hands-off approach to encouraging competitiveness than earlier and unsuccessful interventionist strategies. The fate of ICL within the Fujitsu organisation is being watched closely as an example of the most extreme form of survival measure. It may not be too long before others are forced to follow suit.</p>

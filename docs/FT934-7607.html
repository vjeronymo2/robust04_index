			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / A decisive push against Japan's old system: Parliament's vote for new electoral laws that stunned the LDP CHEERS broke out yesterday afternoon in the normally sedate Japanese parliament as 10 opposition Liberal Democratic party members filed up to the podium to vote with the government. Each man solemnly handed in a white tile, signifying that he had flouted party instructions and supported the government's four political reform bills designed to sweep aside the scandal prone political system which kept the LDP in power for 38 years until last July. Clapping broke out on the coalition benches, where the prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa was seated, faintly smiling, surrounded by his rag-bag seven-party coalition, stretching from religious right through liberal to socialist. Silence hung over the other side of the house as grim looking Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, reflected on his party's second humiliation since losing a vote of no confidence in June. With the help of those LDP defectors, the reform plans swept through the lower house yesterday with a majority of 270 to 226, far larger than expected. The vote was another decisive push against the remains of the old structure of Japanese politics, clearing the site for a re-alignment of parties and politicians. With the LDP now fearing that it will go down for a third time, perhaps at an election late next year, Mr Hosokawa's pledges to transform the style and substance of Japanese politics are gradually being fulfilled. The manner of his victory yesterday was a departure from the tradition of consensus-seeking on important legislation, and will add to a personal popularity based on the public perception that he is at least trying to be honest. But Mr Hosokawa's power is linked to the continuation of his diverse coalition, united only by the desire for political reform. Other coalition members have their own visions of the political realignment that will follow. These visions do not necessarily include Mr Hosokawa and could transfer the drama of politics back from the public stage of parliament to the backrooms of the Tokyo political district, where a fine public image does not count for much. The legislative reforms, still to be passed by the upper house of parliament, will end the present multi-seat constituency system, blamed for encouraging corruption by promoting intense competition among and within parties to raise campaign funds. Under the old system, politicians courted construction companies with promises of huge public works investments that would be directed towards them, as a result of which more than 20 executives and local politicians are being questioned by public prosecutors. The proposed system is a mix of UK-style first past the post single-seat constituencies and continental European-style proportional representation. There will also be tough controls on corporate donations, and a fixed system of public donations. The dangers ahead for Mr Hosokawa come not from a crippled LDP, but from the power struggle that will now take place within the coalition. He has reason to fear Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the main power broker in the coalition who was co-founder of the LDP splinter group that brought down the former government. Mr Ozawa was a valuable ally earlier this week when he used his knowledge of the LDP to undermine its unity. Now he wants LDP defectors for his party, the Japan Renewal Party. There is talk of a JRP merger with another coalition member, Komeito, the Clean Government Party, linked to an influential but murky Buddhist movement, the Soka Gakkai, to form a mainstream centre-right grouping. The ambitious Mr Ozawa has never hidden his desire for a system of two conservative groupings. But for now, the wily Mr Ozawa needs the honest Mr Hosokawa's popularity. Mr Ozawa has been forced to wait behind the scenes because of a poor public profile, stained this month by his confirmation that he, too, had received large but, he insists, legal donations from contractors. Mr Ozawa's second problem is that few mainstream voters would be keen to vote for Komeito, which relies for political support on the religious faithful. Alternatively, an election could produce another hotch-potch coalition of parties able to put aside differing ideologies and religious beliefs for the sake of holding power. But before then, an independent body, under the prime minister's office, will have to draw up new single-seat electoral districts. The boundaries will be the subject of intense inter-party bargaining for at least six months. But on one thing, most political analysts agree. The next election should encourage real debate from a previously impassive public. It will put pressure on politicians, elected in the past because of their powerful political alignments, to provide distinctive policies or style. The seismic upheavals of the past few months have shaken out a large floating vote and narrowed the differences between parties. Undecided voters account for 35 per cent of the total according to a recent survey, which shows no clear leaders among the other main groupings. 'The last election already showed that organisation was not everything,' says Jeff Young, political analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia. All this coincides with, or could be a consequence of, a general cultural change among people at large, away from general adherence to the communal discipline symbolised by four decades of one-party LDP rule, and towards an eagerness to pursue individual ideas. This shift is visible in a number of odd ways. Companies and employees are starting to rethink the traditional social contract of a job for life in return for absolute loyalty. Political chat shows are becoming popular on television and sober suited 'salarymen' can even be seen wearing coloured ties instead of the ubiquitous pearly grey. Mr Hosokawa cannot claim credit for changing Japanese fashion, despite his fondness for Armani ties. But the success of his personal style of politics has ensured that political change has swept onwards. The sober-tied veterans of the LDP will spend longer in the opposition benches than they had ever imagined.</p>

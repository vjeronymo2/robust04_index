			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO INSURANCE ON A COLLISION COURSE  </P> <P> California's auto insurance system has been a mess for so long that one would  have thought it impossible to jolt this state's drivers, already beleaguered by  high rates, out of their cynicism about insurance reform. But Insurance  Commissioner Roxanni Gillespie may have done it when she authorized a  staggering 85% rate increase in the state's assigned-risk plan.  </P> <P> The assigned-risk system allows drivers unable to obtain coverage in the  regular market to buy coverage from a pool in which all the state's auto  insurance companies share the burden. It was designed for drivers with poor  records, but has become a haven for many good drivers who simply can't afford  regular coverage. For policyholders in Los Angeles, Gillespie's rate increase  could mean a jump of about $500 in their annual insurance bill, even if they  have a good driving record. Those with poor driving records could pay as much  as $1,000 more per year.  </P> <P> Of course, no one in his or her right mind is going to fork over that kind of  money unless he or she absolutely has to. And with the state's strict  enforcement rules for mandatory auto insurance due to lapse Jan. 1 -- thanks to  continued inaction by the state Legislature, which allowed the system to  deteriorate -- what's more likely to happen is that the number of uninsured  motorists is going to increase. So down the road, so to speak, those of us who  want to obey the law, or simply protect our financial well-being by carrying  sufficient liability insurance, will pay more for uninsured-motorist coverage,  already the biggest chunk of the typical auto insurance bill.  </P> <P> Talk about a no-win situation. Nobody came out ahead on this one. Not good  drivers or bad drivers. Not the insurance companies, who make a credible case  that they are losing money on the assigned-risk plan and need some kind of rate  increase to keep it afloat. And not politicians, because Gillespie's decision  may feed the anti-incumbent mood growing among voters in California and  elsewhere. Only the trial lawyers, who have blocked all efforts to enact a  no-fault insurance system in this state, have little to complain about. The  tort system that lets them make money from even minor automobile accidents  remains unchanged.  </P> <P> Whatever the political shortcomings of Gillespie's decision, it's a useful  wake-up call to remind us all that the auto-insurance mess is still with us two  years after voters enacted Proposition 103 in an effort to reform the system.  It might even prod a new Legislature, governor and insurance commissioner to  get down to the business of bringing California a real no-fault insurance  system, complete with a no-frills auto insurance policy that even the poorest  driver can afford.  </P></p>

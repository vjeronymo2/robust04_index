			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pilvikki Kause: "Kevsos Steps Up Exports to </F> East; Other EFTA Countries Envy Finland Its Valuable Free Trade  Agreement"]    [Text] Gdansk/Helsinki/Warsaw--Fazer managers ground their  teeth when free trade in chocolate and candies between Finland  and Poland disintegrated at the end of last year. The tariff  advantage for industrial products was preserved, but the  advantage for basic agricultural products and many food products  was lost. Three years ago Fazer's exports to Poland skyrocketed  with the aid of a relic of the past that guarantees free trade,  the Kevsos agreement [free trade agreement with former USSR's  East European satellites].    "In just the next few months we'll realize how very  important  the agreement was to us," Kari Korpela of Fazer said. Korpela  manages the Polish candy factory, Baltyk, a majority of whose  shares Fazer purchased a year and a half ago. Fazer owns 51  percent of the joint venture, which is located in the city of  Gdansk, and the employees own the rest of it. The factory  provides employment for 700 people and its sales volume was  about 252 million markkaa in 1993.  <H5>  Big Investments </H5>   Fazer is planning "big investments" in Baltyk in the near  future. The Finnish company acquired possession of the Polish  factory for many strategic reasons.    "Poland's markets were opened up in 1991. Since it was clear  to us that the Finns' tariff advantage would diminish within a  few years, the purchase of the factory came at an opportune  moment. While the chocolate and candy markets are growing in  Poland at a rate of 5 to 10 percent, in Scandinavia, for  example, they are relatively stable. It's also a good thing for  us to export to the East, the West, and the south," Korpela  enumerated.    So far, in addition to its own traditional candies, Baltyk  produes only one Fazer product, the latter's "red" chocolate  bar. According to Korpela, in the near future the selection of  Fazer products will increase since the profitability of  importing them will diminish.  <H5>  Price Remained Unchanged </H5>   Despite the loss of its competitive edge, Fazer has not  begun  to change the price of imported chocolate on the shelves of its  Polish outlets. "At present we're developing our positions in  the market."    In Korpela's opinion, one has to be present in Poland if one  wants a piece of the pie. Baltyk ranks fourth in domestic sales  figures. After the war the market director nationalized the  family-owned company, Wedel, which Pepsi-Cola bought up a few  years ago accompanied by a big hullaballoo.    In addition, the multinationals, Nestle and Suchard, are in  stiff competition with Fazer to satsify nearly 40 million Poles'  hunger for sweets.  <H5>  Shares of Market Increased </H5>   In the 1970's Finland signed unique free trade agreements  with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia,  and Hungary, in addition to Poland.    A general agreement removed tariffs on industrial products,  and Finland concluded separate agreements with each of these  countries to eliminate obstacles to agricultural products. From  Finland's standpoint, up until the end of the last decade the  agreement was not of any great importance.    Once the foreign trade of the former socialist countries was  liberated, Finnish exports to them began to rapidly increase, to  Poland and Hungary in particular. Kevsos suddenly began to work  to Finland's advantage, whereas before trade had even declined  and showed a deficit.    In five years Finnish exports to Poland have multiplied  nearly 10 times, measured in markkaa. While Finland's exports to  Poland amounted to 290 million markkaa in 1988, last year  exports came to over 2 billion markkaa. Finland exported 276  million markkaa worth of products to Hungary in 1988. Last year  they amounted to 770 million markkaa.    "Since the former socialist countries imposed tariffs and  launched economic reforms, Kevsos has become a valuable asset  for us. Finnish industrial exporters have notably succeeded in  increasing their shares of the market. The tariff advantage has  been of considerable benefit to, for example, Neste [state oil  company] as well as the paper and food industries," Kari  Mitrunen, the head of the foreign ministry Trade Policy  Department, said.  <H5>  Advantages Being Reduced </H5>   By the middle of last November, however, the tariff  advantages had been reduced, especially concerning trade with  Poland. Free trade in basic agricultural products and several  food products was eliminated entirely following heated  negotiations when the new EFTA [European Free Trade Association]  agreement went into effect.    The EFTA countries, Finland included, negotiated broad  agreements with the East European countries that are aimed at  gradually freeing trade by 2001.    At Finland's insistence, Kevsos will continue to exist  alongside these agreements, despite the fact that the other EFTA  countries would have preferred to lay it to rest. If Finland  becomes a member of the European Union, Kevsos will lose its  importance.  <H5>  Tariff Advantages Were Reduced </H5>   Poland too would have been willing to cancel Kevsos, which  had become disadvantageous for the country. To salvage the  socialist relic, Finland agreed to reduce its tariff advantages  for oil products and the paper industry.    A tariff quota of 475,000 tons was agreed on for Finnish  gasoline. According to the quota, gasoline was to receive a  tariff advantage of 27 percent as compared with the other EFTA  countries.    The head of Neste's Warsaw office, Ari Rajala, does not  think  that the advantage is in practice very significant anymore.  Nevertheless, Kevsos has raised the hackles on seven other  foreign oil companies operating in Poland.    "Competitors have even complained about the agreement  directly to President Lech Walesa," Rajala said.    Foreign trade chief Lea Lastikka of the Food Industry  Association said that the elimination of basic agricultural  products and many food products--like butter, chocolate,  cheeses, pork, and beef--from the Kevsos list for Poland is a  great loss.  <H5>  Surplus Butter Becomes Luxury Item </H5>   Poland has risen to become the fourth largest recipient of  Finland's food exports. Valio, for example, has acquired  favorable markets in Poland for its surplus butter and other  products. A couple of months ago a chunk of Finnish butter  hardly cost more than a chunk of Polish butter, but now it has  become a luxury item.    "It'll be a pity if Valio abandons its markets since its  products became well-known during the boom," said Wiktor  Szwechowicz, Valio's only remaining representative in Poland.  According to Szwechowicz, Valio is thinking about granting a  license to a Polish dairy.</p>

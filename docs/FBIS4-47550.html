			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O.Yu. Manzenyuk, N.V. Volozhantsev, Ye.I. </F> Astashkin, E.A. Svetoch, Scientific Research Institute of  Applied Microbiology, Obolensk, Moscow oblast; UDC 616.36-002]    [Abstract] The lack of specific preventive measures against  malleus or glanders--a dangerous infectious disease--induced by  the Pseudomonas mallei bacteria in humans and animals  prompted a search for the P. pseudomallei phages  capable of transducing the P. mallei cells. To this  end, the transduction ability of 17 P. pseudomallei  bacteriophages five of which are capable of transducing the Tn7  (Tp[.sup]R[/], Sm[.sup]R[/]) transposon markers to the C-5  P. mallei strain is investigated. Together with the  outcome of the Tr[.sup]R[/] recombinant clones, DNA-DNA  hybridization data confirm that the PP25 phage transduces the  P. mallei cells while the PP16, PP32, PP61, and PP64  phages can also produce Tr[.sup]R[/] clones whose properties  are closer to transduced C-5/PP25/Tr[.sup]R[/]Sm[.sup]R[/]  P. mallei. The phenotypic properties of these clones  make it possible to speculate that the PP16, PP32, PP61, and  PP64 phages are also capable of transducing the Tr[.sup]R[/]  and Sm[.sup]R[/] markers during transduction. The transduced  bacterial recipients become lysogenic and acquire resistance to  trimethoprime and stroptomycin. Figures 2; tables 2; references  19: 12 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

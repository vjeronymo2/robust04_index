Had there been a revolution, then we  would like to know who the leaders of the revolution were. As  far as the changes that happened then are concerned, we think  that it was necessary to eliminate Nicolae Ceausescu and his  totalitarian regime."    Expressing his belief that the reform has failed because it  was not managed in a qualified and competent way, the PSM  president said that: "those who were in power and promoted the  reform should not be judged because they enjoyed 66 percent of  the votes of the electorate." The Social-Democrats -- who have  been ruling so far -- have not understood that they have to  change the basic concept of this reform. Social-democracy was  discredited in Romania for a long time because of Roman (Petre,  former prime minister and president of the Democratic Party) and  Cunescu (Sergiu, president of the Social Democratic Party of  Romania).    We voted in favor of the IMF memorandum, Verdet said,  although it is onerous and unjust toward our country, but we  could not possibly vote with the right wing. However, we have  achieved a compromise, namely, that the respective memorandum  should not be approved by law, so the parliament is now free to  reject it and ask for it to be renegotiated.    "We told the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]  members  that they should solve the case of [former Defense Minister]  Spiroiu and Pancea [accused of spying for the French secret  services], because they need to show some moral character at  least at the top, because Mitrea [Fratia Free TU Confederation  vice president] and Ciorbea [Fratia Free TU Confederation  president] understand only the language of money."    As far as foreign policy is concerned, the PDM president  said: "We have no business in a war together with the United  States against Iraq. Even if Saddam is a dictator and the Iraqi  people support him, that is their business. What was our  justification to side with the United States and Israel in the  blockade against Cuba? What are we doing in a war side by side  with the United States in Somalia?"</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): This fertile field for fraudsters - Blueprint for two kinds of pyramid schemes The term 'pyramid scheme' can be used to describe a huge variety of marketing and investment schemes. Some are legitimate - but many are dubious or fraudulent. Pyramid selling, also known as network marketing or multi-level marketing, is the more respectable type of pyramid. These schemes offer a part-time income from selling something: household cleaning materials, jewellery and water filters are common examples. Sales agents get commission on their own deals as well as those made by people they have recruited. The more layers of agents below you, the more you earn. Pyramid selling does have its pitfalls, however. People are sometimes encouraged to join with unrealistic projections of the amount of work necessary and the potential income. You should ask yourself if you really want to risk alienating friends, relatives and colleagues by pressurising them to join a scheme. And if you join in an area where a particular scheme has taken off already, you could find that potential customers and recruits are scarce. Some schemes ask for large initial payments, or make you buy large quantities of products with no reliable guarantee of refunds if you do not manage to sell them. But if you are considering taking up pyramid selling, here are some questions you should ask. Is there a big market for the products? Would you buy them yourself? Are the prices reasonable? Is the company well-established? Or might it collapse, leaving you with unsaleable products and unpaid commission? Are you expected to pay for your own training? How much are you likely to earn with the amount of time at your disposal? The Department of Trade and Industry says that, to comply with the law, schemes should not ask for money for goods and services before you have signed a contract; offer instant promotion in return for a large cash payment; or even require a large payment when you join (the maximum should be Pounds 75). Pyramid investment schemes are one of the oldest tricks in the fraudster's book. They exploit people's gullibility, lack of understanding of financial matters, and eternal belief in get-rich-quick schemes. These schemes work (temporarily) by redistributing money from new subscribers to those a few layers above. 'Investors' are attracted through mail-shots or advertisements in shop windows and newspapers promising large profits. What they do not realise is that the 'profits' are actually the subscriptions of the most recent recruits. As soon as the stream of new 'investors' dries up, so do the payments. There is no underlying investment, just money whizzing round the system to make it appear to work. Continuous expansion is necessary for anyone to profit, and those on the bottom always end up losing out. Titles such as Alchemy and Midas, conjuring up mythical riches, give the game away. By the time these schemes collapse, usually in a haze of recriminations and with thousands of people losing their savings, the founders and a handful of early recruits have often made off with the money. Some pyramid schemes are dressed up to look like legitimate multi-level marketing plans or investment clubs by offering a 'product' - such as photo-copied reports, newsletters or seminars - or discounts on consumer goods. In fact, these frills are irrelevant to the working of the scheme. Other schemes take the form of chain letters. Pyramid investment schemes often fall through the web of investment and consumer protection laws, although the DTI stepped in recently and closed down a number of them on public interest grounds. Sadly, when this happens or the schemes collapse, many investors refuse to believe they have been duped, and, instead, turn their anger on the authorities. Warning signs of a pyramid scam include: Promises of fantastic money-making opportunities while being very vague about how the money is to be made. Hints may be dropped about complicated international currency transactions or investment in obscure areas (say, Swiss venture capital or commodities) which ordinary people would not expect to understand. Absence of a realistic, saleable product. Direct payments for recruiting new people. Demands for large 'membership fees' or regular monthly payments, with nothing concrete in return. Classic pyramids always end in tears. Genuine multi-level marketing schemes can sometimes bring in a reasonable income, although only from hard work over an extended period. But any scheme which looks too good to be true - by offering rich rewards for little effort - is bound to be a con.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  was asked about a report that the Khmer Rouge had forced Thai  gem-miners out of Cambodia. He said that there has been no  information to that effect given to the Foreign Ministry and he  would like to check the accuracy of the report before answering  newsmen. However, he said that it is the policy of the Thai  Government that no Thai workers engage in trade with the Khmer  Rouge. He noted that from what happened in the past, the Khmer  Rouge provided facilities for Thai residents.    Asked about U.S. sanctions against three Thai companies with  workers in Libya, he said the United States claimed that the  three companies were helping Libya set up a chemical weapons  production plant. The foreign minister said that U.S.  ambassador to Thailand David Lambertson had already met and  consulted with him on the matter. Prasong said the ambassador  confirmed that the sanctions were against the three companies  only and do not apply to other Thai companies or the Thai people.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark gains on strike vote Trading on the foreign exchange markets remained nervous yesterday, with the dollar falling more than 2 pfennigs on the the announcement that German steel workers voted for strike action, writes Simon London. Overnight trading in the Far East was featureless, with few dealers willing to take on large positions on the last day of the month, a reporting deadline at many firms. In addition, poor economic data from the US this week and the threat of central bank intervention left traders uncertain whether the dollar's recent gains would be increased. The dollar ended in Tokyo at Y125.78, from Y125.75/85 at the close in New York, and DM1.6162, from DM1.6163. However, the narrow range against the German currency was shattered by the announcement that steel workers voted overwhelmingly for strike action. The result was preceded by statements from employers that there would be no increase in the 5.7 per cent pay offer, setting the stage for a lengthy dispute. The D-Mark rose sharply against the dollar on the ballot result. From a level of DM1.6230 against the dollar shortly before the announcement - the low point the day against the US currency - the German unit rose suddenly to DM1.6000 as dealers liquidated dollar positions. In addition to the strike vote, the dollar was damaged by the release of the index of leading US economic indicators for December, which fell 0.3 per cent for the second month in succession. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, echoed hard-line statements by other central bank officials this week, underlining that the medium term inflation target is 2 per cent, against a current rate of 4 per cent. This was taken as a signal that German interest rates will not be reduced in the near term. The weakness of the dollar against the D-Mark lasted through the afternoon, with the US currency reach a low of DM1.5950 in mid-afternoon. Some of the losses were later recovered, however, and the US unit closed in London at DM1.6080, from DM1.6210 on Thursday; 125.55 from Y126; and Dollars 1.7900 from Dollars 1.7745 against sterling. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling gained ground against the D-Mark, pressing DM2.88 for most of the day, the highest level since the Bundesbank increased German interest rates on December 19. However, other currencies also gained on the D-Mark and sterling remained only just above its floor within the system, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the strongest currency, the peseta. The UK currency closed unchanged at DM2.8775.</p>

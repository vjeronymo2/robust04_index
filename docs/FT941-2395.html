			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hyundai shelves plant re-opening near Montreal Hyundai of South Korea has shelved the re-opening of its CDollars 400m car assembly plant near Montreal indefinitely because of doubts that projected output of its Elantra from 1995 would be economic, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The plant was closed temporarily last summer when production of the slow-selling Sonata fell to an annual rate of 15,000, or 15 per cent of capacity. The company last year negotiated with governments to help re-equip the plant to make the Elantra.</p>

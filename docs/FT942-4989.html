			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Retreat on 'Union bonds' boosts EU summit Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday staged a tactical retreat over his plans to launch 'Union bonds' to finance the multi-billion dollar transport, telecommunications and energy projects known as trans-European networks. In a further conciliatory gesture, he agreed to a German plan to set up an independent panel of experts to study barriers to deregulation provided it examined European Union and national laws. The compromise on deregulation cools a potentially damaging row between the Commission and an Anglo-German alliance favouring tighter controls on Brussels legislation. As a result of the two agreements, a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg ended on a positive note, boosting prospects for a harmonious European summit in Corfu later this month. But there is still a risk of a showdown between EU heads of government over who succeeds Mr Delors as Commission head. Arguments over financing of the trans-European networks quickly evaporated at yesterday's session in Luxembourg. Mr Delors stated at the outset he was unwilling to press the case for Commission borrowing on the capital markets to fill an alleged 'financing gap' of around Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.85bn). The UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy all made clear that they wanted strict appraisal of the feasibility of the networks - a point echoed by Sir Brian Unwin, president of the European Investment Bank, which is expected to provide the bulk of capital. Sir Brian said: 'I will not express any views on whether there needs to be a new financial instrument, but the EIB is ready to do very much more in financing networks. The EIB can raise very large financing for sound projects.' A working group under Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, has identified 10 priority projects. These include high-speed rail links from Paris to Strasbourg, and Munich to Berlin; a rail-road tunnel through the Brenner pass in Italy; and motorway routes between the Portuguese capital Lisbon and Valladolid in Spain. Mr Delors, who views the networks as vital for improving European competitiveness and creating jobs, said he hoped work could start on January 1 1996. But he remains adamant the private sector and the EIB alone cannot raise enough capital. Under the new deal on deregulation, a panel of experts will scrutinise existing European Union laws, and put member states under the microscope in recognition that most labour market law is at national level.</p>

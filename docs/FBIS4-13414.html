			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "His Hardest Hour"] </F>   [Text] Had I been a silver-tongued orator I would have  said that I have not come to praise Yitzhaq Rabin or to bury  him, but to defend him. And these days, when facing his  hardest hour as a national leader, he needs support. Overnight,  his fortune changed dramatically. Only a year ago, he was  considered by many the right man, in the right place, at the  right time, and now he is slowly becoming the national doormat.    He is being attacked by politicians on the right and left  for  conflicting traits: He is too fast, he is too slow, he is too  stubborn, he is too lenient, he is too strong, he is too weak.  With the friends he has he does not need enemies. Shulamit  Aloni says that he "radiates weakness." Hayim Ramon stabs him  in the back by creating a split in Labor, Rabin's only fort.  Yosi Sarid, who bends over backward to act as Rabin's  spokesman, convinces MAPAM [United Workers Party] to help smash  Labor's rule of the Histadrut. "My dear friend" Arye Der'i  prevents SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] from joining the  coalition. There are ministers whispering about their prime  minister's "hesitancy and inability to make decisions." And  there are those among them who confide about his "loss of  control" and "conceding too much" to 'Arafat.    There has been a no less dramatic change in the attitude of  the man in the street. Wherever he goes, Rabin faces heckling  and calls of "cheater," "traitor," or "death to Rabin." For the  first time since he became prime minister, public opinion polls  show that almost 60 percent are dissatisfied with Rabin's  performance. For the first time since he came to power, the  polls show that Netanyahu, and even Peres, would beat him at the  polls.    The procrastination in the negotiations angers what is  called  the "Peace Now" camp -- as though the PLO, where disorder  reigns, has no part in it and it is also Rabin's fault. The  latest terrorist attacks have been exploited by the "national  camp" as proof of his weakness -- as though no Jewish blood was  shed under the Likud. That is how a developing unwritten, and  definitely unholy, pact between the opposition and those who are  supposed to be Rabin's supporters and allies in eroding his  leadership. While Rabin is struggling with the peace front, the  right wing is becoming more popular, just as his allies are  stealing the political base on which he depends.    I have not come to praise Rabin, but to express concern  about  the trend to bury him. Rabin is currently the only politician  with the experience, and perhaps the ability, to take the big  leap into the peace era. It is true that he is no Churchill,  and a thick book listing his mistakes and faults can be written.  Sometimes he is his own worst enemy, often he shows disdain for  others, acting like a Johnny-know-it-all, and he justifiably  gets whacked over the head from time to time for his arrogance  and mistakes. Nevertheless, he is still the right man, at the  right place, at the right time for two reasons with which it is  hard to argue:    First, because he has a mixture of personal traits which  serve well the path he is taking: On the one hand, political  ripeness, which apparently comes with age, and which led him to  understand that there is no future to the policy of pure might  and breaking bones. He chose the path of peace arrangements in  return for concessions on territories. On the other hand, he  was and remains "Mr. Defense," which is expressed in his  insistence that concessions must not harm Israel's security and  the IDF's preparations for the battlefield of the future, which  might be fought against far off countries like Iraq and Iran.    Whoever claims that giving up territories endangers Israel's  security will find in Rabin a rare combination of a readiness to  make concessions and concern for security. To my great regret,  when we look around we find either those willing to concede all  -- for whom time is short -- or those who preach security for  its own sake. And both types are no alternative to Rabin.    Second, it is hard to find at present political alternatives  to the path Rabin has taken. The opposition based on the Likud  has still not come up with an alternative policy and has not  cultivated a leader prepared to continue the path of peace. No  immediate successor to Rabin has emerged inside Labor. It is  doubtful whether Shim'on Peres, somebody with an outstanding  political vision, could have brought Labor to power, received  approval for the Oslo agreement, or talked with 'Arafat, had he  been prime minister. There is nothing to be done, this nation,  whether justifiably or not, does not trust Peres. Beyond these  two "old timers," many political babes can be seen on the  horizon, but not a single leader who can out perform Rabin right  now.    He is easily miffed, he is indecisive, he is too arrogant,  he  is too indulgent, he is too stubborn -- but in the political  vacuum we are facing, there is no alternative to Yitzhaq Rabin.  We must nurture him so that nothing happens to him.</p>

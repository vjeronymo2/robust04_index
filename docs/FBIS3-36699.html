			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- A working meeting of the Russian and  Ukrainian groups of experts on the issue of elaborating specific  mechanisms to implement the trilateral  Russian-Ukrainian-American statement concerning nuclear  disarmament began on 8 February. The Russian delegation is  headed by Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador at large of the Russian  Federation, and the Ukrainian delegation is headed by Valeriy  Shmarov, vice-premier for issues of the military-industrial  complex and conversion. "This is the latest phase of talks to  develop the trilateral statement. Another such meeting would  come in useful," Valeriy Shmarov informed a UNIAN correspondent  in an exclusive interview.    "Several more statements have been prepared, and there is no  doubt on the Ukrainian side that they will be signed. All  issues will be resolved in strict compliance with the START I  Treaty. There is already a draft program for implementing  Ukrainian pledges: the share, quota, proportion, and procedure  for recycling and taking silos out of a combat state--all this  has been elaborated and is to be discussed." The meeting is  scheduled to end 9 February.</p>

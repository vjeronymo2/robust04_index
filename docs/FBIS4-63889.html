			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that  Russia intended to develop cooperation with China. He told  journalists that Russia and China must have normal friendly and  even fraternal relations. On the evening of May 25 Chernomyrdin  will leave for China for a four-day working visit.    He announced that a large package of agreements was expected  to be signed during his visit to Beijing. These agreements  cover the following areas: the Russian-Chinese state border  regime, cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection,  sea navigation, water resources in the border regions close to  the Amur and Ussuri rivers, cooperation in the sphere of  agriculture, avoidance of dual taxation and cooperation in the  sphere of communications.    Chernomyrdin emphasized that in 1993 the trade turnover  between Russia and China had increased by 30 pct and amounted to  about 8 billion U.S. dollars. He called this a success and  added that during the previous years the trade turnover had been  decreasing. This tendency was overcome only last year.    Chernomyrdin stressed the importance of friendly relations  between the two countries since they had a common border of  6,000 kilometers. He added that there was all necessary grounds  for such relations.    Chernomyrdin suggested that China had not forgotten the  contribution of the ex-Soviet Union to its development. He said  that many graduates from Soviet higher educational  establishments occupied high posts in China. Chernomyrdin  pointed out that Russia was ready to receive Chinese students  and to send Russian students to study in China.    He added that Russia could participate in modernization of  Chinese enterprises built with the assistance from the USSR.  Chernomyrdin remarked that the potential for development of  bilateral relations was not being used efficiently enough.    Chernomyrdin suggested that there were big opportunities in  the sphere of military-technical cooperation. He stressed that  Russia had military-technical capabilities which must not be  ruined even under the conversion program and which could work  for export.    Chernomyrdin recognized that there existed problems in  Russian- Chinese relations which must not be kept secret. A  number of such problems were connected with cooperation in the  neighboring regions. He was sure that there must be no  barter-relations in trade. Chernomyrdin spoke in favor of a  search for mechanisms for mutual account settling.    The Russian government's apparatus told INTERFAX that during  his visit to China Chernomyrdin would be accompanied by Vice  Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Agriculture Minister Viktor  Khlystun, Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan and  Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov.</p>

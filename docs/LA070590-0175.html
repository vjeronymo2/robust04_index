			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE WISEGUY CONSULTANT . . .?  </P> <P> If laughter can fend off disease, it should be able to help revive an ailing  business.  </P> <P> That's the premise pushed by Malcolm Kushner, author and "humor consultant." He  claims that people who elicit laughs at work get more done and go further than  their sourpuss colleagues.  </P> <P> "I teach people to communicate the fact that they have a sense of humor," said  Kushner, 37, whose "The Light Touch: How to Use Humor for Business Success"  (Simon &amp; Schuster) recently hit stores.  </P> <P> He can't teach the delivery of Jay Leno or the wit of Robin Williams. But  Kushner tries to point out where humor fits in the workplace, as well as what's  appropriate and what's not.  </P> <P> Racial and sexual slurs are always inappropriate, but Kushner says a competitor  can be used effectively as the butt of a joke. His example: "How can you tell  when a (competitor's) executive has been using a word processor?"  </P> <P> Answer: "There's white-out on the screen."  </P> <P> Humor acts as a magnet that draws people in, and it can help make a point,  Kushner asserts. It also softens stress, motivates people, helps resolve  conflicts and shields hostile remarks, he says.  </P> <P> "Managing, selling, negotiating, planning, decision-making -- all the  fundamental tasks associated with business life become a little bit simpler  when people are prejudiced in your favor," he writes.  </P> <P> Lee Iacocca, Ronald Reagan and Mario Cuomo have shown that successful people  don't have to be afraid to joke, Kushner says. Indeed, having fun at your own  expense can be a powerful tool, he says.  </P> <P> "For eight years, Ronald Reagan poked fun at how old he was, and we loved it,"  Kushner says. "When the Iran-Contra (scandal) hit, everyone wanted to give the  guy the benefit of the doubt. Imagine the same scandal hitting Nixon or Carter.  We would have said, 'Nail the guy.' The first day."  </P> <P> Kushner quit his job as a lawyer with a San Francisco firm eight years ago and  took up humor consulting. He's had some tough clients, including the Internal  Revenue Service and the San Francisco Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> He's also worked with many Fortune 500 companies, focusing on Silicon Valley,  which is near his Santa Cruz home.  </P> <P> Bob Brownson, a senior marketing executive for Digital Equipment Corp. in  Maynard, Mass, said he has hired Kushner twice, at a rate of about $1,500 for a  one-day seminar and $3,000 for a dinner presentation.  </P> <P> "He did an excellent job of improving the quality of our meetings so that we  could get on with the more important business. He got us to lighten up and look  at ourselves in a little more realistic way," he said. "You work so hard in our  business, you begin to believe that selling a computer is the most important  thing in the world. And it's not."  </P> <P> Kushner cites a 1983 Stanford University study that found laughter can have the  same health-improving effects as regular exercise. Although he has no  statistics to prove it, Kushner says the same medicine might improve the  financial health of a company.  </P> <P> His book outlines dozens of techniques for introducing humor into conversation  and presentations. Humorous personal anecdotes are great icebreakers, and old  jokes are useful as analogies, he says.  </P> <P> Self-effacing humor can make a person more likable, he says. His book cites  Fred Hoar, an executive with Miller Communications in Mountain View, Calif., as  an example in a chapter called "Building Yourself Up by Putting Yourself Down."  </P> <P> "A veteran Silicon Valley advertising and public relations executive, Hoar  knows that his name has an unfortunate connotation, particularly when linked  with his profession," Kushner writes.  </P> <P> The executive starts his presentations by saying, "My name is Fred Hoar.  </P> <P> "That's F-R-E-D."  </P></p>

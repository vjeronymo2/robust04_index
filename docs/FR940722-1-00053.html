			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation of Provisions With Non-Negligible Projected Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes and evaluates those provisions of the proposed rule that are expected to impose costs that are not negligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.697&blank;Wing Flap Controls <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with &sect;23.145. The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could design the flap control lever to meet the proposed requirement in 8 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $480 per certification. The control lever itself would impose an incremental cost, including installation, of approximately $100 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nominal benefits of this provision would derive from the increased safety afforded the pilot in positively selecting the proper flap setting to maintain longitudinal control. In fact, if a flap position other than fully retracted were needed to maintain longitudinal control: (1) That position would be necessary to prevent an unsafe condition, (2) the airplane would not be certificated under that design, and (3) the airplane would have to be redesigned so that intermediate flap positions would not be needed for control. Proposed paragraph (c) would allow the identification of an intermediate flap position and the positive means of selecting that position. This alternative would rectify the unsafe condition without requiring the manufacturer to redesign the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.703&blank;Takeoff Warning System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement would be applicable if the flight evaluation shows that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices or longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposed rule would provide requirements for the installation of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that an evaluation to determine whether a takeoff warning system would be needed would cost $240 (4 hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour). Where needed, the integration design of a warning system would cost $2,400 (40 hours at $60 per hour). In addition, an incremental 4 hours of flight testing at a cost of $2,720 ($500 per hour for two test pilots and $180 per hour for fuel) would be needed to demonstrate the system's performance. The FAA estimates that the system, including acquisition, wiring, micro switches, and labor, would add approximately $1,000 to the cost of each airplane required to have one. Maintenance of such a system would cost approximately $100 per year. The FAA solicits comments from interested parties concerning the expected certifications that would require a takeoff warning system and the concomitant costs to acquire, install, and maintain them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nominal benefits of this proposal would derive from the increased safety provided by the takeoff warning system that would activate whenever lift or longitudinal trim devices are not set within their approved takeoff ranges. In fact, if an evaluation showed that positions of the lift or longitudinal trim devices could create an unsafe condition on takeoff, the manufacturer would be required, under existing regulations, to redesign the devices so that the unsafe positions could not be obtained. The proposed section would provide relief by allowing the applicant to install a warning system rather than redesigning the trim device(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.735&blank;Brakes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with the applicant's procedures for operation in service. This proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, manufacturers of commuter airplanes could determine the kinetic energy absorption requirements either through a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during a rejected takeoff or by using a formula presented in proposed new &sect;23.735(e)(2). It is projected that the necessary determination would cost $240 based on four hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour. The potential benefits of the proposal would derive from the added safety that would be provided by establishing beforehand the minimum necessary kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly under rejected-takeoff conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.775&blank;Windshields and Windows <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Introductory text and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require that commuter category windshield panes that are directly in front of the pilots be able to withstand the impact of a two pound bird at maximum approach flap speed. By requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speed, additional protection would also be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would further require the panels of the windshield to be so arranged that, if one is damaged, other panels would remain to provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs of proposed &sect;23.775(h) would vary depending on the circumstances of the affected manufacturer. Industry sources estimate that the total nonrecurring cost per model would range from $250,000 to $350,000, consisting of: (1) Up to $200,000 for a bird strike test article (``bird gun'') if the manufacturer does not have one; and (2) up to $150,000 of time and materials costs for the actual testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A manufacturer that has a bird strike test article would not incur additional capital test costs. Most manufacturers would incur up to $150,000 in time and materials costs for the actual testing, but even these costs would be mitigated by the existing need of most manufacturers to perform such tests for export sales to JAA member countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry sources estimate that there would be no identifiable increment in design or tooling costs since the windshield would be an integral part of the initial design. Similarly, little or no recurring costs per airplane (incremental materials, installation, or weight) are projected since it is reasonable to assume that the pressure load, as compared to bird strike resistance, would be the controlling factor in the windshield design strength. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benefit of the proposed rule is the incremental protection against bird strikes that would be afforded to commuter category airplanes. The FAA has reviewed International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes that occurred on member-country airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less than 1981 through 1989. These data show that approximately 550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The data show that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

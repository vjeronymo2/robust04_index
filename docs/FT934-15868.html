			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / BNF cleared of blame in child leukaemia case BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was cleared by the High Court yesterday of allegations that radiation from its Sellafield reprocessing plant had caused leukaemia in children. Rejecting damages claims brought on behalf of two children of former Sellafield workers, the judge said that it had not been proved that childhood leukaemia was linked with possible genetic damage caused by the irradiation of their fathers' reproductive organs. An independent study claiming such a link, upon which the legal cases were based, was unsupported by other evidence and contained shortcomings which reduced the confidence which could be placed in it, Mr Justice French said. The cases were brought by Mrs Elizabeth Reay, whose daughter died of leukaemia in 1962, and Miss Vivien Hope, who contracted non-Hodgkin's lymphona. They claimed that a study carried out by Professor Martin Gardner, an academic medical statistician, had demonstrated a causal link between the diseases and mutations in fathers' sperm caused by the radiation from Sellafield. However, Mr Justice French accepted arguments by lawyers for BNF that the report was flawed and unsupported by other scientific research. Mr Alvin Shuttleworth of BNF said afterwards that the company was pleased with the judgment but had great sympathy with the families. The cases were the first in which a court had been asked to rule on personal injury claims based on alleged genetic damage. It was seen as a test case for up to 40 other potential claims against BNF.</p>

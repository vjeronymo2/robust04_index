			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: New Dollars 1.1bn mutual fund rescinded by NYSE The New York Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading in the shares of a new Dollars 1.1bn international mutual fund that was to invest in privatised companies, and forced the four - day-old share issue to be rescinded, after the performance of privatised companies' stocks was found to have been overstated in the fund's prospectus. The rescinding of such a large stock issue, and the cancellation of all the trades in the fund's shares that were completed last week, is thought to be unprecedented. Between February 18 and February 22, 74.5m shares in The Global Privatisation Fund, managed by the New York money management group Alliance Capital, were sold to investors at Dollars 15 each. However, late last week an analyst at Alliance discovered that the prospectus for the issue had exaggerated the performance of a composite index of privatisation stocks. A chart in the original prospectus had shown that the privatisation index recorded returns of 170 per cent between the end of 1988 and September 1993, a performance that compared favourably with several other indices quoted in the offer document. In fact, the privatisation index's return over a similar period was 94 per cent, a poorer return than one of the other indices quoted in the prospectus, a Morgan Stanley emerging markets index. Alliance Capital said the mistake was the result of a 'glitch' in the calculations. Once the error was discovered, the NYSE suspended all trading in the shares. Alliance Capital, and the Wall Street investment bank leading the underwriting of the issue, Kidder Peabody, immediately agreed to rescind the issue and publish a new prospectus with the corrected data. All trades in the funds shares made over the four days - and the NYSE said about 4.1m shares had changed hands over the period - were cancelled. Alliance Capital said that the new offer document would be mailed to potential investors this week, and it hoped a new pricing date could be set by Friday.</p>

Ministers  estimated that the moves decided by the committee will be  operational moves aimed at calming moods, not political moves.  Still, on the political plane, Major General Amnon Shahaq, the  head of the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, relayed a  message to Dr Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian  delegation, expressing shock at the murders in Hebron. Shahaq  passed on the condolences of the Israeli delegation with regard  to the murder, and expressed the hope that this tragedy would  not harm the effort for peace, an effort which is obviously  aimed at preventing such incidents.

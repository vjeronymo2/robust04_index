			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Shaqaqi: Arrest of `Jihad' </F> Members Will Redouble Its Operations Against the Occupation"]    [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi,  secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine,"  has stated that he held "indirect contacts" with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO leadership for the release  of Jihad member Hani 'Abid who had been detained by the  Palestinian police. He emphasized that the participation of the  other Palestinian forces in the autonomy elections was "a good  reason for us not to participate in them."    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said that the  military operations carried out by the "Islamic Mujahidin  Forces" (QSM) [al-quwa al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] attached to  the Movement "demonstrated that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza  was not real, that Israeli sovereignty is still there, and that  the authority in the Palestinian administration is Israel."    He said that, in his view, "the Palestinian security forces  abducted Hani 'Abid to use him as a political hostage to make us  stop our jihad operations." He added that he told the PLO  leadership and President 'Arafat "indirectly that the arrest of  our brothers would escalate military action against the  occupation to prove to them (the PLO leadership) that they  cannot blackmail us by detaining one of our brothers in the  Movement." He also said that as long as long as 'Abid remains  in detention "we will escalate military action, and (his  continued detention) will not be a reason to stop (military  action) as they hope. We will redouble our operations against  the occupation until they convince us that the occupation has  come to an end and that there is no Israeli presence in Gaza."    Asked why they have not been killing Palestinian "agents" or  "collaborators" as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has  been doing, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are extremely careful  regarding the question of collaborators. The cases where the  Jihad Movement killed collaborators were clear and flagrantly  self-confessed. We do not act on mere suspicion or personal  interrogation." He ruled out the possibility of the Jihad  Movement killing "collaborators because the Palestinian police  force is there and that matter is ultimately left to it."    After he reaffirmed his "absolute refusal to participate in  the autonomy elections," AL-HAYAH remarked that other parties  have contacted 'Arafat and are willing to do so. He replied:  "That is a very good reason for us not to participate. Some,  even a small minority, should uphold what is right, say no to  this game loud and clear, and be the people's conscience."</p>

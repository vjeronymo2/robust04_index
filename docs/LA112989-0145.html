			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS PHASE 2 OF GREENBRIER PLAZA  </P> <P> What could be the final step before beginning construction on the second phase  of the Greenbrier Plaza development has been taken by the Garden Grove City  Council.  </P> <P> City Council members, acting as the Agency for Community Development, voted 4  to 1 Monday night that the proposed commercial-industrial project was  "consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's redevelopment plan."  </P> <P> The project, at the former site of the Greenbrier Inn, one of Garden Grove's  early hotels, is on a 6.1-acre parcel on Garden Grove Boulevard between  Brookhurst and Nutwood streets.  </P> <P> Pelican Properties of Newport Beach first announced plans to redevelop the  location in the late 1970s, but the shape of proposed projects has changed from  its original plan, which included an enclosed shopping mall with a skating rink  and adjacent hotels.  </P> <P> Monday's action by the council approved a phase that will include a pair of  two-story office/commercial buildings fronting on Garden Grove Boulevard, and  two one-story service-industrial buildings toward the rear of the project.

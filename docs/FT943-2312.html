			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Non-executive directors Lord Prior, the former Cabinet minister, is retiring as chairman of Allders, the department store and duty free retailer that was floated last year, to be replaced by John Pattisson. Pattisson, 63, is a non-executive director of Wassall and Blenheim Group, as well as chairman of Hanson Pension Trustees and Imperial Group Pension Trust. He became a non-executive director of Allders last September, shortly before the flotation, when Lord Prior indicated his desire to retire this year. Pattisson spent much of his career in corporate finance with Dawnay Day &amp; Co, the merchant banking group, which in 1964 floated Wiles Group, the company that is now Hanson. He served as director of many companies associated with Dawnay Day, and became an executive director of Hanson from 1981 to 1989. He takes the helm at Allders as it enjoys strong growth after its flotation. Pro-forma pre-tax profits for the half-year to March 31 increased from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11m.</p>

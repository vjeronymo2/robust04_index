			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION  </P> <P> The Supreme Court upheld the Missouri statutes concerning abortion. Since the  Roe vs. Wade decision was passed down by the Supreme Court in 1973 much has  been discovered about the development of the baby within the mother's womb. One  such discovery is that after just a few days a heartbeat and brain waves can be  detected.  </P> <P> The pro-abortion protagonists base their position upon the "woman's right to  choose." This type of reasoning is at best faulty because it fails to consider  the human rights of the unborn child living within the womb of its mother.  </P> <P> Abortion is not only a moral issue, it is a constitutional one. Unborn children  have the same cherished rights, as the Declaration of Independence states, to  "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," as well as such constitutional  rights to "due process" and protection from "cruel and unusual punishment."  </P> <P> The constitutional rights of the unborn must be protected.  </P> <P> TONY NASSIF  </P> <P> Sherman Oka  </P></p>

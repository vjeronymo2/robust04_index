			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Merchant ship orders highest for 15 years HEAVY demand for new merchant ships has brought the highest level of activity for 15 years to the world's shipbuilding industry, figures published today show. The London-based Lloyd's Register of Shipping says gross registered tonnage (grt) of merchant shipping on order from all the world's yards at the end of 1991 was more than 8 per cent up on the previous year's level at 43.2m grt - the highest level since June 1977. The latest figures continue the upward trend which began in 1989 following a long recession in the world's shipbuilding industry. Mr Nick Granger, of the London-based Shipbuilders &amp; Shiprepairers Association, said the recovery in the shipbuilding market had been caused not by any sudden surge in world trade or by a growth in the market for carrying goods by sea, but by the ageing of the world fleet. 'What we are seeing is quite simply replacement demand for all that tonnage that came onto the market in the mid-1970s,' he said. The Lloyd's Register report shows that Japan and South Korea remain by far the busiest shipbuilding nations. Japan had 15.7m grt on order at the end of 1991 and South Korea had 9.4m grt.

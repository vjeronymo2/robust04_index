			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Hungary leader's future in balance THE FUTURE of Hungary's conservative government hung in the balance last night as Prime Minister Jozsef Antall battled against a far-right offensive to take over the ruling party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum. Mr Antall, a statesman-like moderate who has led Hungary since voters threw out the communist regime in 1990, put his political career on the line in his speech yesterday opening the Forum's congress. Mr Antall, generally regarded as a vital element in Hungary's continuing stability, threatened resignation if the far-right took over the party presidium in internal elections last night. The prime minister appealed to the good sense of the party, saying the far-right endangered the stability which was Hungary's 'prime asset', lacking in neighbouring countries. His speech openly confronted Mr Istvan Csurka, the extremist leader whose attacks on Jews, communists, liberals, journalists and western companies have capitalised on discontent over falling living standards, aroused Forum activists and thrown Hungarian politics into turmoil. Mr Antall had in the interests of party unity resisted much pressure from the opposition and the international community to move against the anti-semitic writer after he launched his explosive manifesto last August. But the prime minister's resolve appears to have hardened in the days running up to the congress as the far-right mounted personal attacks and a serious bid for power within the Forum. 'If somebody draws a sword against me and the government, I take mine out too: I will not back away,' he said yesterday. The clash within the Forum comes at the worst possible time for Mr Antall, who faces challenges on all fronts. Painful economic reforms, pursued amid a recession which has seen GDP fall almost 20 per cent in three years, have proved vastly unpopular. Support for the Forum fell to 8 per cent in a recent poll, leaving a daunting deficit to make up before elections in spring next year. Meanwhile, the two smaller members of the three-party conservative coalition are both distancing themselves from an unpopular government. To cap it all, Mr Antall suffers personally from a struggle against cancer and undergoes periodic chemotherapy.</p>

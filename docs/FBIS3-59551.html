			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Crisis Spares Military </F> Data Processing Systems"]    [Text] Budget restrictions do not seem to be hitting the  data processing sector of the French Defense Establishment  (other than materiel, of course). But French suppliers must  regroup and team up with other Europeans to be competitive on  the international armament markets, especially in dealing with  the Americans.    The Western countries, including France, have been reducing  their military expenditures ever since the end of the Cold War.  But these rather melancholy cuts do not nip at all of the  components of the defense budget in a uniform manner. Some  weapon programs are being scaled back or even dropped; on the  other hand, the data processing sector of the Defense  Establishment seems to be going full speed ahead in the  technical, operational, and logistic sense, it seems.    "The enemy has vanished now that the Soviet Bloc has broken  up. Now there is a big question mark dangling over weapons  systems that were designed to counter that threat. On the other  hand, the ability to master, process, and transmit information  becomes vital for a modern army, based on mobility and  efficiency, particularly in a tight budget context," noted  Pierre Audoin, president and general manager of Pierre Audoin  Conseil Consultants. In other words, it is better to have a few  well-equipped ships that can respond to a missile attack in a  matter of seconds with the help of highly-perfected data  processing and command-control systems, rather than to have a  big, but underequipped fleet.    "The Falkland War and then the Gulf War took place in highly  heterogeneous environments where it is sometimes a rather  delicate matter to tell friend from foe. Besides, you have to  know how to handle the logistics of an army that moves in  distant theaters of operation, such as, for example, supplying  them with spare parts for aircraft. That explains the tendency  toward the development of big command and logistics systems,"  commented Francois Dufaux, director-general of the Sema Group, a  French-British service company which has a strong presence in  command-control systems, particularly for the navy.  <H5>  Software -- The Very Heart of Systems </H5>   Software is from now on in the very heart of new weapons  systems. Any organization of ground forces, naval forces, or air  forces is based on it. The complete data processing system used  in the Leclerc tank (data preparation and processing) accounted  for between 10 and 15 percent of its total cost; in the old  days, a tank had very little in the way of data processing  equipment. A central command system accounts for between five  and six percent of the price tag on a frigate. This, by the way,  is the field where Sema Group in 1989 was able to get its hands  on a Fr400 million contract with the Royal Navy; this was one of  the biggest contracts ever awarded in Europe in the field of  data processing engineering. The command systems used in the  Royal Navy's frigates were based on more than 280 distributed  processors and on a storage capacity of more than 1,500  megaoctets. Business deals like this one, spreading out over  several years, make it possible to look far ahead quite calmly  at a time when civilian contracts are shrinking in terms of  number and duration.    Still, the French data processing market for the Defense  Establishment would not exceed Fr4-5 billion per year, excluding  materiel. But it is difficult to identify it since it is rooted  in the much more vast area of defense electronics. This market  is mostly dominated by four companies: the Sema Group, whose  Defense Establishment activities grew from 18 percent to 23.3  percent of its business volume between 1991 and 1992; Syseca, an  affiliate of the Thomson Group, which makes 600 million in the  defense data processing field out of a total business volume of  Fr1.6 billion; Matra Cap Systemes, sprung from last February's  merger of Cap Sesa Defense and Matra MS2i, which should do about  Fr950 million worth of business this year; finally, there is  Dassault Electronique.    In the opinion of Michel Cochy de Moncan, who heads Defense  and Aeronautical Activities at Syseca, with a business volume  that has been growing between six and seven percent per year for  the past three years, "the French data processing market for the  Defense Department is certainly not tremendous, but it has some  nice days ahead of it, because the complexity of weapons systems  and the volume of data to be processed keep growing constantly."  Yves Veret, president and general manager of Matra Cap Systemes,  believes that "the French cruise missile program entails a  rather considerable increase in the on-board data volume,  especially as regards cartography." As to possible simulation of  nuclear tests rather than physical shots on computers, that is a  matter of great concern to suppliers such as the Sema Group. The  lack of growth on certain civilian markets for service companies  is thus not paralleled in military matters. "As a matter of  fact, we diversified our systems integration markets,  particularly in regard to the military sector; that enabled us  to withstand the crisis much better," commented Francois Dufaux.  Moreover, being a sensitive sector, the French market here  benefits from protection against the American competition.    But the Defense Establishment no longer is the manna from  heaven, as it was six or seven years ago. "The military people  are watching their expenditures very closely and they stir up  competition to bring prices down," remarked Yves Veret.    Fortunately, the drop in profit margins was partly made up  by  productivity gains resulting from the development of software  (see box). Nationwide, competition is represented by certain  data processing services and engineering companies that are  attracted by the growth of data processing for the Defense  Establishment. And the four leading companies, represented  rather unevenly among the three services, are fighting among  each other by tackling the markets on which they are weakest.  <H5>  European Cooperation Undertakings Multiplying </H5>   "The policy of overspecialization and excessive  compartmentalization of resources is dangerous for French  industry while customers demand a broad assortment," notes  Michel Cochy de Moncan. "Two or three operators would be plenty  on the French market," suggested Yves Heret [sic]. An effort at  concentration thus seems inevitable. As a matter of fact, it has  already begun and it is now expressed by the fact that big  "military system makers" -- such as Thomson or Matra, which  needed know-how in systems integration -- are getting together  with data processing services and engineering companies, such as  Syseca and Cap Sesa Defense. Likewise, Sema Group created a  joint venture with British Aerospace and recently teamed up with  Thomson for a combined bidding effort in Korea.    This strategy is designed to cope with rise in R&amp;D  costs but  also to develop a capacity for responding to bidding invitations  on the European level. "Like the future French-Italian-British  frigate, the consortiums are going to multiply in Europe, either  temporarily or permanently. Multinational programs are bound to  grow in view of the cost of certain programs and the budget  restrictions now in force in all countries of the European  Union," predicts Francois Dufaux. This feeling is shared in  Syseca, which is participating in the French-Italian program for  the development of a missile of the Patriot type, side by side  with trans-Alpine manufacturers.    These European cooperation undertakings will also enable  enterprises in the Old World to refrain from fighting like  isolated units on the international markets against the  redoubtable firms from the other side of the Atlantic. The  latter, as a matter of fact, can come out with lower prices than  their European counterparts on account of the size of their  domestic market that allows them to spread the costs over large  series, while the Europeans are restricted to their domestic  markets.  <H5>  [Box] </H5> <H5>  Multipurpose Hardware (or Almost So) </H5>   To meet the competition, data processing services and  engineering companies in the Defense Establishment are pursuing  a policy of reusing software both in the military/civilian sense  and in the civilian/military sense, because these two areas  overlap increasingly. That makes it possible to capitalize on  the knowledge that was acquired and to safe R&amp;D funds.    In the software engineering field, the Concerto Shop,  developed jointly by CNET [National Center for  Telecommunications Studies] and the Sema Group for technical and  scientific data processing, was used for the purpose of  developing the command-control system of the Royal Navy's  frigates and was picked up by the French Navy for training  simulators on the "Le Triomphant" nuclear submarine. Looking at  satellite image processing, Matra Cap Systemes is reusing  military developments for Spot, the civilian Earth observation  satellite. Finally, for crisis management systems, it is  possible to reuse the basic "military" building blocks in  complex civilian systems employed for crisis management in areas  tied to pollution and the environment.</p>

The information ministers  of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia, and delegations  representing Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, Palestine, Malaysia,  Senegal, and the General Secretariat of the Islamic Conference  Organization are taking part in these meetings.    Addressing the conference, Information Minister Muhammad  Salman spoke about the importance of this meeting. He said:  This meeting is aimed at following up the implementation of  resolutions and recommendations reached during the previous  conference. It is being held during critical circumstances in  light of major international developments. This requires us to  increase our coordination and integrate our joint efforts to  implement these resolutions and recommendations. This should  guarantee more strength and effectiveness for our joint efforts  in the media field in order to reinforce the prestige and role  of the peoples of our Islamic states in the world community and  assist them to achieve progress, growth, and freedom under a new  international order that is not established at the expense of  our Islamic peoples but based on the principle of equality,  parity, dialogue, and positive and constructive interaction  among peoples. This new international order should guarantee  for our peoples the achievement of freedom and sovereignty on  their territories and the realization of a just and  comprehensive peace that returns the occupied Arab territories  in Palestine, southern Lebanon, and the Golan to their owners.  This peace should also secure the rights of the Arabs and  Muslims to holy Jerusalem, the Muslims' first qiblah [the  direction a Muslim faces while praying], as emphasized in the  Cairo media declaration issued in the second conference held by  the information ministers of Islamic states.    The information minister also called for further  coordination  among Islamic states in all media fields in order to enhance the  effectiveness of the media in Islamic states by taking advantage  of new technological developments to accentuate the image of  Islam and Muslims in a manner that confirms the importance of  Islam and its great role in emphasizing respect for the human  being and his right to justice, peace, progress, and freedom.  Dr. Muhammad Salman added: Syria has participated in this  march of our Islamic states toward joint media action from the  time it was first launched at the conference in Jeddah, out of  its firm belief in the great role that could be played within  this joint Islamic framework in serving the issues of our  countries and lifting injustice and deceit. Syria believes that  the rapid international changes require us to focus on practical  solutions and realistic visions in order to serve our joint  causes. We believe that this meeting and the resulting  recommendations will be an additional and blessed step which we  hope will further strengthen this joint media action aimed at  serving our people's interests.    Dr. Muhammad Salman arrived in Cairo this afternoon to take  part in the meetings of the follow-up ministerial committee of  the second conference for information ministers of Islamic  states which is scheduled to last two days. He was received at  Cairo International Airport by Egyptian Information Minister  Safwat al-Sharif, Syria's Ambassador in Cairo Dr. 'Isa Darwish,  the two assistants of the Egyptian information minister, and a  number of top Information Ministry officials.    Dr. Muhammad Salman responded to reporters' questions at the  airport. He said he was happy to meet with Safwat al-Sharif,  the information minister of sisterly Egypt, which is taking part  in the meetings of the follow-up committee of the conference  held by the information ministers of Islamic states. He said:  During the committee's meetings, we will discuss the means to  formulate recommendations that will help guide our future action  in the media field.    Responding to a question on media cooperation between Syria  and Egypt, the minister said: We are working together for the  integration of the Syrian and Egyptian media in various arenas.  He added: The Egyptian information minister and I are seeking  to achieve a new qualitative move toward developing these  relations in order to reaffirm political relations between the  two countries and between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Husni  Mubarak.    On the results of the Geneva summit, the information  minister  said: The summit was clear. Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill  Clinton openly responded to all questions. It remains for the  Israeli side to respond to the results of the summit.    Dr. Salman spoke about the role of the Syrian media after  the  Geneva summit and said: The media do not represent an  independent policy, but embody the Syrian policy trends on  various levels. He added: We are seeking to develop and  promote the media up to the level of the policy drawn and led by  President Hafiz al-Asad. [passage omitted]</p>

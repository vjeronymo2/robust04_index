Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting  Administration Bureau at the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, told reporters Tuesday his ministry will  promote the development of a digital HDTV system to replace  NHK's hi-vision system.    The remark stirred protests from Japanese consumer  electronics companies, which are already selling hi-vision  television sets.    Egawa said Wednesday the ministry supports the continuation  of NHK's experimental hi-vision broadcasts, to be followed by  full broadcasts.</p>

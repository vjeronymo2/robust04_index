			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating Regulatory Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy). Regulatory Alternative II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative I (2 Mg/yr [2 tons/yr]) is not significant considering the associated cost. Water and energy impacts were examined; however, because the magnitude of these impacts were small, they were not a major factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor (Regulatory Alternative I) considered for existing BLR sources was to implement the LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H to control the equipment leaks portion of the source, and to require the MACT floor emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion. The LDAR program of subpart H would achieve a higher level of control than the MACT floor; also, the cost of this control option was judged to be reasonable (see Table 3). Therefore, the Administrator selected Regulatory Alternative I as the standard for existing BLR sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. WSR Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for existing wet strength resin facilities was calculated based on data supplied by the nine major sources making up this source category. The MACT floor represents the average value of the lowest five production-based emission totals from major sources in the industry. For the process vents, wastewater, and storage tanks portion of the source, the emission limit is 10 lb/MMlb production. Because no existing facility in the WSR source category controls equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion of the source represents an uncontrolled situation. Impacts associated with the MACT floor and regulatory alternatives for sources at existing wet strength resin facilities are presented in Table 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative II, the most stringent alternative identified for existing WSR sources, would require an emission limit of 5 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source, as well as requiring the subpart H LDAR program for the equipment leaks portion of the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy). Regulatory Alternative II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative I, (1 Mg/yr) is not significant considering the associated cost. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative II; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative I, the first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor for existing WSR sources, would require the MACT floor emission limit of 10 lb HAP/MM lb production for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source, and the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because both Regulatory Alternatives were judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed for both the combined process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks portions of existing WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of the subpart H LDAR program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for existing WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program represents an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source, with significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR program was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or better than that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and wastewater and because costs of implementation of this LDAR program are in many cases much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring compliance with the emission limit (see Table 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

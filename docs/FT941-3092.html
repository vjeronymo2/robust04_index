			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Forestry group's river of gold runs dry - A new Canadian newsprint mill has been idle since Christmas Imagine having a spanking new car in your driveway but being unable to drive it. That's the analogy used by a banker to describe the plight of the newsprint mill at Gold River, British Columbia. The CDollars 320m (USDollars 239m) mill, commissioned little more than four years ago, is among the most modern in the world. But it has stood idle since Christmas Eve as its leading shareholder, Canadian Pacific Forest Products, haggles with international banks over its future. The Gold River saga is being closely watched by forestry companies and their bankers throughout North America. Industry executives are nervous that the Gold River closure signals a growing impatience among lenders with an industry which is reeling from four years of heavy losses. For the bankers, the mill raises the difficult question of what to do with a brand-new project when supply and demand for newsprint are finely balanced. Prices remain near their lowest recessionary levels, and a new newsprint machine is the last item on a pulp and paper company's shopping list. But the market outlook has improved as the North American economies pick up. Producers are expected to succeed in pushing through at least part of an 11 per cent price increase which took effect on March 1. The eight-member Gold River banking syndicate has indicated, however, that it wants substantial changes at the mill before it would agree to restructure the CDollars 226m debt. It has turned down CP Forest's proposal for short-term funding to keep the mill going. Instead, the banks have explored more radical options such as a new controlling shareholder to replace CP Forest, and converting the newsprint machine to a different type of paper. One member of the lending group notes that 'in the right hands and in the proper circumstances, the facility is valuable'. The group is led by Toronto-Dominion Bank, and includes National Westminster of the UK, Bank of Tokyo, Union Bank of Switzerland, Australia's Westpac and three other Canadian banks. But the banks have so far come up empty-handed in their search for a buyer or another operator. One sticking point is that the newsprint facility is closely integrated with a nearby CP Forest pulp mill. Rumours abound in the forestry industry that, should talks with CP Forest fail, the machinery may be shipped elsewhere, probably to a US mill. Nowhere is the discomfort greater than at CP Forest, which was a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific, the diversified rail and resources group, until CP spun its stake off to the public last year. CP Forest initially took a 61 per cent stake in the Gold River limited partnership. But its eight partners, who include publishers in the US, Japan, UK and Singapore, have preferred to give up equity over the past four years rather than participate in cash calls for the mill. As a result, CP Forest's interest has climbed to 84 per cent. Relations between CP Forest and the banks have been bumpy. The mill was commissioned just as the newsprint market started sinking. 'We're a long way short of the transaction prices we anticipated in the feasibility study,' says Mr Norman Lord, who heads CP Forest's restructuring team. To add to the problems, the mill's start-up was plagued by, among other things, technical problems and soil subsidence. The Montreal-based company vented its own frustrations late last year by refusing to sink more money into the partnership. As a result, debt-service payments were halted and the mill was unable to re-open after the Christmas holidays. CP Forest wrote off its entire CDollars 147m investment in the fourth quarter, contributing to a CDollars 286m loss for 1993. Long viewed as one of North America's stodgiest forestry groups, CP Forest has lost CDollars 1.12bn over the past four years. West coast lumber properties were spun off last year into a new public company, and the same is being done with its paperboard business. Several individual pulp and paper mills have been sold or closed. Progress in negotiations between CP Forest and the banks over Gold River has so far been slow. The company has yet to deliver a revised business plan which was promised by last month. Mr Lord says that CP Forest was distracted by its short-term funding proposal. The long-term plan will be submitted by the end of March, he says. 'Other than losing 2-3 weeks in the process (the negotiations) are running pretty much as we'd expected.' Whether Gold River eventually sinks or swims, it has fulfilled a purpose for at least one group of stakeholders. In the four years that it operated, its annual output of 230,000 tonnes has helped drive down west coast paper prices. Mr Mason Sizemore, chief operating officer of the Seattle Times newspaper, consoles himself that intensified competition among newsprint suppliers has made up for the write-off which his company has taken on its 5 per cent stake in Gold River.</p>

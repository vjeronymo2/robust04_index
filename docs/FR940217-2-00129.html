In addition, it is the intent of this notice to also inform the public that the Airport will be conducting a Public Hearing. Major development items, proposed to be completed over the next 5 to 10 years, are depicted on the Airport Layout Plan (ALP). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Melissa Wishy, Community Planner, Federal Aviation Administration, Chicago Airports District Office, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, (708) 294&hyph;7524. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice on April 22, 1993 announcing its intent to prepare an Environmental Document (possible Environmental Impact Statement) and to hold a May 26, 1993 scoping meeting. At the scoping meeting no significant impacts were identified. Some concerns were expressed over possible noise, floodplain and wetland impacts. The airport sponsor indicated that any impacts would be mitigated below the level of significance as an integral part of the development. Recently, United Parcel Service (UPS) announced their intention to initiate a cargo hub at the airport in an area not covered by the previous scoping meeting. Below is a refined listing of the major associated and indirect development projects, incorporating items scoped originally and those newly identified as part of the UPS project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Develop the midfield area for aviation-related industrial users. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Expand the existing cargo apron and buildings west of the existing terminal building to accommodate a minimum of 26 cargo aircraft. (expansion scoped originally; to accommodate 26 aircraft_new) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Extend Runway 7/25 to a length of 10,000 feet by constructing a 3,500-foot southwesterly extension with parallel and connecting taxiways and associated lighting and navigation aids. This would include the installation of a CAT II Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Runway 7. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Relocate approximately 12,000 feet of Belt Line Road and 9,300 feet of Kishwaukee Road. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Expand the existing terminal building and auto parking lot and upgrade the existing airport entrance roadway. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Construct a general aviation apron and T-hangars.

(scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Construct a new 4,000-foot general aviation visual approach runway, parallel to and 5,100 feet southeast of existing Runway 7/25, with associated taxiways and instrumentation. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Construct and realign various taxiways parallel to Runway 1/19. The majority of the realignment work proposed is adjacent to and west of the approach end of Runway 19.

Implement actions recommended in the updated Noise Compatibility Plan. (scoped originally) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Acquire approximately 1,100 acres of land for airfield development and noise and floodway mitigation. Included in this acquisition is the relocation of approximately 28 residential dwellings, of which only eleven are considered to be noise impacted and must be acquired and residents relocated prior to the start of any operation resulting from the Proposed Action Alternative. The remaining residential dwellings would be acquired for purposes of airfield development and floodway mitigation. (land acquisition scoped originally; new noise impacted homes) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

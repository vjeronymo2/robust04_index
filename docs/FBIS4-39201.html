			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("AZG" daily), 06/04/94 -- As we have  already reported, a delegation of the Russian Ministry of Energy  visited Armenia. The delegation involves some twenty  specialists in nuclear energy.    An "Azg" correspondent met the director of "Energia"  enterprise, Director of the Russian institute of Nuclear Plants  Use, Doctor of Technical Sciences, Prof. Armen Abaghian.    - Mr. Abaghian, why did you arrive to Yerevan?    - This is a working visit. You probably know that Russian  Federation and Armenia signed an agreement on reopening the  Armenian Nuclear Power Plant, and the majority of work will be  carried by our specialists. We arrived to get acquainted with  current state of the power plant and to define basic directions  of our activity.    - What are the conditions at the plant?    - After preliminary operations, the plant is ready to  reconstruction.    - There have been rumors that most of the equipment is  stolen, is this true?    - This are senseless rumors. It's not easy to steal things  from here. All main elements are in normal conditions.    - What's the main problem today?    - Financing. Some 100 million dollars are needed for  reopening the block. Everything else is clear.    - Do you have security specialists in your delegation?    - Sure, the problems of physical security have been  discussed in detail. These are all soluble problems and one  shouldn't dramatize these.    - If the problem of financing is solved, do you think that  the plant may be started up by winter.    - Yes, this is possible.</p>

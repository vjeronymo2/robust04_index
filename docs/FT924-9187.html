			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: New World Development reveals 102% advance NEW World Development, the Hong Kong-based property development to hotels group, announced a 102 per cent leap in net profit to HKDollars 2.36bn (USDollars 305.3m) in the year to June 1992, up from HKDollars 1.17bn the year before. Around HKDollars 1bn in earnings came from sales of office and residential properties, and HKDollars 1.4bn from rental income on its property portfolio. New World has been one of the more aggressive investors in southern China, building up a sizeable land bank for development, in addition to its construction of the Guanzhou northern ring road, a toll road linking Huizhou with the border city of Shenzhen and two power plants in Zhujiang. 'The outlook for overall economic development in China is particularly bright. There exists a crying need for industrialisation, land development and infrastructure in the Mainland,' said Mr Henry Cheng, managing director. New World also owns the Ramada hotel chain, which manages 101 hotels worldwide. Hotels continued to suffer from the worldwide recession, but properties in Hong Kong and China are beginning to see improvements. The company holds 47.5 per cent of Asia Television, the colony's second TV channel; Mr Cheng said the outlook was more encouraging, but significant losses are still being incurred. A final dividend of 47 cents has been recommended, making a full-year payout of 68 cents - a 36 per cent increase.</p>

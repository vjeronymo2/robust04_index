			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mekhman Gafarly: "Niyazov Fines a Number of </F> Republic's Leaders"]    [Text] Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] President Saparmurat  Niyazov has by special edict imposed fines equivalent to three  monthly salaries on the minister of internal affairs, the  general prosecutor, the chairman of the National Security  Committee, and the chief of the Republic's Border Guard Troops  Directorate, as well as on the leaders of two rayons. All of  them failed to take measures to prevent the fires in the  Ashkhabadskiy and Gyaurskiy rayons, which have done considerable  damage to the environment. The blaze started on 5 June and  mainly engulfed the border zone. A separate decree has  dismissed Nurmukhamed Ashirov, minister for the use and  protection of the natural environment, and his deputy for the  same reason.    The money will be transmitted to a special account to be  opened by the Republic president's staff with the AKB  "Turkmenistan" bank. In the future all fines for ecological  crimes in the Republic will come to this account.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MILKEN SENTENCING;  </P> <P> MILKEN MUST NOW HELP PROSECUTORS NAIL EX-FRIENDS  </P> <P> For many former clients and colleagues of Michael Milken, unease may overshadow  Thanksgiving dinner.  </P> <P> The harsh sentence imposed Wednesday puts him under intense pressure to  cooperate fully with the government in hopes of getting his prison term  reduced. In any event, the terms of his plea agreement require him now to begin  telling prosecutors everything he knows. When the former Drexel Burnham Lambert  junk bond king signed the agreement last April, he committed himself to "fully  and truthfully disclose all information with respect to Drexel-related  activities."  </P> <P> If he doesn't fully answer all the questions put to him, the agreement can be  revoked. At least theoretically he could be indicted on scores of additional  charges, possibly including perjury.  </P> <P> High on the prosecutors' shopping list is information about some of the  notorious corporate raiders of the 1980s, hose exploits were backed by Drexel  Burnham Lambert junk bonds. Sources say prosecutors and Securities and Exchange  Commission lawyers also are eager to grill him about some of Drexel's biggest  buyers of junk bonds. Among them are publicly identified targets of criminal  investigations, such as Thomas Spiegel, the former chief executive of Beverly  Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> Columbia was one of Drexel's biggest buyers of junk bonds. It is has confirmed  that it will probably be taken over soon by federal regulators, due mainly to  enormous losses on those bonds. Robert G. Morvillo, Spiegel's lawyer, said: "We  hope that Milken tells the truth, and we are convinced that if he does tell the  truth, it will indicate that Mr. Spiegel is guilty of no wrongdoing."  </P> <P> Investigators also have had a longstanding interest in Fred Carr, chairman of  the Los Angeles-based insurance holding company First Executive Corp., who also  was one of Milken's best customers. It is unclear whether investigators  currently have any firm evidence of illegal conduct by Carr or the company.  Although First Executive has acknowledged in public filings that it is the  subject of investigations, Carr has long maintained that neither he nor the  company did anything illegal.  </P> <P> Investigators are eager, too, to talk to Milken about former Drexel executives  and about a range of ex-clients such as Patsy Ostrander, once a portfolio  manager for mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments. Ostrander resigned after  Fidelity learned that she had been allowed to invest personally in a highly  profitable Drexel partnership at the same time she was making decisions to buy  Drexel junk bonds for her funds.  </P> <P> The House subcommittee on oversight and investigations is chomping at the bit  to get Milken to testify publicly about the scores of lucrative private  partnerships he controlled.  </P> <P> How much all of these investigators will get from him, however, remains to be  seen. Unlike others caught up in the premier financial scandal of the 1980s,  such as inside traders Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, Milken refused to  cooperate until after his sentencing. Confidants said he didn't want to appear  to offer up his friends in exchange for a lenient sentence.  </P> <P> Milken undoubtedly will want to get his sentence reduced -- a possibility that  U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood left open if the government reports back to  her that he has cooperated fully. But former colleagues say Milken may believe  that he has no incriminating information on anyone. He is also known to be  intensely loyal to former co-workers and clients. Milken's spokesman declined  to comment. His lawyers have said in earlier court appearances that he will  live up to his promise to cooperate.  </P> <P> Even if he does know damning secrets, other strong pressures may make him  reluctant to share them. He faces scores of civil suits that, if successful,  could wipe out even a fortune as large as his is believed to be. Any testimony  he gives can be used against him in the lawsuits. Lawyers say the few times he  has testified before, such as in depositions, he seemed exceptionally adroit at  evasive answers. But a former colleague said: "I don't know if he can get away  with that now."  </P> <P> Jeremiah O'Sullivan, a lawyer for Ostrander, declined to comment about the  possibility of Milken testifying against her. Ostrander herself couldn't be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> A number of other defense lawyers also asserted that their clients have nothing  to fear from Milken. William Hundley, lawyer for Drexel's former head junk bond  trader, Warren Trepp, said: "The truth from Michael Milken will not cause  Warren Trepp any problems."  </P> <P> Trepp and several other Drexel employees had been expected to be named in a new  indictment of Milken that was preempted when Milken agreed to plead guilty. In  addition, former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, named in the original indictment  of Milken, is still under indictment. Newberg's lawyer, Fred Hafetz, said he  doesn't know if prosecutors are eager to talk to Milken about Newberg.  </P> <P> During Milken's pre-sentencing hearings in October, prosecutors surprised some  defense lawyers by saying in open court that they may want to bring a case  against Milken's closest professional aide, Lorraine Spurge, who formerly  headed Drexel's high-yield syndication department. Spurge had testified before  a grand jury under a grant of partial immunity. Lawyers earlier had said they  thought that arrangement meant it was unlikely she would be prosecuted. Andrew  Lawler, her attorney, said he didn't believe that anything Milken could say  would hurt her.  </P></p>

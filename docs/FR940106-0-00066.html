			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limited-entry allocations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The limited-entry fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using limited-entry gear fished pursuant to the harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the limited-entry fishery. Limited-entry gear means longline, pot, or groundfish trawl gear used under the authority of a valid limited-entry permit, issued under 50 CFR part 663, affixed with an endorsement for that gear. (Groundfish trawl gear excludes shrimp trawls used to harvest pink shrimp, spot prawns, or ridgeback prawns, and other trawls used to fish for California halibut or sea cucumbers south of Pt. Arena, California.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limited-entry allocation is the allowable catch (harvest guideline or quota) reduced by: (1) Set asides, if any, for treaty Indian fisheries or recreational fisheries, and (2) the open-access allocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. 1994 Management Measures_Commercial Fishery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the 1994 management measures announced in this notice have been designated as ``routine'' under the procedures contained in Amendment 4 to the FMP (56 FR 736, January 8, 1991). The ``routine'' designation means that a measure is likely to need adjustment on an annual or more frequent basis, and that it may be implemented and adjusted for a specified species or species group and gear type after consideration at a single Council meeting. However, the effects of the particularly measure must have been analyzed previously, the purpose of the measure must be the same as when it was designated as routine, and the measure must be announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those management measures not yet designated as routine apply to the harvest of groundfish taken incidentally in non-groundfish fisheries (in the open-access fishery) for pink shrimp, spot and ridgeback prawns, California halibut, and sea cucumbers. These fisheries must be managed under ``routine'' trip limits to assure that open-access allocations are not exceeded. The trip limits for pink shrimp, and spot and ridgeback prawns previously were codified at 50 CFR 663.24; those for California halibut and sea cucumbers are announced herein for the first time. In the future, the Council also may recommend designating trip limits for lingcod as routine, so that they may be adjusted in season to achieve its harvest guideline which was specified for the first time in 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limited-entry fishery.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following management measures apply to vessels operating in the limited-entry fishery after January 1, 1994, and are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines or limited-entry allocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Sebastes complex (including yellowtail rockfish and Bocaccio).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning January 1, 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex coastwide was 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) in a 2-week period, of which no more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) could be bocaccio taken south of Cape Mendocino, or 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) could be yellowtail rockfish caught north of Coos Bay, Oregon. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex trip limit remained the same all year, but the trip limit for yellowtail rockfish was lowered to 6,000 pounds (2,722 kg) in late April, and the bacaccio trip limit was increased to 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) in early October. By the end of 1993, landings of bocaccio are yellowtail rockfish and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex catches are expected to exceed their harvest guideline in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas by as much as 27 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The Council did not recommend further reductions in the trip limit for yellowtail rockfish in 1993 because the ABC and harvest guideline for this species were expected to increase substantially in 1994, and the overage in 1993 is not expected to reduce future productivity. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex harvest guideline was exceeded entirely due to the overage in the yellowtail rockfish landings, so the trip limit for the complex was not reduced for the same reasons as for yellowtail rockfish. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1994, the cumulative trip limit period for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex (including yellowtail rockfish and bocaccio) is extended from 2 weeks to a calendar month, consistent with the period for widow rockfish and the Dover sole/thornyhead/sablefish complex. However, the trip limit is not simply doubled because experience has shown that the opportunity for landings, and thus catch rates, increase as the trip limit period is lengthened. Consequently, the coastwide trip limit for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> complex is increased to only 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) per calendar month in 1994. Analysis of 1993 Washington and Oregon landings accumulated by 4-week periods indicated that this trip limit will not be severely constraining because few cumulative  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> trips exceeded 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) in 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the management line for yellowtail rockfish is moved north to Cape Lookout, Oregon (45 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;20 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;15 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. latitude), to better define the areas where this species is concentrated. The cumulative trip limit for yellowtail rockfish north of Cape Lookout is set at 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) per month, intermediate to the 1993 levels (6,000 pounds (2,722 kg) and 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) per 2-week periods), because landings in 1993 are believed to have been similar to the 1994 harvest guideline for the same area. To keep landings from accelerating south of the line, as occurred in 1992, a trip limit of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per month is established for yellowtail rockfish caught south of Cape Lookout. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because landings of bocaccio did not reach the 1993 harvest guideline, the trip limit is almost doubled to 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1993 restrictions limited a vessel to the northern, more restrictive trip limit for yellowtail rockfish if operating on both sides of the line at Coos Bay. This was a problem for vessels that took the yellowtail rockfish limit south of Coos Bay at the beginning of the month, and then fished north of the line for the DTS complex because yellowtail rockfish is commonly taken as bycatch. The yellowtail rockfish would either need to be discarded or the vessel would be in violation of the more restrictive northern limit. The same problem would exist north and south of Cape Lookout in 1994. Consequently, the Council endorsed a declaration procedure by the States of Oregon and Washington that would allow a fisherman to operate both north and south of Cape Lookout during a month and retain up to the southern limit of yellowtail rockfish, if the State is notified in advance where the vessel will be operating on each trip that crosses the line during that month. These declarations, which are binding for the trip, are similar, but not identical, to those used in the past. The State where the fish will be landed (Oregon or Washington) should be contacted for more complete information on these procedures, which may differ between the two States. The phone numbers of the State agencies appear in Section III.C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Widow rockfish.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1993 cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish initially was set at 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per 4-week period, but was reduced to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip on December 1, 1993. Landings of widow rockfish are projected to exceed the harvest guideline by as much as 12 percent in 1993. For 1994, the trip limit is again initially set at 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg), but the period is slightly extended from 4-weeks to a calendar month. Reducing the number of trip limit periods from 13 4-week periods (of 28 days) to 12 calendar months (of 30&hyph;31 days) is intended to reduce landings from 1993 levels and avoid the need for further trip limit reductions before the fall of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

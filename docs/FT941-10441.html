			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Schering slips despite sales advance Group profits for Schering, Germany's pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, last year fell 3 per cent to DM254m (Dollars 149.4m) after a 2 per cent rise in sales to DM5.36bn. In spite of the fall in profits, the group increased its dividend to DM14.22 from DM13 in 1992. Schering said sales growth was divided evenly between increased volume and the affects of fluctuations in the exchange rates. Pharmaceutical sales rose 6 per cent, widening the share of total group sales to 77 per cent from 74 per cent. The group expects to lift its earnings over the next few years through sales of Beteseron, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis patients. Sales for the drug, introduced late last year, totalled DM7m, although the group had expected a turnover of about DM30m, rising to DM300m this year. Schering last year underwent a restructuring programming following the merger of its agrochemical division with Hoechst in a bid to concentrate on the core pharmaceutical business. The merger is expected to produce an annual turnover of DM3bn, making it the world's second largest company in this sector. Hoechst will hold 60 per cent of the shares, the remainder will be held by Schering.</p>

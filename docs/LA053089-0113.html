			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1 IN 10 BAY AREA HOUSEHOLDS CAN AFFORD A HOUSE  </P> <P> Only one in 10 households in the San Francisco Bay Area could afford a  median-priced, single-family detached home in April, the lowest figure since  records started being kept and the worst in the state, the California Assn. of  Realtors reported today.  </P> <P> To qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home of $261,520 in April, a  Bay Area household needed a minimum annual income of $85,904 and faced monthly  payments of $2,148, assuming a 20% down payment, the association said.  </P> <P> San Francisco's affordability index was down slightly from March, when 11% of  households could afford a median-priced home of $249,508. In April, 1988, 22%  of local households could afford a median-priced home, then $195,598.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Market ... Crippled'  </P> <P> The area's housing crunch mirrors an affordability drop statewide. For the  state as a whole, only 17% of households could afford a median-priced home of  $200,784 in April, down from 18% in March.  </P> <P> "The entry-level homeownership market has been crippled by more than a year of  escalating home prices and six months of rising mortgage interest rates," said  Joel Singer, the association's chief economist.  </P> <P> Following close behind San Francisco as a house-hunter's nightmare was the  Ventura area, where only 11% of households could afford the median-priced home  of $249,847. In Los Angeles and Orange counties, just 14% of households earned  enough to qualify for a median-priced home of $215,871 and $243,485,  respectively.  </P></p>

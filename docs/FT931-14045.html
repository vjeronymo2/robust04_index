			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore equities show signs of revival - Hopes of economic recovery have given the market a boost It is Chinese new year this weekend and Singapore brokers are hoping for big things from the Year of the Rooster after the Straits Times industrial index of 30 blue chip stocks reached an 18-month high of 1,577 this week. Only a few weeks ago it was hard to find a content broker in Singapore but things have changed with speculation that the market could break its all time high of 1,607 - achieved in early 1990 - within a few weeks. The index eased slightly yesterday to close down 3.98 at 1,573.02. For much of last year Singapore was in the doldrums, overshadowed by a rapid surge in the Hong Kong market and more exciting prospects offered by Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. Lower than expected second quarter domestic growth figures of 4.7 per cent caused nervousness about trading prospects, with recession or economic slowdown affecting all its main export markets. By mid year the market had fallen nearly 12 per cent, with the index at one point touching the psychologically damaging 1,300 level. But then the turnaround happened: signs began to emerge that the economy was reviving; overall trade was picking up sharply, particularly in the vital electronics sector; and November non-oil domestic exports rocketed by 29 per cent. At the same time Governor Chris Patten's argument with China over political reforms for Hong Kong was causing a withdrawal of funds. Singapore, with its reputation as a safe, if somewhat uninteresting, market was felt to be a good port in stormy political times. By the end of December the STI was trading 2.2 per cent up on the year and 16 per cent above its August low. More good news on the domestic front came in the new year when the government announced economic growth of 5.6 per cent in 1992, with higher growth expected this year. It also said that in spite of generally gloomy worldwide economic news in 1992 inward investments had reached a record SDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.12bn) over the year. 'The economy now shows all the signs of being on a roll,' says Mr Paul Schymyck of Hoare Govett, Singapore. 'Having survived what, in Singapore terms, was a bad news patch early last year the fundamentals of the economy now appear to be sound.' One factor driving the market higher is the government's commitment to lower both corporate and personal income taxes in the March budget , which is likely to result in a boost in corporate earnings and provide a much needed stimulus to the retail sector. But Singapore is still a narrow market. Despite the rally late last year, turnover shrank to 13.9bn shares worth SDollars 29.6bn in 1992 from 15.5bn shares worth SDollars 30.5bn in 1991. Singapore has also been overshadowed in recent months by Malaysia, which is now twice as large in terms of market capitalisation, while Malaysian shares, traded on Clob International, the over-the-counter market, now account for about 30 per cent of volume. Hungry investors want a more liquid, less regulated market, with more companies allowed on to the board. The year's main excitement will be the long delayed floatation of Singapore Telecommunications, the highly profitable state telephone utility. The government is expected to sell off a 25 per cent stake in the second half with analysts valuing the company at up to SDollars 16bn. They say that the floatation will give much needed breadth to a market overly dominated by a small number of stocks. The government, still a big force on the corporate scene, says that companies must be more adventurous and expand overseas. Only by doing so, it says, will Singapore remain competitive against more outward looking Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. In the short-term the risks associated with such expansion could disrupt the steady profits growth blue chip investors have become accustomed to. But, in the long-term, it could bring substantial benefits, as Singapore's cash rich conglomerates use their resources to snap up opportunities in the world's most dynamic economic region.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zairean company's mining problems are 'exaggerated' GECAMINES, ZAIRE'S state-owned copper and cobalt producer, has told its agents and customers that reports that its output is at minimal levels and in danger of being shut down completely are exaggerated. Traders claim that the group has admitted that it is suffering some production problems arising from the ethnic battles in the Shaba province, where it is based. and shortages of foreign currency to buy spare parts and equipment. However, Gecamines insists that its copper production this year will be between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes. This is well below the target it set in March when Gecamines (Generale des Carrieres et des Mines), which produces most of Zaire's copper and all the country's cobalt, said it expected to sell just over 200,000 tonnes of copper - or about 2 per cent of refined copper production in the world outside the former eastern bloc countries - and 9,000 tonnes of cobalt this year. In the mid-1980s, the group's annual copper output was more than 500,000 tonnes. Gecamines claims that the radio station that suggested the mining company was in dire difficulties is controlled by those opposed to President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has ruled the country with an iron hand for 27 years, and wants to put the worst possible light on Zaire's problems. The Reuter news agency quoted the radio station as saying that Gecamines was threatened with closure because its main furnace was out and other plants were just ticking over. The radio report said the crisis in Gecamines, which provides two-thirds of Zaire's export earnings, was caused by 'bad management' and that it needed a cash injection of Dollars 500m. Other reports suggested that the 165,000 tonnes-a-year Lubumbashi copper smelter had been shut down because of a spare parts shortage and that the Luilu refinery (100,000 tonnes a year) was behind schedule, leaving Gecamines with spare supplies of copper blister (an intermediate product). However, a Gecamines director who had just returned from Lubumbashi said yesterday in Brussels that operations were continuing 'as in the past'. And traders noted that Gecamines had made recent shipments to MHO (Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt) in Belgium for refining. Nevertheless, some expressed doubts about Gecamines' copper output reaching 150,000 tonnes this year and one said: 'These problems appear to be significant and could mean major declines in the production of copper and cobalt over the next couple of years'. Japan will help China to develop mining of base metals such as copper along the Yangtze River, starting in 1993, an official at the semi-governmental Metal Mining Agency of Japan said yesterday, reports Reuter from Tokyo. As a first step, the agency plans to use a satellite to find potential mining areas. 'China is so large that it is difficult to rely only on manpower to conduct research,' the official said. MMAJ will pay the costs of the survey out of its 1992 development assistance budget.</p>

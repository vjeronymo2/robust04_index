			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Recession balks rise at Sirdar SIRDAR reported a 9.5 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.61m to Pounds 5.05m, but said that pronounced recessionary conditions in the final quarter meant that progress was not as good as had been expected. Sales at the textiles company in the year to June 30 fell to Pounds 52m (Pounds 53.5m), but costs and overheads were cut to Pounds 46.2m (Pounds 48m) and interest payable declined to Pounds 910,000 (Pounds 1.15m). An unchanged final dividend of 3.5p maintains the total at 5.15p on earnings per share of 5.85p (5.26p).</p>

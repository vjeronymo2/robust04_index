"We are required to phase out non-tariff barriers and to  reduce our import tariffs further," Mar'ie told attendants of  the last session of a two day seminar yesterday.    The gathering was discussing the opportunities and  challenges  of Indonesian development within the next 2 years.    The minister said Indonesia has no other option but to make  concerted efforts to strengthen the competitive edge of its  products in terms of both prices and quality.    Mar'ie cited the stronger tendency towards a free open  multilateral trading system as one of three major trends the  country will face in the second stage of its long term, 25-year  development program beginning in April.    "Economic and political issues will also be more intensively  inter-linked," he added, citing another outstanding trend  expected during the next 25 years.    The problem, according to Mar'ie, is how to reconcile the  domestic and international parameters or yardsticks for  assessing the results of development.    He acknowledged that the international yardsticks of  development strongly influenced by the industrialized countries.    But he conceded that in a world that is becoming smaller due  to information technology, international yardsticks are  unavoidably often used to assess the development of all  countries irrespective of the stages of development they are in.    Mar'ie singled out the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum as another development that Indonesia should  closely monitor.    "I think APEC will gradually turn from a loose consultation  forum into a more solid setting and this will naturally have an  impact on our economy," he said.    The two-day seminar, organized by the Yayasan Bina  Pembangunan [Development] foundation discussed the political,  social, cultural and economic aspects of Indonesian development  during the next 25 years. The speakers included three cabinet  ministers. [passage omitted]    Referring briefly to the monetary sector, Mar'ie reaffirmed  that the depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar will be  kept in the range of three percent to five percent a year and  the monetary expansion will be checked at 20 percent a year.    "I am aware that bank lending during the first semester  (April-September) of the current fiscal year (1993/1994) has  expanded by 14.2 percent. But I think a 20 percent monetary  expansion is the most manageable level to fuel economic  activities without causing excessive inflationary pressures,"  Mar'ie said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] The National Reconstruction Movement [MRN] of  Rene Theodore has demanded the resignation of General Raoul  Cedras as a way out of the deadlock. MRN leader Rene Theodore,  former prospective prime minister, explained in a statement on  Signal FM that the departure of Gen. Raoul Cedras is necessary  to avoid a military intervention in Port-au-Prince:    [Begin Theodore recording] "Instead of speaking of military  intervention, since the Haitian military institution is not  hostile toward anyone, the foreign powers should carry out their  commitment to bring military cooperation to Haiti to help  discipline the Haitian Army, professionalize the officers and  noncommissioned officers of the Haitian Army, and establish the  police force provided for by the Haitian Constitution. They  signed documents to this effect and they must fulfill their  obligation." [end recording]    Theodore also calls on the sectors involved in the crisis to  work toward a respect for legality and legitimacy. MRN demands  the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to avoid the  reinforcement of sanctions against the country. Theodore reminds  parliamentarians of the difficult crossroads the country is  facing:    [Begin Theodore recording] "[Passage omitted] It is very  clear to everyone that the resolution of the crisis will begin  with the resignation of Gen. Cedras. MRN demands the resignation  of Gen. Cedras as the first step toward cancellation of the  international community's actions and claims." [end recording]    This was Rene Theodore who has ended his silence, his long  silence, to take a stand in favor of the return of President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>

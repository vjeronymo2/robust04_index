			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: First City Financial in 1990 loss of CDollars 228m FIRST CITY Financial, the core holding company of Vancouver's Belzberg family, has reported a final 1990 loss of CDollars 228.1m (USDollars 197.3m) or CDollars 4.35 a share, due to unsuccessful efforts to take control of several prominent companies, including the British supermarket group Asda. The Belzbergs became prominent North American corporate raiders in the 1980s, often through First City Financial. They have withdrawn from securities trading and arbitrage since the end of the year and the group is concentrating on its financial services subsidiary and property operations in Canada and the US. Mr Samuel Belzberg, best known as a 'greenmailer' in the 1980s, last month stepped aside as chief executive of First City Financial and his nephew, Brent, 40, took over. Now Mr Brent Belzberg has been appointed chairman of the trust company subsidiary. Revenues for all 1990 were CDollars 786m, down from 1989's CDollars 970m. Total assets at December 31 were CDollars 5.5bn against CDollars 6bn a year earlier. In 1989 First City Financial reported earnings of CDollars 61m or CDollars 1.13 a share, excluding a CDollars 123.7m gain from the sale of its investment in Cantel, a cellular telephone company. Mr Brent Belzberg said the priorities were debt reduction and restructuring, sale of non-core assets and a simplified corporate structure. He agreed shareholder value has been eroded 'significantly' by the 1990 loss. Nearly CDollars 1bn of securities have been sold, offices closed in Britain and Barbados, and cutbacks made in New York and Vancouver. The company's Canadian lenders have agreed to convert CDollars 100m of demand bank credit lines into a three-year term loan. But much of First City Financial's underlying value is represented by property and shares of the trust company subsidiary, he said, and further debt restructuring was needed. A US subsidiary lacks sufficient liquidity to redeem USDollars 97m of senior notes due in mid May, and restructuring talks are under way.</p>

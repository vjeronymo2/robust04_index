			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Flying office The days when airline travel represented a break from the stresses of the office are over, according to Inmarsat, the international satellite organisation. Already, 30 airlines have begun to install telephones on their aircraft, with some also offering facsimile machines. By the end of the century, Inmarsat says, airline passengers will have all the facilities they now have in their offices. An Inmarsat global pager is being developed. So is a hand-held satellite telephone. Passengers on some airlines can already use on-line notebook computers.</p>

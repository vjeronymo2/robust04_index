			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Silver screen glows gold: A team of entertainment mogulsis challenging the big film studios Barely a day had gone by in the seven weeks since Jeffrey Katzenberg handed in his resignation as head of Walt Disney's movie studios without the Hollywood gossips lining him up with yet another new partner or venture. This week, the guessing was over. Mr Katzenberg announced that he was teaming up with his two closest friends: Steven Spielberg, the highly successful film maker, and David Geffen, the billionaire rock music mogul, to create a 'dream team' entertainment group. Their aim is to challenge the leading movie studios that have dominated Hollywood for decades, such as Disney, which in its last audited accounts made total revenue of Dollars 2.2bn. The critical question is whether wealth and talent will be enough to enable them to fulfil their ambitions in the cut-throat entertainment industry. 'These guys have got great timing,' said Tim Wallace, entertainment industry analyst at SG Warburg Securities in New York. 'There's huge growth potential in the industry and no shortage of new investors. But this is a complex and costly business. They've got lots of talent but enormous egos.' The three men are dazzlingly wealthy. Katzenberg, 43, is fresh from the success of The Lion King, Disney's latest animated hit. He is a millionaire after cashing in his Disney share options. His partners are two of the wealthiest people in the US. Spielberg, 47, directed four of the 10 most commercially successful films ever, including ET and Jurassic Park. Geffen, 51, has become a billionaire by investing the Dollars 700m he made by selling his Geffen Records stake in MCA to Japan's Matsushita. So far, they have been short on detail about their venture. All that has been said is that they will be equal partners in the company, which will launch early next year with Dollars 250m of their own capital. Geffen Films will be merged into the new business, as will Mr Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. The venture will develop its own projects in animation, movies, television, music and interactive entertainment. The decision to create a fully fledged studio flies in the face of current industry trends. A studio is a huge enterprise with big buildings, a large staff and highly sophisticated technology. No one knows exactly how much it will cost the dream team to launch their studio. However, industry estimates suggest that if they hope to establish the company as a force in animation, for example, they will need to make a total investment of up to Dollars 500m over five years in order to release at least three films of the same quality as The Lion King. Most new arrivals in Hollywood have balked at such an expensive and lengthy investment. Some have bought existing studios as Mr Rupert Murdoch did with 20th Century Fox, Sony with Columbia and Matsushita with MCA/Universal. Mr Murdoch has made a success of Fox. But Sony is still struggling to restore Columbia's fortunes, while Matsushita is embroiled in an acrimonious row with the MCA management over the latter's desire to buy back the business. Other recent investors have invented 'virtual' studios by making films in rented facilities and by making piecemeal investments in independent producers. Ted Turner, the CNN magnate, adopted this approach in making the recent cult comedy, The Mask. So did PolyGram, the London-based music group, with Four Weddings and a Funeral. However, life in the independent sector can be perilous, as illustrated this week by Carolco, the independent US producer. It is now struggling for survival after its proposed merger with the Live Entertainment retail group collapsed this week. The risks of launching a studio are even greater. But so are the potential rewards, particularly in animation, where the studio can count on an impressionable market of children - and their parents - to boost sales of video, books, toys and other merchandise associated with film. Disney took Dollars 267m at the box office in the first four months after launching The Lion King in the US, but that has been surpassed by the income from merchandising. 'An animated hit like The Lion King can make a fortune,' said Richard Grand-Jean, president of Global Film Equity, the New York-based film finance specialists. 'But Thumbelina, which didn't do well at the box office, made money from video. And no one is better at animation than Jeffrey Katzenberg.' Katzenberg and his partners have chosen a good time to launch their venture. The traditional movie business is buoyant. Box office takings in the US have reached Dollars 3.94bn so far this year, according to Variety magazine, against Dollars 3.82bn and Dollars 3.43bn in the same periods of 1993 and 1992 respectively. The international box office is even healthier, thanks to the emergence of new markets in eastern Europe and Asia, most recently in China, where Time Warner has just signed a distribution deal with the authorities. The merchandising market is also showing strong growth, as illustrated by The Lion King's success. Meanwhile, new technology offers exciting opportunities in movie-making and interactive entertainment for the studios to explore in the future. Spielberg is a technology fiend, and was at the forefront of experiments in digital technology with his special effects for Jurassic Park. He sees the new studio as an ideal vehicle for his future experiments. The next wave of technological developments should take the studios into new forms of distribution, such as CD-Roms for use in the home and more sophisticated cinemas that replicate movie special effects, such as the physical experience of being in a car chase, for the audience. The convergence of the entertainment industry with new technology has attracted a stream of investors to Hollywood. The misadventures of Sony and Matsushita have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of the other electronics, information technology and telecommunications companies, such as ITT and IBM, that are searching for partners in the entertainment business. The new venture will offer an appealing package for investors. Microsoft, the world's largest software house, has already been mooted as a potential partner for their studio. There is also speculation of an alliance with the MCA management if it succeeds in buying the company back from Matsushita. 'The movie business is full of swamps: just look at the problems Sony and Matsushita have had in Hollywood,' says Oscar Moore, editor of Screen International, the film industry magazine. 'But Katzenberg and Geffen are very talented men, and Spielberg has made more money for the film industry than anyone else in its history. A lot of people will be willing to bet on them.'  ---------------------------------------------- THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS  ----------------------------------------------                                   US box office Studio              Owner         market shares  ---------------------------------------------- Buena Vista         Disney                19.1% Paramount           Viacom                14.8% Warner Bros         Time Warner           14.5% Universal           Matsushita            13.2% 20th Century Fox    News Corp             11.2% News Line           Turner Broadcasting    5.7% TriStar             Sony                   4.7% Colombia            Sony                   4.7% Others                                    12.1%  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Daily Variety  ----------------------------------------------</p>

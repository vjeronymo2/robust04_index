			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grenada nutmeg oil output starts Grenada, the world's second largest producer of nutmeg, has started producing nutmeg oil in the hope of supplying about one-tenth of world demand for the product. The oil plant has a rated capacity of 30 tonnes per year, and production will be marketed mainly in North America, Europe, Russia and Japan. The oil extraction plant will use about 300 tonnes of defective nutmeg per year. Previously the industry has been destroying defective nuts, and disposed of 400 tonnes last year. It will ease the financial concerns of the industry on the eastern Caribbean island, second to Indonesia as the world's largest producer. Earlier this year both producers agreed on a plan to stabilise and then to increase world market prices, but steered clear of recreating their cartel which collapsed six years ago. Grenadian farmers have been suffering from a fall in price in the international nutmeg market.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Feltrim managers 'misunderstood' LMX markets THE MANAGERS of the loss-making Feltrim syndicates 'did not understand the true nature' of the reinsurance markets in which they were active, a Lloyd's loss review has concluded. The 850-page report by a committee chaired by Sir Patrick Neill QC was sent yesterday to Names (the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's) affected by the losses. It has taken more than a year to prepare. Syndicates 540/542 and 847 specialised in London market excess-of-loss (LMX) or spiral catastrophe reinsurance, in which syndicates at Lloyd's and insurance companies re-insured each other's exposure to high-level catastrophe loss. Between 1987 and 1990 the syndicates were hit by a sequence of catastrophes which produced claims 'on a scale which was without precedent in insurance history', says the report. Reviews covering the losses of LMX syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire have been completed in the past two months. Some 1,000 Feltrim Names suffered losses in excess of Pounds 450m, a level described as totally unacceptable. A Name trading on syndicate 540/542 in 1987, 1988 and 1989 would have faced a loss of more than Pounds 73,700 for each Pounds 10,000 traded. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, called the report 'a savage indictment of the Lloyd's system'. He said: 'It highlights an appalling series of errors and incompetence. No one comes out of it well.' He said it would assist the Names in their campaign for compensation. The report says Feltrim was 'unaware of certain critical factors relevant to the assessment of the degree of risk in the LMX market'. It adds that Feltrim's managers and underwriters did not appreciate the scale of loss to which they were exposed. Their reinsurance was inadequate, it says. In 1987, for example, the two syndicates shared a reinsurance programme for the 1987 account, partially because of cost constraints. The reinsurance programme of syndicate 540/42 was designed to protect dollar exposures, but the big losses of 1987 and 1988 - the UK hurricane of October 1987 and the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in July 1988 - produced claims that were paid in sterling. Mr Patrick Fagan, the underwriter of syndicate 540/542, told the Neill committee that the 'ethos of the syndicates was to protect against the big US windstorm'. The syndicates were also hit by the failure of insurance companies with which they were reinsured. Sir Patrick found no evidence of dishonesty or fraudulence in Feltrim's affairs.</p>

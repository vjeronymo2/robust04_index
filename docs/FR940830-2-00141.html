One of the first networks to introduce point-of-sale debit was Iowa's Shazam. In 1985, California's major banks created Interlink, skipping the ATM stage altogether and going straight to POS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Now at least 25 networks offer POS, and the brand identity, single card bases, and machine-sharing these regional systems bring to the product are helping fuel its remarkable growth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is producing some notable success stories among the networks. The New Jersey-based NYCE network, whose POS program barely existed two years ago, is installing thousands of terminals a month in supermarkets and other retail locations. Result: a nearly 600% increase in monthly transactions in one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These 25 networks offering POS, along with Maestro, MasterCard's national POS brand, are ranked here by transaction volume for June 1993, with details on each system's transactions, terminals, switch fees, cards, and merchant concentration. Interlink, with its massive programs with such merchants as Lucky and Arco, ranks number one, dwarfing second-ranked Explore, another California network. NYCE's big growth was enough to boost the network into the number 10 spot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Look for network mergers to thin these ranks, leading to perhaps 10 or so super-regional systems by the end of the decade. Fewer brands covering more cards, terminals, and territory should mean accelerated growth for POS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [Page irreproducible.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu from the Tirana Court] </F>   [Text] The trial of the last 10 former leaders of  communist Albania resumed today with explanations by defendants  Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai. For details on this hearing,  let us follow our correspondent at the trial:    [Xhaxhiu] Today's hearing of the trial of 10 high  functionaries of the Albanian communist state opened with  explanations by the defendant Simon Stefani. The leadership of  the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] is the only unfortunate  leadership of all the Eastern communist countries to have such a  destiny and experience prison, the former number one at the  Interior Ministry stated in his explanations. The former  Politburo member did not neglect giving a further  philosophic-Marxist analysis of the political party system that  prevailed for decades on end in Albania, stressing that the  party decisions had to be carried out. I did not order the  dragging of dead bodies on the border, I did not order the  shooting of those who crossed the border, he said. Speaking  about other sections of the indictment, the defendant Stefani  rejected them and considered the indictment to be generally  erroneous and premeditated.    After theorizing about the impossibility of economic  equality  in socialism, the defendant explained further the practices that  he had found in place, the implementation of standing  regulations, and the efforts he had made in changing the  instructions on telephone checks and the opening of mail.    The trial continued later with explanations by defendant  Hekuran Isai, the other former interior minister. In his two  hours of explanations, Isai attacked the past and present left  and right wings, assessed the progressives in the bosom of the  Politburo, and considered the PPSh to be fatally broken in the  face of the hurricane of democratic youth. The defendant Isai,  too, did not fail to carry out an autopsy on the regime at the  pinnacle of which he had existed for many successive years.    Citing [Albanian patriot] Noli and [Albanian statesman]  Saidi, passing from Spartacus to Achilles, from Enver Hoxha to  Poland's [Communist Prime Minister] Rakowski, from a Kosovar  poet to the Spanish Gonzales, the defendant spoke at length  about social systems, the former PPSh Central Committee, the  functioning of the Secretariat, and the expenses of the red  group, which according to Isai's arithmetic, resulted in only 1  cent grabbed each year from the Albanian people.    The former deputy chairman of the infamous Eviction-Exile  Commission did not accept his role on this Commission. The post  of deputy chairman, he said, does not constitute an error, just  as the 118 decisions approved by him on the eviction and exile  of dozens of innocent families do not constitute errors. Isai  challenged the indictment with global figures.    The same stance was maintained in the previous hearing by  defendant Manush Myftiu, the chief of the Commission. According  to the Association of Former Convicted and Political Prisoners,  there approximately 60,000 persons were imprisoned or exiled  during the communist regime. The same association confirms that  about 700,000 were persecuted nationally during this period.  Nevertheless, on behalf of the defendants Isai and Myftiu, two  of the leading characters on this infamous Commission, no one  could dare to raise his voice against the existence of this  Dantesque commission.</p>

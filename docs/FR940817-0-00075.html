			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The opinion also focuses on the following statement in the final decision (58 FR 12648): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* There is no national supply and demand standard for the order program as a whole. This is not to say that a regulated market cannot rely on milk supplies from another area, as is often the case. Nevertheless, viewed on an individual market basis, we reaffirm our conclusion that milk supplies available for Class I and Class II uses are adequate, but not excessive in most markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above finding is in the first of three paragraphs that respond to an exception filed by the Upper Midwest Federal Order Coalition (UMFOC) that maintained the Secretary used too high a measure of what should be considered a reasonable reserve. The Secretary indicated that there was a range of views expressed concerning reserve supplies needed to serve Class I needs on a year-round basis. (58 FR 12646) When both Class I and Class II needs are considered, the Secretary indicated that this analysis of supply and demand for milk on the various markets and regions was valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the M&hyph;W is a measure of supply and demand factors throughout the country. However, there is no single national standard for determining how much reserve milk should be, or needs to be, associated with each marketing order. The amount of reserve milk varies among orders as a result of different circumstances that affect production and marketing practices and conditions. Some regions are affected more than others from year to year by variations in weather conditions that have an impact on milk production and reserve milk supplies. Also, some areas are more heavily involved in manufacturing than others. The amount of involvement has an impact on the amount of reserve milk that is historically associated with certain federal order markets relative to others. Moreover, since the blend price drives producers' production and marketing decisions, milk is shifted to alternative outlets and orders to take advantage of higher prices. This shifting of milk supplies impacts on the amount of reserve milk associated with different orders. Also, milk may be alternatively associated or disassociated from orders altogether depending on the blend price level of a federal milk order relative to returns from unregulated manufacturing plants. Consequently, Class III milk utilization is an important indicator of a market's performance and its ability to meet Class I needs. For these reasons, the Secretary's reliance on producer milk and Class III utilization is appropriate and automatically considers the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As detailed in the final decision, the supply-demand analysis conducted by the Secretary considered the level of Class III milk utilization relative to the established Class I price differential. Most markets appeared to have a relative balance between supply and demand, while some markets were deficit and others were surplus. On a system-wide basis considering all of the testimony from the hearing, comments, and exceptions, the Secretary properly determined that the current Class I differentials were meeting the statutorily described market performance measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The findings and determinations set forth herein have been issued in response to a memorandum opinion and order of the United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Fourth Division, issued on April 14, 1994. The findings and determinations supplement those that were previously set forth in the final decision issued on February 5, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 5, 1993, with respect to the New England and other Marketing Area orders. No additional regulatory changes are necessary as a result of this amplified decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1001, 1002, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1030, 1032, 1033, 1036, 1040, 1044, 1046, 1049, 1050, 1064, 1065, 1068, 1075, 1076, 1079, 1093, 1094, 1096, 1099, 1106, 1108, 1124, 1126, 1131, 1134, 1135, 1137, 1138, 1139  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mike Espy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19982 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Gillilan (Petitioner) has requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC): (1) Immediately impose a $25,000 per day fine on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) until all reprisal, intimidation, harassment and discrimination actions involving the Petitioner are settled to the Petitioner's satisfaction, and (2) appoint an independent arbitration board to review all past Department of Labor suits and EEO complaints filed against TVA concerning the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. Since this latter remedy is beyond the scope of the Commission's authority, it has been denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As basis for this relief, the Petitioner asserts that due to his reporting of safety concerns to the Commission, TVA management has subjected him to continuous intimidation, harassment, discrimination and reprisal actions, that his name has been placed on a blackball list that has been circulated nationwide preventing him from obtaining suitable employment outside of TVA and that this has affected his mental and physical health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred to the Director, Office of Enforcement. By letter dated April 7, 1994, the portion of the Petitioner's request that asked for immediate action has been denied. As provided by &sect;2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of April 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James Lieberman, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9365 Filed 4&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

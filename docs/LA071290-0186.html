			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BLASTS NEA, AWARDS $3 MILLION IN CITY FUNDS;  </P> <P> GRANTS: MORE THAN 200 LOCAL ARTISTS AND ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE STIPENDS FROM THE  CITY.  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley and City Councilman Joel Wachs on Wednesday announced more than  $3 million in 1990-91 grants through the Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts,  with $538,214 going to individual artists, $61,600 going to fledgling groups,  and more than $2.4 million divided among the city's established arts  organizations. This was the first full-year grant cycle in which traditionally  under-funded individual artists were eligible for city grants.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of these grants," said Wachs, who in 1988 lead the effort to  establish the multimillion-dollar arts fund, which is widely touted as a  "windfall" for the city's artists. "They represent the cultural pluralism . . .  and the widest range of viewpoints and beliefs which we originally envisioned  in proposing the L.A. Endowment for the Arts. The grants (demonstrate) our  recognition that artists have something to offer our city . . . and should be  valued and compensated for that."  </P> <P> After the City Hall press conference, the City Council unanimously and without  discussion approved the 203 grants which totaled $3,015,549. They ranged from  $125,000 to the L.A. Philharmonic Assn., to $1,000 to the emerging  Asian-American Literature organization.  </P> <P> The grants come in the midst of numerous cutbacks imposed citywide to make up a  projected $100-million deficit. Although the grants amount to $500,000 less  than the amount distributed in 1989-90, Wachs on Wednesday called the amount  "very healthy and substantial -- and only the beginning (of endowment  spending)."  </P> <P> The city's endowment is basically a trust fund which is operating on $5.8  million from the city's general fund. An additional $15 million or so is  expected to be raised from fees on municipal and private developments.  </P> <P> Both the grantees and the amounts of awards were determined by peer panels of  artists and arts administrators from each of the 11 discipline categories.  Grants were allocated in each discipline according to the application load and  the amounts requested. A total of 1,013 grant applications were received.  </P> <P> While the city's cultural affairs general manager, Adolfo Nodal, said he had  worried that the amounts awarded for the last batch of city grants were too  small and would not enable artists to complete their projects, he said he was  more comfortable with this list of grantees and did not expect problems.  </P> <P> "The tendency is still to spread the money around and fund more artists," Nodal  said, noting that the peer panels which recommended the grants were required to  fund at least one-half of the amount requested by grantees, or deny the grant.  "They were told they couldn't nickel-and-dime them, so I don't think it will be  a big problem. Nobody had a problem completing their project last time, and I  was worried then."  </P> <P> Grantees interviewed Wednesday were pleased by the amounts awarded.  </P> <P> "I'm really relieved," said performance artist Dan Kwong, who will put his  $5,630 grant toward four August performances of his "Secrets of the Samurai  Centerfielder" at East-West Players. "I knew that usually people do not get the  amount of money they'd requested anyway, and I had thought that (because of  city budget cuts) I might have gotten knocked down even more." Kwong had  applied for a little more than $7,000, but said he will be able to scale down  his budget to complete his performance.  </P> <P> A big winner in the grant announcement was September's Los Angeles Festival,  which will be directly or indirectly aided by more than 30 of the awards.  Included is $75,000 for production of the L.A. Festival proper, an additional  $14,000 for production of the connected Open Festival, and several awards to  co-presenters of programs included under festival auspices. Festival programs  receiving awards included $10,000 for a Chicano art exhibit at UCLA's Wight Art  Gallery, $30,000 toward the restoration of a mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros  and $2,500 for an Open Festival production of a multiethnic "Taming of the  Shrew" by Will's Players.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled," Festival executive director Judith Luther said of the grants,  noting that the festival had counted on receiving only $50,000 for its own  grant, one-third of the $150,000 it applied for.  </P> <P> 1990-'91 CULTURAL AFFAIRS DEPT.

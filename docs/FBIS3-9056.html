			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 17 (BTA) -- The Independent Public  Committee on National Problems met today to discuss the  predicament of Bulgarians living in the Western Outlands, a  territory awarded to Serbia under the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly.  The meeting was attended by representatives of the Democratic  Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. The Committee adopted a  declaration saying that the Bulgarian state is entitled and  obliged to take care of and protect Bulgarians outside Bulgaria,  to help them preserve their lifestyle, culture, language and  national identity. While showing the will for good-neighbourly  relations, the Bulgarian state authorities and the entire public  cannot pass over in silence certain facts related to  assimilation processes and human rights abuses in the Western  Outlands, the declaration says.    A Western Outlands National Fund was established to provide  material support for the promotion of the Bulgarian spirit and  identity in the area.    It is an alarming fact that the number of Bulgarians in that  area is diminishing, the public figures found. According to  official statistics, Bulgarians there numbered 63,000 in 1960,  and the 1991 figure was a mere 25,000. Migration motivated by  unemployment and misery is depopulating the area but, along with  that, carefully orchestrated processes unfold to eliminate the  national identity of Bulgarians there, the committee members  claim.    The Bulgarian language is not studied or is studied only  partially as a foreign language. Books and newspapers in the  mother tongue are not available, church services are not  conducted in Bulgarian, areas with an all-Bulgarian population  are administratively separated and joined to Serbian-populated  areas. Monuments of Bulgarian culture and history are demolished  or their national character is altered.    The Independent Committee insists that the state authorities  take the necessary action to establish a free trade area in the  Western Outlands and liberalize cross-border clearance to a  degree providing opportunities for free movement. According to  the Committee, the Bulgarian language must be studied in  compliance with the national minority status which the Bulgarian  population in the area enjoys, and Bulgarian teachers must be  sent there. The necessary action must also be taken to conduct  church services in Bulgarian and agree on unobstructed access of  Bulgarian books and newspapers and reception of Bulgarian radio  and TV programmes.</p>

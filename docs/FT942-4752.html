			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Germany German bond markets were inclined to take fright at yesterday's first-quarter growth figures. Their instinct may be right, even though the figures must be taken with a pinch of salt. The 2.1 per cent increase in output over the same quarter of last year falls to 1.6 per cent when account is taken of the extra working day in the 1994 period. It was also boosted by a weather-related increase in construction output which is unlikely to carry forward into the second quarter. Meanwhile, the underlying trend of personal consumption is weak. Despite the further fall in unemployment in May, the recovery has only just begun. It is far too early to worry about over-heating. Yet rising output gives the Bundesbank even less excuse to ignore the explosion in M3 money supply and cut official rates again. Nor, now that the dollar appears to have stabilised, is there pressure emanating from the exchange markets. Indeed the D-Mark has also recently fallen slightly against European currencies as bond investors have sought to exploit yield differentials with other markets. October's election and the prospect of tax increases next year are likely to keep consumption muted. There is a risk that high long-term interest rates will dampen the recovery too. That risk will be greater if money is sucked back into the US bond market once the Federal Reserve stops tightening. Then Europe will be left wondering how to cope with its own turn in rates.</p>

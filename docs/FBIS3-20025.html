He asserted that the crisis has begun to be  surmounted, but did not hazard dates for reflecting growth in  job creation. He condemned the leading opposition party's  stance as "defeatist," because it asserts that "we will not  emerge from the crisis because the government is incompetent.  This argument will turn against them when people realize that  we are emerging from the crisis." "We will emerge from the  crisis without the People's Party," the prime minister said.    Gonzalez described the situation by asserting that the  crisis  bottomed out a year ago, and now we have begun the upturn,  thanks especially to a number of very realistic economic  measures -- lowering of interest rates, a new peseta exchange  rate, combating the deficit -- which provide a more favorable  framework for investment, and hence for job creation. Gonzalez  made these statements during the interview he granted to Radio  Nacional 24 hours before his party held its congress, which is  intended precisely to give an impetus to the government policy  aimed at economic recovery.    On this issue, the prime minister adopted a very  down-to-earth approach, not expressing great expectations, but  demanding of society in general and his party in particular that  they understand the absolute value of competitiveness as the  sole springboard capable of ensuring not just economic recovery,  but the welfare state's very survival in the medium-term.    The Socialist leader also mentioned the importance of  structural measures, and emphasized the need to broaden the  country's production base, an aim to which the current labor  reform is geared. Gonzalez spoke emphatically in this part of  the interview, trying to be especially persuasive, aware of the  opposition to these changes, which was most forcefully expressed  in the 27 January strike.    In the opinion of Gonzalez, it is clear that unemployment  remains the country's main problem. In order to combat it, it  is necessary to "break down the barriers" impeding access to the  labor market and find new approaches to work. Broadening the  production base, having more people working, should make it  possible to "maintain solidarity programs," including pensions.  Gonzalez tried to reassure current pensioners by asserting that  they are guaranteed "a decent income." Nevertheless, he added  that a debate on possible ways to maintain these benefits in the  future should not be ruled out. To this end, he stressed, it is  necessary to ensure "growth" and "competitiveness" -- a word  which he repeated.    The prime minister maintained that thes debate on the future  of the welfare state should be governed by "seriousness" and  "responsibility," especially in a ruling party. Here there was a  very direct appeal to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  to renounce all dogmatism in the reformulation of Socialist  doctrine. The values to be defended are still, he argued,  freedom, solidarity, and social justice, embodied in services  such as the education and public health systems and pensions.  In order to embrace those principles and safeguard these  systems, however, it is necessary to act with "realism" and with  "imagination." Therefore, the PSOE "cannot undertake to do  something for which (the country) later cannot pay."    Spain needs, he also said, "lively enterprises," able to  compete on international markets. Our country needs to win the  "confidence" of investors and consumers daily, since it operates  in an open economy. This year, "tourism, the construction  industry, and the external sector will fare well." This  situation must be viewed without the People's Party's  "defeatism" and "alarmism," but with "concern" in the sense that  "we cannot set all the bells ringing."    In the opinion of Gonzalez, wages must not "soar," nor must  inflation be allowed to revive. He described as "wishful  thinking" the alternatives of the People's Party, which, in his  view, "is spinning yarns." He said he regrets that this is the  stance "of a party with possible government responsibilities,  because it has over 8 million votes."    On political dialogue, Gonzalez stressed that the dialogue  with Convergence and Union -- a force with which there is a  "fluid and serious" relationship, characteristics not shared,  however, by "the opinions some people express on this" -- is  going "quite well."    He also stated that he retains the "hope" that there will be  no blocking with respect to the democratic impetus -- filling  vacancies in institutional bodies. If this is not achieved,  however, the government will adopt "measures." Gonzalez  reiterated: "I am interested in the Spanish Government and  European building viewed from Spain," not in playing a leading  role in it from Brussels. He said in conclusion that he will  stay on "as long as the public puts up with me."</p>

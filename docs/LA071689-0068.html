			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL CLOSING LEAVES A VOID  </P> <P> UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young is a man of his word. He told me and other  representatives of the Friends of Fernald, in response to our entreaties to him  to reverse his February, 1986, decision to close the Fernald School, that if he  did not go forward with his decision to close the Fernald School, he could not  at a later time close the Corinne E. Seeds University Elementary School.  </P> <P> Chancellor Young is also a good student. He has learned from his Fernald  battle. The Friends of Fernald asked him to move the Fernald School to another  location, rather than to close it; but he insisted on sticking to his decision  to close the Fernald School. However, even though he won the war, the scars he  bears from the battles have led him to adopt a different strategy with respect  to UES.  </P> <P> Rather than follow his original plan of closing UES, he proposes to move it, an  alternative he denied to the Fernald School. The demise of the Fernald School  has left an unfilled void in the community's ability to service the needs of  children with learning disabilities. If UES is to be moved, UCLA should revive  the Fernald School and move it also.  </P> <P> HAROLD FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Collor renews offensive to clear name PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil has again tried to regain the political initiative by denying allegations that he knew of corruption within his government, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. 'The time has come to say enough. The people will not stand for the lies, the falsehoods that have found shelter in the organs of the press,' Mr Collor said in a Sunday night television broadcast. Allegations of extortion and other wrongdoing by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a businessman who was Mr Collor's campaign treasurer, originated with the president's brother, Mr Pedro Collor, and triggered a row within the Collor family. A parliamentary panel was set up to investigate the claims. The local press has given much space to allegations by former officials who have yet to testify before the panel. The magazine Veja reported at the weekend statements by Mr Renan Calheiros, former head of the parliamentary delegation for Mr Collor's National Renovation party (PRN), who said, among other things, that he had informed the president about alleged corruption in the government.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (7): EBRD deal reflects institutions' confidence - Big UK investors are flooding back to the office market / London THE SEA-CHANGE in sentiment towards property in little over a year is astonishing. During the dark days of recession, it appeared that only overseas investors were bold enough to keep the market ticking over. There remained strong demand from Germany, the Far East and the Middle East, in particular. But since sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, UK institutional investors have flooded back into the London office market with almost reckless abandon. Falling yields on long bonds have made property yields appear increasingly attractive. The strength of the market was signalled last month by Deutsche Grundbesitz Investmentgesellschaft's purchase of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's headquarters in the Broadgate complex for Pounds 170m. The sale of the building, which contained 360,000 sq ft of office accommodation and 12 retail units, was probably the biggest single property transaction in London for more than two years. UK fund managers, though, have accounted for about two thirds of City investment activity this year, spending some Pounds 171m in the third quarter. Typical of the pattern of recent deals was Scottish Amicable's purchase of Woolgate House for Pounds 87m on an initial yield of about 8.5 per cent. The 266,000 sq ft property is let to Chase Manhattan Bank for at least another 17 years. UK property companies, which have been active raising about Pounds 1.4bn in fresh funds from shareholders, have been elbowed aside in the rush to secure good-quality properties. But many UK property companies argue they are already overweight in central London, and are keen to diversify into retail and provincial markets. One of the more innovative attempts to secure London properties was Postel's restructuring proposals for the property developer Greycoat, which ran into serious financial difficulties during the recession. Postel was clearly attracted by the prospect of acquiring developments at a knock-down price, although its proposals were eventually voted down by the company's preference shareholders. Postel has had to dream up ingenious ways of investing in the sector because of the dearth of investment grade property on the London market. Not surprisingly, property owners have been reluctant to sell while yields are still tumbling. This has led some investors to widen their spectrum of interest and look at secondary locations. 'In central London, people are prepared to accept a shorter lease of perhaps 10 years or less and are having to compromise on some of their ideals to secure a purchase,' says Mr David Hutchings, head of investment research at Healey &amp; Baker, the real estate consultants. 'There are even murmurings that the development market may begin to recover.' Apart from the investment interest in property, there has been a gradual revival in the occupational market too. 'A lot of occupiers who have held their fire over the past couple of years are beginning to move, because they believe the market has reached the bottom. They know they are unlikely to get a better deal in six months time, and supply has been falling steadily over the past six to 12 months,' says Mr Michael Soames, head of London Agency at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The amount of vacant space in the City is now beginning to fall sharply. In the early 1990s, there was about 20m sq ft of vacant property in the City. By the end of the third quarter of this year the availability levels had fallen to 12.35m sq ft, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The IRA bomb, which devastated the City in April, damaging 30 buildings containing 2.5m sq ft of space, undoubtedly had a big impact on take-up levels. But even excluding this factor, there has been a steady pick-up in transactions. A similar picture holds true for the West End. There has been a healthy demand for well located freehold properties, although investment activity has remained weak because of restricted supply of suitable properties. Tenants are becoming more active, and Richard Ellis, the property consultants, recorded a 20 per cent fall in the availability of West End offices in the first half of the year. Rental declines have also begun to slow showing a 3 per cent fall in the core Mayfair and St James's districts over the same period. The Docklands market, however, has remained quiet, as worries about whether the Jubilee line underground extension would be completed has deterred new tenants. Lettings have remained at a low level and there is still some 4.9m sq ft of space available. But confidence appears to be gathering strength now that the transport project has been approved. As the substantial overhang of property in London is gradually absorbed, the balance of power will gradually revert to the owners and the need to provide new tenants with incentives, such as rent-free periods, will diminish. It is perhaps even possible to foresee the day when headline rents will rise. But doubts remain and whether rents will rebound strongly enough to justify the prices currently being paid for some properties is open to question. The implied yields on some City properties may have dropped to as low as 5 per cent, leaving precious little margin for error. As Mr Soames, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, says: 'Most of the properties investors are buying are over-let, meaning the rent being paid is way in excess of the market rent. The main reason for buying property, namely income growth, is not even there at the moment, and may well not be for the next 10 to 15 years.' The property sector may, therefore, remain vulnerable until it becomes clear that rents really are on the upward track, holding out the promise of income growth. In the meantime, any rise in interest rates and a backing up of bond yields would deliver a nasty jolt to confidence. Re-emerging investors would also have occasion to worry if economic recovery remained anaemic and occupier demand showed few signs of improvement. After the first investment flush, investors may be in for an anxious wait to see whether their enthusiasm is justified.</p>

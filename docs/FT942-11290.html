			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Cadbury comes to fore at Premier Brands Roger Cadbury, 56, has been appointed chairman of Premier Brands, the Hillsdown Holdings subsidiary. He replaces Bart Constandse, who stands down on June 1. Constandse will also be resigning as a director of Hillsdown - after being with the group for 4 1/2 years - on July 1. The post of Premier Brands chairman incorporates the European biscuits and beverages division of the group. Cadbury has considerable experience of the food and beverage business, having worked for Beecham, General Foods and Whitworth Holdings. He was promoted from being sales director of General Foods to deputy managing director in 1984, moving up to managing director in 1987. He joined Whitworth Holdings as group managing director in January 1990. Although a member of the well-known Cadbury family - as second cousin of Dominic and Sir Adrian Cadbury, his great-grandfather was their grandfather  -he has never worked for the Cadbury businesses. Ironically, however, thanks to a management buy-out which gave birth to Premier Brands, he will now have responsibility for some famous biscuit brands carrying the Cadbury name. Hillsdown restructured its subsidiaries into four European divisions some 18 months ago. Of the many familiar beverage brands included in his new portfolio, Typhoo Tea and Bournvita are perhaps the most well-established. Cadbury will be reporting to David Newton, Hillsdown's chief executive. Constandse will be returning to his native country, Holland, to pursue his business career.</p>

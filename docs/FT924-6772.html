			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toyota and bank named as takers in Indonesia's Astra ASTRA International, Indonesia's dominant automotive company, yesterday announced the identity of the two buyers of 40m shares sold last Friday for Rp400bn (Dollars 191m) by the Soeryadjaya family, its majority shareholder. The shares, 16.5 per cent of issued shares, were sold in two 20m blocks to the pension fund of state-owned Bank Dagang Negara (BDN) and to Newark of Hong Kong. Astra officials said Newark, the ownership of which was not disclosed, is acting as a nominee for its shares, which are being held in an escrow account while negotiations with a foreign purchaser are finalised. Toyota of Japan, whose vehicles Astra assembles and distributes in Indonesia, is the preferred buyer and has agreed in principle to take 20m shares, Astra said. Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, Astra chairman, said the Soeryadjaya family still held a 54 per cent stake in the company but 'they'll probably lose the majority control'. The Soeryadjayas have been compelled to raise finance for their privately-owned Bank Summa, which was suspended from clearing operations by Bank Indonesia, the Indonesian central bank, last week with bad debts of over Rp1,000bn. Bankers say the Soeryadjaya family may have pledged much of their remaining Astra stake against loans. The announcement that BDN Group pension fund has taken 20m Astra shares could cause a rift within the Indonesian government over the use of state funds and institutions in aiding Bank Summa. One senior government official has privately argued against any state-related pension fund buying shares from the Soeryadjayas. This would 'indirectly (be) bailing out Bank Summa. We don't want to create a precedent here,' he explained. Executives of 17 private banks, which are forming a consortium to take over Bank Summa's small-scale depositors, also privately protest they are doing so only under pressure from Bank Indo-nesia. Most members of the consortium, which is raising over Rp150bn, have yet to see Bank Summa's books. As one broker explained: 'The banks are blindly signing cheques, and they don't like it.'</p>

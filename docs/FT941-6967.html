			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (19): A new line in charges that made rivals head for the exit - John Authers spotlights Fidelity, and a novel marketing concept, launched at a difficult time but since copied by other investment groups Fidelity, the American unit trust giant, appears to have established that companies in the Pep market can compete on price. In 1992, it became the first unit trust group to introduce tapered exit charges on its Peps. The initial charge was cut to only 2 per cent, but exit charges would also be payable when investors wanted to realise their Pep. If they surrendered the Pep within a year, they would need to pay an extra 3 per cent. But savers who held on for more than three years would need to pay nothing at all. Journalists and advisers found it difficult to criticise this arrangement, as Peps are medium- to long-term investments, and it would be difficult ever to recommend taking out a Pep without holding on to it for at least three years. Fidelity was offering prudent investors a genuine reduction in price, and, it said, was also trying to demonstrate that Peps as a product were good value for money. Not surprisingly, it caught on. Exit charges have now been introduced by such industry leaders as M&amp;G and Gartmore. But Fidelity has benefited the most. As astute observers noted at the time, its fortunes were not great in 1992. The company had lost market share in Peps, from 4.4 per cent of the market in the 1990-91 tax year to 2.2 per cent in 1991-92. Also, its excellent investment performance - which allowed Fidelity to establish itself in the UK and become one of the top five players within a decade  - had gone distinctly off the boil. Its Special Situations trust, at one point a leader, languished in 108th place out of 125 over the previous three years. Mr John Spiers, an analyst with BESt Investment, chimed with much thought in the industry when he said: 'Clearly, Fidelity felt it had to do something dramatic.' Since then, Fidelity's Pep sales, if not 'dramatic', have shown an impressive strength. From Pounds 55m in the 1991-92 tax year, they rose to Pounds 110m in 1992-93, and the company claims that month-by-month sales so far this year have doubled again. However, Fidelity disputes that the price change was critical. The company's traditionally aggressive fund management style was about to pay dividends, as 'Black Wednesday' - the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism - was in the offing. Over the two years to the beginning of 1994, Hardwick Stafford Wright figures show that Fidelity Special Situations rose by 72.5 per cent - fourth in its sector of 132, and just behind the similarly aggressive Fidelity Recovery fund. This suggested a return to the fund management success which has been the group's bedrock in the US, where whole magazines are devoted to advice on how to trade in different Fidelity funds. Slick American marketing has also helped. Fidelity has steadily introduced new products to fill different niches in the market, and this month sees the launch of another new trust - the UK Dividend Growth Fund - which will be aimed at those intending to retire within 10 to 15 years. The trust is linked to the Retirement Income Builder Pep, which carries the now standard Fidelity entrance and exit charges. Fidelity is also launching a new Pep for its fund of funds, which invests solely in other Fidelity unit trusts, to bring its total Pep range to 12. These are: UK Growth, Special Situations, Recovery, Growth &amp; Income, Income Plus, High Income, European, European Income, European Opportunities, and the International Pep. A further Pep, based on a trust investing in global privatisations, is in the pipeline. On top of these, the company also offers a single-company Pep, for those who want to invest an extra Pounds 3,000 each year. Savings schemes, from a minimum of Pounds 50 a month, are also available. Management charges are in line with industry averages, ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 per cent. Mr Barry Bateman, managing director of Fidelity Investments, and chairman of the Unit Trust Association (now the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds) from 1991 to 1993, said that sales had also been helped by the low interest rates which followed Black Wednesday. Fidelity has built a range of supporting products, such as the cash unit trusts, which provide an innovative range of services. However, it will need to stay competitive. M&amp;G, the doyen of the unit trust industry, now undercuts it on price, albeit for only one fund, and others have equalled it. Bateman is aware, following 1992, that the company must continue to produce impressive fund management figures if it is to maintain its strong position. He said: 'There's a tendency for people to buy our most aggressive funds. One thing we haven't done as successfully as I would have liked is to have promoted our blue chip funds.'</p>

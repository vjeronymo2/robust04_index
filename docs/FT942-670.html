			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Budgie provides lift as Sleepy Kids hits Pounds 0.26m Pre-tax profits at Sleepy Kids, the children's animation and merchandising company, soared from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 263,000 at the interim stage, on the back of continued demand for Budgie the Little Helicopter. However, the share price fell 12p to 69p yesterday after running-up ahead of the figures. Turnover rose from Pounds 127,000 to Pounds 621,000 in the half year to April 30. The company continued its no-dividend policy, in place since it gained its USM quotation in 1990, although Mr Martin Powell, chairman, said it would recommend a payment once 'a trading pattern becomes more firmly established'. Earnings per share rose to 0.87p (0.01p). The company, which owns the worldwide rights to animate and merchandise Budgie, a character launched in four books written by the Duchess of York, has also won a further 17 merchandise licensing agreements bringing the total to 58 - 36 of which are held by UK companies. Mr Powell said a second animation series based on the character had been commissioned by ITV Network Centre and was due to be broadcast early next year. Cost of production would be in the region of Pounds 1m, of which Sleepy Kids would provide Pounds 700,000. The first series was launched on ITV in early January and is due to be broadcast in Australia, France and South Africa later this year.</p>

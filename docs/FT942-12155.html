			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Sport: Expensive horses for the big courses - Eventing Ginny Elliot (formerly Leng) was pessimistic about Badminton even before minor injuries to her two entries, Welton Houdini and Romance, forced her to pull out of next weekend's competition. Since the withdrawal of her sponsor, Citibank, Elliot's chances of a fourth Badminton win were already tinged with financial worries. 'I'm very close to having to sell one of my top horses,' she said. She has always managed to avoid this crisis, but other top riders such as Mark Todd and Ian Stark have already found it the only way to meet their competition overheads. Mary Thomson, winner of the 1992 Badminton horse trials on King William, is another international eventer with money worries. Gill Robinson, her personal patron is pulling out for business reasons. One of Thomson's seven eventers, probably King Basil, may soon be on the market. 'There are very few riders this season with major sponsors,' said Thomson. 'A couple of years ago companies were willing to underwrite a string of horses.' Recession, said Thomson, made them withdraw. However, since it may take four or five years to bring on a top horse, the competitors are committed to the quality animals they took on in better times. Vicki Latta, the New Zealand lawyer who uses her legal work to fund herself as an amateur at the top of the European tree, has also reached the end of the financial road. 'Most of my assets, except the horses, have been sold,' said Latta. Her magnificent gelding, Chief, won a record Pounds 13,000 in eventing prize money during the 1992 season, which probably just about paid his running costs. In contrast, the renowned showjumper Milton has several times won more than Pounds 250,000 in a season. Sentiment is not the principal barrier to a rider selling a top horse. Cross country courses are dangerous places. Deaths (human and equine) at the big fences have increased. Horse and rider need years to build the mutual confidence needed to tackle tracks such as Burleigh and Badminton. One can sell the horse but not that relationship. Hence the small market in outstanding eventers. When they are sold for serious money it is usually to countries such as Italy and Spain, where prestige is a considerable factor in any purchase. Yet horse trials have never been more popular with both competitors and the public. A British stately home is hardly worth the label these days without a three-day-event in the park. Upwards of 250,000 spectators are expected for the four days of Badminton. While the bulk of the audience will line the 4.25 miles and 29 fences of Saturday's cross-country course, dressage is proving increasingly popular and attracting large, enthusiastic crowds on Thursday and Friday. Although the total prize fund of Pounds 20,000, put up by Mitsubishi, sponsors of Badminton, is the biggest in the sport, it seems tiny in relation to the size of the event and the cost of participation. 'People are more turned on by sport when there is really big prize money involved,' said Elliot. 'It creates hype and media interest, which in turn pulls in the backers we need to keep going.' At one-day events, the grass roots of the sport, stars such as Thomson and Elliot win their personal spurs and train their novice horses. Entry lists which used to be a dozen or so are closer to a hundred. But much of the commercial infrastructure remains in the past. 'I went to an event in Buckinghamshire last week,' said Thomson. 'I paid two entry fees of Pounds 27 and Pounds 5 and then won quite a big section with a prize of Pounds 32.' If Thomson had not had her massive horsebox sponsored, then just the trip to the competition would have left her hugely out of pocket. These are not isolated problems suffered by a few stars. In the bars and stable yards at Badminton, this will be the main topic of conversation among the competitors. The final stage of any three-day event is the showjumping section. In private, few event-riders have much time for the Hollywood world of indoor jumping, yet financially it goes from strength to strength, bolstered by interest in continental Europe. It may be that with its background of cavalry training and foxhunting, the world of horse trials is too idiosyncratic to fit into the modern corporate milieu.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEY, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FAMOUS FOR REAL REASONS TOO  </P> <P> In the article, "Famous for Being Famous" (View, Sept. 12, by Nikki Finke),  there was passing reference to Charles Nelson Reilly as being a PFBFer (People  Famous for Being Famous).  </P> <P> Let me, for the record, say that, besides his occasional appearances on  "Hollywood Squares," Reilly is a talented and accomplished director. His  credits include: "The Belle of Amherst," which won Julie Harris her fifth and  record-breaking Tony Award for Best Actress in a Broadway play; several other  plays starring Harris; and the recent critically acclaimed "At Wit's End" by  Joel Kimmel and starring Stan Freeman. In addition, Reilly teaches and directs  at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Fla.  </P> <P> Perhaps Reilly is famous for reasons other than these, but surely his talents  far surpass getting into the tabloids weekly or having annual face-lifts. I  think his fame justifiably comes from his raucous and genuine ability to make  people laugh.  </P> <P> ALAN TOY, Santa Monica  </P></p>

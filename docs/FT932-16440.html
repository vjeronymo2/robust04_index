			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: The City takes stock / A look at the benefits of electronic trade confirmation The collapse of Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's planned paperless settlement system, has forced UK financial institutions to think again about the future of their operations for the confirmation and settlement of securities trading. One likely recipient of the resources freed by Taurus's demise is electronic trade confirmation (ETC), an automated screen-based process designed to shorten the time taken to confirm equity or fixed-income trades between brokers and institutions. The main advantage offered by ETC to the user is the reduction in the number of failed trades which can often turn into expensive errors for the parties involved. Furthermore, ETC eliminates the need for confirmation faxes or telexes, which in turn should lead to a streamlining in back office staff. The introduction of ETC into the UK came about following an industry user group (IUG) initiative in December 1991, led by Fidelity, the Boston-based fund management group. But although many institutions were quick to acknowledge the advantages of the system, only a few have decided to install one of the three ETC systems which are now running. The main reason offered by institutions for not giving ETC a higher priority was that many of them had already invested a considerable amount of money adapting their back office technology to the eventual start-up of Taurus. These institutions have been forced to return to the drawing board. One of them is the Prudential, the UK's leading life insurance and financial services company and a big investor in financial markets in the UK and abroad. 'Taurus was our number one priority for 1993 but we are now re-evaluating our priorities. ETC is on this list,' says David Hanson, the administration director of Prudential Portfolio Managers. The wider use of ETC is also the main objective of the IUG's new chairman, John Lambert, director of operations at Schroders Investment Management. 'We have got to push much wider geographically - outside the UK - as well as go deeper within the UK,' he says. He adds that the prospect of a three-day rolling share settlement in the UK, as opposed to the current 14-day account system, means that ETC should also be considered by smaller financial institutions. Some of them still rely on brokers sending them contract notes in the post. 'Speed will be of the essence when rolling settlement is introduced,' says Lambert. The collapse of Taurus has, if anything, brought rolling settlement much closer: it is being accorded a higher priority than before, with many in the City urging its introduction this year. Meanwhile, the three vendors selected by the IUG to build and sell ETC systems have all gone live. Institutions can choose from Trax, sold by the International Securities Market Association, the Stock Exchange's Sequal system, or Thomson Financial Services' Oasys Global system. These systems allow users to confirm trades within the UK and across continental Europe. Oasys also provides ETC with Mexico and plans to have a base in Sydney in the third quarter to provide ETC in the Asia Pacific region. So far, the response from users has been positive. John Bevan, transaction support supervisor at Fidelity, says that since January, when Fidelity started putting details of trades through Oasys, the main advantage has been the reduced risk of failed trades. 'It has made life easier but the main benefit will come when more people are involved,' says Bevan. At present, the three ETC systems operate independently, but there is an agreement in principle between the vendors to set up interfaces so that users do not have to subscribe to all three systems in order to confirm trades with each other. However, progress on the links has been hampered by discussions about who will bear the cost of the development of the links and how the charges for using the links will be allocated among the vendors. The links are not expected to be in operation before the end of this year. Lambert is keen to press ahead with the links which he believes are necessary for the success of ETC. For example, the existence of links would benefit brokers in particular since they have had to install several systems in order to communicate with different clients. For now, the use of ETC is mainly between brokers or brokers and institutions but it would appear logical that the same trade details already stored in an ETC system could then be sent on by the institution to its custodian bank with payment and delivery instructions. There has been an initiative to introduce such a system in Europe, known as ISITC, since the end of last year. A similar system is already in use between institutions and custodians in the US. However, this stage of automation may take time before it is widely accepted, mainly because UK institutions may be reluctant to surrender their long-standing links with their custodian banks.</p>

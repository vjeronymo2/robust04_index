			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / German Elections: Berlin's communist legacy still strong Berliners, attracted out by the sunshine, strolled along Unter den Linden, the old city's main street, and through the Brandenburg Gate towards the Tiergarten, the huge central park. Teenagers played football by the side of the Reichstag, the Prussian parliament which Hitler had tried to burn down and which will be the new home of the Bundestag's (lower house of parliament) when the government moves to the capital. 'This is really an important day,' said 71-year-old Mrs Hilda R, who declined to give her full family name. 'I've lived all my life in the eastern part of the city. Through good times and bad. I voted against that Hitler. And I am going to vote for the PDS (the party of Democratic Socialism, heirs to east Germany's former commu nist party) today.' She said her husband would vote for the PDS as well, even though both admitted they had since unification received generous pensions from Mr Helmut Kohl. 'Don't get me wrong. I was never in the east German Communist party. It's just that the PDS are local east Berliners.' Ms Barbara Jahn lives in Prenzlauer Berg, east Berlin, one of the three seats the PDS was trying desperately to win to ensure it would be represented in the Bundestag, or Lower House. The constituency, home to many of east Berlin's intellectuals, boasts long, tree-lined streets and turn-of-the-century houses, whose elegance has given way to neglect and disrepair. It is also home to the PDS's candidate, Mr Stefan Heym, the 81-year-old writer and one of east Germany's best-known authors during the communist period. 'I was so excited,' said Ms Jahn, a 20-year-old computer programmer trainee. 'This was my first time to vote in a federal election. I voted for the PDS, and I gave both my votes to them.' Scores of young and old people walked along the tree-lined Knackstrasse on their way to vote in the local school. 'I gave my first vote for the PDS and the second for the Greens,' said Mr Robert Schwarz, a 43-year-old bank official. His wife looked at him, with a slightly disapproving frown. 'I voted for the SPD. No buts here. Wolfgang Thierse (the SPD's candidate) is a good man,' said Mrs Schwarz. The pensioners, however, appeared divided. 'Helmut Kohl has been good to me,' said Mr Wilhelm Klein. 'I am 56 years old. I went into pension early. Kohl has given me a good income. I can't rely on the SPD to be so generous. As for the PDS, forget it.' His wife shook her head. 'I voted for the PDS,' she said. Beyond the other side of the Tiergarten, along Nollendorf Platz in the western part of the city, many young people had only contempt for the PDS. Sipping their coffee outside one of the several cafes on Maassenstrasse, they were trying to decide whether to use their two votes for the SPD, or at least one for the Greens. 'We have to get Kohl out, and keep the communists out as well,' said Andreas, a waiter. 'I want a change. But (Rudolf) Scharping (leader of the SPD) is so boring. What can I do? I am not convinced the SPD will make it.' Gaby Beyer agreed. 'I can't understand why those east Berliners were voting for the PDS. And we paid all that extra tax for unification] Huh. If the SPD wins, we'll have to pay more tax. But what can I do? I always voted SPD. Maybe I'll switch to the Greens.'</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN'S CRITICS TAKE TURNS  </P> <P> After reading "Her Turn" I feel compelled to point out a discrepancy in Mrs.  Reagan's account of why she wrote her memoirs. She cites her sake, her  children's sake and history's sake as reasons for writing her book.  Conspicuously absent is Mrs. Reagan's bank account's need for the book.  </P> <P> "Too much is going on right now" for Nancy to get involved in a drug center.  Too busy ringing up her cash register, I guess. "Just Say No" kind of died  after Reagan left office, but then again, most drug treatment centers are  nonprofit, aren't they?  </P> <P> A free house in Beverly Hills, $2 million to go to Japan and five-figure  speaking fees. Who's kidding who? With her "Just Say No" program, Nancy Reagan  expected ghetto children to work for minimum wage rather than make hundreds of  dollars a day selling crack on the street. She doesn't seem to realize that she  and these children have two things in common: greed and a lack of moral  conscience.  </P> <P> MICHAEL P. QUIRK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

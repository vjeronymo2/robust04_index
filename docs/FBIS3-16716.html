Fuad Akhundov, a presidential spokesman contacted by AFP,  said that the explosion was caused by a delayed-action bomb.    The blast ripped through two coaches of a train in the  January 20 subway station, the Azerbaijani news agency  ASSA-IRADA said. First the head wagon, then the second  exploded, both being engulfed by fire, it said.    "According to all probabilities, it was the Armenians,"  Akhundov said.    Azerbaijani troops have been fighting a six-year war against  Armenian separatists from Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory  populated mostly by Armenians but controlled by Baku.    More than 20,000 people have been killed in the fighting  since 1988 and the Armenians were widely seen in Baku as likely  perpetrators of any bombing.    However, no explosive device had been discovered by Saturday  evening to back the bomb thesis.    A local journalist reached by phone said that about 100  wounded people were evacuated from the station which was closed  by police shortly after the blast.    Tensions have been running high in Baku, the Azerbaijani  capital, in recent weeks after security forces began a crackdown  against opposition forces supporting exiled former president  Abulfaz Elchibey.    Several members of the Popular Front headed by Elchibey have  been arrested and police have staged raids on the headquarters  of the opposition party.    After the blast Saturday, Azerbaijani President Geydar  Aliyev  called an emergency meeting of internal security officials, but  the outcome of the meeting was not immediately known.    The explosion occurred around 1:00 p.m. (0800 GMT) in the  subway station located in the northern district of the city and  named "January 20" after the 1990 crackdown in Azerbaijan by  Soviet troops.    At least 170 people died in the crackdown ordered by Moscow  to quash weeks of violence between Armenians and Azeris in the  northern suburb of Sumgait.    A diplomat in Baku said the number of casualties was  probably  increased by the fact that people were out in force to go  shopping ahead of the new year celebrations Monday (as  calculated by the old, pre-Islamic calendar).    Another explosion took place a month ago on a train coming  into Azerbaijan from Russia, without causing any casualties.  Responsibility for the explosion was not established.</p>

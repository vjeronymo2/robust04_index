			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SUIT FILED AGAINST FORMER MAYOR KELLY  </P> <P> City Council candidate and former Mayor Jack Kelly has failed to pay $23,615  owed to the previous owners of his weekly newspaper, according to a lawsuit  filed Friday.  </P> <P> In the suit, filed in West Orange Municipal Court, Jeff Brown and Allison Okada  claim that Kelly agreed to purchase their majority interest in the Huntington  Beach News for $20,000 last year, has been publisher since then, but has never  paid.  </P> <P> The suit says Kelly was under contract to pay them the full amount by last  August, a year after he took over the 86-year-old publication.  </P> <P> Kelly, who for six weeks this year discontinued publishing the paper because of  financial difficulties, acknowledged that he has not paid anything for the  transfer of ownership.  </P> <P> But Kelly said that Brown and Okada's 65% stock shares in the newspaper were  never officially transferred to him, because state permits required to complete  the transaction were never filed.  </P> <P> Brown agreed that those documents were never completed, but the suit charges  that Kelly agreed in a contract with the plaintiffs to submit the necessary  permits to finalize the transaction. Kelly dismissed that allegation as  "ridiculous."  </P> <P> "It was an illegal transaction. . . . I don't own any part" of the Huntington  Beach News, Kelly said, although one of his campaign brochures advertises that  he recently acquired the publication.  </P> <P> Considering that the suit was filed four days before the two-time former  councilman will again seek election, Kelly said he believes the action against  him may have been prompted by one or several of his opponents.  </P> <P> Brown said he wanted to file the case before Tuesday's election to solve the  matter before Kelly takes office, assuming he wins his bid for one of four  contested council seats.  </P> <P> "Before he goes off and does something else, we'd like to see him take care of  this," Brown said.  </P> <P> The suit also seeks $3,614 from Kelly for a debt the newspaper has incurred  since he took over its operations. Brown said that a bank has been seeking  repayment from him and Okada because they remain the legal owners of the  publication. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Westminster plan could end 'eyesore' Plans to relocate 3,000 civil servants from the central London headquarters of the Departments of Environment and Transport - and transform the Westminster skyline in the process - were put forward yesterday. Sir George Young, housing minister, announced that an outline planning application to demolish three 21-storey tower blocks in Marsham Street had been made. The application to Westminster city council for a development of offices, shops, houses and parking spaces was made through Property Holdings, a government agency. Demolition will not take place until at least 1997. Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, announced two years ago that the building, whose three towers loom above the Houses of Parliament, was so badly designed that demolition was the only solution. Marsham Street has been described as the ugliest building in London. It was suggested at that time that the workers at the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Transport would move to new offices in Docklands. It now seems that they will be relocated to other sites in Westminster. Sir George Young said yesterday that the maximum height of any new buildings would be half that of the existing buildings. He said: 'The magnificent silhouette of the Houses of Parliament will be restored.' The outline planning application envisages 690,000 sq ft of offices, 175,000 sq ft of houses and 30,000 sq ft of shops and restaurants. The site is valued at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m, but it is not clear whether the government will develop it or sell it to private developers. Sir George said: 'The government will be staying on the site for another two years and will then take a judgment as to whether it needs the site. If so, we will develop it ourselves, if not, we will dispose of it on the open market at the time.'</p>

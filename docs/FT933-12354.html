			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: State fund switches slice of DnB debt to shares NORWAY'S Bank Insurance Fund is to convert NKr3.5bn (Dollars 479.5m) in preference capital in Den norske Bank, the country's biggest bank, to 350m shares. DnB's shares closed down sharply on the Oslo bourse following yesterday's unexpected news. The bank's ordinary A shares shed NKr2.90 to NKr14.60 and non-voting 'free' shares plunged NKr4 to NKr19. Analysts said the shares could come under heavy pressure next week, at least until the BIF clarifies when it plans to exercise the option for the conversion and stipulates how many shares it will retain and how many it intends to sell. DnB said its current share capital was NKr2.37bn, of which the BIF holds 69 per cent. The remaining shares are spread among 6,000 private shareholders. Last autumn the finance ministry announced the government intended to re-privatise Christiania Bank (CBK), the second biggest bank, and indicated it would dispose of a portion of its DnB stake. However, analysts had not expected to see the move until next year.</p>

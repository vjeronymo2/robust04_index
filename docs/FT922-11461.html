			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown plans Canadian growth Maple Leaf Foods, Hillsdown Holdings' Canadian subsidiary, is laying the groundwork for a large expansion in the North American baking industry by offering to buy out minority shareholders in Corporate Foods, Canada's biggest baking group. Maple Leaf, which already owns 66 per cent of Corporate Foods, has proposed paying 1.15 shares for each remaining CF share. At Maple Leaf's current share price of CDollars 17.25, the deal is worth a total of CDollars 127m (Pounds 60m). CF has appointed a committee of its board to study the proposal. Mr Lewis Rose, Maple Leaf's chief financial officer, said the merger would provide extra flexibility for expansion, including acquisitions or joint ventures in the US. The buy-out of the minority shareholders will lower Hillsdown's stake in Maple Leaf from 56 per cent to 51 per cent. However, Mr Charles Bowen, Maple Leaf's president, said Hillsdown intended to buy enough shares to restore its ownership position.</p>

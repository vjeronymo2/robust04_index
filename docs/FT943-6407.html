			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Fletcher Challenge - Other Companies The New Zealand energy, construction and forestry group is expected to announce on Thursday a trading profit, before consolidation, of around NZDollars 165m (Dollars 97m) for the year to June 30, about half of last year's level. But a string of asset sales, including its methanol interests, are expected to lead to abnormal profits of around NZDollars 400m. The company has enjoyed a strong turnaround in earnings from pulp and paper in recent months. Most analysts are predicting a strong profit recovery in the present financial year. The company's energy division and building supplies interests are expected to have performed well over the past year.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Downturn in earnings at Uni Storebrand Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurer, yesterday published weaker than expected first-quarter results, and announced the surprise departure of its chief executive. The departure of Mr Per Terje Vold, who had led a one-year turnround of the group, was only one of a series of moves revealed. Uni also disclosed that it had signed a letter of intent with a foreign investor to dispose of Christiania Re Corporation, the group's US subsidiary, but refused to give details. The group also announced plans for a one-for-14 rights issue for restricted and free shareholders, priced at NKr12.25 a share to raise NKr307.4m during a subscription period from May 25 to June 7. Uni said Mr Aage Korsvold, vice-chairman of the board, is to replace Mr Vold from July 1. Mr Korsvold also holds a key position within the group's strategic operations. The company said Mr Vold had successfully led Uni's restructuring following the group's release from a board appointed by the government. This followed Uni's collapse after a failed raid launched two years ago on Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. 'The group's results for 1993 were good and the company is well on its way with a strategic process for a further positioning in the market,' Uni said. Mr Jon Gundersen, board chairman, said he was looking forward to the fresh approach that Mr Korsvold would bring in addressing the challenges facing Uni, including the growing domestic savings market which has been chosen as a central area for group expansion. Mr Vold had been asked to remain with Uni and his position would be clarified shortly, the company said. Uni reported a decline in first-quarter operating profit, before policyholders' allocations, to NKr998m (Dollars 139m) from NKr1.03bn. It blamed higher interest rates which produced lower financial income. Group net operating income rose to NKr7.07bn from NKr6.38bn as operating costs increased to NKr5.56bn from NKr4.82bn. Pre-tax profit, after allocations to policyholders, fell to NKr84m from NKr150m.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PROFESSOR DENIES ABUSE CHARGE  </P> <P> A University of Maryland nuclear engineering professor today denied allegations  that he sexually abused his daughter for more than 16 years.  </P> <P> Frank J. Munno, 54, was indicted Tuesday by a Prince Georges County grand jury  on felony charges after Angela Mattson told that authorities her father  sexually abused her from the third grade through graduate school.  </P> <P> "I'm pleading not guilty because I'm not guilty," Munno said in a telephone  interview from his College Park home.  </P> <P> "Shocked and outraged would be the words to describe the feelings I'm trying to  keep inside," he said. "My family is supportive and very disappointed."  </P> <P> Mattson, 28, an engineer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said she made  the abuse allegations public because she hoped to help other victims of abuse.  </P> <P> Munno, a tenured, $89,000-a-year professor, heads the nuclear engineering  program on the College Park campus, the largest in the University of Maryland  system. He has been at College Park 32 years.  </P> <P> He said he will not take a leave from his teaching position. "Why would I be  any worse a teacher because I was accused," said Munno.  </P> <P> The grand jury charged Munno with incest, child abuse, unlawful carnal  knowledge, and unnatural and perverted sex practices. He faces a maximum of 15  years in prison, if convicted on all the charges.  </P></p>

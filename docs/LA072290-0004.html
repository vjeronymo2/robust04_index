			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> I was saddened by Wallace's story on the Broderick marriage and its tragic  consequences -- but not surprised. It is too bad that a woman allowed herself  to assume complete control of rearing her children while encouraging her  husband to be the sole financial support of the family. The duties of either of  these roles are enough to make anyone crazy.  </P> <P> CHRISTINE LOVRET STAPP  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

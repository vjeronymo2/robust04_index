			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DUST MITES LINKED TO ASTHMA  </P> <P> Exposure to house-dust mites during infancy appears to be an important cause of  childhood asthma in places where the climate is humid year-round, researchers  reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. University of  Virginia scientists based the study on a survey of 67 children in humid Poole,  England.  </P> <P> The researchers checked for house-dust mites by testing samples of dust from  their homes. By age 11, 17 children had asthma. All but one had been exposed to  high levels of house-dust mites at age 1.  </P> <P> The work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins from common  household creatures, especially cats and cockroaches, can trigger asthma. It  also suggests that modern home construction, including insulation and central  heating, is raising the risk of asthma.  </P> <P> The tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitant of houses everywhere,  especially in places with year-round humid climates. In the study, children had  an elevated risk if the house dust in their homes contained 500 or more mites  per gram. Children whose asthma is triggered by house-dust mites are allergic  to a form of a protein found in the mites' gastrointestinal tracts and  droppings.  </P></p>

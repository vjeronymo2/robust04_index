			<p>BFN     [Text] Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has  confirmed that he asked Portuguese President Mario Soares to  talk to Jonas Savimbi. The Angolan president wants to know what  the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  leader wants and asked Soares to tell Savimbi to speed up the  Lusaka talks:    [Begin dos Santos recording] We did not ask Dr. Mario  Soares,  the Portuguese president, to mediate between the Angolan  president and the UNITA president. We raised a concern that we  had already raised anyway with the deceased President  Houphouet-Boigny, which is to find out what Savimbi wanted and  to try to get out of him what he wants for the war to end in  Angola. That is all I told Soares. I did not ask him to  persuade Savimbi to agree to an immediate cease-fire. I will  repeat that I asked Soares to find out from Savimbi what he  wants and also asked him, obviously, to advise Savimbi to  accelerate certain negotiations going on in Lusaka. [end  recording]    That was Jose Eduardo dos Santos talking to Radio Nova.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS ARE HALFWAY TO HEAVEN, 9-3;  </P> <P> WITT KEEPS ROLLING, TWINS STILL REELING AT THE ALL-STAR BREAK  </P> <P> The winningest team in baseball will have but two representatives in Tuesday's  All-Star game, which has proven a minor annoyance in Anaheim.  </P> <P> But as Brian Downing, the Angels' long-time designated hitter, says, an  All-Star snub is nothing compared to all the World Series snubs he has seen.  </P> <P> "I'd much rather have the ring that comes from October than the ring that comes  from July," said Downing, who will spend Tuesday at home with his family  despite a .312 batting average.  </P> <P> "If you'd ask me in spring training to make a choice -- first place at the  All-Star break or making the All-Star team from a fifth-place team, you don't  have to ask me which one I'd pick."  </P> <P> In other words, Angels can't be choosers.  </P> <P> Sunday's 9-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins brought an end to one of the most  remarkable first halves in Angel history. The team's turnaround, though still  only half-baked, has been stunningly swift.  </P> <P> After back-to-back 75-87 finishes in 1987 and 1988, the Angels are 19 games  over .500 at 52-33, the best record in the major leagues.  </P> <P> After placing 29 games behind the Oakland Athletics in the American League West  last season, the Angels lead the A's by 1 1/2 games and the rest of the West by  at least 3 1/2.  </P> <P> After finishing 13th out of 14 AL clubs in team ERA last season, the Angels own  the lowest ERA (2.89) in the league, along with a pitching staff that has  limited the opposition to three runs or fewer in the Angels' last 13 games.  </P> <P> If the rest of baseball has been slow to notice and it winds up costing the  Angels an extra name or two on the AL All-Star roster, Downing believes the  club can live with it.  </P> <P> "We've turned the organization around," Downing announced. "We've got our  confidence back. This is basically the foundation we need to have if we're  going to win it all."  </P> <P> Win it all?  </P> <P> Downing nodded.  </P> <P> "I was making these same comments in spring training," he said. "I said then  that I could see us winning it all . . . or I could see us finishing fifth. I  thought we could win if we had a return to health of several starting pitchers,  we stayed away from any more injuries and we had six or seven guys on a 20-home  run pace.  </P> <P> "At the halfway point, those are the factors that have gotten us where we are."  </P> <P> Sunday, the Angels completed a three-game sweep of Minnesota, which improved  the team's record against the Twins to 6-1. In their last home stand before the  All-Star break, the Angels went 6-1. In their last 16 games, the Angels are  13-3.  </P> <P> And the latest victory was a much-awaited one. With it, Mike Witt (7-7) finally  returned to the .500 level -- a statistic that underscores the startling  effectiveness of the Angels' pitching rotation. With Witt basically missing in  action for 2 1/2 months, the Angels still have been able to play better than  .600 baseball.  </P> <P> "This is the best staff I've ever been on -- definitely," Witt said. "And  that's saying something, because we had an awesome staff in '86."  </P> <P> The difference, Witt surmised, is depth.  </P> <P> "This year, somebody else is doing the job I used to do," he said. "Somebody  else is winning games and stopping losing streaks. That's helped me a lot this  year while I've been struggling. It took a little of the pressure off."  </P> <P> Witt threw seven innings against the Twins, giving up two runs on six hits. One  was a second-inning home run by Gary Gaetti, one of Minnesota's two All-Stars.  The Twins scored their second run in the seventh when Gene Larkin hit a single,  moved to third on Brian Harper's double and came home on Doug Baker's sacrifice  fly.  </P> <P> At that point, Witt led, 6-2. The Angels added another run in the bottom of the  seventh before Angel Manager Doug Rader summoned reliever Willie Fraser to  finish the job.  </P> <P> From 3-7 to 7-7, Witt, like the Angels, has taken the long road back.  </P> <P> "My goal the last five games was to get to 8-7 by the break," Witt said. "The  last game, I kinda gave up a lead (Witt received no decision in a 5-2 Angel  victory over Texas), but to be 7-7 after where I was at before is not bad.  Hopefully, I can go from there."  </P> <P> The Angel offense pounded four Minnesota pitchers -- including starter Allan  Anderson (9-7) and reliever Jeff Reardon -- for 15 hits. Downing's two-run home  run in the second inning, his ninth of the season, was the biggest blow, but  significant contributions were also provided by Dick Schofield (two doubles and  a single), Johnny Ray (two hits, two RBIs), Wally Joyner (two hits, one RBI)  and Lance Parrish (two hits, one RBI).  </P> <P> When the pounding stopped, the Angels packed their belongings to make room for  the American League All-Stars and paused to reflect on a first half well done.  </P> <P> "The guys we have going to the All-Star Game should definitely go there with  their heads up," left fielder Chili Davis said. "They're not only representing  the home team, but a first-place home team. That's a good feeling."  </P> <P> Regardless of whether or not Chuck Finley and Devon White are enough Angel  All-Stars.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> It's the traditional dilemma that confronts a streaking team come All-Star  time: To break or not to break. "It's a mixed blessing," Angel Manager Doug  Rader admitted. "We have a number of guys who can use the rest -- Tony Armas,  Brian Downing, Lance Parrish, Chili (Davis), even Johnny Ray. We've had to use  a very small number of players a long time. We don't platoon much. Yet, at the  same time, you don't like to see a pitching staff that's going so well to sit  down for three days. But if I had to choose, I'd rather have a full-rested team  to begin the second half."  </P> <P> The Angels' 52-33 record is their best at the All-Star break. The only other  years in which they've had 50 or more victories by the All-Star Game were 1970  (51-35), 1979 (55-38) and 1985 (52-35). This also marks the sixth time the  Angels have led the AL West at the break. The Angels' biggest lead at the  All-Star Game was six games, in 1985. That team eventually finished second, one  game behind Kansas City.  </P></p>

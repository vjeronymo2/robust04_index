Top priorities will be tax returns, government revenues and  expenditures, and keeping track of banks and other financial  organizations according to Lu Peijian, Auditor-General of the  State Auditing Administration (SAA).    Lu said emphasis will also be placed on auditing enterprises  and investments in construction and agriculture.    "Auditing must be strengthened this year, a key year for  China's reform and economic development, to ensure reforms are  implemented smoothly," Lu told a national auditing conference  which opened yesterday in Beijing.    To back up the "tax-sharing system," which refers to the  division of taxes between the central and provincial  governments, the audits of local governments' final fiscal  accounts in 1993 will focus on whether their revenues and  expenditures are accurate since the new system will use 1993  figures as their base, Lu said.    Auditors will also keep a closer eye on the central bank and  policy bank's management of State assets to support financial  reform.    Meanwhile, during the commercialization of existing  specialized banks, it will be the auditors' job to ensure that  no State properties are lost in the course of restructuring.    In addition, Lu said about one-third of the country's key  construction projects will be inspected annually for financial  irregularities.    Auditors will also try to examine every project which has  been completed.    He said project reviews are aimed at strengthening  management  of the country's investments, improving economic performance and  keeping costs low.    Lu said the inspection of State enterprises will focus on  the  preservation and growth of State assets.    When auditing Sino-foreign joint ventures, emphasis will be  placed on assessments of State assets, he said.    In addition, to ensure that the country's investment in  agriculture is correctly spent, State auditors will pay  particular attention to the expenditure of funds this year, he  said.    Lu said that during 1993 auditing departments across the  country placed more attention to public finance, money markets  and key construction projects.    He said the auditing of local governments' revenues and  expenditures and reviews of illegal interbank borrowing have  helped the country rectify financial order and control the size  of capital investment.    More than 182,000 units were audited last year and 3.392  billion yuan ($389.9 million) found to be illegally earned  through violations of financial regulations has been turned over  to the State, he said.    Meanwhile, a total of 11.95 billion yuan ($1.374 billion)  has  been saved through recovering misused funds and curtailing  expenditures.    The figure was 5.204 billion yuan ($598 million) more than  the previous year's figure.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Losing wagers litter path to final Betting-wise, the World Cup has not proved my finest hour, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. No bookmakers have topped themselves as a result of my bets, which is always the bonus I savour most. I got over-heated to start with; then slowed to a crawl; and was finally flattened by queasiness at the sight of Brazil's shrinking odds. In short: bad strategy, poor money management, and loss of nerve. I started too excitedly, backing Colombia and Argentina, then Romania, Nigeria and Germany, and eventually Bulgaria - six squads of shirt-lifters. Between them, these australopithecines cost me Pounds 308 (including tax). The only sensible bet I made all month was Pounds 60 Brazil to win the World Cup at 3-1, which was the best price you could find in London on June 17. Italy were 6-1 that day, but I have never backed Italy in my life. On the other hand, the bookies were offering half-odds if teams reached the final, so there must be thousands of Italians already showing a huge collective profit. This is what attracted me to Romania at 33-1 after they trounced Colombia. Romania - I divined - were a team from the 21st century; pity about their penalty-taking. As the tournament progressed and Brazil looked far from convincing, I stared in horror at their rapidly-shrinking price. This was my big mistake. There is a streak of showiness in my character which at times mutates into a bulging vein of vulgarity. Among other things, this makes me a contra-bettor. I disdain sensibly-priced favourites such as Brazil and instead bet on flashy outsiders such as Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria. As things stand, I will lose Pounds 134 even if Brazil win tomorrow. So yesterday I rang the wretched bookies, looking for an escape. I started with the rascals at Ladbroke, which calls itself, smugly, the biggest bookmaker in the solar system. Brazil, said Ladbroke, are now 8-15 to win the cup, and Italy 11-8. This is no help to me. I never bet odds-on. So I questioned the rascals severely. I asked them what the odds were against Brazil beating Italy 4-1, as they did in the World Cup final in 1970. Answer: 40-1. Brazil to win by 10 goals to nil? Answer: 100-1. These odds are inhumanly cramped. I would rather buy blood from a vampire. But I believe I have no choice. With a mighty smirk and swagger, I will today bet Pounds 20 on a 4-1 Brazilian win and Pounds 20 on a 10-0 pasting. I mean, Italy?</p>

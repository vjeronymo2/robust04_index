			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines as traders unload speculative stocks SHARE prices closed moderately lower after another thin volume, as traders unloaded speculative stocks to avoid margin calls, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 57.20 at 15,926.44. The index rose to the day's high of 16,138.50 in the morning on arbitrage-linked buying, before sinking to a low of 15,808.61 in the afternoon session. Volume came to 180m shares, against Wednesday's 185m. Declines led rises by 615 to 290, with 164 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 6.02 to 1,207.32, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.38 to 977.64. However, earlier pessimism appeared to have lifted. 'People seem to have abandoned the gloom and doom scenario,' said an official at Nippon Life. Small-lot buying, linked to arbitrage-unwinding, was seen in the morning session. Arbitrageurs have been booking profits by selling cash stocks, and buying futures contracts after the recent fall in the futures market. Unwinding of these positions has led to recent purchasing by dealers in the cash markets. Most technical analysts see near-term resistance at 16,300 on the Nikkei. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said investors were selling around the 16,000 level to hedge their positions. Profit-taking weighed on high-technology blue chips, which had gained ground on Wednesday on purchases by foreign pension funds. Sony relinquished Y50 to Y4,020. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y28,000 to an all-time low of Y551,000. Traders said some selling was prompted by reports suggesting that mobile telephones were radioactive, and could cause tumours among users. Banks firmed on covering of short positions. Industrial Bank of Japan put on Y10 to Y1,770 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,200. But Nippon Credit Bank weakened Y100 to Y4,800 on reports of severe problems at its leasing affiliates. Nippon Credit has been requesting other banks to co-operate in restructuring of its three non-bank financial affiliates. Nippondenso lost Y120 to Y1,310. The Toyota Motor affiliate reported a 25 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits for the first half due to slack demand. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 94.33 to 17,479.54 in volume of 17.2m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were influenced by domestic factors. AUSTRALIA closed at its lowest level for almost four months on nervousness about the speed of economic recovery. The All Ordinaries index fell 16.8 to 1,588.9 in turnover of ADollars 273m. Banks remained weak, with Commonwealth down 11 cents to ADollars 7.08 and ANZ off 7 cents at ADollars 3.41. SEOUL staged a technical rebound in thin trading, struggling back above the 500 level. Speculation that the ruling Democratic Liberal Party would come up with market-boosting measures today contributed to the advance. The index ended 6.71 up at 500.04. Companies vying for the country's second mobile telecom contract fell on rumours that the ruling party had asked President Roh Tae-Woo to delay selection of the winner. MANILA eased as large-capitalisation stocks followed a fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone. The composite index slipped 22.05 to 1,463.80 in combined turnover of 195.7m pesos. PLDT shed 30 pesos to 1,030 on a smaller than expected 5.8 per cent rise in first-half net income. TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower as investors took profits in late trading. The weighted index rose more than 20 points initially as shares responded to the central bank's injection of liquidity into the money market on Wednesday. It was finally a net 12.13 down at 4,122.78 in turnover of TDollars 20.7bn. KUALA LUMPUR weakened as selling increased. The composite index fell back below the 600 mark to finish 4.31 lower at 598.27. RJ Reynolds dropped 24 cents further to MDollars 3.08 after the announcement of a cut in cigarette prices. SINGAPORE lost ground as shipyard stocks remained under pressure following disappointing half-year results from a number of companies. The Straits Times Industrial index declined 25.20 to 1,416.83. HONG KONG rose on bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index advanced 24.03 to 5,865.27 in turnover of HKDollars 1.87bn. BOMBAY fell sharply on reports that the government planned to increase prices for petroleum products by 20 per cent. The BSE index lost 100.64, or 3.8 per cent, to 2,529.59. KARACHI rose for the second consecutive day, the index closing 41.43, or 3.2 per cent, up at 1,308.45.</p>

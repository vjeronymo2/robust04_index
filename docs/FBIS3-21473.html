			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kuwait--A Kuwaiti economic expert, 'Adnan al-Bahr,  expressed criticism of the conditions in Kuwait's financial  market, and of those responsible for it, because of the absence  of a clear strategy for emerging from the crisis the financial  market is experiencing.    Al-Bahr, who is the chairman of the board of the [Kuwait]  International Investment Corporation, said in an interview with  AL-HAYAH that the Kuwaiti economy is experiencing a period of  fundamental change, the results of which have yet to emerge. He  said that other Gulf markets were compelled to enter this phase  of change before Kuwait, in the eighties when oil prices dipped  substantially, prompting the Gulf countries to reorder their  economic priorities and restructure their paths.    He said that these economies have begun to grow, each in its  own way, within the past five to eight years. The Saudi economy  was able to flourish and grow strongly based on private-sector  growth, the recovery of its securities and real estate market,  and the renewed profitability of organizations in the Saudi  market.    Al-Bahr described the Saudi economy as "strong with respect  to professionalism, efficiency, and direction." He said that the  UAE [United Arab Emirates] economy, especially in the emirate of  Dubayy, takes after the Saudi economy.    He noted that Kuwait is the only country that has emerged  from these circumstances without having to adapt, because its  investment returns have covered the drop in its oil revenues.    He suggested that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait forced the  Kuwaiti Government to spend half of its financial reserves,  which has in turn compelled Kuwait to reorder its economic  priorities and to reorganize.    He stressed that, if oil market conditions worsen, it will  become even more necessary for Kuwait to adapt and to pursue the  policies adopted by the other Gulf countries.    Al-Bahr described the Kuwaiti economy as "fat and  overstuffed. Its problem is that it has taken a liking to  excess. It needs a strict diet to shed its opulence and lethargy  to become a slim, flexible economy." By doing so, he stressed,  it will have adopted a sound method for adapting to the current  circumstances.    He believes that oil should be used more efficiently to  benefit the Kuwaiti economy, that alternatives should be sought,  and that sole reliance upon a single source of income should be  avoided. He said, "We in Kuwait have long clamored for improving  the economy and finding alternatives to oil. However, in the  short term, we can improve the economic situation by improving  efficiency in the economy through less use and greater output.  In other words, we should use oil income minimally to yield  maximum results."    He believes that this "can happen easily, because we have a  large economy, even though it suffers from waste and incorrect  use, which is the result of many years of ease and affluence."    He said, "In coming years, Kuwait will undergo the painful  cure we saw in the lean years of the economies of Saudi Arabia  and the UAE, but we can bear this pain."    He said, "Change will bring new opportunities to the Kuwaiti  market. At the same time, many traditional areas of activity  will experience difficulty in adapting to change, because the  process of restructuring positions will be trying. A contractor  who used to serve the public sector will be forced to face stiff  competition in the private sector."    Al-Bahr suggested that the coming phase will bring with it  the expansion and promotion of the private sector through new  projects and companies, the sale of shares, and the general  public's ownership of the private sector. This means that there  will be a larger supply of investment assets for the capital  aggregate itself, and that new assets and investment  opportunities will be added to the monetary aggregate.    He attributed the recent slight improvement in the Kuwaiti  market to the drop in interest rates. He said, "It stimulated  investment activities. In addition, with the settlement of a  difficult debt problem--which involved the state's purchase of  bad debts from businessmen after Kuwait was liberated from the  Iraqi invasion--large corporations have begun to adapt to their  new positions."    He said that medium-term investment prospects in Kuwait will  remain stabile or decline. However, he expressed optimism about  the economic situation in the long term--provided that the  economy is successful in moving beyond the current phase--with  respect to attracting greater levels of Gulf and international  capital by creating flexible policies and advantageous  systems--e.g., the tax system--and minimizing red tape in  business transactions.    Al-Bahr said that the flight of domestic and Gulf capital is  due to insufficient investment opportunities, not to political  factors that provoke fear. He said that enough funds exist to  cover good investment activities.    He emphasized the importance of extricating the Kuwaiti  market from its crisis of red tape and paralyzed decisionmaking,  which pose a major risk to the initiation of any project.    On another subject, al-Bahr said that the Islamic capital  market is considered a growing market and that half of the  capital in the Gulf market will flow to Islamic financial  organizations within the next five to 10 years. He attributed  this to the specialized nature of this market, which frees it  from competition with international organizations.    He said that Islamic organizations will be among the most  successful international organizations in the coming years. He  estimated that between $30 billion and $40 billion are invested  in these organizations. He expects that this figure will reach  $100 billion within the next decade.</p>

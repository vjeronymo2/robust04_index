			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHNNIE RAY, BALLADEER OF THE 1950S, DIES AT 63  </P> <P> Johnnie Ray, the balladeer of tears who brought an emotional intensity to music  that was singular to his era, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> The performer, once dubbed "The Prince of Wails" for his impassioned renditions  of such songs as "Cry" and "Please Mr. Sun," was 63 and died of liver failure  at 4 p.m., Cedars-Sinai spokesman Ron Wise said.  </P> <P> "He has been in and out of the hospital for the last three months" and lapsed  into a coma Feb. 14, Wise said.  </P> <P> Ray, noted for his stormy style, would jump about as he sang, bend his knees  and cup his hand to his left ear, where a hearing aid had been in place for  many years. He injured the ear while being tossed in the air by friends when he  was 10, and his hearing deteriorated through the years. Many said, not  unkindly, that he sang as if everyone in the room had similar hearing problems.  </P> <P> As he sang, he contorted his babyish face into a painful expression, tugged at  his hair and cried.  </P> <P> Predictably, his first hit in 1950 was called "Cry." The other side of that  record was "The Little White Cloud That Cried." They quickly became the No. 1  and No. 2 songs in the country, turning an awkward, shy boy into a national  figure.  </P> <P> Several years ago, Times rock critic Robert Hilburn wrote that Ray had played a  "small but noteworthy role in the evolution of rock," helping pave the way for  the passionate singers that followed him.  </P> <P> His roots actually were in rhythm and blues, for his flamboyant style had  forced him away from mainstream nightclubs and in front of black audiences at  the Flame Showbar in Detroit.  </P> <P> He soon became the only white artist on Okeh Records' black R&amp;B roster.  </P> <P> (Music critics have said the intensity of his early vocals helped open the door  for Elvis Presley and other white rock artists.)  </P> <P> After those instant successes he moved into the mainstream of singers and lost  favor with the teen-agers who had mobbed him at personal appearances in the  early 1950s. But he was never forgotten by the white rockers who followed him.  </P> <P> As recently as last year he shared a stage with Billy Idol. And Billy Joel, who  opened last week's Grammy Awards telecast, sang "We Didn't Start the Fire," a  song of appreciation for long-ago performers that names Ray in the lyrics.  </P> <P> Although young record buyers had largely ignored him for the last three  decades, their parents hadn't. He appeared regularly in New York, Las Vegas and  Atlantic City, singing the evergreen favorites that had put him on the national  stage.  </P> <P> Born John Alvin Ray in Dallas, Ore., a small town outside Salem (where he made  his last public appearance), Ray was the son of a man who played fiddle at  square dances and a woman proficient on the piano. He became a self-taught  pianist who sang at church and at school.  </P> <P> Initially an outgoing child, friends recall that after his hearing loss he  became introverted and his teachers and others chastised him for not paying  attention.  </P> <P> "I was the loneliest kid in the world," he was quoted as saying. From that  loneliness came "The Little White Cloud That Cried," which he wrote in his  teens.  </P> <P> But after he was fitted with a hearing aid at 15, his horizons expanded and he  decided to become an actor, performing in local plays and amateur shows.  </P> <P> He met Sophie Tucker, the raucous and lightly ribald singer, as she was passing  through Portland where Ray was singing at a burlesque house.  </P> <P> "If you want to make it in show business," she told him, "get the hell out of  Portland."  </P> <P> He came to Hollywood in 1949 to act in films but found only odd jobs as a  bartender and piano player in clubs he described as "upholstered sewers."  </P> <P> He went to New York and then to Detroit, where he found work at the Flame  Showbar. A local disc jockey persuaded a Columbia Records representative to  give him a chance and the result was "Whiskey and Gin" and "Tell the Lady I  Said Goodbye" for Okeh, a Columbia subsidiary.  </P> <P> Those songs became popular in the Midwest, but it wasn't until he returned to  New York to record "Cry" and "Little White Cloud" that he became fully  established.  </P> <P> He followed those hits with "Please Mr. Sun" and "Brokenhearted," arranged by  Mitch Miller. All four became million-sellers.  </P> <P> In 1952 he opened at the Copacabana in New York and the standing-room-only  crowds (and press agents) began to call him "The Prince of Wails," "The Nabob  of Sob" and "The Atomic Ray," among other sobriquets.  </P> <P> He became the first performer to earn $25,000 a week in Las Vegas and on March  23, 1953, made the first of nine appearances at the London Palladium.  </P> <P> The following year he came back to Hollywood to make the film debut he had  sought earlier. He appeared as the son of Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey in the  Irving Berlin musical "There's No Business Like Show Business."  </P> <P> But records were his forte and he returned to the studio. In the next five  years he made hits of "Just Walking in the Rain," "Walking My Baby Back Home,"  "Yes Tonight, Josephine," "Hernando's Hideaway," "Such a Night," "Somebody  Stole My Gal" and more.  </P> <P> "Cry," his original hit, had sold 25 million copies at his death and Columbia  recently released a compact disc of his many hit singles.  </P> <P> He married once, in 1952, to Marilyn Morrison, daughter of Mocambo nightclub  owner Charlie Morrison, but they divorced. He is survived by a sister and  nieces and nephews.  </P> <P> His personal life was sometimes as pained as his music. He developed a drinking  problem, he told The Times in 1976, but indicated he had conquered it.  </P> <P> Ray credited his success with "showing people the emotion they're afraid to  show" and also said he had grown more appreciative of his career over the  years.  </P> <P> Last October, in Salem at what proved to be his final appearance, he told his  audience:  </P> <P> "It doesn't get any better than this."  </P></p>

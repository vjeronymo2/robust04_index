In the commission's opinion, contracts on the delivery of  equipment, raw materials or fuel should be paid through  banks-distributors of the credit.    Recipients should directly receive no more than 15 percent  of  the total worth of a credit, the commission said. The  regulation is designed to prevent financial machinations with  credit money.    The group also reviewed the Indication Program, which is  implemented in the framework of the PHARE [Poland and Hungary  for Restructuring the Economy] program. In 1994, the program's  funding will be used to finance economic, administrative and  agricultural reforms.    The 1994 PHARE action mainstreams will be adopted in March  in  Brussels. Latvia could receive an estimated 21 million ECU's,  specialists say.    The commission is headed by Finance Minister Uldis Osis, its  members are Economics Minister Ojars Kehris, Economics  Ministry's State Secretary Aina Bataraga and Bank of Latvia's  Vice President Ilmars Rimasevics. It was set up in the end of  1993 in compliance with a government resolution.</p>

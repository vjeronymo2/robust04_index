The president refused to confirm or deny such reports and  noted that it will be Vera himself who will refer to this matter  at a news conference that he will hold tomorrow, Tuesday.    Vera, a well-known journalist and radio and television  producer in his country, urged Dahik to straighten up and not  "spread rumors." Vera made this remark after the vice president  announced that the government is studying the possibility of  convoking a plebiscite on topics that have not been disclosed by  government spokesmen yet.    The Ecuadoran vice president was elected to that post while  ministers get appointed. According to television, radio, and  newspaper reports, this explains the government hierarchy.</p>

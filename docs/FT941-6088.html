			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: The Nash plays Casken - Concert Having been sour about the Nash Ensemble's first concert in its Wigmore season last autumn, I am happy to report that the players were back on their usual distinguished form for the second of four '20th Century' concerts. Each includes a premiere; this time it was John Casken's Infanta Marina, a concertante piece for cor anglais and a pair of competing instrumental trios. Casken's star has been rising steadily for several years, especially since his Golem opera at the Almeida Festival. He is a romantic, fiercely loyal Northerner with scrupulous musical standards. Here, his inspiration was Shakespeare's princess Marina in Pericles, as re-imagined by the poet Wallace Stevens: tempest-tossed, at the eccentric mercy of fate, but resilient and calmly reflective. While the competing trios pursue their own lively material and sometimes coalesce, the solo cor anglais (Gareth Hulse, visually an unlikely Marina, but musically character-laden) responds sweetly, arbitrates, offers sidelong commentary. Immediately attractive, Infanta Marina promises to divulge much more on further acquaintance. Some day soon, there should be a big, definitive Casken piece which will set his music in perspective - perhaps his forthcoming violin concerto for the BBC Philharmonic, or his Philharmonia commission for 1996? A refurbished work was the late Roberto Gerhard's op. 1, a dozen Straussian songs on Catalan poems, for high erotic soprano: 'With the velvet of my eyes I shall weave you a carpet/ Which shall lead you to my bed.' Meirion Bowen has made clever arrangements of six of those for a dozen players - in a couple of passages, maybe too 'orchestral' - and Rosa Mannion sang them seductively. A rediscovery, not quite new but not yet familiar, was the original version of Falla's El Amor Brujo. Most of us know it in its later, more luxuriant dress. It was exciting to hear the Nash players and their conductor Lionel Friend make so much of the leaner original, with Jean Rigby's lusty mezzo to electrify the songs. For good measure, we got Michael Berkeley's ingratiating, eclectic little Nocturne and a sharply purposeful account of Falla's Harpsichord Concerto, with Maggie Cole confident at the keyboard.</p>

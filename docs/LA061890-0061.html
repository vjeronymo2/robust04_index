			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: ALMOST HOMELESS: 'MAD HOUSING' IN ATLANTA;  </P> <P> THEIR VOLUNTEER-BUILT SHACKS ARE IN HIDDEN SPOTS BUT HUT-DWELLERS FEAR THEY ARE  LIVING ON BORROWED TIME.  </P> <P> Huts may not be houses, but scores of Atlantans call them home.  </P> <P> For three years now, a group of socially conscious architects, industrial  designers and others, called "the Mad Housers," has been building shacks for  homeless people. They have erected 87 of the little structures in  out-of-the-way places around town -- near railroad tracks, under viaducts. Made  of plywood and measuring 6 feet by 8 feet, the huts are just big enough to hold  a cot and a few personal possessions.  </P> <P> At one time the little emergency shelters, which have no running water or  electricity, do not comply with building codes and are considered eyesores by  many, drew the wrath of city and state officials. During high-profile events,  such as the 1988 Democratic National Convention, some of them were evacuated.  Some have been razed.  </P> <P> Lately, a kinder and gentler era has taken hold. Nevertheless, some of the  hut-dwellers are worried that they will be moved. They live under the Martin  Luther King Jr. Drive viaduct near downtown and next to the construction site  of the Georgia Dome. The $210-million, 70,500-seat facility is scheduled for  completion in 1992 and Atlanta recently won the right to host the 1994 Super  Bowl there.  </P> <P> The sports news brought great joy to official Atlanta, and visions of the  Olympics and the NBA All-Stars danced in Mayor Maynard Jackson's head. "This is  just the beginning," he declared. "We're going to stage the greatest Super Bowl  ever."  </P> <P> But there was no joy under the viaduct. There was no sadness, either. Only  cynicism and resolve, the two constant companions of the homeless and nearly  homeless people who drop out or fall out of society and then live lives of  repeated displacement. Here, as in other cities, the people on the bottom of  the socioeconomic ladder often disparage urban revitalization even when they  are promised that it will help them.  </P> <P> "We know that, eventually, we will have to move," said Roger, who has lived  under the viaduct six months. Turning to a visitor, he sneered. He said: "I  have a $10 house next to a $210-million stadium. They don't want me next to  them. You don't want me next to you."  </P> <P> Several of Roger's neighbors, who had gathered in front of the neighborhood row  of huts to chat and play bid whist, shouted their agreement. They talked  passionately and proudly about how they help to guard the surrounding property,  about how they live as day laborers and scrap collectors and how they shun  official shelters because they are crowded and dangerous.  </P> <P> Boasting about how the comrades look out for each other, one man challenged the  visitor, saying: "I leave my hut with the door unlocked. I bet you can't leave  your hut without locking your door."  </P> <P> Local officials insist that it is too soon to worry about losing the huts.  </P> <P> "The city has not expressed any plan of action on that," said Jerome Eppinger  of the Atlanta Office of Human Services, who coordinates assistance to the  homeless. "We let them know about other facilities. Beyond that, you have to  let people make their own choice. This is their shelter of choice."  </P> <P> Jody Plummer, a nurse with a community health program, was skeptical. "I  wouldn't be surprised if they were moved," she said. "It would be really sad if  the city takes them away and doesn't put anything in their place."  </P> <P> Michael Connor, an architect who is a Mad Houser, believes the "moneywigs" will  be driven to dismantle the huts "for appearances' sake."  </P> <P> He added: "Society is insensitive, or there wouldn't be such a problem with  homelessness." An estimated 8,000 homeless people live in this city of 420,000.  </P> <P> Under the viaduct, a resolute young man was certain that his hut would be  destroyed, but he was philosophical.  </P> <P> "When they move us," he said, "we just become more tenacious. We're like  roaches. We survive."  </P></p>

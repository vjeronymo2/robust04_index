			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on Schlesinger comments BOURSES headed lower as cautious hopes of lower German interest rates were dashed by comments from the Bundesbank president, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT weakened as Allianz came under renewed pressure following a negative analysts' meeting on Wednesday. The insurer saw the value of its shares tumble after Deutsche Bank issued a sell note and reduced its 1992 forecast of Earnings Per Share to DM28 from DM45.50. Allianz closed down DM79 or 4 per cent at DM1,872. Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, in which he reaffirmed that there would be no cut in interest rates this year, added to market gloom. The DAX index lost 4.16 to 1,623.99 while, at midsession, the FAZ was 0.03 weaker at 643.02. Turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM5.9bn. Some analysts believe that Allianz may fall to around DM1,850. The market has taken a view that the next two years will be difficult for the insurer, since losses from its east German operations likely to continue. Increased competition from other European insurers as the sector is further liberalised is also likely to hurt its profit margins. Car makers enjoyed a better day as BMW announced a 10 per cent increase in first half group net profit. Its shares added DM3 to DM543. Volkswagen was DM1 stronger at DM359.50. Lufthansa slipped DM3.40 to DM108.50 on its plans to reduce services between Germany and the US. MILAN fell on selling by domestic investors, perturbed by the implications of the resignation of the foreign minister, Mr Vicenzo Scotti. Dealers said there were fears that the crisis within the Christian Democrat party could topple the coalition government. The Comit index fell 3.41 to 397.73 in turnover estimated at L100bn after L76.9bn. News that a Turin broker was unable to meet his commitments and that settlement of the account, due today, was likely to be postponed as a result, also weighed on the market. Potentially good news, such as a 3.25 per cent increase in cement prices, was ignored. Fiat fell L71 to L4,380 while Montedison dropped L55 to L1,105. Italcementi fell L50 to L9,600 and its savings shares were suspended for excessive losses. Acqua Marcia was suspended by Consob after the company said at a shareholders' meeting on Wednesday that it is planning a capital increase for at least L139bn to avoid bankruptcy. PARIS followed the bond market lower, weakened by worries about the referendum on Maastricht and the prospect of high German interest rates for the rest of the year. The CAC-40 index lost 19.06 or 1.1 per cent to 1,782.57 in thin turnover of FFr1.7bn. Euro Disney continued to fall, losing FFr2.65 to FFr88. Other losers included Saint-Gobain, down FFr19 to FFr545, while pessimism surrounding Allianz, the German insurer, weighed on UAP, down FFr14.40 at FFr397.50, and Axa, down FFr36 to FFr809. But Credit Local outperformed the market, adding FFr4.10 to FFr249.50 in good volume of 171,420 shares. AMSTERDAM began firmly but weakened just before the close after the central bank increased its special advance rate. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to 117. DSM cheered the market with its first-half results and said that it would maintain its interim dividend at Fl 2.65. Its shares advanced Fl 4.60 or 4.5 per cent to Fl 105. Akzo benefited from the results, gaining Fl 2 to Fl 144. It publishes first half figures next Tuesday. BRUSSELS rose on news that Solvay may issue American Depository Receipts. The Bel-20 index advanced 4.14 to 1,141.18 in turnover of BFr554m. The chemical group reported lower first half earnings but forecast that full year results will be in line with 1991 figures. Its shares rose BFr250 or 2.1 per cent to BFr12,325. ZURICH drifted lower on profit-taking. The SMI index shed 6.6 to 1,806.1. Chemical stocks were stronger with Ciba-Geigy bearers adding SFr3 to SFr653 and Sandoz bearers up SFr10 to SFr2,870. OSLO was led higher by Hafslund Nycomed which reported better than expected first half results late on Wednesday. The all-share index rose 1.78 to 387.99 in turnover of NKr167m. Hafslund A shares added NKr2.5 to NKr157. VIENNA closed slightly higher. The ATX index gained 1.21 to 792.16 after an intraday high of 805.94. Austrian Airlines lost Sch140, or 8 per cent, to Sch1,570 after the group said that it might have to cut the 1992 dividend.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1071.87  1073.12  1072.91  1071.42  1069.93  1068.92  1070.63  1068.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1073.73    Day's Low  1067.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jul 29    Jul 28    Jul 27    Jul 24    Jul 23      1077.69   1058.38   1056.98   1052.53   1059.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ancona, Italy, April 11 (AFP) -- The UNHCR on  Monday [11 April] suspended its airlift between the Italian Air  Force base at Ancona to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, a  spokeswoman for the UN aid agency said here.    Speaking at Ancona airport, Antonella Gesulfo from the  office  of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the organisation  was awaiting "the next developments" before deciding whether or  not to resume the airlift.    The decision follow's Sunday's airstrikes by two U.S. F-16  fighters against Bosnian Serb forces attacking the UN-protected  Moslem enclave of Goradze in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina.    In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said the 20 flights  planned for Monday as a "precaution," adding that "Tuesday we  will reassess the situation." [sentence as received]    The decision was taken by the UNHCR and the UN Protection  Force in Bosnia, and representatives of the six countries --  Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the  United States -- operating the air bridge.    A Canadian C-130 aircraft which was being used to airlift  injured Bosnians out of Bosnia has left for East Africa to take  part in the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda.</p>

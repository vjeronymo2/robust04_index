			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Members of the urban  flood control inspection group formed by the State Flood Control  and Drought Relief Headquarters [SFCDRH] has returned to  Beijing. He Jing, one of the group leaders, SFCDRH deputy  commander, and vice minister of water resources, stressed that  responsibility for cities' flood control must be set for  administrative leaders to discharge, and publicity must be  intensified to combat indifference. To safeguard cities from  floods, grass-roots cadres and people must heighten their flood  control awareness and intensify this year's antiflood  preparations mentally and organizationally, and with effective  measures.    He Jing continued: Since many Chinese cities are located by  rivers and lakes, or near the sea, much has to be done in  protecting these cities from floods. Whether these cities are  safe from flood damage has a close bearing on China's social  stability and economic development. Therefore cities' flood  control is a priority project in China's flood control plan.  This was why the SFCDRH organized the urban flood control  inspection group to inspect certain major cities before the  arrival of the high-water season.    According to He Jing, the inspection group -- composed of  personnel from the State Economic and Trade Commission, State  Planning Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of  Construction, and General Staff Headquarters, as well as the  SFCDRH General Office -- inspected flood control projects in  Jiujiang, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 1 to 10  June. The group found that these cities have taken flood  control seriously, their precautionary measures have special  characteristics, and they are quite successful in one way or  another. But we must also be aware that the requirements which  Chinese cities have set for flood control are quite low. For  example, of the 472 cities with flood control assignments to  carry out, only 93 of them, or 19.7 percent, have met the  requirements for combating the kind of floods which occur once  every 50 years; only 248 of them, or 52.5 percent, are able to  combat the kind of floods that occur once every 20 years; and  only 109 of them, or 23.1 percent, are able to combat the kind  of floods which occur once every 10 years or less. This being  the case, we must firmly intensify various non-engineering  measures [fei gong cheng cuo shi 7236 1562 4453 2238 2457],  heighten our awareness against floods, carry out all measures,  and be well prepared against serious inundation.    He Jing stressed that cities and economic development zones  must attach importance to flood control projects. She urged  cities in all parts of the country to achieve even greater  success in flood control as well as in combating drought. She  also reminded all localities to tighten inspection, attend to  usually unheeded areas, and pay special attention to the safety  of dams located near cities and on the upper reaches of main  lines of communications during the high-water season.</p>

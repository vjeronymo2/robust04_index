			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hamas spokesman Muhammad Nazzal by </F> unidentified correspondent in Amman; date not given]    [Text] [AL-QUDS] What are the results of your repeated  meetings with PLO officials?    [Nazzal] Following the signing of the Oslo Agreement, Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership decided to freeze all  official contacts and meetings with the PLO leadership. Since  then, no meetings between us have taken place.    [AL-QUDS] But you have met recently with 'Abbas Zaki.    [Nazzal] The recent meeting with brother 'Abbas was at his  request. We did not freeze individual contacts with officials  opposed to the PLO policy. Accordingly, my meeting with brother  'Abbas came within this context.    [AL-QUDS] What about your intention to join the coming  Palestinian Authority and its institutions and how do you view  the future of your relations with them?    [Nazzal] I have informed brother 'Abbas of Hamas' official  and final decision rejecting participation in the Palestinian  Authority. We do not recognize this authority and do not believe  it represents the Palestinian people. I believe it was imposed  by a U.S.-Israeli desire.    [AL-QUDS] If legislative elections under the Palestinian  Authority were held, would you take part in them?    [Nazzal] We believed and continue to believe in holding free  and general elections that can ensure the election of a  leadership representing the Palestinian people.    [AL-QUDS] What is the alternative to the Oslo Agreement you  are offering to the Palestinian people and thousands of  Palestinian families at home and abroad?    [Nazzal] Hamas offers resistance as an alternative to the  settlement process. The settlement process which started in  Madrid and ended in Oslo has brought about an extremely feeble  agreement. The way it was drafted and its clauses constitute a  liquidation of the Palestinian cause. We believe that the  resistance and its continuation are essential for achieving a  full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian  territories. Gaza was a burden to the occupation. What  happened is that the Israelis traded their exit from Gaza for an  agreement that has consecrated Israel's occupation of Palestine  and granted the Palestinian administrative self-rule, thus  treating Palestinians as an ethnic minority living under a  Jewish state.    [AL-QUDS] But is Hamas offering resistance to steer the Oslo  and Cairo Agreements toward the desired objectives?    [Nazzal] We believe that the Oslo Agreement and the  agreements that followed it have interpreted the Declaration of  Principles in a way that serves Israeli interests and harms  Palestinian interests. Accordingly, Hamas believes that these  agreements are the natural result of the policy pursued by the  PLO leadership.    [AL-QUDS] Suppose that the agreement did not exist, what  would have guaranteed that no more settlements would be built?    [Nazzal] When the PLO leadership decided to attend the  Madrid  Conference it made this conditional on halting the settlement  activity. What happened is that the PLO has abandoned the  condition it placed for itself. When the agreement was signed,  no mention was made of removing or dismantling the settlements  or even freezing settlement-building. So even the agreement  does not provide for the guarantees referred to in the question.    [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the agreement has  preserved what is left of our land? Perhaps tomorrow we will  not find land to negotiate about.    [Nazzal] I believe that the agreement has not dealt with the  Palestinian issue as a problem of land, but a problem of a  people. The land occupied in 1967, which according to the  Security Council Resolutions is occupied land, has become, under  the negotiations, disputed land. This means that the PLO's  ceiling in the negotiations is lower than that of the so-called  international legality, which is very strange. I do not believe  that this agreement will preserve the Palestinian territories or  what is left of them but instead will consecrate Israel's  sovereignty of this area.    [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the decision to take part  in the negotiations has been made in the absence of an  international balance of power and amid Arab fragmentation?    [Nazzal] Joining the negotiations under Arab weakness and  fragmentation and in the absence of the balance of power is in  the interest of Israel, and the Palestinians shouldn't have  participated in the negotiations, because negotiations should be  among strong and equal parties. Negotiations between a weak and  a strong party will inevitably be in the interest of the strong,  which will impose and even dictate its terms. This is what  happened in the settlement process that started in Madrid and  ended in Oslo. The excuses that the PLO leadership has advanced  and is advancing for joining this process are supposed to lead  us to results contrary to what the PLO leadership has expected.    [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the Oslo and Cairo  Agreements will prompt the Israeli leadership to abandon, even  partly, the notion of Greater Israel?    [Nazzal] We must realize that the theory of Greater Israel  still exists in the Zionist mind, but there are two approaches  to it. One says that it can be achieved by geographic  expansion, while the other, which is adopted by the Labor Party,  seeks to build Greater Israel through Israel's political,  economic, and cultural penetration of the so-called Middle East.  One of the most important things gained from this agreement is  that the Palestinians will be the bridge that the Israelis will  cross into the region, thus achieving the theory adopted by the  Labor Party.    [AL-QUDS] But the Palestinian National Independence  Document stipulates the establishment of the Palestinian state  on any part of Palestine to be liberated. So how can you  explain your opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian  entity on liberated land?    [Nazzal] When we see that any part of the Palestinian land  is  liberated we will be the first to express our support and  blessings. However, we believe that the agreement is devoted to  championing the Israeli sovereignty. We also believe that the  agreement has not liberated anything. The settlements still  exist in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli occupation has  redeployed its troops and has not completely withdrawn.  Therefore, how can we accept what they say about the so-called  liberated land?    [AL-QUDS] But Israel is continuing the negotiating process  with the Arab countries. Can Hamas guarantee its continuous  opposition in these countries?    [Nazzal] The Hamas movement started and forged ahead in the  occupied Palestinian territories. Hamas' principal  organizational structure is still there. It will, therefore,  not be affected by any political development that might emerge  in Arab-Israeli relations. Also, I rule out any normalization  in the relations so soon, particularly with regard to Syria,  Jordan, and Lebanon.    [AL-QUDS] How do you envisage the future relations between  Hamas and the opposition Palestinian forces, particularly the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine?    [Nazzal] After the Madrid Conference, we started to  coordinate efforts with the opposition Palestinian forces. We  succeeded in establishing a political alliance with them. This  alliance aimed at forming a political base to confront the weak  base set up by Yasir 'Arafat at the start of the Madrid  Conference. We formed an alliance consisting of 10 Palestinian  organizations to confront Yasir 'Arafat's alliance which is made  up of only three groups.    I believe that the structure of our alliance is  unprecedented  on the Palestinian arena as well as in the Arab and Islamic  arena. Our alliance included political and ideological currents  in the "leftist nationalist and Islamic" region. We are trying  to promote this alliance in the new stage that started with the  implementation of the Oslo Accord.    [AL-QUDS] But what if the Hamas Movement wants to use its  position in the opposition to gain the support of the masses to  ensure its success in the upcoming elections?    [Nazzal] Hamas started as a resistance movement, and it has  never aimed at assuming power. Furthermore, the authority they  are talking about is nothing but an imaginary authority. It is  an administration supervised by the occupation, and it is,  therefore, a tool in the hands of the occupation.    [AL-QUDS] But all the provisions of the Palestinian-Israeli  Agreement were signed. What is the most dangerous political  challenge that might face the Palestinian people in the wake of  the implementation of this agreement's protocols?    [Nazzal] This agreement has not dealt with basic issues that  represent the core of the Palestinian cause. These issues have  been postponed until the next stage of negotiations with the aim  of promoting the agreement. This is because we believe that  there are clear Israeli answers to all outstanding issues,  namely Jerusalem, settlements, the 1948 refugees, and the  Palestinian state. Hence, these issues will be settled only if  the negotiations are completed in favor of the enemy.  Therefore, the challenge facing the Palestinian people is to  complete the march of resistance against the occupation and to  reject the agreement and to consider it null and void.</p>

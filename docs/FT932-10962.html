			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: SFO stuck with no trial and only token gestures one of the most high-profile prosecutions brought by the Serious Fraud Office - was due to start on September 13. He faced 13 charges alleging he stole Pounds 34m from Polly Peck. There is now no chance that the trial will take place. With Mr Nadir beyond reach in northern Cyprus, the SFO can do little except make token gestures. In a short statement yesterday, it said it was considering further action, including issuing a fresh warrant for his arrest. Police were also investigating how he was able to slip out of the country in a private jet. Both courses of action, however, remain academic. Unless Mr Nadir returns voluntarily, the papers for his prosecution will gather dust. The SFO is left to decide whether to go ahead with the prosecution of Mr Nadir's co-defendant, Mr John Turner, Polly Peck's chief accountant. He faces two charges of false accounting which he denies. He could stand trial on his own. Yesterday, the SFO said only that it was too early to consider its position on Mr Turner's case. Mr Nadir was first arrested at Heathrow Airport in December 1990 on his return from a trip to Turkey. He was initially charged with 18 counts of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 25m. As the investigation proceeded, the charges mounted until he faced 66 charges involving almost Pounds 120m. However, in June 1992, Mr Justice Tucker, the trial judge, ordered the dismissal of 46 of the charges, These referred to money transfers from Polly Peck to Unipac, a subsidiary. The charges were later trimmed again to the current 13 which formed the final indictment on which he would be tried. Mr Nadir always protested his innocence and maintained that proof of this could be found in northern Cyprus. The fact the SFO had never considered it necessary to visit there angered him deeply. As the case continued, Mr Nadir's health broke. He suffered from a severe depression which left him unable to instruct his solicitor for several weeks and having to seek psychiatric help.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Yongping 0491 3057 1627: "Has U.S.-Russian </F> `Partnership' Matured?"]    [Text] The world's focus on relations between the United  States and Russia, which are no longer opponents, reached a high  tide from 12 to 15 January. During the first three or four days  of this year, U.S. President Clinton made his first official  visit to Russia since assuming office. It was the second  official meeting between the heads of state of the two countries  after their April 1993 meeting in Vancouver.    Russia has said that the talks at the most recent meeting  had  "very enriched contents and were most businesslike and  substantial" compared with all previous summits. Leaving aside  a dozen important documents signed between the two sides, the  "Moscow Declaration" signed by the two presidents shows that  Clinton presented a new thing during his current trip, that is,  he announced that the United States and Russia have entered "a  new and mature stage of strategic partnership." Apparently,  this new formulation constitutes a big step forward compared  with the U.S.-Russian ties which had changed from being  opponents during the "Cold War" to the "strategic partners" they  declared to be at the Vancouver summit nine months ago. How  could the United States and Russia, the long-standing enemies  during the "Cold War," cause their recently established ties of  "strategic partnership to mature" within the short period of  only 9 months and then enter a "new stage"? Is it a diplomatic  miracle or merely a political show?  <H5>  Each Side Has Its Own Intentions </H5>   The Moscow meeting was held at a time when there were  various  complicated factors in the international situation and the U.S.  and Russian domestic situations. Russia's radical reform  measures suffered setbacks and the ultranationalist forces were  on the rise at home; there was a strong demand in the United  States to "be cautious in maintaining relations with Russia";  and turbulence continued in Europe and the disputes over whether  East European countries and the former Soviet Union should join  NATO were intensifying. These scenes formed the background to  the latestt U.S.-Russian summit.    Against such a background, the primary consideration for the  United States was to clearly state U.S. support for Yeltsin via  the summit, to exert an influence on Russia's political  situation. The United States has always believed that the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, and Russia's reforms aimed  at establishing a Western-style "democratic society," are the  greatest victories of the "Cold War." However, the unexpected  victory of the Russian Communist Party and ultranationalist  forces in the 1993 December parliamentary elections,  particularly the crazy "remarks" by Zhirinovsky, sent a warning  to the U.S. Government. Hence, helping Russia "steadily realize  the democratic transition" became an urgent task for the United  States to consolidate the "Cold War" victory and ensure the  establishment of a new international order. Second, placating  Russia through the establishment of the "mature strategic  partnership" to win Russia's support and cooperation in handling  the regional security and nuclear nonproliferation issues.  Although Russia is no longer a superpower following the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, its military strength and  geopolitical influence cannot be ignored. Moreover, it still  exerts a great influence on the countries of the former Soviet  Union and Eastern Europe and it would be unimaginable for the  United States to establish a new security structure in Europe  without Russia's support. The United States intends to make use  of Russia to check the tendency of Western Europe to drift away  from the United States so that it can play a leading role in  Western Europe and also exert an influence on the whole of  Europe, including the countries of the former Soviet Union and  East Europe.    Through the recent meeting, Russia tried to prove to the  United States its irrevocable reform and used promises (that is,  not allowing the pace of reform to slow down) in exchange for  U.S. economic aid and support for the Yeltsin government.  Through the establishment of an "equal" and "strategic  partnership," Russia also tried to show the world that "it was a  big country like the United States" and that the United States  had to admit Russia's "special status" and "leadership" over the  countries of the former Soviet Union and East Europe.  <H5>  False Display Exceeds Substantiality </H5>   During the recent meeting, both sides exchanged views on a  wide range of issues including Russia's domestic situation and  economic reform, Europe's security system, Ukraine's nuclear  problem, and the establishment of mutual trust and comprehensive  bilateral cooperation and reached a series of agreements. The  two sides also agreed to hold another two meetings between the  head of states before the end of the year.    To sum up, the following achievements were attained at the  recent meeting: First, the "Moscow Declaration" stated that the  United States and Russia had "entered a new stage of their  mature strategic partnership." The declaration set a high tone  for the current U.S.-Russian ties of cooperation. However,  whether Clinton and Yeltsin can continue to sing in a high tone  depends to a great extent on the future trend in Russia's  political situation and whether the changes in its foreign  policy can be brought into line with the United States. Viewed  from the recent changes in Russia's domestic situation, the  future is by no means optimistic. Second, Yeltsin told Clinton  that Russia "will continue its reform and not slow the pace"  while Clinton reiterated that the United States resolutely  supported Russia's "democratic market transformation." Clinton  also said that he will fulfill the economic aid promise made  after the Vancouver summit and declared that he had urged the  U.S. Congress to make a decision on offering Russia $900 million  in economic aid by the end of 1995. The United States also  agreed to reduce the tariffs on over 4,000 commodities imported  from Russia and to "work positively" to remove the trade  restrictions and discriminatory trade policy toward the former  Soviet Union. However, the United States failed to make new  offers on economic aid. As everyone knows, the West has merely  paid lip service rather than offering economic aid in the past.    Even if the promise on economic aid is honored, it will be  inadequate for Russia's ailing economy. As to Yeltsin's promise  of not slowing down the pace of reform, it has probably become a  rubber check following the dismissal of Gaidar and other  "reformers." Third, the two countries decided to stop targeting  their missiles against each other or their allies before the end  of May this year. This move seems to have dispelled the West's  nuclear phobia left over from the former Soviet Union. When  there is no mechanism to examine the implementation of this  agreement, however, it can only be a symbolic political game.  What is more, it is an easy technical job to resume the  targeting of these nuclear weapons. Fourth, the United States  and Russia jointly compelled Ukraine to sign the  Russia-U.S.-Ukraine Agreement on destroying all the nuclear  weapons in Ukraine within a prescribed time. This was regarded  by Clinton as a "breakthrough" in "strengthening the security  and stability of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia and the  world as a whole." Western media also believe that this is the  only substantial achievement scored in the recent summit.  Nevertheless, a demonstration against the agreement was held in  Ukraine during the signing of the agreement by the three  parties. The Ukrainian parliament ratified the agreement on 3  February but refused to approve the nuclear nonproliferation  treaty. As the political situation in Ukraine is unstable and  the people have heightened their vigilance against the rising  tendency of Russian nationalism, the Ukrainian Government will  encounter numerous problems in implementing the three-party  agreement. Since the destruction of nuclear weapons is to be  completed within 7 years, some experts believe that even if the  political troubles are ruled out, the question of Ukraine's  nuclear problem is far from being resolved technologically and  in terms of funds and timing.  <H5>  Not Yet Mature </H5>   Despite the achievements attained at the recent meeting and  the enhanced ties between the two countries, it is "probably too  early" to say that the two countries have entered a "mature new  stage of strategic partnership." According to the general  understanding, a "mature strategic partnership" refers, at the  very least, to ties of mutual trust, equality, and comprehensive  cooperation. Viewed from the current situation, however, the  United States cannot rest assured of the development of Russia's  domestic situation. Not long after Clinton met with and  extended his regards to Gaidar while in Russia, Gaidar and  Feyaodorov, who were regarded as "symbols of reform," left the  government. The U.S. media believe that this is a sign of a  slowdown in Russia's economic reform. After the meeting, some  American experts insisted that the rise in Russia's nationalism  and the forces of the former Communist Party constitute a  component part of Russia's political reality. Russia's internal  and external policies will undoubtedly be conditioned and  influenced by these forces. The uncertain factor in Russia's  policies toward the West will increase and trouble might crop up  in U.S-Russian ties. Because of Russia's unstable internal and  external policies, some experts of the U.S. Heritage Foundation  and Carnegie Endownment for International Peace believe that  U.S.-Russian "cooperation will reduce" and "the prospects are  dreadful." Regarding Russia, it also strongly distrusts the  United States. Even Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who is regarded  as pro-Western, expressed the following view: No Western power  has truly shown concern for Russia's revitalization. Such a  mentality of the two sides not trusting each other is bound to  affect the "strategic partnership" between the two countries.    Second, U.S. policy toward Russia is immature. During  Clinton's stay in Russia, the United States indicated that there  should be more "treatment" and less "shock" in Russia's reform.  When there were indications of a readjustment of the economic  reform policies introduced by the new Russian Government not  long after the meeting, the call within the United States urging  Russia not to slow down the pace of economic reform immediately  took the upper hand. Newly appointed deputy secretary of state  Talbot, who was ambassador-at- large to the former Soviet Union,  has openly said that if Russia slows down its economic reform,  "the date for it to receive the $1.5 billion loan from the IMF  will continue to be postponed." The U.S. Congress also  criticized Clinton once again for putting all his stake on  Yeltsin. Thus, it can be seen that U.S. policy toward Russia  can mature only after a period of exploration.    Third, U.S.-Russia cooperation on international issues is  limited. During the recent meeting, although Yeltsin expressed  support for NATO's establishment of a "peaceful partnership"  with Eastern Europe, he also said that it was one of the options  for building a new Europe. In fact, Russia still keeps a wary  eye on the U.S. eastward strategy. Regarding the region covered  by the former Soviet Union, Clinton stressed at the meeting that  the "independence gained by Russia's neighbors must be  respected" and hoped that "Russia could totally withdraw its  troops from the three Baltic states this year." Yeltsin once  again indicated that Russia assumed a "special status" and  "leadership" over the region of the former Soviet Union. The  tunes by the two leaders were not in harmony. In his State of  the Union Message on 25 January, Clinton pointed out that action  by the Russian troops in the neighboring countries should be  taken only in light of the agreements reached with the parties  concerned and based on international rules. Apparently, the  purpose was to check Russia's "re-expansion" in the former  Soviet Union. On the second day after Clinton's remarks,  Zhatulin, chairman of Russia's CIS Affairs and Overseas Russian  Liaison Committee, told the press: "Everyone knows that these  nations (countries of the former Soviet Union) are within  Russia's sphere of influence." On other international issues  involving their vital interests, the two countries will not  easily make concessions for the sake of the so-called "strategic  partnership."    In a word, the strategic interests of the two countries and  their geopolitical positions determines their so-called "global  strategic ties of cooperation" can only be established on the  basis of bargaining and maintaining the interests of each side.  Being opponents as well as partners, rivalry as well as  cooperation will continue as the main line of U.S.-Russian ties  for some time to come.</p>

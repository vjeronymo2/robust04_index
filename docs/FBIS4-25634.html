			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Neville de Silva, Diplomatic Editor] </F>   [Text] Fears are mounting among Hong Kong-based diplomats  that China may plant spies and informers in consulates by  imposing new recruitment rules for local staff after 1997.  These fears stem from indications that China will introduce a  Foreign Ministry-run government agency which will supply all  local staff to foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong, a  practice which now operates in China. Some consulates have  already been examining ways to tighten up security, including  the access of local staff to sensitive information.    Concerns were heightened following comments earlier this  month by Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the local branch  of China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Mr Zhang told German  journalist Peter Seidlitz that China would establish a foreign  affairs office in Hong Kong which would be in charge of all  major affairs. "All issues of foreign affairs in Hong Kong will  be unified and dealt with under the management of the central  government in Beijing," he was reported as saying. He did not  spell out the issue of local staff recruitment.    The local branch of XINHUA refused to comment when THE  HONGKONG STANDARD asked about central recruitment being extended  to Hong Kong.    If it happens, Hong Kong-based consulates would no longer be  able to recruit their own staff but would have to apply to the  Chinese office to fill their staff needs. Some countries are  expected to voice their disapproval if China decides to extend  the practice here.    Hong Kong staff working at various diplomatic missions are  also worried about their future after 1997. Some have already  voiced their concerns to their employers. Some fear for their  jobs while others believe they may be forced to provide  information.    The central recruitment system, followed by most communist  countries, allows the host nation to infiltrate "suspect"  diplomatic missions and plant bugs, spies and informers inside  foreign consulates and diplomatic households. Diplomats who  have served in the former Soviet Union and communist capitals in  eastern Europe told THE HONGKONG STANDARD they had to be alert  because they did not know whether local staff were genuine  employees or intelligence personnel working as clerks,  interpreters, drivers, and even cleaners. "It was always a  strained relationship for one didn't know who one could trust,"  a diplomat, who had served in the former Soviet bloc, said.    Several diplomats said that if Beijing introduced the  central  recruitment system here, the same strained relationship that  prevailed in China would come to Hong Kong too. "This would be  a very unfavourable development. We would have to keep local  staff at arms' length as happened in other communist capitals,"  a senior Western diplomat said. Other diplomats said it was  unlikely China would create an unnecessary problem by extending  the practice to Hong Kong.    But diplomats who were concerned about central recruitment  argued that after 1997 some of the diplomatic missions would  assume greater importance. "Naturally Beijing would like to  know what we are up to, particularly since Hong Kong has a  democracy movement which is seen as subversive. These are  matters we would have to report on and Beijing would like to  know what we have to report back home."    The British-Hong Kong governments prefer not to raise the  issue in the hope that Beijing will not give it any thought.</p>

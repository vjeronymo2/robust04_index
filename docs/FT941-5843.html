			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Introducing the dust meter The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has developed a process for measuring how much dust industrial materials produce during manufacturing processes. The method is intended to provide a single standardised way of measuring the dustiness of a wide range of materials. The process involves a rotating drum, which repeatedly lifts and drops the material, producing an airborne dust cloud. This determines the size and type of dust that can enter the nose and mouth. A complete set of engineering drawings of the prototype for the new tester is included with a report into the issue. HSE: UK, 0742 892345</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Apprehension ahead of US data turns to relief The story of the week and of this year, apprehension ahead of US economic data, turned to relief yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. US payrolls growth came in below expectations. Reports that Iraqi troops were moving towards Kuwait put an dampener on bourse proceedings early in the afternoon but, later, lifted crude prices, and some of the oil majors in Europe. FRANKFURT ended slightly lower on the session, registering a new 1994 official closing low for the third day in a row. The Dax index fell 0.44 to 1,960.59, 2.5 per cent down on the week in turnover up from DM6.4bn to DM6.6bn. After hours the picture improved, the Ibis-indicated Dax moving 12.26 higher to 1,977.67 over 24 hours. Stars of the day included shares recently depressed, like the inter-related Deutsche Bank and Metallgesellschaft, which recovered DM21.30 to DM696.20, and DM11 to DM139 respectively. Analysts attributed the Deutsche Bank gain to restructuring measures, aimed at helping the bank gain a better market position. Metallgesellschaft said yesterday that its bank debts shrank to DM4.1bn by the end of 1993-1994 from DM7.6bn a year earlier. Schering, moved recently by prospects for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis drug, fell DM25 to DM895, maintaining its weakness throughout the day. Analysts said that the shares reacted to news that Biogen, the US biotechnology company, would be producing data on its own ms drug in San Francisco on Monday. PARIS was looking at yet another new 1994 low at one stage in the day as the CAC 40 index fell to 1,825.36, but it posted a technical rebound to close 13.00 higher at 1,856.38, 1.2 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of FFr2.83bn. Oils moved with the Kuwait news and crude prices, Elf Aquitaine rising FFr7.50 to FFr373.30, and Total by FFr7.90 to FFr314. The water companies, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux, put on FFr13.90 at FFr481.90 and FFr9.90 to FFr488.40 as the political bears ended hostilities for the time being. However, the scandal-tainted stocks did not all have a good day. Schneider, which has been at odds with the Belgian authorities, fell FFr8.10 to FFr371.90 on apparently good half year figures, after rising FFr6.60 in advance of them on Thursday. MILAN resumed its slide, losing 2.2 per cent, as the conflict between the government and the judiciary deepened. The real time Mibtel index fell 222 to 10,094 with news of a search by fiscal police on the offices of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group providing the day's installment of drama. The index lost 6.9 per cent over the week. One Milan dealer commented that the market was trading in conditions of 'huge political confusion'. He added that mutual funds data earlier in the week indicated that equity funds already had near-record portfolios and were unwilling to commit fresh cash while all but the most speculative of foreign investors were keeping a low profile. Ferruzzi fell L64 or 4.4 per cent to L1380, after a low of L1,350, and Montedison was L34 or 2.7 per cent down at L1,213, after a low of L1,138. The declines followed rumours, denied by the companies, of forthcoming capital increases. ZURICH finished higher in the wake of the US data, and the SMI index rose 12.1 to 2,496.9, but was down 1.5 per cent on the week. Investors turned the spotlight on insurers on the perception that after developments at Swiss Re, more of the smaller companies could become takeover targets. Swiss Re added SFr11 to SFr699. Baloise rose SFr50 to SFr2,645 and Berner, in which Germany's Allianz has a 30 per cent stake, rose SFr150 or 12.2 per cent to SFr1,380. AMSTERDAM recovered from early weakness ahead of US employment data, helped by the bond market's subsequent recovery and Wall Street's firmer opening. The AEX index closed up 2.09 at 392.87, but still 2.3 per cent lower on the week. Royal Dutch Petroleum was Fl 2.30 at Fl 187.50 as oil prices rose on the Kuwait reports. Some cyclical issues moved higher in a technical correction after recent falls, but chemicals were weak. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 74.10 but Akzo Nobel closed down 70 cents at Fl 196.10 and DSM was 60 cents lower at Fl 137.10. HELSINKI, closing early, was hit by sharp falls in the telecoms-based conglomerate, Nokia, and in forestry shares, the Hex index closing 38.7, or 2.1 per cent lower at 1,831.8, 3 per cent down on the week. Nokia dropped FM14 to FM525.

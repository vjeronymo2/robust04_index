			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: The bear necessities of Aspen life - Skiing NOW THAT winter is almost here and the first snows have dusted America's magnificent Elk range of mountains with a fresh white mantle, Aspen's townsfolk are breathing a sigh of relief. The bears are about to begin their big sleep. Guests can now sleep easy in their beds, too. Last April 1, telephone calls about a bear on the lower half of Ajax Mountain in Colorado during ski-racing were at first dismissed as an April fool's joke, until someone actually saw the bear padding up Spar Gulch, one of the resort's most popular ski trails. It had been hibernating in an old mine-shaft and - perhaps roused by the sound of the race tannoy - had woken up early. It was to be the first of many bear-sightings in the Rockies' most famous resort, many riffling through dumpsters and exploring garages. In Crested Butte, just across the Elks, a jogger was joined by a bear for his morning run. It chased him down the mountain track. Fortunately he was able to out-run it until he reached the sanctuary of the town. Then, in May, the unthinkable happened: in the middle of the night a bear swaggered into the grounds of Aspen's newest and most prestigious hotel, the Ritz Carlton, and took a dip in the swimming pool. If the news leaked out, the hotel reasoned, there would have been panic which could have sent its pampered guests running for cover. Not good publicity. The bear's bloodied footprints were spotted at daybreak by a security man. The security camera was played back; sure enough, there was the shadowy figure of a substantial brown bear lowering itself into the water. It was timed at 3.40am. The bear swam around for 12 minutes and then - in its struggle to get out - damaged a foot with the claws of the other. Hence the trail of footprints. The pool was drained, cleaned and refilled, and the story was hushed up - until weeks later, when the news leaked out. Far from driving customers away, the story raised the hotel's profile. Is it bears or people who are the problem? 'Some people try to attract bears so they can watch them,' says the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW). 'That's like free ice-cream to the bear. It starts poking around the house and the people call us and want the bear removed.' According to the authorities, people - including holidaymakers - need to realise they are living in the bears' backyard. 'People move here to appreciate nature and enjoy the wildlife, yet they worry every time a bear walks through their backyard,' says Mike McLain, the wildlife supervisor in Telluride, another famous Colorado ski town. 'They have to take some responsibility for their choice of living here. Yet every time a bear turns up, they ring us and ask us to remove it.' With the bears safely out of harm's way, Colorado can get on with the new ski season. Breckenridge, the favourite resort for British skiers, has been sold by its Japanese masters and gobbled up by Ralston Purina, which manufactures dog food among other things. It also owns the rival resort of Keystone and Arapahoe Basin. Ralston now owns every resort in Summit County's 'Ski The Summit' alliance except Copper Mountain. Will it go for the grand-slam? Aspen, too, has been buying up the opposition: after years of being a small but irritating thorn in Aspen's side, the maverick resort of Aspen Highlands has finally fallen into its famous neighbour's clutches. Stand by for ski wars: Aspen's four mountains vs Summit County's 10. Also stand by for another heroic British performance in Aspen's 24-hour endurance race for charity, in which racers in teams of two spend all day and all night launching themselves down Aspen's steep cruising trails at speeds approaching 90 miles an hour, completing serial descents in around two minutes 30 seconds. Does anyone know - or care - that two British skiers, Malcolm Erskine and Mike Jardine, astonished everyone in town last winter by coming fourth? The racers can only take 12-minute rests each time they return to the top of Ajax in the Silver Queen gondola, and towards the end of the marathon some of them start hallucinating: pink elephants and catfish were mentioned. The idea of Brits coming to Aspen, skiing the mountain 80 times in 24 hours and seeing off a lot of European and North American skiers is almost too good to be true. This year the self-effacing Erskine, once in the British ski team, is coming back with a new partner, Mark Blyth, a former British junior champion, for another attempt. Perhaps if more young British skiers took advantage of free skiing in neighbouring Crested Butte every year - the only resort in the world I know of that offers free skiing before Christmas - we would have promising young racers in greater numbers. This winter Crested Butte is going one better. The resort is offering beginners taking its 'Quick Start' courses their money back if they are unable to ski from the top of the Keystone lift to the bottom.

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES WON'T CHANGE GWYNN'S 3-YEAR PACT  </P> <P> The Padres will not renegotiate the final three years of all-star outfielder  Tony Gwynn's contract, Jack McKeon, Padre manager, vice president/baseball  operations, said Sunday night, and will not adhere to public pressure.  </P> <P> McKeon, continuing to back the guidelines set by Padre owner Joan Kroc, also  said Sunday that the Padres will not alter their policy of offering contracts  longer than three years to any player.  </P> <P> "We have a club policy, and that will continue," McKeon said. "There wasn't any  renegotiations in the past, and there won't be any renegotiations in the  future.  </P> <P> "If a player signs a contract, then they have to live up to it.  </P> <P> "Hey, if I renegotiate one contract, I'll have to renegotiate them all. And  that's just not going to happen."  </P> <P> Gwynn, a four-time batting champion, will be the seventh-highest paid player on  the team in 1990, earning $1 million. His salary rises to $2 million in 1991  and the club has an option for $2 million in 1992. Yet, even with the salary  raises beginning in 1991, he still will be paid less than center fielder Joe  Carter, who was acquired last week by the Padres.  </P> <P> Besides Carter, Gwynn will be paid less five other teammates in 1990: first  baseman Jack Clark ($2 million in 1990), pitcher Bruce Hurst ($1.6 million),  pitcher Craig Lefferts (three years, $5.3 million), pitcher Eric Show ($1.2  million) and pitcher Ed Whitson (1.025 million). None of the five players have  made the All-Star team since joining the Padres.  </P> <P> "He's the one who signed it," McKeon said. "He's the one who got the security.  We're not going to be changing it."  </P> <P> The Padres recently relented in their three-year contract policy when they  offered Cy Young free-agent reliever Mark Davis a four-year, $12 million  contract. But when Davis and his agents turned it down, asking for a five-year  deal, Kroc told McKeon to abandon negotiations, and do whatever it takes to  fill the void.  </P> <P> McKeon went out and signed free-agent reliever Lefferts of the San Francisco  Giants to a three-year, $5.35 million offer, and while he was at it, finalized  the Carter trade and signed free-agent left fielder Fred Lynn of the Detroit  Tigers.  </P> <P> "I keep hearing all this criticism about losing Mark Davis," McKeon said. "Hey,  don't blame Mrs. Kroc or anyone else. The fans of San Diego should be proud of  her efforts. She made him a fabulous offer, and even made an exception to the  club policy for him.  </P> <P> "It's the first time we ever offered a four-year deal since '83. She offered  him lifetime security. She even offered to meet him face-to-face two times.  </P> <P> "They're the ones who turned it all down. It's their loss, not ours.  </P> <P> "I totally support her. She made every effort to strengthen the club, and she  allowed me to make trades and sign free agents worth more than $15 million to  ensure that the fans of San Diego will be well represented by the ballclub.  </P> <P> "How can you be blamed for that?"  </P> <P> Kroc put the club up for sale at the end of the season, and said that  negotiations are in the final stages. The sale of the club is imminent, she  said, and is hoping to announce a new owner by the end of the month.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Chinese and  foreign companies have won the bid for three major parts of the  World Bank financed Xiaolangdi water control dam construction  project on the middle reaches of the Yellow River.    The Inpergilo company of Italy, the No. 14 Water Conservancy  and Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau of China, and Dumiz Company  of France and the No. 6 Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric  Engineering Bureau of China, which are selected among more than  30 Chinese and foreign companies, have been given the jobs of  building the dam, culverts and spillways, and facilities for  generating electricity.    They have formed two international joint management groups  to  achieve best effect and will soon start work on the construction  site.    Xiaolangdi water control dam is among the first of its kind  in China to select builders through international bidding and  the practice is in accordance with requirements of the World  Bank.    Earlier reports also showed that the Xiaolangdi water  control  project, situated 40 km north of Luoyang city, Henan Province,  has won a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank.    As a project to introduce World Bank loans, the Xiaolangdi  water control dam has received the assessment of 15 delegations  sent by the World Bank since 1988.    Through concerted efforts from Chinese and foreign experts,  the Xiaolangdi Dam is believed to have basically met the  requirements for appraisal from the World Bank in aspects such  as engineering technology, dam safety, relocation of people,  budgetary estimates of projects, economic and financial  analysis, consultancy of supervised management in construction,  training program of technical workers, and the drafting of the  tender documents.    Preparatory work for the Xiaolangdi water control project,  which was initiated in September 1991, has been completed ahead  of schedule after two years' efforts from 15,000 builders.    The preparatory work has cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about  137 million U.S. dollars). It includes facilities for  transport, water and electricity supplies, telecommunications  and facilities to house the construction workers, according to  earlier reports.    The relocation of the first 10,000 local residents in the  construction area -- mainly in Jiyuan and Mengjin Counties of  central China's Henan Province -- has also come to an end, with  full support from local governments and farmers concerned. At  the same time, the Ministry of Water Resources has also  established a department in charge of construction and a  department responsible for supervised management in accordance  with international common practices, as well as management  information system of projects.    More than 300 supervisory engineers have been brought in  from  across the country to attend training courses where lectures are  given by World Bank officials.    When completed, the Xiaolangdi water control project will be  the largest conservancy works on the Yellow River and will be  China's second biggest after the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang  Jiang. It will play an important role in diverting the Yellow  River flow, preventing floods, generating power and controlling  sediment, according to experts.    The experts say that the entire project, which will take 11  years to finish, together with other reservoirs nearby, will  enable the lower reaches of the Yellow River to absorb a flood  of a magnitude that occurs only once in one thousand years.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Another good day for bourses as oil majors rise Bourses had a good day overall in spite of easing in the afternoon as Wall Street found it difficult to sustain an early advance, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS kept on the positive track with a rise in the CAC-40 index of 27.97, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,128.22. Activity was concentrated mainly in oils, as investors reacted to the rise in the price of crude and suggestions that some US investment funds had been switching aggressively out of other sectors. Elf Aquitaine gained FFr16.40 at FFr394.40 and Total FFr9.20 at FFr316.50. The shares had been under pressure since reaching 1994 highs early in February: Elf has slipped by 8.6 per cent and Total by 10.5 per cent. Suez, which pleased with its return to profits in 1993, improved FFr9.30 to FFr323.60; Alcatel rose FFr9 to FFr673 ahead of results, released after the close, which came in much as expected. FRANKFURT showed some enthusiam for laggard stocks, and more for the currently fashionable cyclicals, as the Dax index rose 32.91 to 2,191.20 on the session, before drawing back to 2,184.89 after hours. Turnover was reported as thin after Tuesday's DM6.7bn. Among the laggards, Allianz, the insurer, acknowledged a small cut in repo rates and hopes for a discount rate cut next week as it advanced DM62 to DM2,665 for a two-day gain of DM112. In the same sector, Munich Re went ex-rights worth DM299 a share, and rose a net DM79 to DM2,980. In construction, said Mr Matthias Welticke of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Hochtief and Holzmann may have caught the eye of funds looking for recent underperformers, and ready to place their first-quarter inflow. The shares moved ahead DM32 to DM1,092 and DM40, or 4.5 per cent, to DM925 respectively. In carmakers, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen all had respectable gains but they were outperformed by Bayer and Hoechst in chemicals, the former enjoying the second day of a big buy order as it rose DM11.30 to DM393.10 after a rise of DM8.60 on Tuesday. AMSTERDAM built on Wednesday's good performance with major international stocks pulling ahead. The AEX index finished up 7.41 or 1.8 per cent at 412.81. The day's activity was helped by the bounce in Wall Street overnight, as well as a solid gain by Royal Dutch which has lost some 9 per cent in value since its year high at the end of January. The shares closed up Fl 5.20 at Fl 193.70, with traders putting the gain down mainly to short covering, while it was also seen to be tracking the performance in London of Shell, lifted by the general improvement in sentiment for oil stocks. MILAN overcame some early nervousness to resume its advance although Mr Silvio Berlusconi broke off talks on a new government with his right wing allies. The Comit index finished 7.99 higher at 732.52. Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan commented that investors remained confident a right-wing government could be formed. He said that hugely liquid domestic funds continued to buy while foreign investors, still focusing on an improving economic and corporate outlook, were refraining from taking profits after the market's recent surge. Construction stocks had a good day on hopes that a new government will boost building and public words. Italcementi rose L520 or 3.4 per cent to L15,801, Cogefar added L74, or 3.5 per cent to L2,221 and Calcestruzzi put on L853 or 6.8 per cent to L13,355. Telecommunications saw a rare day of profit-taking: Stet retreated L38 to L4,748 and Sip L33 to L5,797. ZURICH was propelled higher by a strong financial sector, the SMI index adding 22.9 at 2,830.2. CS Holding bearers, the most active issue, rose SFr9 to SFr634 after news that the group had raised its stake in its CS First Boston investment banking affiliate, in response to a request from small shareholders. SBC registered put on SFr6.50 at SFr210 and Winterthur registered firmed SFr20 to SFr700. Brown Boveri moved forward SFr21 to SFr1,203: the heavy engineering group said it had won a Dollars 150 power plant order from Iran. MADRID's general index rose another 3.13 to 322.16 as Tuesday's favourites maintained their appeal. Repsol rose Pta125 to Pta4,345 in line with oil stocks around Europe, and Telefonica another Pta50 to Pta1,780 in spite of a debate on tariffs, and the implementation of Spain's policy of opening up its telecommunications sector to an expected wave of foreign competition. ISTANBUL rose a further 7.7 per cent as the market continued to react favourably to the government's economic measures, announced late on Tuesday. The composite index added 1,358.21 at 18,859.18. However, while equities strengthened the currency weakened further against the dollar. The Turkish lira was effectively devalued by 28 per cent on Tuesday as the government announced its three-month austerity package, and yesterday the dollar climbed TL7,500 to end at TL39,500 on the interbank market.

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAUDING THE LITTER CLUB  </P> <P> In newspapers and on television we are hearing about the wonderful things  elementary schools are doing to improve our environment. What about the high  schools? My school, Calabasas High, is making a great effort to clean up our  school and environment.  </P> <P> Concerned students have started the Litter Club, which club has placed yellow  receptacles all over campus for aluminum cans. The public may bring cans to our  new recycling bin at the end of the ramp leading to the football field. Members  of the club are also planting trees on campus and in the Santa Monica  Mountains. Our Associated Student Body has canceled a car-washing fund-raiser  to conserve water.  </P> <P> When standing in line at the cafeteria window, I am hearing more and more  people ask for soda in a can instead of a Styrofoam cup. Eating areas are  becoming much cleaner because students are remembering to pick up their trash.  </P> <P> I would like to congratulate the Litter Club and all the people who have done  anything that can lead to a safer place to live.  </P> <P> ERICKA N.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 26 Mar (PL) -- A Cuban province is  responsible for the food supply for nearly one third of the  country, capital city included. To meet this objective, that  province is struggling to overcome the deep crisis affecting its  output and local economy.    Havana Province, with 600,000 inhabitants, 5 percent of the  country's productive soil, and a somewhat significant industrial  and scientific output, will have to stimulate substantial  improvements in agricultural commodities to nearly 3 million  people.    During a recent conversation between Hiram Gonzalez, head of  the provincial government, and the diplomatic corps accredited  in Cuba, a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had access, he  cited efforts to increase food and vegetable harvests, milk and  egg supplies, and sugar and tobacco production.    In order to better explain these issues, Gonzalez cited the  impact caused by the difficult situation through which the  island is going as a result of the U.S. economic blockade and  the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe.    For example, Gonzalez mentioned the death of more than  100,000 heads of cattle as a result of the shortage. He also  cited the significant drop in egg and milk production also due  to the inability to obtain half a million tons of needed fodder.    Despite the fertilizer and fuel shortages, Havana believes  it  can produce more than 12.5 million quintals of food and  vegetables during the current year, 3 million quintals more than  what was obtained during 1993 and which could result in an  improvement in the food supply to the people, in addition to the  production of 50 million liters of milk.    According to disclosed information, it is expected by  encouraging cooperative agriculture production through state  assistance it will be possible to ensure an increase in harvest  yields via a smaller work force and less technical measures.  Concurrently, the increasing cattle mortality rate has been  decreased by simply changing pasture systems.    The province is working to meet its sugar production targets  as well as its tobacco surplus. It has also announced the use  of five large cold storage plants and the completion of 36  scientific-productive plants already in operation.    Despite all these setbacks, the provincial government has  cited the fact there are no unemployed teachers or students  without a school in Havana. In addition, the infant mortality  rate stands at 9.9 per thousand infants born.    Adopted measures to ensure the continuation of these  advances, and as a result of the lack of more than 400  medications in Havana drugstores during 1993, include the  production of more than half a million doses of byproducts from  herbal medicine [derivados de la medicina verde], the use of  which has been greatly encouraged.    According to an announcement made by Gonzalez, industrial  production is in a depressed state, the reactivation of which  will depend on foreign investments in certain sectors.    Havana is also relying on specialized companies, such as in  cement production, electrical energy, ceramics, and aluminum,  among others, in addition to sugar factories.    We are under extreme pressures and experiencing significant  shortages, but we also have some very dynamic options to solve  these problems, the provincial leader explained to the foreign  diplomats. In conclusion, Havana's task is just one aspect of  the efforts the entire country is undertaking to deal with the  most complex phase of its history.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / French debate central bank's regulatory role FRANCE'S debate on how to give its central bank autonomy in setting monetary policy - as required by the Maastricht treaty - has got under way with the Banque de France and the powerful Tresor department of the finance ministry taking opposing sides on the future of the central bank's other roles in regulating commercial banks, their solvency and liquidity. In a banking newsletter, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France, said he saw no reason to change the present system in which the Commission Bancaire, with the aid and close supervision of the Banque de France, controls commercial banks. 'The central bank regulates the liquidity of the banking system, which gives it (the central bank) a crucial importance in tracking the performance of commercial banks,' he said. Even in Germany, where supervision of commercial banks formally lies with an office in Berlin separate from the Bundesbank, the German central bank had a department which keeps an eye on the banking sector. By contrast, officials at the Tresor have been quoted in the press as suggesting that, if France does not adapt the German system, the Banque de France might find itself faced with a conflict of interest. If, for instance, the central bank, as lender of last resort, had to provide emergency liquidity to a commercial bank in trouble, it might undermine its own monetary policy. Any paring down of the Banque de France also worries leaders of the central bank's 18,000 employees. They have sought - and won - from Mr de Larosiere assurances that he will try to maintain the central bank's role. Many of the key elements - such as the security of tenure for board members of an independent central bank - are set in the treaty of Maastricht, and are therefore in the brief which the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, last Friday gave his finance minister, Mr Edmond Alphandery, to prepare a draft statute on the Banque de France's future. On Friday, Mr Balladur spoke of giving the Banque de France 'a very broad autonomy'. The fact that he did not use the word 'independence' has been interpreted by some as indicating that he intends to let the central bank keep a banking supervision role, which in contrast to the area of monetary policy, would still be subject to government influence.</p>

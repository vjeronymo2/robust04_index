			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Spain bucks easier European trend - Turnover on continental bourses in February Turnover on European bourses, with the exception of Spain, eased back last month after a strong January but was still above levels seen in the last two months of 1991. Mr James Cornish, who compiles the data for County NatWest, says the easier trend has continued into March on most European markets, as investors wait for prices to come back before making further purchases. 'It is more of a pause than a sell-off,' he says. For example, turnover in Germany has tailed off ever since the market peaked in early March. Looking at the February data, Germany showed the most resilience, down only 6 per cent on the month and up 29.8 per cent on the average for the November-January period. German volume fell back in the middle of February as the market moved sideways but picked up again towards the end of the month as domestic and foreign buying resumed. French turnover dropped 17.7 per cent last month, the second worst fall after the UK, and was 1.6 per cent below the three-month average. Volume improved late in February as the index rose sharply, but it has since fallen back in March, partly as a result of school holidays. Spain saw turnover increase by 4.8 per cent in February as foreign investors bought blue chips in anticipation of lower interest rates - the central bank duly obliged the market towards the end of the month - and on optimism about inflation and the economy. Turnover remained buoyant during the first two weeks of March, but has since declined on news of worse than expected inflation data for February. Daily turnover has contracted to Pta10bn from between Pta16bn to Pta24bn. Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Securities says the disappointing inflation numbers have put back any chance of a further fall in interest rates by at least two months. However, some domestic analysts are still confident that another cut will occur in April. 'There is nothing to drive the market in the short term apart from international events,' adds Mr Hughes. The company reporting season is over for now and there are few developments on the corporate scene to revive turnover. Looking further ahead, however, the government's plans to reduce its stake in the oil producing and refining group Repsol from 66.5 per cent to 50 per cent, and the likelihood of a 1 1/2 per cent cut in the central bank's intervention rate to 11 per cent, should renew interest in Spanish equities later this year. The UK showed the biggest drop in volume terms in February, losing 18.7 per cent on the month and down 3.7 per cent on the three-month average, as general election uncertainties mounted. Another casualty last month was Switzerland, which fell 17.4 per cent as hopes of lower interest rates came to nothing. A weak Swiss franc has also weighed on equities.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                 Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse               Nov        Dec        Jan        Feb       US                     1991       1991       1992       1992   Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            39.40      32.30      55.85      46.72        1.39 France            102.02     111.08     141.18     116.18       20.87 Germany            91.47      66.00     134.30     126.20       77.05 Italy           7,105.40   6,342.00   9,665.20   8,948.80        7.28 Netherlands        11.97       9.81      16.10      14.10        7.65 Spain             529.26     671.36     637.26     667.83        6.47 Switzerland        10.50       7.70      13.20      10.90        7.34 UK                 29.36      26.44      36.40      29.61       52.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

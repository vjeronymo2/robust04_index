			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE SWIMMER WON'T RETURN TO HIS HOMELAND  </P> <P> A member of China's national swimming team who fled from Hong Kong on Oct. 4  said he plans to remain in the United States until his country "settles down."  </P> <P> Yang Yang, 20, told a news conference here Thursday that he has no immediate  plans to seek asylum in the United States although he supports the  pro-democracy movement. He said his main wish "is to return home once the  country settles down and there is freedom and democracy."  </P> <P> Yang said that, although he never was politically active in China, he was one  of the approximately 1 million demonstrators in a pro-democracy rally in Hong  Kong after the June 4 retaliation against dissident students at Beijing's Tian  An Men Square. He said his participation in the rally could lead to persecution  if he returns to China.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he has a visitor's visa that his attorney said could be extended for  a year or more. Yang said he plans to learn English and participate in  conferences about China.  </P></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Telephone charges set to fall as BT agrees toOftel plans TELEPHONE charges are set to fall after BT yesterday accepted a stricter pricing regime. BT agreed to implement proposals by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, by keeping price changes on a range of services to 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. At present, price changes have to be kept to 6.25 per cent below inflation - as measured by the retail prices index. The new pricing regime, which will last for four years starting next August, means that BT's 19m residential and 6.5m business customers can expect real cuts in charges while inflation, currently about 4 per cent, stays below 7.5 per cent. One immediate benefit for consumers is that connection charges are set to come down by 40 per cent from Pounds 163.75 to Pounds 99. The agreement between BT and Oftel follows two months of heated negotiations during which relations between the two became increasingly strained. The City welcomed the decision by BT, whose shares closed up 1p at 333p. The agreement will lead to lower revenues, but the threat of being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was removed. According to Mr Peter Golob at SG Warburg Securities, this was 'a far greater threat than anything else'. While BT decided to accept all Oftel's main proposals, it said it had seriously considered rejecting them - a move which would have triggered a reference to the commission. This option was ruled out due to the uncertainty for the business and demands on senior management time. BT's decision contrasts with that of British Gas, which recently chose to go to the commission rather than agree to stricter price controls proposed by its regulator. However, BT criticised Oftel's tough stance, saying that its proposals represented 'a significant change in direction towards more interventionist regulation, which could impede the development of the truly competitive and open marketplace that everyone is aiming for'. The deal, which comes at a time when BT's profit growth is expected to come largely from cost cutting rather than additional revenue, puts more pressure on the group to reduce costs. It has already announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs this year, and a further 15,000 each year over the next two to three years. New telecoms licences, Page 7 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacquie Golding] </F>   [Text] The ANC plans to increase the health budget from 3.4  percent of GDP to 4 percent, raising government expenditure on  health care to more than R[Rand]12bn.    The hike, proposed in the ANC's national health plan  presented in Johannesburg yesterday, represents a shift from  11.5 percent to at least 13 percent of last year's Budget.    ANC health department head Dr Ralph Mgijima said the plan  set  out a five-year progamme to create a single, integrated national  health system based on effective primary health care and funded  through existing taxation.    "A single government structure will co-ordinate all aspects  of both the public and private health care delivery and all  existing departments will be integrated."    In addition to general taxation, ANC health advisers  recommended increased excise on tobacco and alcohol of up to 100  percent. They added that reduced expenditure by other  government departments such as defence could see extra funds  being diverted to health.    "Additional expenditure can be immediately derived by  increasing taxes on tobacco which will have an added effect of  reducing consumption," Mgijima said.    The plan, which includes a strong emphasis on building up  the public health service and discouraging expansion of the  private sector, was presented to Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma  yesterday and was likely to become official health policy.    The comprehensive plan, which also recommended the  zero-rating of basic foodstuffs, would be "thoroughly discussed"  with the Finance Department, said Mgijima, adding that the ANC  strongly supported moves to extend VAT exemption to medicines  and medical services.    As a means of achieving an equitable health care system, the  report urges the Health Minister to recommend next month that,  among other things, free medical services be provided to  children under the age of six, the elderly, the disabled and  pregnant and nursing mothers.    It also called on government to urgently appoint a  commission  of inquiry to examine the crisis in the medical aid sector and  to consider alternatives such as a compulsory national health  insurance system.    It proposed that, in addition to general taxation, health  care be funded by an insurance system based on employer and  employee contributions.    The proposed commission of inquiry is expected to  investigate  the economic feasibility of such an insurance scheme and  undertake planning if there is sufficient consensus on the  option.    The investigation into an insurance system would be based on  whether current medical schemes could form its basis and whether  existing schemes met specified statutory conditions governing  the health insurance system.    The ANC's health plan suggests that membership be compulsory  for all formal sector employees and their dependents and that  the health coverage provided by the scheme be statutory defined.    Existing health insurance companies and medical schemes  would  be free to offer "top-up" cover for services not covered in the  insurance package, said Mgijima, adding that the long-term goal  would be for all citizens, including the unemployed, to be  covered under the system.    An Econometrix senior economist said the zero-rating of more  basic foodstuffs was better than government food subsidies, and  said government could make up for the lost revenue by increasing  taxes on "luxuries" such as tobacco and alcohol.</p>

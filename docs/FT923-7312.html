			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Russia struggles to cast off its own chains - Potential for vast change is there, but not the means A YEAR after the failed coup, Russia has all the preconditions for freedom, but is not yet free. Through their actions many of its leaders have attempted to further the cause of freedom. But they are constrained, often very severely, by forces which the Soviet state created and sustained, and which the new leadership appears unable to change. This has been the legacy of last August's coup: the injection into the body politic of the former Soviet Union of the potential for vast change  - without the means, the experience or the institutions. The coup destroyed the already tottering edifice of the Soviet Union and the coercive apparatus of Soviet power. But it had little effect on the real constraints on the construction of a democratic state: the economic networks, the feudal-style provision of social and other services, and the psychological reflexes which seven Soviet decades had inscribed into the 15 member states. Thus the second 'Russian Revolution' can be called so only with qualifications. After all, so many of its citizens  - even its political class  - experienced it only through the media. In the industrial city of Cherepovets 400km north of Moscow, Mr Vassiliy Kovalov, the deputy mayor, heard the news on the radio and expected tanks, soldiers or at least party functionaries to appear on the square in front of the city hall. But nothing happened. Likewise in Perm, where Mr Andrei Klimov and other city deputies passed, on the second day of the coup, a motion defiant of the state of emergency  - and found their activity to have been the only coup-related move the city saw. By contrast, a group of businessmen from the southern city of Rostov-on-Don found themselves in the thick of it because they were attending a conference in Moscow on new economic structures, and were staying at the mammoth Rossiya Hotel just off Red Square. Yet, even at the epicentre, there was confusion. Says Mr Vadim Polovnikov, head of the Don Union of Businessmen: 'We went up to Red Square and asked one of the soldiers in the tanks what was happening. He said, 'You tell me, brother'.' The coup, whose competing symbolic centres were the Russian White House and the Soviet Kremlin, tilted the uneasy balance between these two sharply towards the former. The Kremlin then again became what it had been before the 1917 revolution  - the citadel of Russian power. The coup destroyed a Soviet president  - Mr Mikhail Gorbachev  - who dithered about the consequences of the reform process he had begun. It elevated to the position of first post-Soviet leader Mr Boris Yeltsin, who committed himself and his country to democratic and market change. The consequences are everywhere to be seen. In Cherepovets, Mr Kovalov backed the idea of hiring a western consultancy to advise on diversifying the town's economy, heavily skewed towards iron and steel and chemicals. It was the first such initiative in Russia. In Perm, Mr Klimov was the moving spirit behind the founding in January of the Perm Business Club, which took into its membership the new men of the banks and the exchanges, as well as the older heads of the big engineering and defence enterprises on which the economy of the town still depends. In Rostov, Mr Polovnikov took the chemical company he heads into 'private' ownership by creating a joint stock company whose shares were owned by the workforce. All felt themselves to be working in a new environment, taking risks, sailing into new oceans without charts. Throughout the central part of European Russia, the same processes are taking place. Foreign companies making deals for the export of metals are doing a roaring trade in Ekaterinburg, formerly Sverdlovsk, Mr Yeltsin's fief. In St Petersburg, joint ventures for the production of food and cigarettes are being concluded, a model private farm has been set up and a western store is about to open on the Nevsky Prospekt. In Moscow, private trading filled the city centre's pavements until it was chased into the side streets. The Ismailovo market for carpets, paintings, antiques and junk doubled, tripled, then quintupled in size. Western shops and restaurants open up at an accelerating rate. The market habit is spreading. But it is doing so within an overall framework of collapse, of colossal debt, and of increasingly ferocious in-fighting within the very circles which were victorious after the coup. In a year, the defenders of the White House have discovered that the prestige which accompanied them as they took office was ephemeral. For much of the past year, Mr Yeltsin the popularly elected President of Russia, retained a political dominance and a personal popularity. He now barely has the latter. Indeed, the latest opinion poll, commissioned by the Russian parliament, shows him outstripped for the first time by his vice president, General Alexander Rutskoi. To build on the breakthrough to democracy which the coup seemed to presage he will need to find support quickly, not just personally and in his presidential power, but in institutions independent of him. That means an elected parliament with which he can work; an independent judiciary to which his decisions can be submitted with a reasonable hope of being independently judged; and a constitution which both defines and constrains his powers. These are at best in embryo. The possibilities of August 1991 are now changing into the harder facts of August 1992. Russia is in rapid economic decline: there is no easy way out, no way of making the mass of people other than poorer, nor  - short of a reversion to a command economy  - any way of stopping the rich becoming conspicuously richer. Russia remains a nuclear state and a vast landmass. It can no longer pretend to be a genial giant which is everyone's friend, but must define its interests and alliances, especially with the other former Soviet states. Russia has almost no institutional structures for the pluralist market economy it says it wants to be, and is little nearer acquiring any. In Pravda, the former communist party newspaper, the voice of Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister during the coup and a flaccid co-conspirator in it, was recently heard from behind the walls of the Matrosskaya Tishina jail where he has languished for nearly a year. Heavily underscoring the worsening economic indicators since he was removed from the scene, Mr Pavlov said: 'The issue is one of the survival of Russia'. He is right there. The coup has ensured that 'Russia' rather than the Soviet Union is the central issue. But the survival of the transformation which the coup appeared to presage is still in doubt.</p>

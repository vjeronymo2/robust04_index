			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Frankfurter Allgemeine - Editorial The concern expressed that only national issues have been at stake in the European elections may be well-meant, but it is hardly politically thought out. The problem with the direct election to the European parliament is now, as it always has been, that the voters don't know what they are voting for. There is none of the normal confrontation between 'government or opposition'. . . Voters who are only roughly informed about the circumstances in other member states can hardly be expected to calculate the consequences of their votes. The Germans send a good 15 per cent of European members of parliament to Strasbourg; even if there were a massive level of support for one party, it would have only a modest effect on building a majority in the parliament - that is both unavoidable and logical. But it is also clear that it depresses the election turnout.</p>

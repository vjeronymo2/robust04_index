			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 24 (XINHUA) -- For ten days there has  been heated debate in the kremlin over whether President Boris  Yeltsin's decree to fight organized crime is timely or legal.    On June 14, the president decreed urgent measures to fight  organized crime, triggering the debates which are ongoing.    According to official statistics, about 5,600 organized  criminal groups, or mafia, exist in Russia, while the crime rate  has doubled over the past five years.    During the first five months of this year, a total of  1,094,000 crimes were reported, including 30,000 murders, 67,000  severe physical injuries, and more than 200,000 robberies and  thefts.    "Crime has already penetrated the centers of power and is  taking them over, extending its control over property, the  economy, the market and politics," warned Sergei Stepashin,  director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service.    The presidential decree gives law enforcement agencies  sweeping powers to detain suspects for up to 30 days and examine  the financial affairs of anyone suspected of engaging in  organized crime.    Under the decree, police and federal troops have the right  to  search offices and homes without a court order. However, the  human rights group 'Memorial' criticized the policy for  "sacrificing the principles of law and democracy."    The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, called on  Yeltsin Wednesday to halt his decree while accusing him of  violating the constitution.    On the same day, the lower chamber passed a resolution by a  vote of 279 to 10 with five abstentions, charging Yeltsin with  "restricting the constitutional rights and citizens' freedom  without sufficient basis." But Yeltsin stood firm by his  order, although he is well aware there may be some questions  about human rights violations contained in the decree, according  to his press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov.    However, First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov, a  supporter of the decree, made a gesture of compromise by  announcing "we will not detain anyone without the sanction of  the prosecutor's office."    Defending the police's right to detain suspects for up to 30  days without charge, Yegorov stressed that it was very hard to  pin charges on sophisticated gangsters within 48 hours as  required by the law.    This issue has also divided the upper chamber, which met  Thursday but failed to work out formal stand on the issue. Some  deputies criticized the presidential decree for ignoring civil  rights, while others called on the upper house to support  Yeltsin.    As the debate continued, police attempted to carry out a  massive raid against organized crime in Moscow earlier this week  with little success, it turned out, when a radio report revealed  the secret operation.</p>

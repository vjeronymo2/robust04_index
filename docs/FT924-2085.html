			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Proposal for chair of legal education  -Legal briefs Are UK lawyers receiving the education and training they need to meet the rapidly changing demands of practising law in the 1990s? In spite of new vocational courses from the Bar and the Law Society and a general shift in attitudes towards the teaching of law in recent years, a significant body of opinion within the profession believes UK legal education is headed in the wrong direction. The problem facing the profession as it struggles to come to terms with the internationalisation of legal practice and rising public expectations about the quality of professional services, is how to determine the right direction. Evidence of dissatisfaction from end-users exists. Industry, for example, frequently complains of a lack of 'commercial awareness' among young lawyers. But no analysis is carried out to see what can be done to improve matters. Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the board of the University of London's Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, and Professor Terence Daintith, director of the IALS, believe the time has come to set up a chair of legal education in the UK to provide an assured capacity for research into the structure and content of legal education. The chair would be based at the IALS but funded externally. Prof Daintith estimates the cost of running the post for an initial five-year period at Pounds 118,000 a year. The bulk of the money will have to come from the practising profession, but both he and Lord Woolf are adamant that it will represent an excellent investment for the legal profession. It is not so much a question of can we afford it, but 'can we afford not to do it', Lord Woolf says.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Two options for Channel tunnel rail link THE GOVERNMENT is days away from announcing two possible routes to central London for the planned high-speed rail line linking the capital with the Channel tunnel. It is also expected to announce in the Budget tomorrow that the Pounds 2.5bn project will be a candidate for joint financing by the public and private sectors under new guidelines drawn up by the Treasury. The more controversial approach to central London would follow the route of British Rail's North London Line from Stratford to Dalston Kingsland in east London but run under the track in a tunnel. It would then surface to join the existing four-track North London Line through Canonbury, Islington and Barnsbury. After passing through Caledonian Road and Barnsbury station, trains would run south at a new junction and run into St Pancras station, where there is said to be enough room for an international terminal. The less controversial alternative route would go through a tunnel all the way from Stratford, ending at a new underground terminal beneath King's Cross station, which is next to St Pancras. The government has been forced to publish two alternative proposals because of a behind-the-scenes row over where the London terminus should be. Union Railways, the BR subsidiary in charge of the project, favours the St Pancras option because it is much cheaper than the King's Cross one. It fears that a more expensive project will not go ahead. British Railways Board, however, is fighting to preserve the King's Cross option because construction of an underground terminal forms part of its ambitious plans for a Pounds 1.4bn upgrade of the InterCity and suburban railway interchange at the station. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is believed to favour the Union Railways plan, but British Railways Board has refused to abandon its position. Rather than continue the argument, Mr MacGregor has decided to put both options to public consultation. The Union Railways option is likely to worry north London residents near the overground sections of the route because the link will carry high-speed commuter trains from Kent into central London as well as trains running between London, Paris and Brussels. Union Railways believes the line could be open by 2000 provided legislation is introduced this autumn and the funds are available. The government had hoped that the private sector would finance the scheme using revenues from train operators and property profits from the development of adjacent land. However, the depressed state of the property market means a contribution from the public sector is likely to be needed if the project is to go ahead.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Mexico in pole position yet again WALL STREET's historic breach of the 3,000 level changed the direction of the FT-Actuaries World Index last week. Overall, it rose 0.3 per cent in local currency terms. Excluding the US, the world was 0.1 per cent lower. Japan held the world back in spite of reports in midweek that the central bank was loosening its monetary policy. Speculation of an early cut in interest rates was fanned by last Friday's release of better than expected March money supply figures. From a technical standpoint the Nikkei average was unable to break decisively through the important 27,000 mark. Without Japan the world index would have risen 0.7 per cent last week. The best performer of the week and of the year to date was Mexico, which put on 9.5 per cent and 62 per cent respectively in local currency terms. Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton of Baring Securities attributed the advance to unabated buying of shares in Telmex, the telephone monopoly and a rise in foreign investment on optimism that the Free Trade Agreement between the US and Mexico will succeed. The government is due to make an international offering of its remaining Telmex shares next week, expected to raise over Dollars 2bn. Telmex has risen over 50 per cent to over Dollars 3 in the last month and now accounts for one-fifth of average daily market volume of Dollars 32m. However, it showed signs of tiring last Friday, which could herald a much-needed rest for the market, Mr Campbell-Lamerton says. Interest rates continued to steer most stock markets last week. Hopes of an early cut boosted Australia 5.1 per cent and New Zealand 4.4 per cent in local currency terms, while receding hopes of a reduction cost France a fall of 1.5 per cent and rising domestic rates left Sweden 2.2 per cent lower. Hong Kong lost 1.7 per cent on worries about the new airport project following the stalemate in negotiations between the UK and China.</p>

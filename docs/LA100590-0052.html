			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE SEEKS END TO ISOLATION;  </P> <P> POLICY: BUT A MEETING WITH JAPAN'S KAIFU YIELDS LITTLE. A TOP SOVIET AIDE  CARRIES A GORBACHEV MESSAGE TO BAGHDAD.  </P> <P> Iraq launched a diplomatic offensive Thursday in an effort to punch its way out  of international isolation, sending a senior official to Jordan to confer with  Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and announcing plans for similar meetings  with European officials.  </P> <P> Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraqi first deputy prime minister, conceded after meeting  with Kaifu that their talks had done little to bring Iraq closer to Japan,  which has pledged contributions of $4 billion to the multinational effort to  dislodge Iraq from Kuwait and to ease the economic hardships brought down on  some Middle East nations by the crisis. Japan has also sent medical teams to  the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Elsewhere on the diplomatic front, Yevgeny Primakov, a senior aide to Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, arrived in Baghdad with a message from his  chief. Its contents were not made public, but Primakov was quoted by the Soviet  news agency Tass as saying that the crisis must be resolved diplomatically in  order to "avoid a military explosion."  </P> <P> Primakov went to Baghdad from Amman, where he began his Middle East mission  Wednesday by meeting with Jordanian officials and Yasser Arafat, chairman of  the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> The United States, meanwhile, pulled the aircraft carrier Independence out of  the Persian Gulf, where it had arrived two days earlier. A Navy spokesman in  Washington said the Independence had completed its mission.  </P> <P> The Pentagon reported that the U.S. Navy boarded and diverted a Sudanese  freighter Thursday in the Red Sea after discovering that its cargo manifest did  not match its load of unspecified "industrial equipment."  </P> <P> The Sudanese ship, a 400-foot cargo carrier called the Blue Nile, was headed  toward the Jordanian port of Aqaba when it was stopped and boarded by a team  from the American guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts.  </P> <P> An inspection of the ship's cargo revealed the discrepancy between the goods  and the documentation, and the ship was ordered to change course.  </P> <P> The Blue Nile was the seventh ship diverted by U.S. warships since the naval  embargo of Iraq began in mid-August. A total of 170 ships have been boarded and  inspected by officers from allied navies in the Persian Gulf region, 139 of  them by U.S. personnel.  </P> <P> Baghdad's Ramadan, who is believed to rank second only to President Saddam  Hussein in the Iraqi leadership, insisted at a news conference here that the  fact that the Kaifu meeting had taken place proves that Iraq is committed to  finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it created by invading Kuwait on Aug.  2.  </P> <P> It was a rare public appearance for Ramadan, who was accompanied by two dozen  security men in business suits. He used the news conference to make one of the  clearest statements yet on Iraq's position in the crisis.  </P> <P> He linked Iraq's occupation of Kuwait directly with Israel's occupation of the  territories it seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Also, he said Iraq will  withdraw the 430,000 troops it has in Kuwait if Israel agrees to withdraw from  its occupied territories, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Iraq, he  emphasized, will not withdraw unilaterally from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Echoing what Hussein said in a speech Sunday, Ramadan rejected the idea of an  "Arab solution" to the crisis, as proposed by Jordan's King Hussein, among  others. He said that anything short of an agreement that also resolves the  Palestinian question would be "an aid to American terrorism."  </P> <P> Ramadan reiterated the argument that Iraq holds thousands of foreigners against  their will, some of them some aged and infirm, only as a deterrent to war.  </P> <P> "This situation has occurred to give peace a chance," he said.  </P> <P> Speaking in soft tones and puffing on a thin cigar, Ramadan reverted to  familiar Iraqi rhetoric when he spoke of the United States. He said Iraq will  retaliate swiftly against Israel if the United States strikes first.  </P> <P> "We'll make this entire region a cemetery for all aggressors," he said. "We  have decided not to fire the first bullet -- but if America starts it, they  will not be able to determine the end of the battle, the size of the  battlefield, or even where the battle will take place . . . including Israel.  The age of American terrorism, in which they had time to rule over Arab leaders  and rob their resources, is over."  </P> <P> Clearly, though, Ramadan intended to convey a message of peace, to present the  Hussein regime as reasonable and committed to resolving the situation without  resorting to force.  </P> <P> He also made it clear that Hussein intends to use diplomacy and the rhetoric of  peace as tools to probe for soft spots in the embargo that has closed Iraq's  ports. He assailed what he called the brutality of the embargo.  </P> <P> "The coming period," he said, "will witness more active (diplomatic) attempts .  . . in order to enlarge the dialogue between us and the European community. We  are confident that, just to ease the American domination, the will for a  peaceful solution exists in many Western countries, for a solution through the  path of war has no gain for anyone. The only beneficiaries from war will be the  Americans."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Ramadan gave King Hussein a letter from Saddam Hussein, and  some analysts said it may have contained an attempt to explain what the Iraqi  leader meant when he said in the speech Sunday that moderate Arab leaders were  "firmly in the ranks of the enemy."  </P> <P> Ramadan had words of praise for the king, who, he said, will play "a very  active role in opening the door to dialogue."  </P> <P> Also Thursday, the State Department said the United States has chartered  another flight for refugees from Kuwait and Iraq next week. A department  official said that about 100 people, not all of them Americans, are expected to  be on the flight. He said the Americans are primarily children with  non-American parents and siblings.  </P> <P> Last month, the State Department said it had completed the refugee airlift  because it had already evacuated all Americans who had permission to leave and  wanted to go. At the time, the department said that additional flights would be  arranged if there was a need for them.  </P> <P> The official said Thursday that Iraq has not relaxed its exit procedures but  that a number of people who have been free to leave all along have now decided  to do so.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated his assessment that  while all nations prefer a diplomatic solution, a growing number of U.S. allies  are willing to explore the possibility of military action.  </P> <P> Times staff writers John M. Broder and James Gerstenzang, in Washington,  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

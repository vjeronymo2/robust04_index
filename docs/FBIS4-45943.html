			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Dimension to India's Security"] </F>   [Text] While it is comforting that the position of the  United Kingdom on the Kashmir issue is not far from India's, the  continued double-speak on the part of the United States of  America cannot but cause serious concern because of the  ingredient of interference in our affairs. On top of its  departure from the already accepted position of Kashmir's  accession to India, the Bill Clinton administration's move to  make available to Pakistan 38 F-16 deep penetration strike  aircraft (DPSA) provided Islamabad agrees to a nuclear `cap' or  freeze through a so-called one-time exception to the Pressler  amendment clearly shows its partisan posture. The Pressler Law  bars economic and military aid since on its own assessment  Islamabad possessed the nuclear bomb. It is common knowledge  that the F-16 provides an effective delivery system for nuclear  weapons. The External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh's  assessment that the United States is encouraging Pakistan to use  nuclear weapons against this country should be regarded as a  genuine concern for it adds a new dimension to the internal  security of India. Pakistan already has 10 F-16s and was  supposed to get 71 more when the Pressler sanctions were  imposed. Eleven of the 71 aircraft were already built and paid  for but Pakistan could not get them because of Pressler. Under  the current proposal, if Pakistan `caps' its nuclear weapons  programme it is possible that up to 38 aircraft could be made  available.    The American postures and Pakistan's hectic activity  internationally, with the main thrust on false propaganda to  enlist sympathy of not only the Organisation of Islamic  Countries but of other western nations on the ground that India  had systematically violated human rights, should make New Delhi  prepare for any eventuality. And this demands not only national  discipline to brave the challenge, but all political parties  should also once again demonstrate that they are one in the  determination to thwart the designs of United States and  Pakistan. There is a suspicion that America has designs to see  that an independent Kashmir can be brought under its hegemony as  part of its secret plan to control the region. While such a  proposition is not only unacceptable to India it is also bound  to be opposed by countries like China and Iran, not to speak of  other Central Asian Republics.    The immediate consequence of the supply of F-16 aircraft to  Pakistan is the upsetting of the security arrangements in India  and it will be forced to beef up its defences, which may entail  enormous expenditure to the point of dislocating our own  developmental plans. This is one area where the nation cannot be  complacent and the people should be prepared for any sacrifices  that the situation demands. New Delhi would be well advised to  match the mischief of Pakistan perpetrated by its Inter-Services  Intelligence in a tit-for-tat manner rather than giving the  impression that India is complaining from a position of  weakness. By now it should be clear to the Indian Government  that Pakistan understands only the language of offensive and not  reason. Delhi should neither be apologetic nor go on the  defensive but take effective steps to thwart Pakistan's evil  designs, what with its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto,  becoming increasingly desperate, probably to save her political  power, and the growing opposition to her internally including  from her home province of Sind. The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha  Rao, had already hinted that his government would review or  reassess its defence policy to face the Pakistani challenge. And  that challenge can be met only by India going nuclear,  notwithstanding pressures and threats from the United States and  other western powers.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Heron completes sale of motor distributorship Heron International, the property and trading group run by Mr Gerald Ronson, will today complete the sale of the Heron Suzuki motor distributor to Suzuki Motor Corporation. However, the sale of Heron Suzuki - which was agreed last month - will do little to reassure Heron's creditors who were left in confusion last week after meetings of senior and junior bondholders were adjourned when they failed to reach a quorum. The bondholders' meetings had been called to consider Heron's request for a deferral of interest payments due on Thursday until the end of June. Because the interest has been left unpaid, the bonds are technically in default - though as yet no creditor has moved against the company. Heron, which completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing six months ago, had warned that without the interest deferral, and the postponement of other payments due, the property and trading group might be unable to continue trading. In the wake of the bondholders' meetings there has been some speculation that Heron might ask UBS, its financial adviser, to formulate proposals for the sale of the whole group. Yesterday, however, Heron said it had 'nothing to add' to its statements of last week. Heron expects to receive Pounds 75m from disposals by the end of June - Pounds 31m from the sale of Heron Homes and Pounds 44m from the sale of Heron Suzuki.</p>

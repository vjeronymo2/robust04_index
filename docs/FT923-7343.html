			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Jensen comes to end of the road JENSEN CAR Company, the manufacturer of high-performance sports cars for the rich and famous, is calling in liquidators. Officials from Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, yesterday made their first visit to the Jensen works in West Bromwich, West Midlands, to look over the books and property. Creditors are owed Pounds 638,000. The liquidators hope to sell the company as a going concern. The Pounds 100,000 Jensen cars are hand-built. But only one new car has been sold this year  - to Germany  - and there are no outstanding orders. Jensen, which went into receivership in 1976, has been supported financially for the past 18 months by Unicon Holdings of Stockport, which has decided to cut its losses. About 20 people work at the factory, which once produced cars for the likes of Clark Gable, Henry Cooper and Cliff Richard.</p>

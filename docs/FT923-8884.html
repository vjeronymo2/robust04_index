			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Tokyo slumps again  - At A Glance Shares in Tokyo fell once again yesterday, with the Nikkei average falling 408 points, or around 2.5 per cent, to 15,518. The continued falls in the Japanese market have been very bad news for unit trust investors in the area. The average Japanese unit trust has fallen nearly 40 per cent over the last year, and by nearly 46 per cent over three years, even with income reinvested. And only four unit trusts in the sector can report gains over a five year period.</p>

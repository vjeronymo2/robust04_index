			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- The French National  Assembly on Tuesday [3 May] began a debate on a controversial  bill laying down fines of up to 20,000 francs ($3,448) for  people using English words, when a French equivalent exists.    The bill, ridiculed abroad and contested by sections of the  ruling right-wing coalition, was nevertheless expected to be  voted in its essentials in second reading by the lower house of  parliament.    The upper house, the Senate, has already voted the bill with  communist and right-wing support while socialist senators  abstained, calling it "repressive" and "antiyouth." [passage  omitted]</p>

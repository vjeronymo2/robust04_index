			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALEMATE OVER STATE BUDGET CONTINUES;  </P> <P> FINANCES: LAWMAKERS TRADE INSULTS. DEUKMEJIAN INSISTS NO TAX INCREASE IS  NEEDED. THE STATE IS LEFT WITHOUT A BUDGET FOR THE 11TH DAY.  </P> <P> Progress toward a state budget agreement seemed to break down further  Wednesday, with lawmakers trading insults, Gov. George Deukmejian expressing  displeasure at a Senate-passed $50-billion state budget and one key lawmaker  saying further negotiations with other legislators seemed pointless.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to go home," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara),  chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, as fruitless deliberations  left California without a budget for the 11th day.  </P> <P> The absence of progress brought the machinery of state government ever closer  to the point when checks will stop going out to welfare recipients, state  employees and contractors who work for the state.  </P> <P> Until a budget is approved, the state controller's office lacks the legal  authority to issue checks. And state Treasurer Tom Hayes warned the governor  and lawmakers Wednesday that unless a budget is signed by July 17, delays will  begin costing the state more because of higher interest costs.  </P> <P> Lawmakers in the Senate had hoped that by passing a budget late Tuesday night,  they would -- as one put it -- "get the ball rolling" toward an agreement.  Instead, feelings just seemed to harden.  </P> <P> Representative of the mood in the Assembly were remarks, reported by the San  Francisco Chronicle, between Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) and  Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) over the Senate-approved  budget:  </P> <P> "They left us with a bag of dog doo on our doorstep, lit it on fire, rang the  doorbell and ran away," Baker said. Brown replied, "And we will not take it out  of the bag. We will simply return it to its owners in its original form."  </P> <P> Those and other comments left Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los  Angeles) in a funk, and he lashed out at Deukmejian, state Supt. of Public  Instruction Bill Honig and his critics in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Roberti said Deukmejian, with his intractable stance against tax increases, is  ignoring the financial strains created by waves of immigrants whose children  are crowding into classrooms and whose family needs are straining public health  and social services.  </P> <P> "He doesn't see the change in California," Roberti said of Deukmejian, adding  that if the governor took a close look at Hollywood he would find that "it's  not a recording-film center; it's Ellis Island."  </P> <P> As for Honig, Roberti accused him of being an ingrate for criticizing the  Senate budget after Democrats fought off efforts by Deukmejian and Republicans  to cut deeply into school funding. In the Roberti-backed budget, spending on  just about everything but public schools was reduced.  </P> <P> In his own news conference, Honig said that the Senate budget went "too far" by  cutting back $1.7 billion in proposed spending.  </P> <P> Roberti, saying he was "a little bit ticked," declared: "They are not living on  the same planet that the rest of us are. . . . If they are not happy with what  we did, what in the world do they want? Do we have to close the county  hospitals and put the money in schools? Do we have to close all the trauma  centers and put (the money) in teachers' salaries?"  </P> <P> Regarding his critics in the Assembly, Roberti challenged them to, in effect,  put a budget where their mouths are. "Now is the time for compromise, not  rhetoric," he said.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said the bitter exchanges,  coming at a point when talks should be progressing toward a solution, made the  current budget crisis the worst he's seen in his 13 years in the Legislature.  </P> <P> "It shows how desperate the situation is and how deadlocked things truly are,"  Roos said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as of today, the state has missed $627 million in payments to local  governments, in-home care workers and doctors, hospitals and others who care  for the poor under the Medi-Cal program. Also today, an additional $588 million  in checks are to be held up including a $139-million payment to counties to  meet obligations to welfare recipients.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Max Boot contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SENATE BUDGET-BALANCING PLAN  </P> <P>  The budget-balancing plan passed by the state Senate includes $1.3 billion in  new taxes and fees and $1.73 billion in program cuts. Under the plan, now being  considered by the Assembly, Gov. George Deukmejian would be expected to cut an  additional $550 million to provide a 3% emergency reserve.

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: To preserve, not destroy A HISTORY OF WARFARE by John Keegan Hutchinson Pounds 20, 432 pages TO SAY that war is a continuation of politics by other means is like saying divorce is a continuation of marriage by other means. Nonetheless the great military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said exactly that. Indeed it was a central tenet of his book On War (1832), which became the sacred text of generations of German staff officer. Clausewitz's advocacy of total war, involving vast, indoctrinated 'citizen' armies which could only be raised by conscription, lay at the heart of the Schlieffen Plan, and of Hitler's Wehrmacht. Understandably, no serious commentator on war has been able to ignore Clausewitz, and most have succumbed to his thrust. Among such commentators the historian John Keegan stands pre-eminent. His past publications, including The Face of Battle - a hugely absorbing reconstruction of Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme - have altered and enriched our perception of warfare as something hideously logical in its detail. Now comes A History of Warfare: not just his latest offering, but a summation of much that has gone before, and Keegan's attempt to secure for himself at least a separation from the Prussian genius. War, he proposes, has quite as much to do with culture as with politics, at least in its origins. And just as there are different kinds of culture, so there are different kinds of warfare. Keegan identifies four historic phases of warfare, which he calls Stone, Flesh, Iron and Fire. Each refers to a primary combat resource - in the case of Flesh, horses. And while these provide him with the thematic chapter headings needed to make sense of six millennia of armed conflict, between chapters he conducts mopping up operations ('interludes') that account for the 'limitations of warfare' (mainly the weather and terrain), fortification, armies and logistics. Although the whole book swarms with brilliant analysis and a command of history unrivalled among militaritians, it is the earlier sections of Keegan's lengthy rumination that are the most satisfying. He casts his net very wide. Not only does he examine warfare among the Samurai, the Zulus, and the Mamelukes of Egypt, but, guided by anthropologists, he explores the Yanomano, the Maring and the Aztecs. He also offers an explanation for the disappearance of the Easter Island civilisation. What he finds among these examples is that warfare, while limited by such materials as were available, also limited itself. Conflict and combat were ritualised. Tribal people, aware of survival values as few of us living in comfortable urban homes can be, sought to contain, not to exploit, the damage to life that can be done by even the most rudimentary weapons. War therefore was practised in harmony with the greater needs of the societies it protected. Among the Polynesians of Easter Island such controlled conduct maintained an extraordinary culture for several centuries. It was only when the islanders began disregarding their own taboos, and elected instead for war to the bone, that their society was wasted. As this was happening, across the Pacific the Japanese, in a startling renunciation of seemingly superior technology, opted to dispense with the gun. Although the samurai had an obvious interest as a privileged class in keeping to the way of the sword, a generalised apprehension of the consequences of powder and ball informed Japan's decision. In these contexts, Clausewitzian true, or all-out, war becomes merely a type of warfare specific to some cultures only, if not in fact an aberration. Keegan's problem however is twofold. As he journeys through time toward the 20th century, it is the Prussian mode that comes to dominate all others, not just in the west, but globally. Secondly, as he journeys forward, the more difficulty he has in deciding which wars to discuss, and which to leave alone. There are just too many of them. But Keegan's actual selection does not help his suite. Guerrilla, or people's, war generally gets short shrift. Vietnam is dismissed in less than a page, and there is nothing on Nicaragua, El Salvador or Guatemala. Equally odd is his failure to isolate and debate intelligence-gathering as a primary component of warfare - unlike, for instance, Sun Tzu writng in the fourth century BC Today, although guerrilla warfare is likely to persist as a means of waging armed struggle against unequal odds, and although weapons of mass-destruction must inevitably keep alive the possibility of total war in the future, the trend is toward surgical warfare: a synthesis in fact of air-power, long-range missiles, commando tactics and, of course, intelligence. So the wheel comes full circle in Keegan's favour. It does appear that, wittingly or otherwise, we are rediscovering the fundamental responsibility of warfare, which is to preserve as much as to destroy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By HEBEI RIBAO reporter Kang Enhua (1660 1869 5478) and </F> XINHUA reporter (0719 0679 0112)]    [Text] Shijiazhuang, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- During his recent  trip to rural Hebei to inspect spring plowing and production,  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat, stated: Spring plowing and production is now the  leading task in agriculture and rural work. All localities  should take effective measures to ensure bumper summer grain  harvests and to lay a solid foundation for bumper harvests  throughout the year.    From 4 to 6 April, Wen Jiabao visited Xushui, Rongcheng, and  Dingxing in Hebei to assess the growth of wheat crops, as well  as preparations for plowing and sowing on cotton fields. He  also visited peasants' households, and held informal discussions  with grass-roots cadres, peasants, and people. He carried out  investigations and studies on such matters as spring plowing and  production, as well as the supply of agricultural means of  production.    Wen Jiabao said: The overall situation of reform,  development, and stability is contingent on accomplishing this  year's rural work; on bringing about quite favorable  developments in agriculture and the rural economy; and on  ensuring the production and supply of grain, cotton, cooking  oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in the "shopping basket." All  localities should seriously implement the guidelines of the  central rural work conference, earnestly give priority to  agriculture and rural work, complete all tasks related to  agriculture and rural areas for this year, and create a good  economic environment and a stable social environment for the  smooth implementation of major state reform measures and for the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy.    Wen Jiabao said emphatically: To accomplish this year's  rural work, the most important task of the moment is to carry  out spring plowing. He said: Ensuring bumper summer grain  harvests as an initial step for the rest of the year could lay a  good foundation for this year's bumper harvests. To this end,  we must accomplish the following tasks: 1) Making overall plans  for spring plowing and production, especially effectively  implementing measures for increasing grain and cotton acreage  and output, allocating seeds, and supplying agricultural means  of production; 2) concentrating on field management for summer  crops, popularizing crucial measures for increasing output, and  raising unit yield; 3) providing materials, as well as technical  and information services, for spring plowing and production, and  tightening supervision and management over the market for  agricultural means of production; and 4) improving disaster  prevention and relief work, and ensuring spring sowing and  summer harvesting through drought relief measures. He urged  leading cadres at all levels to go into the thick of reality,  work in a down-to-earth manner, unearth problems on a timely  basis, solve problems, and accomplish this year's agricultural  production and rural work.    Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial CPC  Committee, accompanied him during the trip.</p>

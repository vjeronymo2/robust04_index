			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. WILL HALT SALE OF $50-$75 EE BONDS BY PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS  </P> <P> The Treasury Department said today that beginning next Oct. 1, it will not  issue $50 and $75 Series EE savings bonds through payroll savings plans, making  $100 bonds the minimum denomination for plan participants.  </P> <P> "This step is one of several initiatives that will assure the long-term  strength of the savings bonds program by reducing administrative costs,"  Richard L. Gregg, commissioner of the public debt, said in a statement.  </P> <P> The change does not affect over-the-counter sales at financial institutions  where $50 and $75 bonds will still be available.  </P> <P> The Treasury said employees who currently buy $50 and $75 bonds will not be  required to complete new bond authorizations. Instead, current allotments will  automatically be applied to the purchase of $100 bonds.  </P> <P> The Treasury began phasing out $50 and $75 bonds from payroll savings in  February, 1988, by no longer offering them to new enrollees.  </P> <P> Payroll savings allows employees to buy savings bonds on the installment plan  through regular payments withheld from their paychecks. Bonds are issued when  the price of a bond is accumulated.  </P></p>

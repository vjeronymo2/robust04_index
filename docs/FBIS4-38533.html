			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Gorodetskaya based on news agency </F> materials under the "Northern Caucasus" rubric: "Chechnya Fears  Russian Military Aggression. FIS Denies Groznyy's Accusations"]    [Excerpts] The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]  has denied a Chechnya Foreign Ministry report alleging that the  attempt on the life of President Dudayev was prepared by Russian  special services. An FIS representative has stated that "the  foreign intelligence service has long renounced the carrying out  of terrorist acts, and it does not even have corresponding  structures."    In the meantime the Russian "state terrorism" idea has  captivated the minds of Groznyy officials. Sultan Geliskhanov,  head of Chechnya's state security department, has discovered a  connection between the taking of hostages in Mineralnyye Vody  and the attempt on the life of Dzhokhar Dudayev. Speaking at a  conference of a special team investigating the circumstances of  the attempt on the life of the president, he asserted that the  story involving the terrorists who seized the bus was from  beginning to end inspired by Russian special services. [passage  omitted]    Yesterday, Chechnya made an announcement about a  redeployment  of Russian troops in areas bordering on the republic. Khamid  Dzhamaldayev, deputy chief of the Chechen Republic's state  security department, referring to the latest information from  the Chechnya Armed Forces General Staff, said that a detachment  of strike and ground-attack aviation of the Russian Air Force is  being redeployed at the present time to the area of the air  force base in Mozdok (North Ossetia) complete with Su-27  aircraft. According to him, special units of Russia's Ministry  of Internal Affairs "equal in its fire power to a wartime army  division" are being redeployed to Prigorodnyy Rayon of North  Ossetia. The "power" ministers, however, maintain that the  situation in the republic remains stable and fully under  control. [passage omitted]</p>

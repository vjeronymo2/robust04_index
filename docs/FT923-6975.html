			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Civil Service bias fears FEARS THAT performance-related pay schemes are potentially discriminatory have been fuelled by Treasury figures showing that women benefit less than male colleagues from a Civil Service bonus scheme. The analysis coincides with a rapid spread of performance pay in the Civil Service and the public sector. Unions were concerned about discrimination following an earlier analysis by the FDA Civil Service union of Treasury figures showing that top female civil servants were considerably less likely to qualify for performance pay than men. The Civil Service 'special bonus scheme', introduced in March 1989, is administered separately from performance-pay schemes and rewards 'exceptional performance' and acknowledges 'particularly demanding tasks'. Departments can use up to 0.2 per cent of paybills for the scheme. The Treasury's analysis of 43 departments in 1990-91 shows that 4.8 per cent of men received bonuses, against 3.9 per cent of women. The Treasury says in a note to the Council of Civil Service Unions that one explanation could be a lower incidence of bonuses in jobs dominated by women, such as secretaries and administrative assistants. It says departmental returns do not contain sufficient information to test this hypothesis. Future questionnaires will be amended to make this possible. Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the CPSA Civil Service association, said his union reluctantly accepted the extension of performance-related pay this year. But the Treasury figures heightened fears of discrimination. The Treasury analysis shows that 20,719 bonuses were paid in the 43 departments - to 4.4 per cent of staff. Awards varied from Pounds 10 to Pounds 3,000, with an average bonus of Pounds 168. The total cost of the awards was 0.1 per cent of the paybill. The degree to which the scheme is used varies widely. The Inland Revenue spent 0.01 per cent of its paybill on the bonuses. The Office of Water Services spent 0.2 per cent. Nearly half the total number of awards went to administration and executive officers. In percentage terms, higher and senior executive officers and grade seven civil servants were most likely to win awards.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SAUDIS RENEW OIL QUOTA EFFORTS  </P> <P> The Saudi oil minister today announced new efforts to bring back into line OPEC  partners violating the cartel's oil production quotas and driving down prices,  an official report said.  </P> <P> It was the first official Saudi reaction to last week's wild swings in oil  prices as a result of overproduction by some OPEC members.  </P> <P> The current situation not only harms "all producers, but . . . weakens the  chances of the anticipated improvement in oil prices during the second half of  the current year," Oil Minister Hisam Nazer was quoted as saying today by the  Saudi Press Agency.  </P> <P> The press agency said Nazer will meet Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ali al  Khalifa al Sabah, and his United Arab Emirates counterpart, Mana Said Oteiba,  in the Red Sea port city of Jidda on Tuesday. He said consultations with other  OPEC states were aimed at restoring "their production to the allocated  ceiling," the agency reported.  </P></p>

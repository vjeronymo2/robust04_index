Nagorskiy, Moscow, Mashinostroyeniye, 1991,  320 pages]    [Text] Increases in society's demand for transportation  have always stimulated the search for new transport vehicles and  technologies. Scientists and designers in various countries  have, since the beginning of the 1960s, concentrated their  attention on creating diverse ground contactless (wheel-less)  transport systems. Since that time, both in our country and  abroad various types of systems have been developed, theoretical  research has been conducted, and prototypes and experimental  full-scale vehicles have been manufactured and tested. Studies  of technical-economic, energy, and ecological indicators have  established the superiority of ground transport with magnetic  suspension, a linear traction electric drive, and an automated  system to stabilize the vehicle's position in space as it moves  at speeds up to 500 km/h.    The timeliness of the book being reviewed here is dictated  not only by the tasks entailed in researching and developing  such transport but also by the prospects of its wide-scale use.  The book's appearance is tied to the need for advance  formulation of the theoretical and experimental foundations of  this direction of transport technology. It analyzes the results  of R&amp;D conducted in our country and abroad. Its primary  focus is  on the developments achieved by a group of higher educational  institutions and organizations under the direction of the  All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electric Locomotive  Construction [VElNII].    The book is intended for scientific workers involved in  solving the specified problem but may also be useful to graduate  students and students enrolled at higher educational  institutions. Its purpose is to acquaint interested readers with  the advantages, current status, and prospects of transport with  magnetic suspension and, above all, with those theoretical and  experimental foundations of contactless motion that are most  important and necessary to the study and creation of such  transport.    Chapter one contains general information about ground  transport for contactless motion. Specifically, it gives a  classification of levitating transport systems and examines the  functional and pictorial diagrams and singular features of  contactless rolling stock with various magnetic suspension  systems (electromagnetic, electrodynamic, combined, and  permanent magnet-based suspension systems). It also presents a  classification of linear traction motors and assesses the effect  that the type of magnetic suspension system and linear motor  have on the sphere and efficiency of the use of contactless  transport.    Chapters two, three, and four are devoted to an examination  of the foundations of the configuration and theory of magnetic  suspension systems, linear traction motors, and electric drive  and electric power supply systems. In the second chapter, the  electromagnetic and mechanical diagrams of a magnetic suspension  system are analyzed, and a procedure for selecting the type of  suspension, refining electromagnets' characteristics,  determining braking and lifting forces during motion, and  creating automatic suspension control and vibration protection  systems is set forth. In addition, a comparative analysis of  combined suspension and traction systems is conducted, an  electrodynamic suspension system with a complex drive belt is  examined, and its levitation quality is evaluated. Attention is  paid to the transitional processes occurring in electrodynamic  suspension and measures to make the vehicle comfortable. The  chapter concludes with material regarding the sphere of use of  permanent magnets for transport suspensions and the design of  suspension systems based on them.    Chapter three examines the singular features of the use of  linear traction motors and their thermal state and presents a  comparative analysis of their indicators and ways of improving  them. Also examined are the operating modes of motors in  electric drive systems; methods of controlling speed, frequency,  and voltage; and the singular features of control and power  supply systems and transformer and cryogenic equipment and its  effect on the transport's technical and economic indicators and  characteristics.    Chapter five is devoted to the electromechanical  characteristics of a linear traction electric drive in traction  and braking modes.    Chapter six presents the singular features of the  aerodynamics and dynamics of the motion of a contactless rolling  stock. Examined here are disturbing forces as a vehicle moves,  the principles of its aerodynamics and aeromechanics, and the  problems involved in selecting the geometric shape of a vehicle  and its track and assessing the dynamic qualities of vehicles  with variously designed running gears.    Presented in the seventh chapter is a substantiation of the  technical requirements of both a rolling stock with magnetic  suspension and its route and track structure, the methodological  foundations of a technical and economic evaluation of  contactless ground transport, and a technical and economic  comparison of its different systems and design versions.    The book's limited size prevented its authors from devoting  more attention to the problems of technical and economic  comparison of the new type of transport with familiar types of  passenger transport or to specifying those areas in which its  use would be feasible. Also not reflected in the book are  combined magnetic suspension and linear electric drive systems,  with the exception of systems with linear induction and  inductor-type synchronous motors that combine the functions of  suspension and traction.    Overall, the book now being reviewed is an original and  sufficiently complete summary of research on the problems of  transport with magnetic suspension.    COPYRIGHT: ``Izv. vuzov.

An  undetermined number of individuals were injured.    According to Jorge Martinez, president of Chapare's five  coca  producers' federations, "some peasants" died during the clashes,  a report that was denied by Interior Minister German Quiroga who  said that only one police agent and two members of the official  Coca Reconversion Directorate (Direco) were injured.    Some 50 peasants armed with machetes, stones, and sticks  clashed on 5 March with some 100 Mobile Police Unit for Rural  Areas (Umopar) and Direco agents who intended to eradicate coca  leaf plantations which, according to authorities, were being  used for drug trafficking.    The peasants set various Umopar vehicles on fire, but Umopar  forces repelled the attack with machine gun fire from  helicopters.    This is the second violent clash with peasants in the  Chapare  region within the past 10 days. The clashes are the result of  the government's determination to destroy excess coca  cultivation that is being used for manufacturing cocaine and not  for the traditional and legal coca leaf consumption.    The interior minister today told Radio Panamericana of La  Paz  that the Umopar agents' operation in Chapare on 5 March only  intended to eliminate coca plantations that include maceration  pits, which are used for cocaine production.    Quiroga said the Bolivian Government does not intend to  eliminate all excess coca leaf plantations by force, adding that  police only seek to eliminate plantations that include  facilities for cocaine production.    According to the minister, other excess coca plantations  must  be eradicated voluntarily by peasants with the cooperation of  local authorities and through the alternative development  program.    Chapare region peasants, however, accuse the government of  trying to forcefully eliminate all coca leaf plantations.    The Bolivian Government is committed to eradicating a  certain  number of coca leaf plantations annually in exchange for  substantial U.S. economic assistance.    Bolivia is the second largest coca leaf producer in the  world, after Peru, and the second largest cocaine exporter in  the world, after Colombia.</p>

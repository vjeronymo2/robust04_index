			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text]  <H5>  Iritel Joint Stock Company </H5>   This was created on 8 May 1992 to manage the transitional  phase that will lead to the constitution of a single  administration. It will guarantee the continuity of services by  transferring and retraining personnel who were formerly with  ASST [State Telephone Services Agency] and PT [Post and  Telecommunications] (about 12,000 people), and by creating the  technical, economic, and organizational conditions for the  successive integration of its own operational structures into  the new system. It is the sole administrator of public and  private telecommunications systems (including equipment  installation and management), formerly done by ASST and the PT  Administration. The telegram, electronic mail, and public  telematics services carried out by post offices, national  telex-data services and, until the relative concessions expire,  those entrusted to SIRM [Italian Marine Radio Corporation] and  Telemar, are excluded.    Iritel supplies the means of transmission within the  national  long-distance network for interconnection between the transit  switching nodes of the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone  Company] (SGT) network and between these and the national  transit nodes managed by Iritel itself (for European traffic)  and by Italcable (for intercontinental traffic). Furthermore it  manages international traffic to and from Europe and the  countries bordering on the Mediterranean basin, together with  the relative equipment.  <H5>  Italcable Joint Stock Company </H5>   This company manages intercontinental telecommunications  services (telephones, data transmission, telex, cables, and new  value-added services). Furthermore it participates in the study  and realization of the more important underwater cable systems.  It is collaborating with partners in the Atlantic area to build  a vast and complex network that directly connects North America,  the Mediterranean, and South-East Asia. Its network is one of  the largest and most diversified in the world and uses both  cables and satellites in a balanced way.    It is quoted on the stock exchange and has a capital stock  of  275 billion lire. In 1992, with 3,068 employees, its proceeds  were 789 billion lire; investments totalled 120 billion lire  with profits of 130 billion lire.  <H5>  SIP Joint Stock Company </H5>   SIP -- the Italian telecommunications company that  administers national public telecommunications services -- is  responsible for customer relations.  It guarantees the basic telephone service, with 23.7 million  subscribers (in 1992) that will rise to 26 million in 1996, with  a density of over 45 percent of the population. One subscriber  in five belongs to the business world, whilst there are over 1  million mobile telephones and it is forecast that this number  will double by 1996. There are more than 240 million kilometers  of circuits under our cities and along our motorways and in 1996  about 40 billion communications are forecast, that is more than  75,000 per minute.    The primary goals of SIP are the modernization of the  network  and the management and maintenance systems, improvement of  quality, and the introduction of new services (ISDN [integrated  services digital network], intelligent networks, etc.).

With 89,293 employees, in 1992 its  revenues were 21.557 trillion lire; investments totalled 9.718  trillion lire and profits 461 billion lire.  <H5>  SIRM Joint Stock Company </H5>   SIRM is involved in the installation, running, and  maintenance of the radio stations that legally must be on board  pleasure craft and ships bearing the Italian flag. In addition  it sells various types of radio navigation aids. These are  divided into two categories: those with a high innovative  content for ships with large tonnage (satellite terminals and  integrated navigation systems) and those that use the older  technologies, for a wider and less professional market, such as  the fishing sector and pleasure craft.    It has a national maintenance network with 10 operations  depots and about 40 agencies in the principal coastal towns.  <H5>  Telespazio Joint Stock Company </H5>   Telespazio -- space telecommunications company -- has the  exclusive concession in Italy for satellite communications  (telephones, television and data). It participates in advanced  space programs and in the design and testing of new applications  for satellites. It is developing the use of small antennas on  dedicated networks and has over 400 completed installations.

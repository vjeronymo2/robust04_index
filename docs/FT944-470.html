			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Samas makes German purchase - Dutch group will get 10 per cent of European office furnishings market Samas, the Dutch office furnishings company, said yesterday it had reached final agreement on acquiring a majority stake in Schaerf, the German office furniture maker, from the Schaerf family. The acquisition will nearly double Samas's annual turnover to Fl 1.4bn (Dollars 800m) and will give it 10 per cent of the European market for office furnishings. Samas said this would make it the European market leader. The company declined to say how much it will pay the Schaerf family for its 58.7 per cent stake. The remaining 41.3 per cent of the Schaerf group's shares do not carry voting rights and are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 'The Samas group is not considering a bid for these shares', the Dutch company said. The two companies are largely complementary, both in their products and their geographic markets. Schaerf makes a range of wooden off-ice desk and chairs and generates nearly three-quarters of its sales in Germany, while Samas focuses mainly on the Netherlands, France and Britain. Schaerf also has production facilities in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, providing the Dutch company with a foothold in Eastern Europe. Although Samas would not reveal the purchase price, it said part of the financing for the deal would be raised through a rights issue of convertible, cumulative pref-erence shares that would be worth at least Fl 152m before costs. In the first quarter of 1995, Samas's shareholders will be able to subscribe to one new preference share for every two ordinary shares they own. ING Bank, lead manager, will underwrite the issue at a guaranteed price of at least Fl 74 per preference share.</p>

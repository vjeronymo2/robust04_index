			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Abu Dhabi blamed over BCCI: Draft Bingham report says vital facts withheld from Bank of England ABU DHABI, the majority shareholder in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, has been criticised in the draft Bingham report for withholding from the Bank of England vital information on the scale of the fraud at the collapsed bank. Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into the collapse of BCCI highlights a nine-month delay in communicating details of the huge losses and fraud - including the theft of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.15bn) of Abu Dhabi's funds - as a serious omission. The criticism of the Gulf emirate's actions, in draft excerpts seen by the Financial Times, forms one of the main conclusions of the 11-month investigation by Lord Justice Bingham, which also assesses the roles of the Bank of England and of Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor. Abu Dhabi and its advisers are understood to be unhappy at what they see as this slur on the emirate's reputation, and reject it. The Bank is also braced for criticism of its role as supervisor of BCCI's UK operations. Unless key passages of the preliminary report are revised or excluded from publication, a row between Abu Dhabi and the UK government is expected to follow the report's publication, which is not expected for several weeks. In his draft, Lord Justice Bingham highlights an interview between Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive, and Abu Dhabi's representatives in April 1990 - 15 months before the bank was shut down. Lord Justice Bingham concludes that, had the contents of the interview been communicated to the Bank of England by the emirate, a more detailed investigation of BCCI and a more urgent programme for reconstructing the bank might have been triggered. Alternatively BCCI could have collapsed or been closed. In the event, the Bank did not learn of the Dollars 2.2bn theft until the end of February 1991. But Abu Dhabi and its solicitors, Simmons &amp; Simmons, have argued to Lord Justice Bingham that there is no evidence that the Bank would have behaved any differently if it had received details of the Naqvi interview. The final date for submissions to Bingham was last Friday. One emirates' representative present at the controversial interview with Mr Naqvi was Mr Ghanem al-Mazrui, head of Abu Dhabi's Department of Private Affairs, which handles the personal finances of Sheikh Zayed, Abu Dhabi's ruler. In the conversation, Mr Naqvi gave the Abu Dhabi representatives details of hitherto undisclosed losses at BCCI and said that Dollars 2.2bn of funds belonging to Sheikh Zayed, had been stolen by ICIC Group, a Cayman Islands offshoot of BCCI. However, the Abu Dhabi representatives say the confession was confusing and that they did not trust Mr Naqvi. They also believed ICIC was unrelated to BCCI's core activities. They were given no evidence to back up his assertions, though they eventually received a three page hand written summary from Mr Naqvi of his allegations, which they decided to investigate before communicating them to outside authorities. It is not known whether they communicated details of the confession to Sheikh Zayed. No notes were taken of the conversation at the time. Lord Justice Bingham is understood to have relied to a large extent on written evidence relating to the discussion provided by Price Waterhouse which has passed on notes it made during its investigation into BCCI under section 41 of the Banking Act. However, Lord Justice Bingham is convinced that Abu Dhabi was not as uncomprehending as it now says it was. His draft says that the Abu Dhabi representatives were not financial innocents. Bingham's report falls into three parts. The first contains the evidence and is unlikely to be published. The second, of more than 300 pages, is a narrative. The final section, which is still being prepared, contains Lord Justice Bingham's conclusions. The Bank of England and the Treasury, which commissioned the report, have received the bulk of it already. The Government will then decide, in consultation with the Treasury's solicitors, which parts to publish. The Government has said that any parts likely to prejudice possible criminal prosecutions will be excluded.

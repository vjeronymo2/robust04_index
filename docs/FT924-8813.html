			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Fight against inflation is 'yesterday's battle' THE FIGHT against inflation was 'yesterday's battle' and has been replaced by the fight to restore confidence, Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, told the Confederation of British Industry annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Sir David opened the CBI debate on UK economic recovery by saying the government could not 'go soft' on inflation, but it should cease to be the dominant theme of policy. He told delegates: 'The battle we need to win now is against the lack of confidence which is holding back growth and investment in the UK economy'. He called for a package of measures in the Autumn Statement to release the economy from 'the grip of a vicious recession that shows little sign of abating'. Sir David indicated that the CBI has decided to press for the improvement of investment allowances. He said next year threatened to be the fourth consecutive year when investment in plant and machinery would be lower than in the previous year. The CBI is thus renewing its call for depreciation allowances to be doubled to 40 per cent. Sir David said the move would involve no fiscal cost in 1993-94. The later impact on public finances would be 'a price worth paying'. He emphasised that, if the government found it necessary to raise taxes to cut borrowing, tax increases for the business sector had to be avoided if Britain was to emerge from recession. Continuing divisions of opinion on the value of higher investment allowances were reflected in the debate. Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of Rentokil, the environmental and property group, rejected the 'old chestnut' of allowances, pointing out that Britain now had the benefit of what was in effect a devaluation in the currency of 15 per cent and the lowest interest rates in Europe. Mr Thompson, who voiced fears that further big cuts in interest rates would stoke inflationary pressures, called instead for lower rates of corporate tax to encourage entrepreneurs and small businesses to expand and create jobs. Mr Andrew Buxton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, said Britain should still aim to rejoin the ERM once the economy had improved and stabilised. He asked whether any company seriously believed that a 15 per cent devaluation, with the consequent threat of a rise in inflation, could be good for the UK in the longer term. However, it could kick-start the economy. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth of John Livingston, the north-east engineering group, said industry needed a clear statement of government economic objectives and a long-term commitment to help rebuild Britain's industrial base. His view was echoed by many other speakers in the debate, but none went as far as Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of the Gooding investment and management group, who called for a coalition government united by a single objective - the revival of the British economy.</p>

Sales rose to $4.77 billion, up 7%. The New York broadcast and  publishing concern said its broadcasting operations reported a 14% gain for the  year, although ABC Television Network reported a slight loss because of special  event programming such as the Winter Olympics, the mini-series "War and  Remembrance" and coverage of the U.S. presidential election. The company also  said publishing earnings fell 12% because of sluggish advertising demand at  specialized publications.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 4 April in the regional people's government  auditorium, the regional party committee and people's government  jointly held a regional anti-corruption work conference to relay  and implement the spirit of the third plenary session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Committee and a recent  anti-corruption work conference convened by the State Council,  and to study and arrange for this year's anti-corruption work.    The conference was attended by regional party and government  leaders, including Zhao Fulin [regional party committee  secretary], Cheng Kejie [regional people's government chairman],  Liu Mingzu [regional people's congress standing committee  chairman], Ding Tingmo, Chen Huiguang [regional Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference committee chairman], Pei  Guikang, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang,  Huang Baoyao, Zhang Dunhao, Lu Bin, and He Xianglin.    Liu Mingzu, regional party committee deputy secretary,  presided over the conference at which regional party committee  Secretary Zhao Fulin, Cheng Kejie, regional party committee  deputy secretary and people's government chairman, and Yuan  Zhengzhong, regional party committee standing committee member  and people's government vice chairman, spoke.    Secretary Zhao Fulin stated in his speech: Since the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council made important  arrangements for the on-going anti-corruption struggle in 1993,  party committees and governments across the region have made  unreserved efforts to fulfill the three anti-corruption tasks  laid down by the CPC Central Committee, employed practical and  feasible measures, and carried out work in a down-to-earth  manner. Thanks to concerted efforts on the part of the broad  masses of cadres and people, the region's anti- corruption  struggle has scored some initial results. Those areas and units  that have energetically carried out the on-going anti-corruption  struggle have already achieved gratifying results in the  first-stage struggle, thereby dealing a telling blow to all  types of negative and corrupt phenomena across the region and  basically fulfilling the first-stage tasks set by the central  authorities and regional party committee.    Speaking of this year's anti-corruption struggle, Secretary  Zhao Fulin noted: In order to effectively carry on the  anti-corruption struggle this year, we should make redoubled  efforts to ensure that all leading cadres at the provincial  department section or county level across the region will  honestly perform official duties and strictly observe party and  government discipline. To this end, all provincial department  sections and counties across the region should call meetings  before the end of May to carry out self-examination and  self-rectification among cadres in a democratic manner.  Discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial organs at all  levels across the region should also concentrate on  investigating and handling major and serious cases, make  continued efforts to vigorously investigate and handle law- and  discipline-violation cases involving party, government,  judicial, administrative, law enforcement, and economic  management departments and cadres; make continued efforts to  crack corruption cases involving leading cadres, law-enforcement  and discipline-enforcement personnel, as well as legal persons,  including embezzlement and bribery cases, cases in which cadres  seek private gains by abusing power, and cases in which cadres  seek unlawful privileges and gains by abusing law- and  discipline-enforcement powers; conscientiously investigate and  handle law-violation and discipline-violation cases concerning  key projects construction, land lease, real estate development,  and foreign economic and trade activities; make continued  efforts to crack down on those malpractices that have caused  strong resentment among the masses; and resolutely put an end to  indiscriminate and unreasonable charges and fees.    Secretary Zhao Fulin also urged continued efforts to lighten  burden on the part of peasants, disengage party and government  organs from their own economic entities, resolutely ban party  and government organs from doing business and running  enterprises, and focus on the following seven aspects of work:    1. Continually conduct democratic activities within party  and government organs at all levels.    2. Strengthen mass supervision and mobilize the masses to  participate in the on-going anti-corruption struggle.    3. Continually increase transparency of party and government  work, ensure mass supervision over party and government work,  and carry out democratic appraisal of leaders.    4. Continually implement an organizational supervision  system.    5. The discipline inspection and supervision organs at all  levels across the region should step up supervision and  examination and conscientiously implement a series of important  policy decisions made by the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council to this end.    6. The people's congresses and their standing committees at  all levels across the region should strengthen supervision over  law- enforcement organs.    7. Vigorously push ahead with party style and clean  government building.    Chairman Cheng Kejie stated in his speech: The year 1994  is a crucial year for deepening reforms aimed at building a  socialist market economic structure and speeding up economic  development. Reform, development, and stability should promote  and complement one another. Successfully combating corruption  and building a clean government constitute an important  guarantee of social stability. The leading cadres at all levels  across the region should firmly adhere to such overall interests  as grasping each and every excellent opportunity, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, maintaining  stability, correctly handling relations between reform,  development, and stability, never slackening efforts in  furthering the on-going anti-corrruption struggle, making the  on-going anti-corruption struggle more fruitful, and striving to  bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth across  the region.    Chairman Cheng Kejie called in his speech for  conscientiously  carrying out the following five types of work:    1. Properly handle problems cropping up in the course of  reforms.    2. Monitor and supervise market prices and improve market  order.    3. Guarantee sufficient vegetables and non-staple food  supplies.    4. Make sound livelihood arrangements for the masses and  help people in disaster-stricken areas overcome difficulties.    5. Vigorously step up comprehensive social order management  and provide reform, opening up, and economic construction with a  sound social environment. [passage omitted]    In his speech, Vice Governor Yuan Zhengzhong called on party  and government organs and leaders at all levels across the  region to conscientiously implement and carry out regulations  promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  of banning party and government organs from running enterprises  and urged party and government leaders to make every possible  endeavor to have all party and government organs across the  region disengaged from their own economic entities before the  end of June of this year.

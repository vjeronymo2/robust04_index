			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> TEACHER ADMITS 4 MOLESTATION CHARGES  </P> <P> A Camarillo High School drama teacher who hugged his female students and made  sexual comments to them pleaded guilty Tuesday to misdemeanor child molestation  charges.  </P> <P> William H. Fisher, 42, who previously quit a job in Orange County after  allegedly having an affair with a student, admitted guilt in Ventura County  Municipal Court on four of nine charges, each of which could bring a year in  jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> He was released on his own recognizance pending sentencing on June 25.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen O'Brien said she will drop the five remaining  charges and recommend probation instead of jail time if Fisher does not change  his plea.  </P> <P> Camarillo High School hired Fisher in 1987, but suspended him after his arrest  on Nov. 17. The arrest came after nine girls complained to investigators about  sexual remarks made by Fisher.  </P> <P> "He did hug them, but he did hug both male and female students," O'Brien said.  She said he never touched the women in sensitive areas, but made insinuating  remarks about them.  </P> <P> O'Brien said Fisher quit a teaching job in Irvine in 1983 after he had an  affair with a 14-year-old student, and then paid for her abortion after she  became pregnant.  </P> <P> O'Brien said Fisher left Irvine after the girl's father caught them together.  </P> <P> Irvine school district officials agreed not to press charges on the condition  that Fisher resign.

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Undervalue order is extra-territorial POWDRILL AND ANOTHER v HAMBROS BANK (JERSEY) LTD Court of Appeal (Sir Donald Nicholls, Vice-Chancellor, Lord Justice Taylor and Lord Justice Farquharson): February 27 1992 THE COURT has an extra-territorial power to order a foreign defendant to restore sums paid to him by an insolvent company at undervalue, but it is a discretion to be exercised only if he was sufficiently connected with the UK for it to be just and proper to make an order against him. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiff administrators of Paramount Airways Ltd from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies's decision setting aside leave to serve proceedings on the defendant, Hambros Bank (Jersey) Ltd out of the jurisdiction. Section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides: '(2) Where the company has at a relevant time . . . entered into a transaction with any person at an undervalue, the (administrator or liquidator) may apply to the court for an order under this section (3) . . . the court shall, on such an application, make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into that transaction.' SIR DONALD NICHOLLS V-C said that Paramount carried on business as a charter airline. On August 7 1989 an administration order was made in respect of the company. In the present proceedings the joint administrators were alleging that in July 1989 the company had sums of Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 346,800 in England, which were transferred to an account held by a Jersey company with Hambros Bank (Jersey). The administrators alleged that the company's money was misappropriated and paid away for no benefit to the company. They asserted that the payments were transactions at an undervalue, made when the company was unable to pay its debts. They sought an order under section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 for the bank to restore the money to the company. The administrators obtained leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction. The bank applied to set aside leave. Mr Justice Mervyn Davies acceded to the application. He held there was an implied limitation to 'any person' in section 238, restricting it to British subjects, companies registered in England, foreigners present in England and, possibly, foreign companies carrying on business in England. The administrators appealed. When using the expression 'any person', parliament was to be taken to have been legislating only for British subjects or foreigners coming to the UK, unless the contrary was expressed (which it was not) or was plainly implicit (see Blain (1879) 12 ChD 522,526 and Clark v Oceanic Contractors (1983) 2 AC 130). Section 238 applied in the case of a company in respect of which an administration order had been made or which had gone into liquidation. Subsections (2) and (3) provided that where a company had entered into a transaction 'with any person' at an undervalue, the court 'shall' make 'such order as it thinks fit' restoring the position to what it would have been had there been no transaction. An order was not to be made under the section if the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business, and at the time there were reasonable grounds for believing it would benefit the company (subsection (5)). Section 239 was concerned with giving a preference 'to any person'. It applied in the same circumstances as section 238. Giving a 'preference' meant doing anything which put one of the company's creditors, or a guarantor, into a better position in the event of its going into liquidation than otherwise would have been the case (subsection (4)). The two sections were matched by comparable provisions in sections 339 and 342, regarding individuals who were adjudged bankrupt. On its face the legislation was of unlimited territorial scope. Parliament might have intended that the English court could and should bring before it, and make orders against, a person who had no connection whatever with England save that he entered into a transaction, maybe abroad and in respect of foreign property, with a person who was subject to the insolvency jurisdiction of the English court. Such an intention was possible. But in some instances such a jurisdiction or its exercise would be truly extraordinary. The difficulty lay in finding an acceptable implied limitation. The case for some limitation was powerful, but there was no single simple formula which was compelling. Authority did not provide any guidance. The solution did not lie in retreating to a rigid and indefensible line. Trade took place increasingly on an international basis. To meet changing conditions English courts were more prepared than formerly to grant injunctions in suitable cases against non-residents or foreign nationals in respect of overseas activities. When considering 'any person' in the sections, it was impossible to identify any particular limitation which could be said with any degree of confidence to represent the presumed intention of parliament. What could be seen was that parliament could not have intended an implied intention. The expression must be left to bear its literal and natural meaning. That conclusion was not as unsatisfactory as it might appear at first sight. There were two safeguards built into the statutory scheme. The first lay in the court's discretion as to the order it would make. Despite the 'shall' in the section, the phrase 'such order as it thinks fit' was apt to confer an overall discretion, which was wide enough if justice so required, to make no order against the defendant. If a foreign element was involved the court would need to be satisfied that the defendant was sufficiently connected with England for it to be just and proper to make the order against him. In considering whether there was sufficient connection, the court would look at all the circumstances, including the defendant's residence and place of business, his connection with the insolvent, the nature and purpose of the transaction, the nature and locality of the property, the circumstances in which he became involved in the transaction or received a benefit from it or acquired the property, whether he acted in good faith, and whether under foreign law he acquired an unimpeachable title free from claims. The importance attached to those factors would vary from case to case. By taking into account and weighing those and any other relevant circumstances, the court would ensure that it did not exercise oppressively or unreasonably the very wide jurisdiction conferred by the sections. The other safeguard was that persons who were abroad and not able to be served in the UK in the usual way, were not to be brought here unless the court granted leave for them to be served abroad. Rule 12.12 of the Insolvency Rules provided that in insolvency proceedings the court might order service to be effected abroad 'within such time, on such person, at such place and in such manner as it thinks fit'. Thus the second safeguard was that the court had a discretion. In deciding whether the case was a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction, one of the circumstances the court would take into account was the strength or weakness of the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings. There must be a real issue between the plaintiff and the defendant, which the plaintiff might reasonably ask the court to try. He must make out a sufficiently strong case in the circumstances to justify his being given leave. Where a foreign element was involved one of the factors which the court would consider was the apparent strength or weakness of the plaintiff's claim that the defendant had a sufficient connection with England in respect of the relief sought. The present proceedings should be permitted to go ahead in England. It would be for the judge to decide in the light of the evidence whether the bank had sufficient connection with England for it to be just for the court to grant the relief sought. The grant of leave to serve abroad did not preclude the bank from raising that issue as a defence. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the bank: Nigel Davis (Norton Rose). For the administrators: Nicholas Merriman QC and Richard Salter (Wilde Sapte).</p>

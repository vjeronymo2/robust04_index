			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPLOSION, FIRE ON BOGOTA BUS KILL 7  </P> <P> Seven people were killed and nine others injured when an explosion and fire  tore through a bus in northern Bogota on Sunday.  </P> <P> At least two children were among the dead.  </P> <P> Initial reports blamed the accident on a bomb planted by attackers with links  to the nation's drug cartels. But a police spokesman said the fire apparently  was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle's electrical system.  </P> <P> However, he said police were investigating the incident to see if it was linked  to the 64 bombings that have rocked Bogota since drug lords declared war on the  government Aug. 24.  </P> <P> The bus was on its normal route in northern Bogota when an explosion ripped the  vehicle apart and engulfed it in flames, witnesses said. An unknown number of  passengers managed to escape.  </P> <P> The national radio chain RCN said the fire was caused by a bomb placed by two  assailants in the back of the bus. It said the two fled just before the device  exploded.  </P> <P> RCN did not cite a source for its report.  </P></p>

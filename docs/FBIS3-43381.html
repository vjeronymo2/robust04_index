			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, says the  allegations made against South Africa by the Transkeian leader,  Major General Bantu Holomisa, in a letter to the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] are incomprehensible. Mr. Coetsee was  apparently reacting to a request by Gen. Holomisa that the TEC  give serious consideration to asking the United Nations to send  a peace keeping force to South Africa because this country was  tardy in forming a national peace keeping force. Mr. Coetsee  said the government's representative on the TEC's defense  subcommittee has informed him that there had been dynamic  progress toward establishing a national peace keeping force.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Hi-tech measures urged to aid police GREATER USE of technology to assist and monitor police investigations is proposed by the commission, although it acknowledges that nothing can wholly eliminate the risk of an innocent person being convicted 'due to error or malpractice'. It says the police should have powers to take saliva and hair samples to identify suspects through DNA profiling - genetic fingerprinting - and calls for a national DNA data bank of samples from serious offenders. The commission wants custody records computerised to reduce the risk of falsification; video recording or colour photography of all identification parades, and continuous sound-track video recording in the custody office and cell corridors - but not cells - of police stations. A video record would reduce the scope for complaints against the police and enable complaints to be more readily resolved. Police interview techniques are subjected to criticism in the report, which says there is evidence that questioning of suspects is 'often rambling, repetitious and insufficiently focused on the real issues'. More serious criticisms include an 'over-ready assumption on the part of some interviewing officers of the suspect's guilt and on occasion the exertion of undue pressure amounting to bullying or harassment'. New national training in basic interview skills introduced by the Home Office should, says the report, inculcate techniques that were most likely to elicit the truth. 'Much will be achieved by instilling in officers a recognition that oppressive interviews are liable to be inaccurate.' A new approach to supervision is needed throughout the police service, with line managers at all levels being required to regard it as central to their roles. The report emphasises the need for adequate inspection procedures to detect the beginnings of malpractice before it becomes entrenched, and helplines for individual officers to report concerns confidentially. The commission doubts whether internal police disciplinary procedures command the confidence of the general public. It calls for fewer hearings and abandonment of the present criminal standard of proof. Acquittal in a criminal court should not be a bar to internal disciplinary action.</p>

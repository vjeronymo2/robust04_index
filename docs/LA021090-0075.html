			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. SHERIFF ATTACKS REPORT URGING CIVILIAN-RUN JAILS  </P> <P> A grand jury report calling for the transfer of San Diego County's troubled  jail system to civilian leadership is so "inaccurate and misleading" that its  conclusions are questionable, Sheriff John Duffy said Friday.  </P> <P> In a letter sent to grand jury Foreman J. Phil Franklin, Duffy complained that  the report is replete with "errors, misinterpretation and misunderstanding" of  how the county jail system functions. Duffy's letter describes the report as  "superficial at best, inaccurate and misleading at worst . . . (with) no  resolutions to the major problems affecting our jails."  </P> <P> Duffy commended the grand jury for recognizing that the jail system's biggest  problems are a lack of funds, an overworked force and a lack of space for  inmates. However, "nowhere in the remainder of the report does the grand jury  address these concerns . . . except to recommend the creation of a Department  of Corrections under a civilian director."  </P> <P> "I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of the jury's depth of understanding of  this important issue," Duffy wrote.  </P> <P> The grand jury report, released Tuesday, is based on a seven-month study of the  jail system, which Duffy supervises, as well as interviews with officials in  counties where jail inmates are supervised by a civilian-run department.  </P> <P> The report suggests that a civilian system staffed by specially trained -- and  lower-paid -- corrections officers would trim jail operating costs and reduce  inmate tensions that often boil over into riots and escape attempts.  </P> <P> On Friday, Leon Williams, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, said the  report describes the jail system "as we understand the situation to be."  Williams, who had not seen Duffy's letter, maintained that civilian control  over the jails would "provide the efficiencies and economies . . . that the  Board of Supervisors has the obligation to provide to taxpayers."  </P> <P> "The question is not related to the sheriff's office or who the sheriff is,"  Williams said. "In my mind, it has to do with the efficiencies and economics  that appear to be linked to a Department of Corrections."  </P> <P> Duffy's letter hits hard at the grand jury's suggestion that civilian-run jails  staffed by corrections officers are cheaper and more effective to operate. The  jury relied heavily on reviews of civilian departments in counties such as  Santa Clara in the Bay Area, which has saved $6 million since it first hired  correctional officers 18 months ago.  </P> <P> But Duffy maintained that the grand jury failed to recognize that Santa Clara  County has a $78-million budget to care for 3,800 inmates at five facilities  that are at 95% of capacity, whereas San Diego houses about 5,000 inmates in 11  facilities that are at 173% of capacity.  </P> <P> Duffy took issue with the grand jury's contention that he has too many deputy  sheriffs and not enough lower-paid corrections deputy officers working at the  jails.  </P> <P> "It is expected that by July, 1990, the percentage of corrections deputy  sheriffs assigned to the jails will be about 40%" higher than it now is, he  wrote.  </P> <P> Duffy also questioned the wisdom of the grand jury's willingness to turn  control of the jails over to a force consisting almost totally of lower-paid  corrections deputy officers. The grand jury seems to be "interested only in  cost savings resulting from paying the lowest wage possible and not sound  operational planning based on demonstrated need, consideration of policy  issues, liability concerns, facility security and other issues."  </P> <P> He also questioned why the grand jury wants to put more professional  corrections officers in San Diego's jails.  </P> <P> "I believe that the grand jury is misinformed about the nature of the  corrections officer's job," Duffy wrote. "Jails are not correctional  institutions, and security officers who work in jails are not employed for  correctional purposes."  </P> <P> Duffy questioned why the grand jury is pressing him to consider incorporating  the practice of "direct supervision," in which jail personnel mingle with  inmates rather than watching them from isolated booths. Direct supervision "is  not a new concept and, in fact, is used to varying degrees in San Diego county  jails," Duffy wrote.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Williams urged county supervisors to place an issue on the  June ballot that would let county residents determine if San Diego should turn  control of its rapidly growing jail population over to a Department of  Corrections.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, county staff members will present supervisors with the results of a  study designed to determine whether a civilian department would be more  cost-effective than the current system.  </P></p>

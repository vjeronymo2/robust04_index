			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Railway sell-off plan gives guarantee BRITISH RAIL passengers are likely to see few if any changes to train services when privatisation starts next year, says a government consultation document to be published this week. Companies bidding for franchises to take over BR's passenger services will be bound by contract to BR's 1994 timetable, with only marginal changes in services to reflect market demand. Later the Department of Transport foresees a gradual evolution in the timetables as train schedules change to reflect what customers want. The consultation paper sets out to fill one of the last big gaps in the government's rail privatisation plans by setting out the rules for allowing private-sector train operators on to the tracks. It confirms that companies winning passenger-service franchises will face limited competition initially from other operators. The government hopes to get privatisation off to a good start by making the franchising process as simple as possible. Franchise bidders will not be involved in negotiations over services or track charges. These will be laid down by the franchising director after negotiations with Railtrack, the proposed state-owned track authority. Companies will be presented with the contract and asked to bid. The one bidding the highest price - or requiring the lowest subsidy - will win. Anyone else wanting to run a passenger or freight train in competition with the franchisees will have to negotiate their own track fees with Railtrack based on what they can afford to pay. In the case of freight, operators who cannot afford to pay at least the marginal extra costs they impose on the railway may qualify for a new system of government grants. The paper notes that all access arrangements are subject to EC law, reinforcing fears that train operators may bring actions for discrimination if they feel they are being treated unfairly.

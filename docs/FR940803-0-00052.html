			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) of this section apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless the conditions in paragraphs (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Argentine justice minister dismissed: Hopes for independent legal system set back ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem yesterday sacked his justice minister for objecting to the president's decision to interfere in the appointment of 235 new judges. Mr Leon Arslanian complained that some of his candidates were replaced by others chosen for political reasons rather than their performance. Officials said the minister, who served as an appeals court judge before entering government last year, would be replaced by the president's legal affairs secretary, Mr Jorge Maiorano. Although he was admired for his record as one of the judges who tried Argentina's generals during the 1980s for human rights offences, Mr Arslanian lacked the political skill to manoeuvre in Mr Menem's cabinet and failed to defend his reforms. The minister said he resigned because the judiciary's independence was at stake. The president's decision not to back Mr Arslanian is a setback for attempts to create an independent legal system. The judiciary is widely seen as submissive to the government; shortly after taking office in 1989 Mr Menem packed the Supreme Court with his supporters. Mr Arslanian's fate is also a vivid example of Mr Menem's style of government, in which efficient policymaking is frequently reduced to battles between rival factions or disputes between ministers carried out through the media. The dismissal came a day after important reforms in legal procedures were implemented, in which traditional written trials were replaced by public trial for criminal cases. The changes should make trials faster and fairer, improving Argentina's slow, corrupt and secretive judiciary.</p>

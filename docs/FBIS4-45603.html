			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Liaoning Province has set up 37 nature reserves to protect rare  animals, plants and landscape.    An official with the Liaoning Provincial Environmental  Protection Bureau said that the reserves are home to 97 rare  animals and several rare plants on the state's protection list  including the red-crowned crane, bear, sable, Mongolian gazelle,  sika, red deer and otter, as well as ginseng in the plant  category.    He said that in the reserves, specialized protection teams  have been set up. Every year, the province allocates special  funds to equip the team with fire prevention equipment and for  scientific researches.    Scientific personnel are also undertaking a series of  investigations and research programs to survey the wildlife  resources in the reserves.    The Laotieshan Nature Reserve on snake island in the  province  was set up in 1979 and is now a major stop for migrating birds,  including red-crowned cranes, swans and eagles, in northeast  China.    Since the reserve was set up, hundreds of thousands of birds  have been saved from slaughter.    In the northeast section of snake island, the number of  pallas pit viper, the only kind of poisonous snake on the  island, has reached about 17,000, an increase of 5 percent per  year since the reserve was established.</p>

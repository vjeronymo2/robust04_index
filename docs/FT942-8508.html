			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Loophole in BCCI case disallowed At least 250 depositors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International who exploited a legal loophole in efforts to gain additional compensation yesterday had their case overturned in the House of Lords. By a ruling of five to nil, the Law Lords ruled in favour of the Deposit Protection Board in its efforts to withhold Pounds 3.7m in payments it believed to be outside rules of the scheme. The deposit protection scheme, which is administered by the board and underwritten by all the British banks, pays three-quarters of the sterling deposits in any collapsed UK bank to depositors, regardless of where they live, up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. However, in the days after the closure of BCCI on July 5 1991, a number of depositors attempted to gain more than this total by 'assigning' their deposits in excess of Pounds 20,000 to family and friends. Under an apparent loophole in the 1987 Banking Act, which established the deposit protection scheme, this allowed each of the assignees to deposit compensation of up to Pounds 15,000. Pearlman, Kahan &amp; Joseph, a firm of chartered accountants based in north London, wrote to depositors to encourage them to exploit the law. The board has refused to pay the money assigned in this way to others, although it lost its case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The Bank of England moved swiftly to amend the act with a statutory instrument that outlawed the principle of assigning claims from early August 1991. But the law could not apply retrospectively for the few weeks since the closure of BCCI. Total payments under the scheme in connection with BCCI are about Pounds 65m to more than 17,000 depositors. The bank's liquidators estimate there may also be a final dividend of 30p-40p in the pound.</p>

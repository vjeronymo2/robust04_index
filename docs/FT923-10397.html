			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Pan Am to sell remaining assets LAST rites for Pan Am, once a flagship for the US airline industry but now defunct, will take place on August 4-7 as the airline sells its remaining assets in Miami, writes Nikki Tait. The auction will take place at Pan Am's maintenance base at Miami International Airport, which used to act as one of its major hubs. Pan Am, which stopped flying late last year, is technically still under bankruptcy court supervision, but the aim is to completely liquidate the assets in Miami. Items for auction include tooling equipment from the airline's overhaul shops.</p>

[passage omitted]    The believers were also addressed by the President of the  Presidency of ours state, Alija Izetbegovic. Here is an excerpt  from his address:    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] On this occasion we should  remember those who are facing considerable difficulties even  today: those in Maglaj, Bihac, or near Olovo. Thank God, it is  somewhat easier in some other places, Allah Akbar. This is a  chance to remember them and to ask the God to help them, to give  patience to the weak and power to the strong to endure. This is  perhaps a chance to remember with pride that we belong to a  huge, huge mass of people, celebrating Bairam today--a billion  people-- and, like us, hundreds of millions are attending Bairam  prayers, marking this great day.    You must know that the struggle is not over yet. More  difficult days are ahead. However, do not be afraid, we belong  to a nation which believes that you die once and live twice.

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER FOUND GUILTY IN DEATH OF 'STOLEN' BABY  </P> <P> A woman suspected of killing two infant daughters whom she claimed were  abducted was found guilty of first-degree murder Tuesday in one of the deaths.  </P> <P> The jury was to reconvene today on the question of whether Paula Marie Sims,  30, should be sentenced to death.  </P> <P> Jurors deliberated for two days before deciding that 6-week-old Heather Lee was  suffocated by her mother. Heather was one of two baby girls Sims said were  abducted by a masked gunman under nearly identical circumstances three years  apart.  </P> <P> Madison County prosecutor Donald Weber called it "the hardest case I ever had  to try." He said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by evidence that  Sims and her husband, Robert, wanted only male children.  </P> <P> "She didn't like little girls and neither did Robert," Weber said.  </P> <P> The father has not been charged in either case, but Weber said that because of  the verdict against Paula Sims, the state's attorney's offices in Madison and  Jersey counties may seek indictments against the 37-year-old man.  </P> <P> The jury found the mother guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, two  counts of obstructing justice and one count of concealing a homicide.  </P> <P> She also has been implicated in the 1986 death of her firstborn, 13-day-old  Loralei Marie, in Jersey County, but murder has not been charged in that case.  </P> <P> Paula Sims reported in June, 1986, that a masked man with a gun had entered her  home while she was watching television, made her lie on the floor and fled with  Loralei. A dead infant girl was found a week later near the Sims' home in  Brighton, in rural Jersey County.  </P> <P> On April 29, 1989, she reported that a masked gunman approached her as she was  taking out the garbage at home in Alton, in Madison County, where the family  then lived. She said the man ordered her back into the house, where he knocked  her unconscious, and that when she awoke Heather was gone.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Sympathy for Wood: Ron Wood, a guitarist with the Rolling Stones, was  recovering Tuesday after breaking two legs in the aftermath of a highway  accident.  </P> <P> Wood, 43, stepped from his limousine after it crashed Monday near Newbury, in  southern England. He was going to direct traffic away from the wreckage but an  oncoming car hit him. Tuesday he joked with friends: "The doctors have  prescribed as part of my treatment a pint of Guinness a day, so that can't be  bad." One of the other drivers involved in the accident, however, said Wood had  narrowly escaped death. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

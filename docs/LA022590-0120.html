			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NOISE POLLUTION  </P> <P> Three cheers for your editorial Feb. 4, "Off-Roaders Don't Belong in  Anza-Borrego Desert."  </P> <P> You failed to mention, however, one more good reason why off-roaders should be  kept out of the state park: noise pollution.  </P> <P> I travel the back roads of Anza-Borrego by mountain bike, and I wander in the  back country on foot. One of my primary rewards is the peace and quiet and  solitude which the desert offers, and which is easily destroyed by the whine of  an all-terrain vehicle. Let the stimulation junkies get their adrenaline highs  on their noisy vehicles, but please, not in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.  That is not why the park is there.  </P> <P> PHILIPPE VERMEYEN  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

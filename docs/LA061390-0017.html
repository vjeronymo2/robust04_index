			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PROJECT FOR MENTALLY ILL GAINS BACKING  </P> <P> Supporters of a proposed low-cost housing complex for the mentally ill received  assurance Tuesday that the project has the backing of a majority of the County  Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Supervisor John K. Flynn, a longtime booster of the proposed $4.5-million  project next to Camarillo State Hospital, said another supervisor, James R.  Dougherty, has decided to become the crucial third vote needed to keep the  project on track.  </P> <P> As it is proposed, the county must provide $600,000 to help build the  condominium project for 150 mentally ill people who are not confined full time  to a hospital. The federal government has set aside money to cover the  remaining cost.  </P> <P> Until Dougherty's announcement, only two board members, Flynn and Susan K.  Lacey, had committed themselves to the project. Others on the five-member  board, Madge L. Schaefer and Maggie H. Erickson, had said they wanted to wait  until formal budget hearings before taking a position.  </P> <P> Dougherty, the swing vote, was absent during earlier discussions. Tuesday,  Flynn read the supervisors a note from Dougherty saying, "I am committed to  supporting the mental health project at budget time, and . . . I believe  whatever steps are necessary to assure that the project proceeds in a timely  manner should be taken immediately."  </P> <P> Dougherty, who is recovering from throat surgery, was present but did not  speak. "This is the go-ahead we've been waiting for," Flynn said after the  meeting.  </P> <P> "Now we can proceed with getting a lease from the state, arranging for the  water supply and so forth."  </P> <P> Project supporters cheered when Flynn made the announcement. They had vowed to  attend board meetings every week until they were assured that the county would  pay its share of the cost.  </P> <P> "This means we have three of the five votes," said John Ellis, representing the  Friends and Advocates of the Mentally Ill. "It's important to us to have that  assurance." JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Crisis of confidence as Tel Aviv drops further 2.6% The Israeli stock exchange registered its third successive day of heavy falls yesterday, with the Mishtanim index dropping nearly 3 per cent, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. The market has been drifting downwards for several weeks, and has lost in excess of 25 per cent of its value in the last month. Analysts said that the market was going through a crisis of confidence, and ascribed the latest falls to a variety of factors: a financial crisis in the country's largest health fund, Kupat Holim Clalit, unexpectedly poor results published recently by several large companies, deadlock in the peace process with Syria, and soaring house prices that have been fuelling inflation, prompting recent interest rate rises.</p>

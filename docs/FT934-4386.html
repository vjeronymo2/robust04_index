			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (2): Complex pattern of relationships - Industry and Politics When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and his coalition took office this year, the party of industry, the Liberal Democratic party, lost power for the first time in four decades and politicians long cultivated by companies were sitting in the opposition benches for the first time. The realignment has disoriented Japanese companies and prompted them to seek closer relations with the bureaucrats whose power Mr Hosokawa is attempting to limit through his deregulation drive. Meanwhile, companies are reassessing the worth of links to LDP politicians - traditionally seen as representing the construction or trucking industries as much as arguing the case of their local constituencies. Within parliament, there are 'tribes' of politicians representing the interests of various sectors, and these have been dominated by LDP politicians. An unfolding construction industry scandal has highlighted the close links in the provinces between companies and the LDP, and similar ties are maintained with national politicians. Not only the construction industry had influence. The natural gas industry, through an economic organisation, bought advertisement space in LDP publications, including Y230m for six ads last financial year. But the end of LDP rule does not mean that Japanese companies have no influence over policy - because they also have close links to the bureaucrats, many of whom later join companies in the industry they have regulated. When Mr Hosokawa announced deregulation plans, the leaders of industry associations welcomed his plans but, at the same time, companies represented by those associations were queueing for employment 'adjustment subsidies' and industries were seeking bureaucratic help to cope with a deepening downturn. Deregulation is meant to increase competition in Japan, but it would also mean a new relationship between the administrators and the administered, which have seen the traditional links with the bureaucracy as both restraining and reassuring. These links are particularly reassuring when industry's political influence has declined with the departure of the LDP. Weaker corporate links with the ministries, which tend to deal with companies as an industry group rather than individually, would provide more freedom for aggressive companies to break from the orderly hierarchy that characterises some Japanese sectors and their courting of politicians. Japan's leading steel companies all announced losses in the first half this year, each with an eye on the figures of Nippon Steel, the industry leader. By selling equities, the companies are able to reduce their losses and increase profits at will, ensuring that each keeps its acknowledged place in line. The link between the regulators and the regulated is one thread in the complex pattern of relationships, but by tugging at that thread, Mr Hosokawa could change the shape of the whole in unexpected ways. Some industries which have been particularly generous political sponsors - such as those in the transport and construction sectors - will find their influence on the wane if strict limits are imposed on corporate donations. Japanese politicians have found ways in the past to get around restrictions on donations, and are likely to find new routes in the future. But the hotchpotch nature of the present coalition and its uncertain life has increased the difficulty for companies attempting to target future leaders for cultivation. For example, the orderly queue for ministerial posts and even the prime ministership provided a guide for companies and industries. In investigating the construction scandal, prosecutors found that companies had ranked politicians according to influence, beginning with A+ for the very powerful and down to D for those hardly worth taking out to dinner. In finance, the coming of the Hosokawa government has not quickened liberalisation, which is conducted at a pace directed by the bureaucracy. An official at one of the long-term credit banks allowed to establish a securities subsidiary earlier this year complained about the fresh list of restrictions introduced by the finance ministry, which was reacting to criticism from existing brokers that the banks would undermine their industry. The new subsidiaries are forbidden to share the same office as the parent bank, their staff must wear a uniform that is distinctively different from that of the bank staff, and their staff are unable to accompany bank staff on a client call. In effect, the bank official said, many of the advantages of deregulation have been lost in the new regulations. Banks are being allowed to enter new business in small groups, beginning with the long-term credit banks and ending with the commercial banks. Their access to new products is determined by the finance ministry, not by demand from customers, whose views are barely represented by politicians or bureaucrats. Changing the regulations will not necessarily change the way Japanese companies are treated. Companies are wary of treading on ministerial toes, fearing that a licence for a new product or that recession-linked assistance could be delayed by the small group of bureaucrats responsible for approving these matters. Japan's shipbuilders can testify to the power of the bureaucracy, as they were officially in recession until three years ago, following the downturn created by the yen's rise in the mid-1980s. As a result of technological improvements during that period, assisted by a range of government subsidies, the industry emerged from recession with a half share of the world market. By the end of April this year, Japan's car companies and computer makers had joined a list of 138 sectors eligible for government assistance in 'employment adjustment', covering the transfer of workers within companies, retraining and early retirement schemes. None of the companies wants this type of government intervention to end. This message will be passed on by political colleagues to Mr Hosokawa, now attempting to clear a path through the regulations holding back growth. He will find that many Japanese companies are reluctant to sever a network of ties among the bureaucracy, other companies in the same sector, and politicians that has served them well.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Bond bailed on charges over Manet MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Perth businessman, has been released on ADollars 200,000 (Pounds 88,000) bail after appearing in the Perth Court of Petty Sessions yesterday on charges relating to the use by Bond Corporation, his former corporate flagship, of a valuable Manet painting. Mr Bond appeared on four charges laid by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) following investigations into events in 1988 and 1989 involving the painting, La Promenade. The court ordered that Mr Bond, who was not required to plead, appear again on August 12. It also ordered that Mr Bond surrender any passport not already held by his trustee in bankruptcy and notify the federal director of public prosecutions before applying for return of his passport or permission to travel. In part, the ASC charges allege that Mr Bond, with intent to deceive or defraud, failed to notify the board of Bond Corporation (since renamed Southern Equities) of an opportunity to acquire La Promenade at a cost substantially less than market value. The ASC also alleges that Mr Bond gave Bond Corporation directors information he knew to be false and permitted the furnishing of false information to an auditor of the company. The ASC said in a statement yesterday that the La Promenade investigation had been lengthy and complex and had been conducted in conjunction with the federal police. In a statement released after the hearing, lawyers for Mr Bond claimed he was being singled out, and would vigorously deny the charges.</p>

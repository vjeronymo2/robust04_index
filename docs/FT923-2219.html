			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Delta wants public hearings on planned BA stake in USAir DELTA Air Lines, one of the big US carriers which is strongly opposing British Airways' plan to invest Dollars 750m for a large minority stake in USAir, yesterday called on the US Department of Transportation to hold public proceedings to consider the issues involved. The DoT, which must approve the deal, has not said how it plans to proceed - in particular, whether it will hold public hearings on the matter. Earlier this week, Mr Andrew Card, the transportation secretary, acknowledged that there was intense interest in the proposed transaction and its implications for future aviation policy, with the department receiving thousands of letters on the subject. Although BA would only have a minority interest in USAir, the large US airlines claim that the deal is structured to give the UK airline effective control over key areas of USAir's business. They claim that BA is thus gaining access to the US domestic market, while formal bilateral aviation agreements between the US and the UK severely restrict their access to the UK. This week, Mr Card indicated that the bilateral arrangements would be 'relevant' to his department decision on whether to approve the BA-USAir deal, although he denied any 'formal' linkage between the two issues. America West Airlines has formally received the funding from its Dollars 53m debtor-in-possession financing package, Reuters reports from New York. The company announced a new 10-member board of directors which provides GPA, one of the financing participants, with two seats.</p>

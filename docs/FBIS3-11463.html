Deputy Governor Simon Hernandez has told  PAGINA/12 that the commitments that were assumed under Decree  349, signed by President Carlos Menem and Labor Minister Armando  Caro Figueroa, "will entail no dismissals." However, a great  many of the 23,000 provincial public servants are expected to be  transferred through the sale of public enterprises.    The decree sets forth that the improvement of the province's  fiscal and financial situation and the structural reform of the  public sector will be implemented "in keeping with the economic  policy guidelines that the national government has adopted on  the subject."

Acting Governor Hernandez -- Governor Arnaldo Castillo is on  vacation -- said that the nation's contribution "was the  condition we imposed for signing the fiscal pact. Another  requirement that the Economy Ministry is fulfilling is the  implementation of an investment program for 120 million pesos.  [passage omitted]</p>

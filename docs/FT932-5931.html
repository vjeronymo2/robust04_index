			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: High-yielding European markets attract attention ONCE again, the high-yielding European government bond markets are attracting dealers and investors who expect bond yields in countries such as Italy, Spain and Sweden to decline gradually towards the levels seen in Germany. Spain and Italy were the top-performing government bond markets in May in local currency terms, with returns of 5.18 per cent and 2.86 per cent respectively, according to Kemper Investment Management, which monitors the performance of a wide range of bond markets. By contrast, Germany showed a return of 0.08 per cent, with only Japan (-0.37 per cent) and the US (-0.41 per cent) turning in a worse performance for the month in local currency terms. The Spanish bond market benefited from the peseta's devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism and the subsequent interest rate cuts. But high-yielding markets in general were spurred on by the expectation that Denmark would ratify the Maastricht treaty when it held its second referendum on May 18 - an assumption which in the event turned out to be correct. Bond market participants noted widespread switching out of German bunds into the high-yielding bond markets before the Danish referendum as investors hoped to gain from a rally in these markets. Even though there has been some profit-taking, many economists remain optimistic about the prospect for the high-yielding bond markets and continue to recommend switching out of Germany and into the Spanish and Italian markets. 'There's a lot of confusion about what the Bundesbank is up to at the moment,' says Mr Mark Brett, economist with BZW. 'People are revising their growth forecasts for Germany downwards, yet the Bundesbank is dragging its heels over cutting interest rates because the money supply data is still poor.' Mr Nigel Rendell, economist at James Capel, believes the Bundesbank has cut interest rates too fast, adding that the recent cuts 'are not justified by the economic fundamentals'. The uncertainty over Germany is encouraging many investors to look to the high-yielding European markets instead. 'The best value is still in the high-yielding markets,' says Mr Malcolm Butler, economist at UBS, pointing to Italy and Sweden. Mr Butler says that for risk-averse investors, the main part of their portfolio will probably consist of the hard-core currencies because he believes that Germany is unlikely to weaken further. But he urges less risk-averse investors to buy the high-yielding markets because of the likelihood that yield spreads over Germany are set to narrow. Even though the peseta saw a sell-off last week and could still suffer ahead of the Spanish general election on June 6, economists point out the bond market is likely to be buoyed by hopes of aggressive interest rate cuts. 'We think the peseta will suffer more in the run-up to the election . . . but bondholders need not panic. An even lower peseta accompanied by lower money rates are just pre-requisites for a sustained bond rally,' according to SG Warburg Securities. Mr Kermit Schoenholtz, director of Economic and Market Analysis at Salomon Brothers, recommends that investors concentrate on the short and intermediate maturities rather than long-dated bonds. 'Interest rates will be coming down in most of continental Europe - in Italy, Sweden, Spain and Denmark - so the short and intermediate sector of the yield curve is more attractive,' he says. 'A great deal of convergence has already occurred, and we expect to see short-term rates coming lower and staying lower.'</p>

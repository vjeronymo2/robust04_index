			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Poland to reduce its steel capacity POLAND'S steel-making capacity is to be cut over the next 10 years in a modernisation programme worth Dollars 4.5bn approved by the government this week. The programme foresees the closure of two mills and reduced capacity at four more of the country's 26 steel plants. This should bring output down to some 11.7m tonnes of steel in the year 2002 compared with 15m at present. In 1980, 19.5m tonnes of steel was produced and 13.6m tonnes in 1990. Output this year is expected to reach 9m tonnes. Under the new programme the sector's 124,000 workforce will be reduced to 44,000 over the same 10-year period. The government is looking to the World Bank to provide about Dollars 300m of financing for the plan which foresees the spending of Dollars 1.8bn on new capital investment. Another Dollars 1.8bn is to be spent on refurbishing existing plant. The Sedzimir mill in Krakow and that at Katowice, the two largest in the country, are to be merged. Three continuous steel casting lines, due to come on stream between 1993 and 1995, are to be installed at the new company. The plan sees Polish steel exports reaching 2m tonnes by the end of the century compared to sales abroad of 3.2m tonnes in 1991. Barriers to sales of steel to the European Community are to be removed by 1998 under Poland's association agreement with Brussels. See Editorial Comment</p>

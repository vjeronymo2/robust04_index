			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PART-TIME COLLEGE TEACHERS  </P> <P> Thank you for Gordon's article.  </P> <P> I am a part-time teacher at a local community college. I am limited to nine  hours of teaching per week at any one college; if I had more class time, the  college would be obliged to give me benefits. Heaven forbid!  </P> <P> I am single and pay no rent because I live in my grandmother's house.  Therefore, I am able to live on my teaching income as long as financial  emergencies don't arise. Many of my teaching colleagues, however, can only  survive economically by becoming "freeway flyers," who spend lots of time  traveling between teaching jobs.  </P> <P> I appreciate that, in some cases, part-time jobs might be good for some  teachers who have full-time jobs elsewhere, who are full-time university  students, or who have a spouse who works full time. However, many of us depend  on our part-time teaching as our main source of income.  </P> <P> For myself, I could live with the inequity in pay and the absence of job  security, but I would desperately like to be eligible for group medical  insurance. I think it is inexcusable that part-time teachers do not have access  to a group medical insurance plan.  </P> <P> JAN A. COPELAND  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

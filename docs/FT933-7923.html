			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Russia launches oil privatisation RUSSIA launches the first official privatisation of oil companies today. On offer are just 8.3 per cent of Komineft, which produces oil and gas, and two of its subsidiaries, Tebukneft, which produces oil, and Snabneft, which supplies oil equipment. The fact that only a small proportion of shares are on sale, compared to stakes offered in manufacturing and services, reflects the political battle around privatisation, particularly of such a key industry. Despite attempts by Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, to switch companies from socialism to capitalism as fast as possible, there has been well-argued opposition to giving away shares in an industry requiring particularly large capital investment. Subscription for shares, offered in exchange for privatisation vouchers given to each Russian citizen but purchasable by foreigners and others, is open until September 15. Mr Valentin Leonidov, director-general of Komineft, said another 8 per cent of his company would be put on sale later for money, with the proceeds providing a welcome 'if insignificant' financial boost of perhaps Rbs3bn. He hoped to attract some foreign investors. Komineft is one of Russia's better-run oil companies. 'Leonidov is excellent,' said one western oil executive whose company has a joint venture with Komineft. 'With Komineft, you would be buying into something that's functioning relatively well already.' Although the oil industry is considered a jewel of the Russian economy, it is saddled with customers who do not pay their bills, including state-owned refineries. As a result, it is owed a total of Rbs1,200bn. Komineft is owed Rbs66bn, while owing other companies just Rbs5bn. Starved of investment by the state, a quarter of his oil wells are idle, and he expects his production, including that produced by joint ventures, to fall to 11m tonnes this year from 12m last year. He has so far relied mainly on foreign capital to help redress the situation, setting up five joint ventures with foreign partners which supply equipment in return for the right to export oil produced.</p>

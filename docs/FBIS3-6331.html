			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A top-ranking Trade  Ministry official on Thursday [17 March] called for the ruling  coalition to reach a consensus on comprehensive tax reforms by  the end of May. In view of administrative and other technical  works to be required, agreement around late June, as widely  sought, is too late, said the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry ministry official, who requested anonymity.    A forum set up by the seven-party coalition is working on  tax  reforms, including multiyear tax cuts designed to spur domestic  demand, to show Japan's commitment to the plan at the Naples  summit of the seven industrialized countries in early July.    The official said he has no knowledge on whether Ichiro  Ozawa, a coalition key figure, will fly to Washington shortly in  search of a breakthrough in the trade framework talks.    Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is said to have a  considerable clout in the government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and is believed to have played a major role in last  week's settlement of the cellular phone trade dispute between  Tokyo and Washington. It is not desirable for men such as  Ozawa, who is not the leader of Japan, to play a part in getting  the stalled talks moving again, the MITI official said.</p>

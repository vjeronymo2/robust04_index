			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The Paramount Unified School District has offered teachers a 2% salary  increase, Supt. Richard B. Caldwell said. In a Feb. 9 story about teacher  contract negotiations in several Southeast school districts, The Times  incorrectly reported that the Paramount district had offered its teachers a 5%  salary increase. Caldwell said a 5% salary increase already has been accepted  by classified and management employees. Negotiations with teachers remain at an  impasse.  </P></p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Slowly rebuilding reform from the ruins: India faces the task of restoring business confidence at home and abroad after the Ayodhya temple sacking Mr Mohamed Ismail, a furniture maker whose business was destroyed in the recent riots in India, stares at the blackened remains of his workshop and says: 'Only God knows what we can do now.' Mr Ismail's livelihood went up in smoke when rioters set fire to a timber market in Seelampur, a poor suburb of New Delhi, inhabited mainly by Moslems. The commercial life of the district is slowly limping back to normal. In the narrow alleyways surrounding the timber yard, men are hard at work at sewing machines, lathes, and welding irons. 'We lost two weeks' work through the violence and through police curfews,' says Mr Bashir Rahmad, who sews button-holes into jeans for export, 'but now things are all right.' India will be relying on men like Mr Rahmad in the next few months, if the country's economy is to recover from the damage done after the sacking of the mosque in Ayodhya. Not only will the physical destruction have to be repaired, but so will the harm done to the confidence of businessmen - including foreigners, whom India expects to play a critical role in the government's economic modernisation programme. Mr Ashok Desai, the government's top economic adviser, says: 'Ayodhya is a setback.' The crisis has come at a tough time, with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, under public pressure to demonstrate the benefits of the liberalisation policy launched in mid-1991. So far, businessmen have responded hesistantly to the government's initiatives. Ayodhya will make them even more cautious. They are pleased the violence has been stopped; now they want to see that political in-fighting does not distract Mr Rao from economic reform. As Mr Tarun Dass, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), says: 'The government has already lost four weeks. Let's hope it doesn't lose any more time.' The estimate of production lost through disruption amounts to about Rs90bn (Dollars 3.2bn) or the equivalent of about 1 per cent of national output. Even if some companies recapture lost orders, others will not, particular in time-sensitive industries such as fashion textiles for export. The Indian Export Organisation, a trade promotion group, says some export shipments will have to be carried by air to meet customers' demands - at a loss to the producer. 'It will take weeks or months for the situation to normalise,' says Mr Freddie Mehta, a director of Tata group, India's largest industrial conglomerate. Fortunately, good rains have boosted farm output this year, so the government should exceed its 3.5 per cent real economic growth target for the year to the end of March 1993. However, industry, the main focus of economic reform, is doing worse than anticipated - the CII expects to see industrial growth of just 3 per cent, compared with an official target of 5 per cent. A curb in government spending, a crucial element in the liberalisation programme, has hit demand for steel and engineering goods, while private sector demand has failed to fill the gap. Exports are growing steadily, as the government had intended, but domestic consumption is sluggish. With shoppers holding back, businessmen have been reluctant to commit themselves. Some are scared of the prospect of foreign competition. 'They're trembling at the thought,' says Mr Deepak Mukarji, communications manager at Dupont, the US chemicals group. Other companies are busy seeking tie-ups with foreign companies for manufacturing foreign-designed goods in India. Foreign companies have pledged to invest some Dollars 1.4bn since mid-1991. However, less than 25 per cent of this total is expected to come to fruition in 1992-93. A few foreign companies, mainly American, are pressing ahead with sizable projects, among them General Electric, which has established joint venture factories in plastics and medical equipment and is planning others in refrigerators and lighting. But other groups see little need to rush into India. Royal Dutch/Shell, the oil giant, this month pulled out of a planned Dollars 2bn petrochemicals complex after arguments with its Indian partner. Ayodhya will give further pause for thought to foreign executives who are at an early stage of planning Indian ventures. Some economists in Delhi like to compare India with China, and argue that the crisis will not derail economic modernisation, just as the shooting of students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 barely affected China's reforms. However, even in 1989, reform was more deeply entrenched in China than in India today. Foreign investors were convinced that the rewards outweighed the potential risks. As a senior official of AT&amp;T, the American telecommunications group, says: 'China had reached critical mass. India has not.' Also, China is an authoritarian dictatorship. Its leaders were able to suppress post-Tiananmen protests without fear of being overthrown. India is a democracy in which consensus is important. Mr Rao was able to carry out economic reform quite rapidly in the year to mid-1992 because there was little criticism from the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the main opposition party. But, even before Ayodhya, the consensus was coming under strain. The pace of reform appeared to slow amid protests from farmers about the impact of cuts in fertiliser price subsidies and from trade unionists about proposed redundancy laws. The Bombay securities market scandal delayed planned financial liberalisation. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank warned Mr Rao against foot-dragging on reform. The prime minister told them to wait until February, when the 1993 Budget would bring a bagful of important measures. Even though Mr Rao remains committed to deregulation, as does Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, their supporters are distracted by the arguments over Ayodhya. The crisis threatens to polarise politics between supporters and opponents of the BJP, which sponsored the rally at which the Ayodhya mosque was destroyed. Mr Rao is seeking to build an anti-BJP front, which would include left-wing parties. At the least, since the ruling Congress (I) party lacks an absolute majority, Mr Rao will have to bargain with his allies to get economic legislation through parliament. At worst, Congress could decide that a new man is needed at the helm - perhaps someone more forceful than the mild-mannered Mr Rao. Such an upheaval would unsettle even the most positive-minded investors. As Mr Stephen Brandon, General Electric's manager in India, says: 'Although Ayodhya has brought us short-term disruption and delay it will not (of itself) have any long-term effect on our plans. However, we would be disturbed to see any change of government bringing uncertainty about policy.'</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Mortgage applications rise MORTGAGE applications to Halifax Building Society jumped 50 per cent in the seven days after its mortgage-rate reduction last week, the society said yesterday. Halifax said the increased buyer activity had been sustained this week, but added: 'We are cautious because this is a very short run for us to be able to predict that the housing market is on the turn.' Barclays, the largest UK bank, yesterday cut its mortgage interest rate by 0.56 percentage points to 10.99 per cent (11.6 APR) with immediate effect for new applicants. Existing customers will have their rates reviewed after the Budget on March 10. The cut brings Barclays level with the large building societies, and other banks such as Abbey National, National Westminster and TSB which have already reduced their mortgage rates. Barclays is also offering mortgages at 10.6 per cent, fixed for three or five years. The cut in mortgage rates is seen as the final factor - combined with discounts for first-time buyers, falling house prices and the ending of stamp duty on house purchases under Pounds 250,000 until August - which may have stimulated the market. Mortgage applications are running at January 1990 levels, higher than the brief upturn seen last January.</p>

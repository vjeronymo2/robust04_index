			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Americans set UK on the right track - Serious Money THE DOMINANCE of American culture often causes resentment in the UK. Many Britons long for the days when fast food meant fish and chips, not Big Macs, and when cinemas showed Ealing comedies rather than Lethal Weapon 3. But there are some areas where a dose of American business culture can do Britain a lot of good. In financial services, it has often seemed that US consumers have had a much wider choice and a better standard of service than their British counterparts. As one example, those who do not want to pay a credit card fee have 447 cards to choose from. Some US practices and products are filtering over to the British side of the Atlantic, though, and there are two prime examples this week. The first is the 'tracker' or index fund. The concept is based on the evidence that most fund managers fail to beat the stock market indices. Rather than gamble on finding one of the few managers who can beat the index, why not just create a fund that buys all the shares in the index? These index funds have seized a large part of the institutional market in the US and are becoming increasingly popular with UK pension funds. But, as I have argued before, the concept is even better news for the private investor, who finds it so difficult to obtain a properly diversified portfolio or to pick 'blue chip' stocks that live up to the name. There are several indexed unit trusts in existence already, but none based on the most prominent UK market benchmark - the FT-SE 100 index. On September 28, though, James Capel will launch a Footsie fund that gives investors a simple way to invest in 100 of Britain's biggest companies. The aim will be to track the index within 0.15 per cent a month and the fund will have an initial charge of 4 per cent, with a discount of 1 per cent until the end of the year. The annual charge is 1 per cent. These charges are not the cheapest in the indexed market. Gartmore abolished the initial charge on its index fund (which tracks the FT-A All-Share) earlier this year and its annual charge is just 0.5 per cent. Indeed, there is an argument that indexed funds should incur much lower costs than traditional 'active' managers who have to visit companies, analyse accounts and the like. To be fair to Capel, there are extensive costs involved in establishing such a fund, and Footsie can be a difficult index to track since stocks are replaced on a fairly regular basis and some companies, such as Maxwell Communications and Polly Peck, can disappear altogether. The Capel fund is also available via a relatively low minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 (or Pounds 40 a month via the savings scheme), compared with Pounds 5,000 (or Pounds 100 a month) at Gartmore. It is to be hoped, however, that if Capel does raise a substantial sum though this offer, it will eventually pass on, via a lower annual charge, some of the economies of scale that can be achieved through indexation. The second development this week has a more direct American origin. Fidelity, the big US financial services group, is expanding and re-launching its stockbroking service. The share-owning culture is far more widespread in the US, with many towns having their own stockbroker's office. Brokers do not have the 'stuffy' image that they have in the UK (despite some valiant efforts, by the likes of Sharelink, to alter perceptions). The Fidelity service has many elements which other UK brokers may be able to match and, indeed, beat but, as an overall package, it still looks impressive. As before, you can call an 0800 freephone number for service between 8am and 6pm on weekdays. The weekend hours have now been extended to run from 9am to 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Commission charges are not the lowest in the market but, at a minimum of Pounds 25 (on deals up to Pounds 2,500), they are reasonably competitive. (The rate on Pounds 2,501-Pounds 5,000 is Pounds 50; the maximum is Pounds 250). Fidelity's Shareholder Plus service adds a further incentive by holding all dividends in a money market account, linked to the Bank of Scotland, which pays a gross rate of 8.5 per cent. Money awaiting investment will also be held in this account. The money market account is not unique (Albert E. Sharp has such an account for its discretionary clients, with a chequebook attached). But two further elements of the service do seem particularly interesting for those FT readers who are active investors. First, there is a commission discount for those frequent traders who spend more than Pounds 250 in commission in a calendar month. Second, Fidelity is making it easier for investors to buy US and European shares. Judging from the inquiries I have had at the FT, many investors have had problems buying overseas stocks. Fidelity's minimum commission on US securities is Dollars 38 (around Pounds 19). On a purchase of stock of Dollars 5,000, the commission would be Dollars 88.50 (around Pounds 45). Commissions on European stocks are much steeper, starting at Pounds 100. The service is entirely execution-only, so it will not suit those many investors who need advice on their portfolios. But even if your own broker can match the above services, it must be good for investors to see a major US group competing hard for business in the UK broking market.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNAWAY PRODUCTION  </P> <P> I never cease to be astonished by the cavalier and indifferent attitude that  Hollywood and Los Angeles project toward the movie industry.  </P> <P> Amid all the publicity and self-congratulatory hoopla over Disney's new theme  park and production facility in Orlando, Fla., did no one realize that what we  have here is the most aggressive display of runaway production yet?  </P> <P> Of course, Hollywood studios have always been notorious for their lack of  community involvement, but to see the unions, craft people and guilds yawn  blithely while the industry drifts out of the city and the state is shocking.  </P> <P> These production facilities do not mean more production: They mean that  production that was done here will not be in the future.  </P> <P> Disney/MGM and Universal, which also will soon open a theme park/production  center in Florida, have not spent a billion dollars just to let facilities lie  empty. They will be forced to use the facilities to justify the enormous  expenditures.  </P> <P> Thank you, Disney, MCA and MGM for having such a sense of loyalty to this great  city. Thank you for keeping the faith with the people who have made the  industry great.  </P> <P> And when the dusts of unemployment blow down the streets of Hollywood, what  difference could it make? Disney has created Hollywood in a theme park. A park  without people, tradition or history. A park without a soul. A park without  weeds, dreams or problems. A hollow replica of the great Dream Factory.  </P> <P> What else could we expect from the masters of the automaton? Certainly nothing  so human as gratitude.  </P> <P> GERALD R. REED  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

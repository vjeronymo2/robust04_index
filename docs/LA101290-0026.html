			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'MR. DESTINY'S' VIEWERS DESERVE A BETTER FATE  </P> <P> Near the opening of "Mr. Destiny" (citywide), Michael Caine as Mr. D. himself,  must explain to ordinary guy James Belushi that what is and what might have  been are, well, you might just say fated, but "That's how destiny works -- very  subtly."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for moviegoers, very subtly is not how "Mr. Destiny" works. It's  an attempt at fantasy so plodding that by its end it feels as though we'd  walked the 20 years back to Belushi's past, then hacked our way out of it  again.  </P> <P> It's roughly the 83rd "if-only" sports movie: if only our hero had caught it,  ducked it, dunked it, swung at it, not swung at it or sat on it . . . his life  would have been completely different. If only these movies would be.  </P> <P> Filmmakers James Orr and Jim Cruickshank, who co-wrote "Three Men and a Baby"  and between them bear full responsibility for this soggy cruller, lay the blame  for Belushi's present mundane life on his high school baseball championship  strike-out. Now, at 35, he's a small cog in a sporting equipment empire where  his wife Linda Hamilton is the union shop steward. The business is in danger of  a take-over by insider shark Hart Bochner  </P> <P> After the worst day in Belushi's life, he has one of bartender Mr. Destiny's  drinks -- the Spilt Milk -- and is transported to a far, far better past, one  where TV sitcom rules of class and caste apply. So Belushi finds himself  married to the boss's daughter, Rene Russo and living in "Being There's"  baronial mansion and the movie's arch and curiously dated humor comes from what  the filmmakers call their Everyguy, wandering around his ritzy digs, goggling  at the behavior of the swells.  </P> <P> His English butler will not know what Belushi wants when he asks for "the can"  and will turn the word brewski over disdainfully in his mouth. Belushi's two  young kids -- mysteriously non-existent in his "real" life -- and his wife  attend the op-er-ah, wearing velvet togetherness outfits like those families in  mall photographer's Mother's Day studies.  </P> <P> You can keep yourself awake by brooding about the fate of these kids in the  time-travel switchback, but the only real spark to this infinite affair comes  from Linda Hamilton's intrinsic warmth and from art director Catherine  Hardwicke. She and set decorator Karen Steward created Caine's splendid  nostalgic bar and The Golf of Mexico, a miniature golf course so hilarious  it'll probably be in theme parks before Christmas. However the movie, whose  pinnacle of self-discovery is, "I guess I just didn't know what I had," is a  destiny to be avoided at all costs.  </P> <P> 'MR.

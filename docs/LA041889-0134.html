			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> U.S. URGED TO LIFT FETAL TISSUE BAN  </P> <P> Expert advisers to the National Institutes of Health formally recommended today  that the government lift its year-old ban on transplant research using tissue  from aborted human fetuses.  </P> <P> But researchers and federal officials said the ban is likely to remain in place  for some time, despite the experts' recommendation.  </P> <P> The ban stems from a proposed study on transplanting fetal nerve tissue into  people suffering from Parkinson's disease. Due to the emotional nature of the  debate over fetal tissue research and strong opposition from the anti-abortion  movement, the panel's report is likely to undergo lengthy and intense scrutiny  by Congress and the Administration.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FOOD-SERVICE FACILITY OPENS WITH 'BREAD-CUTTING' CEREMONY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE JAMES AND CAROL COLLINS CENTER FOR HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT, AN  18,000-SQUARE-FOOT OPERATION ON THE CAL POLY CAMPUS IN POMONA, WAS FUNDED BY  $3.5 MILLION.  </P> <P> Atop a hill on the campus of California Polytechnic Institute, Pomona, remote  from the 21s and the Spagos of the world, a dream has unfolded aimed at  creating the next Julia Child or Baron Hilton.  </P> <P> The dedication Sunday of a handsome complex dedicated to restaurant and hotel  management, to culinary arts and wine service, concludes a seven-year quest by  food visionaries who have long felt that the West, creator of fast food trends  that swept the nation, lacked a center dedicated to food, service and  hospitality education.  </P> <P> The James and Carol Collins Center for Hospitality Management was funded by  $3.5 million in funds raised from donations and used no public funding. The  18,000-square-foot facility instantly becomes the West Coast's most energetic  such collegiate program.  </P> <P> More than four dozen food and hospitality corporations donated $1,000 or more  and dozens of other benefactors contributed smaller amounts to have the  facility built to serve the 800 students now enrolled in Cal Poly's Hotel and  Restaurant Management program, which began in 1973.  </P> <P> However, it wasn't until a decade later that Collins met with Dr. Robert Small,  director of the center, and other interested parties plans were made to raise  the funds to build the center.  </P> <P> Included in the building are some $200,000 in food preparation equipment, all  donated by manufacturers. The equipment and the students are on view in a  kitchen that is visible through a glass wall at the entrance to the restaurant  area.  </P> <P> Plans call for the center to have a full-service, white tablecloth restaurant  open to the public by September. Service will be Monday through Friday for  lunch and Wednesday through Saturday for dinner. Wine and beer will be served;  a full wet-bar will be on site, but used for laboratory purposes only.  </P> <P> Also included in the facility is a demonstration kitchen and a $650,000  research project sponsored by Southern California Edison to study energy use  and efficiency in various food service appliances -- a project that gives the  school sophisticated equipment and gives the public utility much-needed data on  the performance and energy demands of new food service equipment.  </P> <P> Tarun Kapoor, associate professor in the Center for Hospitality Management,  said the hospitality program will make full use of the new facility.  </P> <P> "We have a class in catering management, and we intend to run catered events,  conducted by the students," he said. Also part of the program will be a hotel  management program including courses in front office management; hotel  operations, and hotel sales and public relations.  </P> <P> Among four-year schools offering degrees in hospitality, Cornell University and  Michigan State are considered the best schools in the nation.  </P> <P> Collins, chairman of Collins Foods International, parent company of the Sizzler  restaurants chain, donated $1 million to have the center constructed, and he  spoke briefly at Sunday's bread-cutting ceremony (which replaced the  traditional ribbon-cutting).  </P> <P> "Fast food was started out West and has become successful around the country,  and the only thing we didn't have was a world-class culinary center to compete  with those in the east," said Collins. "Ten years from now, they're going to be  talking about Cal Poly Pomona and then maybe about Cornell and Michigan State."  </P> <P> Kapoor pointed out that Cornell and Michigan State have emphasized hotel  management in their hospitality programs, "but because of California's  trend-setting history in the food area, we have decided to specialize in food  and wine." He said that a master's degree program in the department may someday  be offered.  </P> <P> Kapoor added that this undergraduate program was not intended to compete with  programs such as those offered at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde  Park, N.Y., or the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco, but might be a  prelude to further study at those programs.  </P> <P> The second phase of the center, for which fund-raising has already begun, will  focus on the wine and alcoholic beverage management program. Phase 2, expected  to cost about $3 million, already has a substantial grant from wine collector  Elwell Averbeck.  </P> <P> Plans for Phase 2 include a wine cellar, a living wine library and a major  wine-tasting facility that could be home for the Los Angeles County Fair wine  competition. A number of California wineries have already said they will donate  wines to start the cellar.  </P> <P> Architect for the center was John Tegtmeyer, a Cal Poly Pomona graduate who is  with the architectural firm of Pederson, Beckhart, Wesley and Stice.  </P> <P> Among the graduates of the hospitality program here are Mark Peel, owner/chef  at Campanile; Sam Manolakas, owner of Bradshaw's restaurant in Sacramento, and  Rick Redman, general manager of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> The program at present has 14 full-time instructors, but by September will have  20 full-time instructors.  </P> <P> Sunday's dedication ceremonies featured food prepared by eight of Southern  California's top chefs. Visitors toured classrooms, student study areas,  instructors' offices, the beverage management lab, a computer lab and the  demonstration hotel classroom.  </P> <P> At Sunday's dedication, campus president Hugh O. La Bounty announced that the  chairman and co-chairman of the center's advisory committee, respectively,  would be Collins and Richard Frank, president and chief executive officer of  Lawry's Restaurants Inc., for whom a lecture series at the center is named.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTk) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel  today left for an eight-day tour of India and Thailand,  accompanied by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, Finance  Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Deputy Industry and Trade Minister  Radomir Sabela.    In Delhi Havel will meet Indian President Shankar Dayal  Sharma, at whose invitation the visit takes place and Indian  Premier Narasimh P. V. Rao. He will also travel to Varanasi and  Calcutta, where he will visit Mother Theresa's mission.    On February 11 Havel will visit Thailand at the invitation  of  the king of Thailand, Phumiphon Adunyadet. Besides meeting the  king, Havel will meet Thai Premier Chuan Likphai and Chairman of  Parliament Marut Benneg.    This is Havel's second trip to Asia which he visited in  April  1992 in his capacity as Czechoslovak president. He went then to  Japan and South Korea and on his way back home he made a short  stop-over in India.    "One of the goals of my current visit to Asia is to  emphasize  the Czech Republic's membership in the United Nations Security  Council and our share of responsibility for world developments  ensuing from this membership. We also want to point out that  also far distant countries are very important for the Czech  Republic," Havel said before his departure.</p>

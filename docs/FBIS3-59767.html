			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) will initiate comprehensive technical development of new  diamond materials, which are expected to find applications in  electronic devices that operate under extreme conditions imposed  by global environmental problems [sic]. MITI will establish a  joint research system for national research institutes and  private companies, begin work on the creation of carbon and  carbon-containing (new diamond) materials and on development of  their basic manufacturing technology, and even get involved in  the control of their properties and their evaluation. MITI will  also work on development of basic technology for their use as  threshold electronics materials. More specifically, beginning in  1994 MITI will seek out the possibilities of creating a variety  of carbon materials using AIST's advanced research system and  plans to promote it as a national project by 1996.    The use of diamonds has expanded dramatically with the  advent  of gas phase synthesis technology. Not only in the field of wear  resistance, which utilizes the hardness properties of diamonds,  but also in the fields of electronics and optics the uses of  diamonds have expanded rapidly, and already researchers have  created primitive transistors and several passive devices.    On the other hand, the group of substances that have carbon  as their main component include a variety of forms such as DLC  (diamond lattice carbon films), fullerenes (C&lt;inf&gt; 60&lt;/inf&gt; ),  carbon tubes and carbenes. Moreover, their crystal structures  can be linear, planar, three-dimensional or amorphous. In  addition to SiC and B&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; C, we can also expect still  unknown carbon compounds such as C&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; N&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt;  and BCN to appear. It is projected that these new diamonds will  become a one trillion yen market in the 21st century.    In order to promote the sophisticated use of these carbon  and  carbon-containing compounds, the policy toward new diamonds  planned by MITI involves R&amp;D on a large scale from basic to  applied research including development of basic materials and  the techniques to manufacture them, development of technology to  control their crystalline and electronic properties, and  development of applications focusing on electronic materials.    First MITI plans to establish a system for joint R&amp;D by  private corporations and university experts anchored by national  research institutes and then conduct advanced research for one  or two years.    The following specific themes have been proposed:    1. Research on basic technology to create new substances    2. Research on basic techniques for growing crystals    3. Study of basic techniques to control electronic structure    4. Research concerning applied technology.    New diamonds are attracting attention as possible electronic  devices that can be used under extreme environmental conditions.  Active research is being carried out in Japan, the U.S. and  European Community. MITI's commitment to new diamond technology  will surely encourage further R&amp;D in the industry.</p>

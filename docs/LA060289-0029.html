			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AGENT, SUSPECT WOUNDED DURING SHOOTOUT AT PARK  </P> <P> A drug bust erupted into gunfire Thursday night at Golden Hill Park, leaving a  federal agent hospitalized and his assailant in serious condition with wounds  to the neck and leg.  </P> <P> Two other men were arrested during the alleged drug deal and shooting, which  surprised and startled park visitors.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 6 p.m. when Tony Campbell, an undercover Drug  Enforcement Agent, exchanged money for 20 ounces of heroin allegedly sold by  Miguel Angel Flores-Palbar, 21, and Jesus Alberto Gutierrez-Corrales, 29, both  of Culiacan, Mexico.  </P> <P> Campbell, working with a multiagency anti-drug task force, then gave the arrest  signal to his colleagues, according to Charles Hill, special agent-in-charge of  the DEA's San Diego office. But a lookout for the alleged drug dealers, Luciano  Pulido-Barela, believed to be 36, saw what was happening, pulled out a  .45-caliber handgun and, according to Hill, shot Campbell in the chest from 15  to 20 feet away.  </P> <P> The bullet, however, was deflected by Campbell's bulletproof vest. Knocked down  by the impact, Campbell got up and began chasing Pulido through the park, which  is located at 25th and A streets. He was joined by other agents of the task  force, made up of DEA, U.S. Customs, Border Patrol and California Highway  Patrol officers, Hill said.  </P> <P> Several bystanders in the park witnessed the chase, and their presence caused  the agents to withhold their gunfire, Hill said, but Pulido continued firing at  the officers as he fled. When they were clear of the park-goers, the agents  fired at Pulido, hitting him in the neck and leg.  </P></p>

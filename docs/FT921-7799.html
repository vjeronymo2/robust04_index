			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Companies 'underrated' recession MANY companies thought the recession would be short-lived and have found it necessary to review costs only in the last year, according to a survey by KPMG Management Consulting. The study, based on a survey of 50 large companies, showed that 83 per cent have undertaken a one-off cost-reduction exercise in the past 12 months, compared to 30 per cent in the previous year. Mr Mike Morrow, a partner in KPMG Management Consulting, said the survey identified seven points to successful cost reduction: Strong and visible commitment from senior management. Willingness to question and challenge structure, culture and methods. Determination to see the project through. Understanding of what happens at the operating level and what activities and factors drive costs. Participation of managers and a clear communication of why cuts are needed. Understanding of business priorities to meet customer needs. Decisive management action combined with a fair deal for all employees. 'Without these,' Mr Morrow said, 'companies risk a failure to achieve objectives, doing more harm than good or costs simply creeping back up again.' The survey also found that three quarters of respondents wanted to create a process of continual cost competitiveness and almost 80 per cent said all areas of the company were the subject of the most recent cost-reduction exercise. Four out of five companies managed the cost-reduction exercise at board level. More than 90 per cent cut jobs as a result and 74 per cent reduced discretionary overheads. Almost half said they achieved a 5 per cent to 10 per cent cost reduction and 65 per cent expected to achieve their savings within the first 12 months. Many companies underestimated the disruption to management while the cost-reduction programme was being implemented, and nearly one in five companies admitted costs had crept back up.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Summer reading - Book Fairs FOR book collectors, June is a high point of the year. The antiquarian and second-hand book trade holds a series of fairs in London hotels at which many thousands of tomes can be seen. Although more than half those sold go to other dealers, the public are welcome. The biggest selection of books, about 85,000, can be seen at the two fairs in the Hotel Russell in Russell Square, Bloomsbury. These are sometimes called the London Fairs, or the Russell Fairs, although are still known as the PBFA, from the initials of the association which organises them. Most books cost less than Pounds 100 - many much less. The stock changes between the two fairs, but buying the catalogue for the first will let you in to the second. On two of the days experienced dealers offer a roadshow at which they give advice and valuations, although they are not permitted to make offers. The other 'London' fair, held at the Bonnington Hotel nearby in Southampton Row, off Russell Square, is smaller. Most dealers are part-timers, and the books are cheaper and more modern. On two of the days the book fair is joined by dealers in maps and prints, some from the International Antique Map Fair, to be held at the New Connaught Rooms in Great Queen Street, off Kingsway. The Bloomsbury fair, at the Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way, near Russell Square, is comparable to its bigger rival at the Russell Hotel, with a pleasing mixture of antiquarian and modern. The 'International', at the Cafe Royal at the foot of Regent Street, includes a few dealers from abroad but consists mostly of British dealers offering books from about Pounds 100 up. The most expensive books are to be found at the Antiquarian Booksellers Association (ABA) fair at the Park Lane hotel - which, confusingly, is not in Park Lane but at the Hyde Park Corner end of Piccadilly. The fair opens at 6pm during the preview evening on Tuesday June 23. The catalogue, which serves as an entry fee, costs Pounds 15, but falls to Pounds 6 the following morning. You can buy a page of music in the handwriting of Beethoven for Pounds 28,500 (Wilson) or an original quarto of The Wealth of Nations for Pounds 20,000 (Steedman). The most moving item is a manuscript 'Character Book' listing the convicts bound for Western Australia on board the Edwin Fox in August 1858 (Remington, Pounds 5,000). It records the names, ages, former occupations, crimes and other details of 284 unfortunate men compelled to leave their country for their country's good.

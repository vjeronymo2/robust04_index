			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [State of the Nation Address by President Guillermo Endara </F> at the Legislative Palace in Panama City -- live]    [Text] Your Excellencies Arturo Vallarino, president of the  Legislative Assembly; Dr. Arturo Hoyos, president of the Supreme  Court of Justice; Vice President Guillermo Ford Boyd; Mr.  Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Mr. Comptroller General and  Deputy Comptroller General; Reverend Oscar Brown, auxiliary  bishop of Panama; honorable Attorney General and Solicitor  General; honorable Supreme Court of Justice Magistrates;  honorable Electoral Tribunal Magistrates; Governors; Mayors of  Panama City and San Miguelito Districts; directors, managers,  deputy directors, and assistant managers of decentralized  agencies; special guests; members of the local and foreign  media; ladies and gentlemen:    This is the ninth and last time I will appear before you to  fulfill my constitutional obligation of addressing you at the  beginning of each legislative period to deliver a message on  administrative matters. The next time I come to this arena, in  six months, I will be doing it to deliver the presidential sash  to the president the people will freely elect in May. At that  time, the Legislative Assembly will comprise citizens who enjoy  the approval of the majority of their voters. Because of this,  the legislative period that begins today provides the current  Legislative Assembly with a final opportunity to discuss the  important bills it still has to discuss. Whatever is not done  within the next four months will be left as unconcluded work by  the representatives who were elected in 1989.    This is why I want to begin my speech by encouraging you to  make this last phase of the mandate you received a constructive  phase in every sense for the benefit of the Panamanian people.    Exactly four years ago I addressed you for the first time.  The Legislative Assembly was belatedly installed on that day  and that installation marked the beginning of the relationship  the legislative and executive branches have maintained. In my  opinion, this relationship shows a positive balance. We have  made conscious efforts to work in a reasonably harmonious way.  We have also been aware of the limits imposed by our respective  state branches.    Throughout these years, in my eight previous speeches at  this  assembly, I have touched on several issues. Some of them were  reiterations. On other occasions I discussed issues that at a  given moment were of special interest.    I have repeatedly spoken about the critical situation under  which we assumed the government and about the chaos in which we  found the country at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990.  We have spoken about serious maladjustments in state finances  and about the enormous foreign debt burden we inherited from the  past regime.    We have spoken about the depths of unemployment and poverty  into which we were plunged and about the continuous efforts we  have made since then to mitigate these problems in the short-,  mid-, and long- term.    We have spoken about how necessary it is to encourage our  worn out economy and about the predominant role the private  sector has as an engine of economic recovery and development.    We have spoken about the functions of the state and about  the  size of the state in relation to private activities. We have  discussed specific actions we have adopted in this regard.    We have discussed public security and the social peace we  want and have been building despite the obstacles we faced.    We have discussed democracy, the creation of a de jure  state,  civil liberties, especially freedom of expression and respect  for the independence and separation of the state branches.    We have spoken about my conviction that it is necessary to  produce a clean and fair elections campaign and to deliver power  to the legitimate winner of the elections.    Other issues also have been the source of special interest  in  my messages at the beginning of each legislative period.    Among these issues I must mention the urgent and pressing  need to save the Social Security Bank, which was heading for  bankruptcy because of past mismanagement; the creation of the  Interoceanic Region Authority to manage those assets that have  been returned and will be returned; the amendment to the  Constitution to create the Panama Canal Administration that will  pave the road for assuming control of the canal at the end of  the century; and the basic law for the existence of a  police-minded, not military-minded, public force as an important  tool for guaranteeing public security and peace.    Other issues we have discussed are the administrative career  law to give public employees stability and peace of mind; the  reforms to the electoral code that will be in effect for the  current elections; and the approval of the family code and the  health code -- both tools of great importance for protecting  society's basic core as well as the Panamanian people's health.    We have discussed many other but no less important issues.    I am very pleased to see that these proposals, which on  occasion have been the key or most important part of my messages  to this honorable assembly, have received priority attention.  Many were approved by you. They were presented for your  consideration as initiatives of the executive branch, and most  of them are already laws of the Republic. They have been an  important part in the process to reconstruct nation of Panama  and its institutions.    Today I want to stress a bill that is on your legislative  agenda. This bill is inspired by the legal duties that officials  charged with enforcing and interpreting the law fulfill on a  daily basis. In addition, various social sectors directly  affected by related crimes have made recommendations. With this  bill, an attempt is being made to amend Law 23 of 1986 and some  provisions of the penal code. All of this is being made to make  more effective the struggle against the scourge of drug abuse  and narcotics trafficking.    This topic is very important. It is, unfortunately, a very  current issue. During the last legislative period, you ratified  the Vienna Convention on drugs and money laundering. This was  another important step to establish, once more, Panama's  commitment in the international struggle against these evils.  The 1988 Vienna Convention -- the name used to identify the  convention against the illegal trafficking of drugs and  psychotropic substances approved by the United Nations -- is one  aspect of our country's commitment within international  cooperation. To this we must add the agreements signed with the  United States of America, the United Kingdom and Northern  Ireland, Colombia, and all the Central American republics to  collaborate in the eradication of the illegal trafficking of  drugs and psychotropic substances to prevent the shipment of  chemicals and basic substances and, in general, to provide legal  assistance in connection with drug trafficking and other crimes.    Currently, we are extending this network of international  agreements on this same matter through negotiations that have  gotten under way with Canada, Mexico, and the Russian Federation.    On this occasion, we have to make further progress with the  approval of new internal regulations against drug trafficking  and money laundering. For several years, we have discussed a  possible review of existing legislation on this topic.    The Legislative Assembly's Drug Commission began this  process  in 1991. The Attorney General's Office presented a bill during  the previous legislative period. If changes proposed to  existing laws are approved, we will have comprehensive  guidelines to modernize and consolidate the legal basis needed  for this struggle.    We cannot deny this reality: Panama is threatened by drug  trafficking, drug abuse, and money laundering. We are not the  only ones to suffer the dangers and consequences of these evils,  but we cannot find consolation in this fact. The Panamanian  people have repeatedly expressed their concern over the fact  that drugs could be undermining the foundations of our society.    The Panamanian Government also has expressed this same  concern several times at various international forums. The  health and welfare of a generation of young Panamanians is at  stake. The future of this nation rests on the shoulders of  these Panamanians. In addition, we are witnessing, with great  surprise, a new wave of murder, kidnapping, and other crimes  that are characterized by a special kind of cruelty and savagery.    Without a doubt, these crimes are directly linked to this  imported scourge. Legitimate economic and financial activities  in our country are overshadowed by money-laundering activities.  Drug traffickers act against our sovereignty when they make a  mockery of our borders and economic institutions and try to buy  people and influence with their dirty money.    My words are not exaggerated one bit. Quite the contrary, I  am understating the situation. This is a sad and dangerous  reality, and we cannot allow this to happen. The people demand  that you -- men and women who have been elected to serve society  -- take action on this matter. Mothers in Santiago, Bocas del  Toro, and Penonome; teachers in Chitre and David; honest bankers  in Panama City; policemen in Colon, Darien, and Los Santos --  all of them demand action against this evil of our times and  demand the approval of the necessary tools to fight it. These  legal instruments will not by themselves solve the problem  completely. They must be enforced by able, devoted, honest, and  well-paid officials. Ample economic resources are also  required. Nevertheless, strict and effective legislation is  essential to avert an unfair fight.    The country is in the middle of an important election  campaign. The new legislation that you deputies are to debate  does not entail political purposes. This legislation has not  originated in any political party and favors no special  interests. Quite the contrary, it benefits all Panamanians.  Our fellow citizens demand and deserve the approval of this  legislation.    I wish to refer briefly to some of the items that may be  good  to introduce into legislation extant. These items are included  in the recommendations presented by the Attorney General's  Office and supported by various sectors of society.    In the first place, to investigate these crimes it is  necessary for our legislation to include canons on two settings  that it currently does not envisage: the undercover agent and  controlled deliveries. Both are necessary to be able to  infiltrate international mafia bands and to destroy them with  overwhelming evidence obtained from within the criminal  organizations themselves.    Next, it is necessary to apply stiffer measures, other than  preventive detention, on those found guilty of drug trafficking  or related crimes. We cannot deceive ourselves. We must admit  that this business moves plenty of dirty money. This money  starts to move as soon as a drug trafficker is apprehended and  sent to prison. He starts to make his tempting moves  immediately, determined to buy any weak consciences available to  him or which succumb to his dishonest approaches. For this  reason, it is necessary that only magistrates may lift  preliminary measures, such as preventive detention. The  magistrates will be made fully responsible for their actions.    Third, we must admit that profits can be made in this  business, not only in cash, but in other assets, negotiable  certificates, securities, or goods. All of these can be  laundered and, in turn, must be confiscated.    Fourth, it is necessary to revise the structure of the  agency  that conducts investigations on drug trafficking cases.  Presently, the Drug Secretariat through a single office  investigates all drug- and money-laundering related crimes. The  accumulation of files and the bottleneck are evident. It is  necessary to decentralize functions to make the punishment of  criminals more expeditious and effective. Also, the situation  of drug addicts has not been overlooked in the project.    We must offer alternatives for their rehabilitation and,  later, for their rejoining of society. To this effect, we have  been planning that all of these goods, instruments, or valuables  that have been seized in these cases be turned over to the  National Commission for the Study and Prevention of Drug-Related  Crimes. This commission would then assign them to the government  or nongovernmental institutions that form part of it, or will  put them up for public bidding in order to create a common fund  for campaigns and programs for the prevention, rehabilitation,  and repression of these crimes.    Last, I want to specifically point out a new measure in our  penal code. Not only is it new, but in addition it is needed  immediately. I am referring to the new measure that will  establish penalties for using money or any illegal financial  resources coming from drug trafficking to finance political  campaigns. This measure, which would be new in terms of  legislation of this kind, would be designed to alert us against  the temptation of willingly ruining the exercise of free  democracy. Such links would be shameful and denigrating. Let it  be clearly understood by narcotics traffickers that in times of  democracy their shameful money is never welcome, and much less  welcome in Panamanian political campaigns. Let the drug barons  know that in Panama there is a definite political determination  that rejects their activities and their money.    Mr. President, honorable legislators: I want to recall the  words I said here on 1 September 1990, more than three years  ago. I said the following, and I quote: Allow me also to voice  my pleasure over the fact that finally the three branches of  state have managed to form the Electoral Tribunal. We have done  this with honorable and qualified citizens. I have great faith  in the honesty, independent criteria, and capacity of the new  magistrates. Here, in this great hall, I want to tell the  people -- and with God as my witness -- that I will devote all  of my efforts so that the 1994 presidential elections will be  remembered as the most honest elections of our history. I will  turn over the presidential sash to whomever wins it honestly.  This is the end of my 1990 statement.    Therefore, my commitment with this year's electoral campaign  and my clear intentions of turning power over to whomever the  people elect is nothing new. It is an ethical decision I made  and a moral commitment I accepted from the Panamanian voters and  myself, even before I won the 1989 elections. Ever since I  assumed power, I have tried to create the proper atmosphere. I  have made and supported all decisions that will facilitate this  goal. I consider it an intrinsic duty with holding public power  in an authentic democracy. I want my intentions and behavior to  this effect to become a paradigm that is demanded from future  presidents. I must reiterate my hopes that the elections will  be conducted at a level worthy of all Panamanians and within the  framework of decency and respect.    The majority of the deputies and alternates of this  Legislative Assembly are hoping for reelection. They are  thereby joining the thousands of Panamanians who are running for  the hundreds of posts up for election in this campaign. As  president of the Republic, who has had to preside over a  difficult period of transition, I would like to see people  elected who, during the next five years, will devote their best  efforts to improving the country and continuing to build  positive things.    I do not think there has ever been a president that has  been targeted as much as I have been. My work has been  questioned and severe charges have been levied against me,  without any consideration whatsoever. All aspects of my  administration have been harshly judged and this has been done  in complete freedom. I have tolerated this because I have a  historic mission to fulfill and because I respect the right of  others in a democracy. The eradication of national problems has  not been, is, or ever will be, something that can be achieved  overnight. Only disinterested discipline, honest intentions,  tenacity in the face of adversity, and clear and attainable  goals can guarantee lasting and long-term success.    The Panamanian people deserve they be addressed honestly. No  success is possible without effort or without sacrifice. The  country's development and the wellbeing of the nation's poorest  people can only be attained through everyone's hard and constant  work and by way of essential values -- values such as honesty,  loyalty, generosity, tolerance, and integrity. We must not  forget that the political stability I have gone great lengths to  maintain during these four years, despite all of the pressures  exerted, is essential to creating the appropriate atmosphere for  development, creating jobs, and reducing poverty.    God, guide all Panamanians to ensure that correct decisions  are made during the upcoming elections and thereby lead us to  the end of this epoch and guide us into the 21st century. All  of us await better days for our fatherland and for our families.  Hopefully, we will show good judgment in our decisions and  actions to ensure that nothing clouds our hopes.    Today, more than ever before, our future depends on us.  Unlike times gone by, we do not have a dictatorship that  persecutes us in the street and in our homes. There is no  regime like there was in the past -- one that uses blackmail or  threatens the tranquility of our homes and families. There is  no atmosphere of tension and fear that existed during the past  elections campaign, which led to all kinds of unimaginable  abuses the very same day that elections were being held.  Moreover, we will not have a shameless vote count, such as  occurred in May 1989, which led to the disgraceful annulment of  the elections.    All we have is a broad path down which everyone's creative  energy can be channeled toward a single constructive direction  to make Panama a great nation. We are going to choose our  destiny in full freedom; this will be our responsibility and no  one else's. By way of well-channeled energies, we shall resolve  both our large and small problems.    All goodwilled Panamanians, without distinction of race,  position, or political belief, will face united the challenges  and opportunities that lie ahead -- a future that is promising,  splendid, and within our reach.    I am issuing this fervent call to all of my fellow citizens:  We are a small country, but its size is also a fountain of  opportunities and advantages. I feel optimistic. In my last  message I invited you to lead our government of national  reconstruction and transition toward democracy. Future  presidents will find a country that is incomparably better and  more orderly than the country we found. History will show this  to be the case and will recognize it. Many thanks.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / War weariness blurs Belgraders' vision / Finding residents of the city more worried about the price of potatoes than the prospects for peace in Bosnia AN ATMOSPHERE of confusion yesterday pervaded Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav federal capital, after Bosnian Serb leaders once again rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan. As Serbians faced the imposition of new United Nations sanctions aimed at isolating the country, weary shoppers at Kalenic, the city's biggest vegetable market, appeared more worried about the rising price of potatoes than the future of the peace plan for Bosnia. They praised the refusal of Bosnian Serb leaders to cave into western threats of sanctions and military intervention. But most also claimed to back the efforts of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to persuade the Bosnian Serb deputies to vote in favour of the peace plan. No-one appeared to see any contradiction between the rejection of the peace plan and the appeal from Mr Milosevic and his Yugoslav and Montenegrin counterparts, who on Sunday warned the Bosnian Serb deputies: 'You have no right to endanger the lives of 10m Serbs'. Many Belgrade residents seemed uncertain about the first public division between the interests of Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro, and Serb-held territories in other former Yugoslav republics. 'They are both right. Each from their own perspectives,' said Olga, a 67-year old pensioner. She denied there was any reason to resent Bosnian Serbs because Serbia had to bear the brunt of the new sanctions regime. 'The sanctions will be lifted when the west realises it has have made a mistake,' she added. While Belgrade inhabitants seemed confused, diplomats were also at a loss on how seriously to take the apparent split between Mr Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. 'It is the first visible fissure. But it remains to be seen how deep and serious it is,' said one diplomat. Most people backed the rejection of the peace plan. 'They made the right decision. If America bombards us, we will defend ourselves,' said Milan, a pensioner born in Srebrenica, the fallen Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. 'They could not approve a plan that takes away everything that is ours with one stroke of the pen,' he said. The proposed plan calls for Serb forces to give up nearly half of the territory they have seized over the past year of war. Amra, a 25-year-old Moslem married to a Serb in Belgrade, said: 'I would have given in. I would do anything for peace.' My parents are living in Bosnia. I am scared for them amid the lies that no-one can live together any more,' she said wheeling her year-old daughter through the park. Reports that buses heading for Hungary were turned back at the frontier yesterday also heightened fears among Yugoslavs of being cut off from the outside world.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Alexander &amp; Alexander buys actuarial firm Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, the US-based international insurance broker, is to acquire Clay &amp; Partners, one of the UK's biggest actuarial firms. A&amp;A paid Clay's partners with 2.27m shares of A&amp;A common stock, valuing the firm, which provides employee benefits and related consulting services to corporate clients, at Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m). The deal is A&amp;A's biggest since it acquired Reed Stenhouse in 1985 and signals growing interest among international insurance brokers in the skills of actuaries, which are increasingly important in commercial insurance and linked consultancy business. The world's biggest broker, Marsh &amp; McLennan, acquired William M Mercer, the UK's biggest firm of actuaries, in 1986. Clay employs 90 qualified actuaries, ranking third equal in size in the UK with Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Its practice complements the more regionally diversified consultancy business of Alexander Consulting Group, the A&amp;A consulting subsidiary. Mr Brian Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of ACG in Europe, said the new business - Alexander Clay &amp; Partners - will be made up of 650 professional and support staff. He said Clay's 'actuarial strength complements ACG's existing human resource management consulting services.'</p>

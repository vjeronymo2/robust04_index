			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>   [Excerpt] ... The third item on the agenda of the weekly  ministerial meeting was on the assessment of the operation of  restoring peace and security and was presented by the minister  of territorial administration.    Regarding the Bujumbura mayorship, he noted that the  recently  conducted disarmament operation in the suburbs north of the  Ntahangwa River restored a certain calm. It created conditions  for the return of peace which can be seen in the return of the  people to their homes, busy marketplaces, notably those of  Kinama and Gasenyi, as well as the reopening of schools.    The minister of territorial administration, however,  indicated that some areas were still faced with overcrowding due  to the problem of displaced people, and that with the outbreak  of cholera the situation might worsen. The meeting called on  the government to take swift measures in time to deal with the  problem and also to convince the displaced people to reintegrate  into their respective areas.

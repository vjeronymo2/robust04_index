			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Milica Knezevic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Jan. 18 (TANJUG) -- In expectation of the  government's programme for the economic recovery of Yugoslavia,  scheduled to take effect on Monday, chaos is reigning in the  commodity and money markets.    Most transactions are not carried out in the national  currency, the dinar. Even farmers in the markets sell their  goods solely for DM [German marks], the exchange rate of which  changes several times a day. The value of the German currency  has gone up exactly a thousand times since new year. Experts  estimate that the January inflation rate in the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia is going to exceed the record one million per cent  reached in December.    Turnover of goods in shops is rapidly dropping which is  partly explained by a dramatic and massive impoverishment of the  population, living under international economic sanctions for  twenty months.    Most shops in central Belgrade are closed, each having the  same notice "inventory" on the door. Salesmen do not want to  sell their goods for dinars, which is being devaluated daily for  several tenths percent, even less for cheques, because it is  difficult to cash them in. Salesmen complain that it is harder  and harder to purchase goods since the production in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia is almost non-existent for lack of fuel,  raw materials and primary products whose is banned by sanctions  [sentence as received].    Pensioners represent the mostly affected social category,  but  the standard of living of those who are employed is hardly any  better. A large number of companies in Serbia paid out on  Friday guaranteed weekly salary, amounting to an average  5,000,000 dinars, which is less than 1 DM according to the  current exchange rate. The physical survival of the population  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia depends on crushing the  inflationary chaos. The government has announced that the  monetary reconstruction programme is planned to take effect at  the beginning of next week.    According to experts, the fact that the new measures will be  carried out without any support or assistance from international  financial institutions represents a serious handicap.</p>

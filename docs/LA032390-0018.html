			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OK, WE STILL DON'T KNOW;  </P> <P> CENSUS BUREAU TRIED, BUT COUNTING HOMELESS IS TOUGH  </P> <P> How many homeless people live in the United States? Seven million, insists  Mitch Snyder, an advocate who works on behalf of the homeless in Washington.  Others say that the number may be as low as 250,000.  </P> <P> The U.S. Census Bureau Tuesday night tried for the first time to determine what  the true number is. The enumerators concentrated initially on canvassing  shelters and cheap hotels before fanning out to parks, alleys, highway  underpasses and far more dangerous places. The ambitious effort was flawed.  Census monitors found many homeless people who were not counted. Still, the  tally was the first systematic attempt to count the nation's down and out.  </P> <P> Census officials made no pretense of coming up with a complete count. They had  hoped for a fairly accurate picture of the nation's shelters and flophouses, as  well as a glimpse of who the homeless are. But if more such efforts are  necessary in the future, a second survey of the shelters should be taken within  a week to provide a comparison, and allow for an estimate that could make up  for any undercount.  </P> <P> And, let there be no doubt, there was an undercount. Wide areas went unchecked  in South-Central Los Angeles, for example. Census officials have acknowledged  an undercount of migrant workers in North San Diego County, and a recount is  planned there -- possibly the only one in the nation. Finding people who sleep  in canyons and fields, sometimes literally in holes in the ground miles from a  road, is one of most difficult tasks for census workers and will require  special procedures. The accuracy of the count in Orange County was complicated  by the tendency of homeless people there to drop out of sight, especially at  night. Field enumerators were surprised they found so few of the homeless  living on the streets. Many retreat to cars or cheap motels after dark.  </P> <P> Homeless people are mobile. Some are cynical about contact with government  institutions. Others are mentally ill or just plain scared. But they are also  among the poorest Americans and stand to benefit from a more equitable  distribution of the $30 billion in federal aid allocated to cities and counties  based on census figures.  </P> <P> There may be no way to determine, without controversy, how many homeless people  the special tally missed. But while the totals are incomplete, the needs are  clearly there, and they are great. That alone must prompt the government to  invest more in health care, job training and affordable housing to help them.  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (14): Running costs cut by two thirds - Case study Provident Personal Credit knows all about right-sizing: this financial services company has done it twice in the past six years. In that time it has cut costs while confirming that simply moving from big computers to small ones is only part of the job. In the late 1980s, Provident Personal Credit started running down its Unisys central mainframe computer and installing Digital Equipment Vax machines in business departments. The computing staff, too, were moved out to work alongside their end-users. 'We had the traditional problem of a central mainframe department, semi-detached from the rest of the organisation and never really meeting business needs,' says Mr David Chan, information technology director 'The costs of the operation were not reflected in business benefits.' Installing local computers gave business departments control of their own computing, helped by their own computing specialists. However, by 1992 the company saw the need for a compromise between central and departmental systems. 'We found there was a need for certain centralised systems and information, for example a corporate customer database,' says Mr Chan. 'So we have functionality in the departments but control and strategic systems back at the centre again. 'In addition, having central computing staff is more efficient than giving each department its own team.' The company has switched to Unix computers from Hewlett-Packard and to database and system development products from Sybase. Running costs have been cut by two thirds and the number of system development staff has been halved. Meanwhile business departments have the systems, the information and the service they need. Such changes have not been simple. Indeed, Chan puts much of the success down to the fact that he called in human consultants early on. 'We were a mainframe shop with a traditional command hierarchy, like an old-fashioned army,' he says. 'We needed a new culture, where the emphasis was on delivering service, generating ideas and working together.' Work was done not only on setting up appraisal schemes and training but also on personal motivation: 'opening the possibility of individual fulfilment through work', as David Chan puts it. Team skills were also built up to fit a new department structure. This led to greater trust between staff. 'In a traditional hierarchy you refer decisions upwards and watch your back,' Mr Chan says. 'But our people now trust each other and are open to suggestions. They're not constantly worrying about failure. Three people were identified as potential opponents to the changes: they have all left the company. 'Technical training was important but we could not have succeeded without the human development work,' says Chan. 'We went from a low-delivery, inefficient, classic programming shop to an open, high-delivery, successful and innovative department in a year  - and all with the same people.'</p>

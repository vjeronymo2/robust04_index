			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> My thanks to CBS for not canceling "Island Son." It is a refreshing program  with one of the finest, Richard Chamberlain.  </P> <P> I truly hope the show continues. Quality programming such as this is very  important to someone like myself with very little time for TV viewing.  </P> <P> Barbara Sutman, West Covina  </P></p>

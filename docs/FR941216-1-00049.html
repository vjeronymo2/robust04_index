On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument of $935 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of $100 for 1996 and $110 for 1997, minus the $275  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected amount of the December 31, 1997 payment). Because E  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has no other adjustments for 1998, and E's interest inclusions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument in prior taxable years do not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total net negative adjustments E treated as ordinary loss in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those years, the $65 negative adjustment on January 1, 1998,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in a negative adjustment carryforward of $65 for 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the $65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount E realizes on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sale of the debt instrument from $900 to $835. As a result,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E realizes a $100 loss on the sale of the debt instrument (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between the amount realized and E's adjusted basis in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument). Because E's total interest inclusions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument do not exceed the total net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments E treated as ordinary loss on the debt instrument,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E's loss on the sale of the debt instrument is treated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital loss.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of this paragraph (b)(9) notwithstanding any other rule of this paragraph (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis different than adjusted issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(9)(i) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument is different than the adjusted issue price of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument (e.g., a subsequent holder that purchases the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument for more or less than the instrument's adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A holder whose basis in a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is different than the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrues interest under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes adjustments under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the projected payment schedule determined as of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue date of the debt instrument. However, upon acquiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument, the holder must reasonably allocate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between the adjusted issue price and the basis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily portions of interest or projected payments over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining term of the debt instrument. Allocations are taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account under paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(B) and (C) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis greater than adjusted issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a holder's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in a debt instrument exceeds the debt instrument's adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to a projected payment is treated as a negative adjustment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date the daily portion accrues or the payment is made. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is reduced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount the holder treats as a negative adjustment under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis less than adjusted issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a holder's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in a debt instrument is less than the debt instrument's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest or to a projected payment is treated as a positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment on the date the daily portion accrues or the payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made. The holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased by the amount the holder treats as a positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Premium and discount rules do not apply.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accruing premium and discount in sections 171, 1272(a)(7), 1276,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1281 do not apply. Other rules of those sections continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to the extent relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Safe harbor for exchange listed debt instruments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment debt instrument is exchange listed property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (within the meaning of &sect;1.1273&hyph;2(f)(2)), it is reasonable for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder of the debt instrument to allocate any difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the holder's basis and the adjusted issue price of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument pro-rata to daily portions of interest (as determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) over the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term of the debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples illustrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. In each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume that each debt instrument is not exchange listed property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Basis greater than adjusted issue price <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facts. On July 1, 1997, Z purchases for $1,405 a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that matures on December 31, 1998, and promises to pay on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturity date $1,000 plus the increase, if any, in the price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified amount of a commodity from the issue date to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturity date. The debt instrument was originally issued on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. Z is a calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year taxpayer. The projected payment schedule for the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument (determined as of the issue date) provides for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single payment at maturity of $1,350. Thus, the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a projected yield of 10.25 percent, compounded semiannually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the purchase, the debt instrument has an adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price of $1,162, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on December 31 and June 30 of each year. The increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and not to a decrease in market interest rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Z's basis in the debt instrument on July 1, 1997,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is $1,405. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Z  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocates the $243 difference between basis ($1,405) and adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price ($1,162) to the contingent payment at maturity. Z's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price is reasonable because the increase in the value of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expected amount of the contingent payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of debt instrument for 1997.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payment schedule, $60 of interest accrues on the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument from July 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 (the product of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on July 1, 1997  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ($1,162) and the projected yield properly adjusted for the length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the accrual period (10.25 percent/2)). Z has no net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or positive adjustments for 1997. Thus, Z includes in income $60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of total daily portions of interest for 1997. On December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1997, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,465 ($1,405  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1997).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of allocation to contingent payment at maturity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1998, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,400, rather than the projected $1,350. Under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $50 on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31, 1998. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Z has a negative adjustment of $243 on December 31, 1998. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, Z has a net negative adjustment of $193 for 1998. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $128 total daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1998. Because Z had $60 of interest inclusions for 1997, $60 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remaining $65 net negative adjustment is treated by Z as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary loss for 1998. The remaining $5 of the net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1998 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the amount realized by Z on the retirement of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument from $1,350 to $1,345.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

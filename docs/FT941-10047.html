			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Property: Bargain buys in Europe - Renewed interest by investors suggests that the market may be turning Where are the best opportunities in Europe for property investors? After the uplift in the UK property market, investors are watching the continent for signs that other markets are emerging from recession. Cross-border investment activity is still at a low ebb - except for the UK where the property market attracted overseas investment totalling Pounds 2.2bn in 1993, with Germans leading the way. Many advisers believe that pan-European investment will pick up this year. 'As markets move to the bottom of their cycle there will be clear opportunities during the year, ahead of an economic upswing, to do business at extremely attractive prices,' says Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors. Dutch and German investors, together with some UK investment funds, are likely to set the pace, it says. Mr Richard Mully, managing director in charge of European real estate for Bankers Trust, reports strong interest from so called 'bottom-fishers' - investors willing to buy properties with serious problems such as letting difficulties, if the price is sufficiently low. In some instances, prices have fallen by 80 per cent. 'Bottom-fishers', which include US funds, are showing particular interest in Paris, Madrid, Milan and Portugal. The carrot for prospective investors is the prospect of buying at close to the bottom of one of the deepest property recessions in recent memory. Average capital values of prime offices in Europe's 14 largest property markets have fallen by a third from their peak in March 1991, according to Jones Lang Wootton. Property values are now at their lowest levels in real terms since 1986. The case for renewed investment is largely based on the prospect of further interest rate falls across Europe and property's relatively high investment yields. Against this there are problems in the letting market. Rents are falling and vacancy rates are rising in most markets. Since tenants on the continent generally sign short leases, investors cannot achieve the same security of income as in the UK, where leases run for 25 years. Footloose investors may be tempted to look beyond Europe. In particular, parts of the US are attracting attention as the economy continues its expansion. Germans, the biggest overseas investors in the UK last year, are 'likely to shift from the London market to North America during the course of this year',according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors. Within the main European markets, investors face a choice of cities with varying prospects. In Brussels, the presence of the European Commission has insulated the city's commercial market from the worst of the downturn affecting other continental markets. Belgium's recession and European Union expenditure controls may soon end this immunity. Vacancy rates have increased to about 8 per cent from a low of about 3 per cent in 1989, while rents fell by 15 per cent and capital values slumped by 13 per cent over the past year. However, falling interest rates have stimulated new activity in the investment market, which nearly doubled in 1993 to about BFr30bn. In Paris's central business district, rents have fallen by some 30 per cent. Capital values have dropped by an estimated 44 per cent from the market's peak in 1990, according to Jones Lang Wootton. However, the investment market has remained stagnant as vendors have refused to accept reduced values. In Germany, demand has been weak, although some activity is beginning to return to the Frankfurt office sector, which is likely to benefit from the establishment of the European Monetary Institute in the city. In spite of the downturn in the letting market in Germany, the investment sector has remained strong, as lower interest rates have increased property's attractions compared with bonds and equities. In Italy, both capital and rental values of Milanese offices have fallen by up to a third, according to Jones Lang Wootton. The investment market has been inactive, but with interest rates at their lowest level for 17 years, property deals by domestic investors may soon pick up. Foreign investors, however, are likely to be deterred by Italy's political uncertainties. In Spain, rents have fallen by about half since their peak in 1990-91. This has encouraged some investors to conclude that the market is through the worst of its downturn. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley reports that the investment market will not pick up until sellers are prepared to be more flexible on prices. One of the largest investment deals in recent years was struck in Madrid last month when Fomenta de Construcciones y Contratas, one of Spain's largest private corporations, bought a portfolio of office buildings and retail centres for Dollars 350m. The price paid per square metre - Pta400,000 - was about a third of the portfolio's estimated peak value two years ago. In the Netherlands, take-up has fallen, vacancy rates have risen and rental levels could come under pressure this year. The investment market has been quiet, but the emergence of a positive yield gap could encourage investors to return to the market. The UK economy is now growing faster than most other EU competitors, fuelling hopes that the rental market will begin to stabilise over the next 12 months. These hopes, together with sharp falls in bond and equity yields have fuelled a strong recovery in the investment market. It is not clear how far the overseas-led revival in demand for London office property will be repeated in other European cities as they emerge from recession. The liquidity and size of the London market, the city's prominence as an international business centre, together with security of income derived from long leases, make the UK capital a prime target for foreign funds. Recovery in the continental markets may not be so pronounced or rapid as that of London. Nonetheless the interest being displayed by international investors for pockets of Europe's property markets suggests that the turning point of the cycle may be near. 'There are opportunities for investors to buy at yields which are historically high,' says Mr Mully of Bankers Trust. 'I think it is the first sign that investors are anticipating recovery.'</p>

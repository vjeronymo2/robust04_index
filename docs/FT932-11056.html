			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mixed views greet amendment Page 1, line 18 (clause 1), after 'Community', insert 'with the exception of the Protocol on Social Policy on page 117 of Cm 1934'. Amendment 2 to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. DEPENDING on who is asked, Labour's briefly worded 'amendment two' - as accepted by the government yesterday - could throw a legislative spanner into the Maastricht bill, halting British ratification. Or it will force the government to sign up for the social chapter. Or it can simply be flung aside as ratification moves ever closer. The immediate consequence is that the protocol on the social chapter agreed at Maastricht, which included an opt-out for Britain, will not be part of the legislation approved by the Commons. But the effect that this will then have is far from clear. EURO-SCEPTICS argue the amendment means legislation approved by parliament could prove insufficient for the government to sign the Maastricht treaty. Confusion has thus been created. They will seek a 'judicial review' of ministers' use of the royal prerogative - the formal mechanism used to sign treaties. Specifically, Tory Euro-sceptics believe the government will not have the power to contribute to the administrative costs of the social chapter, which the government will probably help pay in spite of supposedly having opted out. THE GOVERNMENT argues that, even though the protocol will be excluded from domestic law, it still stands in the treaty. Britain can ratify the treaty because the protocol imposed no burdens on the country that required domestic legislation. The social chapter opt-out remains. Incorporation of the protocol into UK law was 'desirable' for the sake of neatness but not 'essential,' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told MPs yesterday. Financial costs to Britain of administering the social chapter are insignificant and can probably be charged to the Treasury's 'consolidated fund' under the European Communities Act 1972, ministers believe. LABOUR agrees broadly with the government that ratification has not been stopped. But Mr George Robertson, Europe spokesman, says a 'series of minefields' have been created that can only be solved by accepting the social chapter. There could be a case for judicial review on ratification; certainly there is now moral pressure on the government to accept the social chapter. There might also be challenges in the European Court of Justice by British workers who - now the opt-out is removed from UK law - demand that the social chapter's provisions should apply to them. Separately, Liberal Democrats, who also back the social chapter, argue that extra powers for the European Parliament have to be agreed by the Commons. The effect of the amendment is to override that principle - offering a fresh avenue for a legal challenge.</p>

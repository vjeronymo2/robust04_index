			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO representative in Germany, </F> 'Abdallah al-Franji, by Karin Beindorff in Bonn on 1 March]    [Text] [Beindorff] Mr. al-Franji, you can certainly tell  us what the results of last night's meeting in Tunis were. What  are the PLO's preconditions for further negotiations?    [Al-Franji] The demands of the Palestinians after the  massacre are clear. They are looking for protection for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories and they demand that  not just a few settlers but all the settlers be disarmed. It is  obvious that this issue must be discussed between us and the  Israelis so that something like the terrible massacre of Friday  cannot happen again. In addition, many Palestinians who  enthusiastically advocated the peace process a month ago are now  doubting whether it is worth negotiating peace while  experiencing war every day. Of course, there is disappointment,  bitterness, and the massacre has achieved its aim.    [Beindorff] The PLO seems to demand that UN blue helmets are  positioned in the occupied territories and not just unarmed UN  observers. Do you think that you can push this demand through?  Is it absolutely necessary for you?    [Al-Franji] This demand is very legitimate. The Israeli  Army cannot safeguard the security of the Palestinians in these  territories. Immediately after the massacre when the  Palestinians were demonstrating, they fired on the crowd. The  number of casualties in the West Bank and Gaza went up  afterward. This shows that the Israeli Army cannot be neutral  in this conflict. And the Israeli Army does not intend to  disarm all the settlers. This means that it takes a burden off  the Israelis and their army if international protection troops  are stationed between us and the Israeli settlers until we have  found a solution to the problem. If they want, we could have  U.S. and British UN soldiers so that the Israelis do not fear  that a front is being formed against them. It has become very  obvious that the Israeli Army is no longer in a position to  control the West Bank and Gaza and that it cannot keep the  settlers under control either.    [Beindorff] Disarming the settlers is one of the PLO's main  demands. Who is to protect the settlers? Or is this meant as a  start to the breaking up of the settlements?    [Al-Franji] When we excluded this question the Palestinians  hoped that the problem would be solved by the Israelis leaving  the country. They live in the West Bank, which is 5,400 square  kilometers. In this territory there live 1.3 million  Palestinians. And right among them live 150,000 Israeli settlers  who occupied the land illegally and built their houses  illegally. This decision of the settlers has not been accepted  by international organizations. You must imagine that in Gaza  nearly 1 million people live in 365 square kilometers. And  there are 5,400 Israeli settlers, claiming 160 square  kilometers. This is unbelievable. It is just not normal; and  this is a situation that will lead to confrontations if we  cannot find a solution quickly. And because we Palestinians are  determined to get the peace process so far that we can achieve  peace with the Israelis, we think that the Israeli Government  can yield on this question. If the Israeli Government wants a  lasting peace then it must make concessions in this matter and  they must think about whether they want peace, or the  settlements and the settlers.    [Beindorff] If I understand you correctly, peace is only  possible if the settlements in the occupied territories  disappear.    [Al-Franji] It is clear that in the long run they will  disappear, or they will have to give in to the Palestinian  authority that is forming there. This means if they accept,  just like the Arabs living in Israel, Palestinian passports and  Palestinian authority, this would be a new situation where we  could discuss the issue with the Israelis. But the majority of  settlers say they will not accept Palestinian authority and that  they will use force to question this authority. And that is  what they have done. This action in Hebron was meant to prove  that the settlers can do it; and they can.    [Beindorff] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is accused of making  too many concessions to the Israelis. Does 'Arafat still  represent the interests of the majority of Palestinians?    [Al-Franji] Yasir 'Arafat does represent the interests of  the majority of Palestinians. Of course, the disappointment of  many Palestinians is understandable. It is disappointment  because Yasir 'Arafat, and the PLO leadership, has promised that  the Israelis will withdraw on 13 December. They did not  withdraw. They said that the violence in the occupied  territories will decline. The violence has increased. The  activities of the Israeli Army have become much tougher. And of  course, this is what the Palestinians experience. They say:  Yasir 'Arafat has signed an agreement; he promised us a better  life; he promised us freedom. And they see that we have been  living in a state of permanent confrontation since September.  And this massacre that concerns so many people brings up  emotions and outcries. There are protests, and maybe also nasty  words against 'Arafat and the PLO leadership.    [Beindorff] Mr. al-Franji, you are going to Tunis today.  Do you expect a debate on the PLO leadership there?    [Al-Franji] Discussions within the PLO have never ended;  discussions about the way we lead the PLO. We have never simply  accepted a Palestinian leader within our ranks without being  critical toward him, and this includes Yasir 'Arafat. But on  the other hand, we cannot question these people's credibility  whenever a conflict arises. We are in a very difficult process.  We cannot prove quickly enough to the Palestinians that we have  achieved some progress. We will have to count on two things:  First, the Israelis must take us into account and give way on  these matters in order to help us. Second, we demand, or we  hope, or we ask, that the European Union, those countries that  have good relations with Israel, do not pressure Israel but make  recommendations so that they give way on certain difficult  problems, such as the matter of settlements, and other problems  which involve the Palestinians' possibility to get an autonomous  state.    [Beindorff] One last question, and I ask you to give me a  very short answer. The Security Council has not yet agreed on a  resolution. When do you expect an answer?    [Al-Franji] We are waiting for this answer. And what the  PLO will do partly depends on the Security Council's decision.  We hope that it will react in a responsible way.    [Beindorff] Thank you for the interview.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / What world donors did not know about Kenya frauds When international creditors pledged Dollars 850m to Kenya's economic recovery programme last November, they did so in the knowledge that newly-appointed reformers in the finance ministry and the central bank were committed to cleaning up Kenya's financial system. What they did not know was the scale and systematic nature of corruption at the Central Bank of Kenya. What began in 1991 as the crude falsification of export invoices to benefit from government export incentive schemes, escalated over the next two years into a series of financial frauds, estimated to have cost Kenya Dollars 430m, according to unpublished official estimates - equivalent to 10 per cent of the country's annual gross domestic product. The financial irregularities drew in CBK officials, Kenyan businessmen, senior politicians and ultimately two international banks. The scams are understood to have fuelled already excessive money supply and inflation, increased the government's domestic debt, and contributed to the devaluation of the Kenyan shilling by 47 per cent in 1993. Although the irregularities were unravelled by auditors working at the request of the International Monetary Fund, a full account of their findings was never passed on to donors. Documents obtained by the Financial Times, recent comments of Mr Micah Cheserem, the new CBK governor, and the arrest last week of a leading Kenyan businessman and four former CBK officials are helping to bring the details of the fraud to light. In 1991, Goldenberg International, a Nairobi trading company, owned by Mr Kamlesh Pattni, Kenyan businessman and owner of Exchange Bank, was granted sole rights by the finance ministry to export diamond jewellery and gold from Kenya. The company claimed to be exporting, but there was no evidence of this in customs statistics, although it earned Dollars 45m from the government's export incentive scheme. Kenya's auditor general noted in his 1993 report that the export compensation had been paid irregularly. Mr Pattni and others went on to tap the CBK's pre-shipment finance facility, a source of credit so widely abused it was closed at the insistence of the IMF in March 1993. But there were other scams at the CBK that profited several of Kenya's commercial banks. According to an IMF report, domestic banks obtained irregular access to CBK credit by holding large overdrafts with the CBK and persistent deficiencies in meeting statutory cash ratios. The CBK is investigating theft and possible forgery of some Dollars 200m of Foreign Exchange Certificates - bearer bonds entitling the holder to hard currency when dollars were still rationed in Kenya. In addition, the IMF report says domestic banks, in forward contracts with the CBK, received advances in local currency, but delayed the delivery of foreign exchange or defaulted on payment outright. Mr Pattni's Exchange Bank defaulted on its contract by which it had obtained KSh9.9bn in April 1993 against the future repayment of Dollars 210m. The irregular outstanding credit then at its peak was estimated to be up to KSh24bn. To erase liabilities incurred by the forex fraud, CBK officials devised fictitious hard currency deposits in two UK accounts to make CBK'S foreign exchange reserves seem greater than they were. According to Mr Francois Vikar, communications director at Banque Indosuez in Paris, Mr SA Taheri, former deputy chairman and chief executive officer of Exchange Bank, introduced CBK officials to Indosuez Aval, a UK subsidiary of Banque Indosuez. The contract establishing the account for a fictitious deposit was signed on June 10 by Indosuez Aval's chief executive, Mr DI Guild and Mr Job Kilach, head of the CBK's foreign department, and Mr Michael Wanjihia, chief foreign exchange dealer. Mr Vikar insists Indosuez Aval 'in no way knowingly participated' in concealment of financial regularities. He says: 'To make things look absolutely normal', Indosuez Aval made interest payments on the fictitious deposits using moneys made available from a CBK advance. Certainly Indosuez Aval knew that the CBK wanted 'to make itself look as good as possible . . . before the visit of IMF officials'. Mr Vikar acknowledges that Indosuez Aval was 'doing window-dressing'. But it was 'not doing hanky-panky'. The cover-up came to light, however, when the CBK was asked why it did not meet its foreign debt obligations when it had significant cash reserves abroad. The accounts were then closed. A full chronicle of the irregularities was presented in July to reformist finance minister Musalia Mudavadi in a report by an independent team lead by Price Waterhouse, the accountants. Mr Mudavadi responded to its findings by ordering the closure of Exchange Bank, Pan African Bank and Post Bank Credit. In the same week, Mr Eric Kotut, the CBK governor, resigned, but denied wrong-doing. In an attempt to recover some of the moneys the CBK has seized several of Mr Pattni's assets, including the five-star Grand Regency Hotel in the centre of Nairobi. Last week, Mr Pattni was charged, along with four former CBK officials including Mr Kilach and Mr Wanjihia, in a Nairobi court with stealing a total of KSh9.9bn from CBK. The full explanation of irregularities in Kenya's banking sector was shown to the IMF. International donors, including the World Bank, however, have not seen the auditors' report. At a conference on Kenya's aid chaired by the World Bank in Paris in November donors and lending institutions endorsed the Kenyan government reforms by ending a two-year aid freeze with a pledge of Dollars 850m.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Everton rights issue aims for Pounds 9.75m Everton, one of the great names of British football, has announced the details of its first share issue for more than a century. The Merseyside club is to raise Pounds 9.75m through a one-for-one rights issue. There is just one catch - each shareholder has to stump up Pounds 4,000 per share. Everton has, and needs, a loyal band of supporters who between them have 2,500 shares which change hands at more than Pounds 2,500 each. About 40 per cent of the shares are held by the Moores family, which founded Littlewoods football pools and formerly ran the club. The remainder are largely owned by relatives of well-heeled fans who bought one or two shares when they were first issued in 1892 for Pounds 1 apiece and kept them as a gesture of faith rather than personal investment. They are rarely traded. In the past six months, aside from executor sales, fewer than 30 shares have changed hands. One of those shares was bought by Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Food Group and former chairman of Tranmere Rovers football club. It was after the death in September of Sir John Moores, the Everton chairman, that Mr Johnson beat off a rival consortium's attempt to gain control of Everton. With the backing of the Moores family, Mr Johnson overcame the bid of Mr Bill Kenwright, the theatrical producer and Everton board member, and put himself forward as prospective chairman. Mr Johnson hopes shareholders will baulk at the premium price being charged for the equity allowing him, in his capacity as underwriter, to pick up the new shares. The club justifies the price by saying it wants to raise as much as it can to reverse its dwindling fortunes - Everton has not won the FA cup for 10 years and last season it came close to relegation. Mr Johnson expects to take up enough new shares to win the necessary 30 per cent stake for a dominant interest - assuming the Moores let their rights lapse and see their stake diluted to 20 per cent. There will be an informal meeting for shareholders next Thursday at Everton followed by an extraordinary general meeting on July 26 at Goodison Park, Liverpool, to vote on the rights issue.</p>

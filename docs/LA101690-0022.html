			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: A LESSON IN RECYCLING HAS-BEEN LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> The recent budget mess was about jobs. Not people's jobs, but congressional  jobs. This was brought home to me by House member Luke Slowly, who lives down  the street. He dropped by the other day with a fistful of polls in his hands.  </P> <P> I had never seen him so depressed.  </P> <P> "This could be the end of the planet Earth as I know it," he told me. "I might  be shoveling snow by November."  </P> <P> "You're being too pessimistic. Lots of Congresses have been unable to come up  with a budget and have still been returned to office in a landslide."  </P> <P> "But this is the big one. The American people are boiling mad because we  couldn't cut $500 billion out of the deficit without causing pain.  </P> <P> "You should see my mail. They are calling me names I would only use against my  opponent."  </P> <P> "What do the people write?"  </P> <P> "They say that the members of Congress are idiots because half of us wanted to  give everything to the poor and the other half wanted to give everything to the  rich. It hurts to hear my constituents blame me because all I was trying to do  was put the American Dream on hold. If I lose the election because of this, the  voters will have to live with it for the rest of their lives."  </P> <P> "You are taking a dim view. After all, just because you might lose the election  doesn't mean you're completely worthless."  </P> <P> "That's easy for you to say," Slowly muttered. "But nobody wants a has-been  legislator who can't even get on a local talk show any more."  </P> <P> "Slowly," I said, "you'll still be a valuable asset even though you may be out  of a job."  </P> <P> He asked, "What could I do?"  </P> <P> "You could become a lobbyist and fight for what you believe in -- for a large  fee."  </P> <P> "Every congressman who loses in November is going to become a lobbyist. What  have I got to sell the vested interests that they don't have already?"  </P> <P> "You could teach them the art of wheeling and dealing," I told him. "Why not  take credit for killing all the new taxes on cigarettes and liquor?"  </P> <P> Slowly responded: "But they weren't killed!"  </P> <P> "Who's going to know that? The only ones who will be aware of the taxes are the  smokers and the drinkers, and since it's a sin tax, they will be happy to pay  it. My advice is to print up cards and call yourself 'Across-the-Board Slowly.'  You'll have all the business you can handle."  </P></p>

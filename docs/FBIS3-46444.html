The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry described the vote as a  "positive move which is in accordance with the reality and  aspirations of the American people."    "The resolution would receive extensive support from the  United States and from world public opinion," it said in a  written reply to reporters' questions.    The U.S. Senate voted 62-38 in favor of the resolution  calling for the lifting of the 20-year-old economic embargo.    The embargo imposed on Vietnam in 1964 [date as received] by  Washington extended to cover the whole of the country after the  south was liberated in 1975.    The U.S. Administration has maintained that Vietnam's  cooperation in fully solving the issue of American prisoners of  war and missing-in-actions is the precondition for lifting  sanctions and the normalization of relations between the two  countries.</p>

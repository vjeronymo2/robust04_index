			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Argent Pounds 448,000 in black Argent, the property investment and development company which made its Stock Exchange debut in May, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 448,000 in the six months to the end of June against a loss of Pounds 1.2m last time. However, last year's figures did not include profits from Argent's portfolio of investment properties which were held off-balance sheet in joint ventures until March. Yesterday's result includes rents and interest payments on this portfolio from March 11, the date of consolidation. Rental income amounted to Pounds 3.98m in this period and interest costs Pounds 3.08m. Administrative expenses at Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 647,000) were higher as a result of the additional staff costs and expenses arising from quoted company status. Mr Peter Freeman, joint chief executive, said he expected administration costs for the full year to be about Pounds 2.5m. Earnings per share were 1.3p. Since flotation Argent has complete two large deals. At its Brindleyplace development in central Birmingham, the company let 120,000 sq ft of office space to British Telecommunications on a 15-year lease and acquired an adjacent 170,000 sq ft building - also let to BT - for Pounds 5.1m. British Airways Pension Fund has agreed to finance the development of an additional 68,000 sq ft office building at Brindleyplace. At the end of last month, Argent acquired 28 acres of land at the Thames Valley Business Park in Reading for Pounds 17.4m and immediately sold seven acres for Pounds 5.8m. Mr Freeman said that the company was considering development options for this site. The shares closed down 2p yesterday at 273p, well above the offer price of 255p in May.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Technology: Research comes back to the nest - Why Nestle is taking a closer interest in the commercial side of R&amp;D IT IS lunchtime at Nestle's gleaming laboratory high on a hillside above Lausanne. Gathered round a canteen table, the company's top researchers are rejoicing at their liberation from the past with the sort of bright-eyed wonderment with which east Europeans greeted the collapse of the Berlin Wall. In the past two years a minor revolution has swept through the laboratory, shaking its 600 researchers out of a cosy ivory tower existence and propelling them much closer to the cutting edge of the Swiss food manufacturer's global competitive strategies. Nestle invests SFrs120m (Pounds 46m) a year in research - and SFrs500m in development - making it the food industry's biggest spender on science and technology. But until recently much of the lab's work was only tenuously connected with the company's business. 'In the past, people here didn't get their hands dirty dealing with food,' says Magnus Dagerskog, head of the lab's food technology department. 'Everybody was busy publishing papers. They were trying to compete with universities.' Indeed, Nestle researchers enjoyed an intellectual freedom which many academics would envy. Says Herb Hottinger, head of bio-science research: 'When scientists joined the lab, they were told: 'Just work in this or that area. If you work hard enough, we're sure you'll find something'.' But the price the lab paid was to become a sterile backwater, cut off from Nestle's global network of development centres and largely ignored by its operating divisions. As a consequence, much research never found commercial applications. By 1990 Helmut Maucher, Nestle's chairman, had had enough. Deciding a wholesale shake-up was needed, he recruited Werner Bauer, a German professor of bio-engineering, to bring the lab firmly back into the corporate fold. This has been achieved partly by establishing formal links with the strategic business units (SBUs) into which Nestle's commercial activities have recently been grouped as part of a wider corporate reorganisation. Each SBU now includes a research co-ordinator, responsible for two-way communications with the labs, which are encouraged to view the SBUs as clients. Bauer, who previously worked at one of Germany's Fraunhofer institutes of applied technology, has reorganised the labs to focus their priorities more clearly and enable them to respond faster. The company's senior researchers, far from being resentful, seem exhilarated by the fresh challenges they face. As Brian Suter, British-born chief of Nestle's research and development puts it, they are full of 'boisterous, exuberant, young ideas'. He concedes, however, that the new system still needs time to bed down. In particular, bridges are still being built with the rest of the company. 'We have to get ourselves better known to the SBUs,' says Jurg Loliger, head of the food science department. 'They know we have the technology, but they don't yet realise our potential.' None the less, the new approach is already yielding benefits. For example, the lab took just two months to find a way to cut the salt in Lean Cuisine dishes by 30 per cent without using substitutes or changing the taste. Researchers say five years would have been needed in the old system, because they would have gone right back to basic science. Instead, they devised a simple analytical model to identify ingredients in which a lower salt content would be least noticed by consumers. Bauer has also expanded some areas of fundamental research, notably in molecular biology, where increased attention is being paid to enzymology. Overall, he aims for a 50-50 split between basic and applied research. The trick is knowing where to draw the line: 'In research, there is always a will to perfect. But a company can't afford that,' he says. 'Stopping at the point where learning curves become incremental is what I see as my major job.' All the more so because the huge marketing costs involved in launching brands are prompting Nestle to gear research increasingly to strengthening established products, rather than inventing new ones. The company points to Nescafe, its most profitable product, as a classic example of the approach. The brand has dominated the soluble coffee market for half a century, thanks to continuous up-dating of process technology and the regular introduction of new variants, the latest of which is instant cappuccino. Yet the Nescafe formula also sprang from innovations in Nestle's laboratories which broke completely new ground. By focusing research more tightly in support of existing products, will the company not risk missing out on similar world-beating breakthroughs in the future? Suter replies that the world has changed radically since the 1930s, when Nescafe was invented. Nowadays, innovations are much more expensive to develop and are much more quickly matched by competitors. Still, he says: 'I wouldn't want to exclude that one day we may come up with another blockbuster like Nescafe - it may just be possible.'</p>

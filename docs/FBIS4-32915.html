			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In addition to the 36 Skyhawk A-4M planes already  purchased from the United States, Argentina has decided to  purchase four more of the planes.    The reason for increasing the purchase operation is that  Argentina is interested in having inexpensive spare parts. If  Argentina purchased spare parts on the international market,  they would be more costly.    This has been confirmed by Defense Ministry sources who  reported the existence of a letter Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion sent to U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. [passage omitted]</p>

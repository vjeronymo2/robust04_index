			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] This year, the Juelich Research Center awarded  its prizes for outstanding doctoral theses to the electronics  and semiconductor engineering sectors. One of the criteria for  the awards is whether the candidates have presented their  findings in a readily comprehensible form. [passage omitted]    Gerd Fuhrmann, working in the Juelich Research Center's  Central Electronics Laboratory, developed a laboratory  microtomography system that can be used, in conjunction with a  computer, to make the entire three-dimensional structure of a  sample visible without previous preparation. He exploited the  scanning electron microscope's high-current electron beam,  which, if directed onto a metal cutting edge [Metallschneide],  generates an x-ray beam, which is passed through the sample  under inspection. According to the material of which the object  under inspection consists and its thickness, the x-ray beam is  attenuated (absorbed), and the absorption, or the energy loss  resulting therefrom, is measured behind the sample in special  detectors.  <H5>  Details From Inside the Object </H5>   A computer is then used to reconstruct the inner structures  of the sample according to the computer tomography process,  achieving unprecedented resolution. Details of bones, tumor  tissue, or industrial materials down to a size of less than 5  micrometers (five-thousandths of a millimeter) can thus be  displayed and distinguished. However, this involves evaluating  and processing large quantities of data from the numerous  detectors by sophisticated procedures. The microtomography  system can be used anywhere where interference-free inspection  of the inner structures of small samples is required: for pores  and cracks in ceramics or fiber-reinforced composites, for  airbag sensor tests, for measuring oil-water mix permeation of  porous rock in mineral oil research, or for examining bone  specimens for medical purposes. Fuhrmann demonstrated his  development with an examination of tiny living beings,  displaying the inside of a fly's head. It was possible to  identify tubes leading from the mouthpart into the trunk of the  body.    "Electrons in the Overtaking Lane" is the title that Frank  Mueller gave his doctoral thesis, in which he addressed problems  encountered in highly compressed semiconductors. Unlike  nonconducting insulators and metals, which are good conductors  of electricity, semiconductors are materials in which the flow  of free electrons can be controlled. As "ideal" semiconductors  have no free charge carriers, however, foreign atoms with an  excess of electrons must first be built into the semiconductor  material, a process referred to as "doping."  <H5>  Foreign Atoms Becoming a Problem </H5>   These foreign atoms are becoming something of a problem in  the quest for faster and faster devices. As they pass through  the semiconductor, the electrons are repelled by the positively  charged atom and thus take a sort of zigzag course. Separating  the electrons from the doping atoms in space helps: The  semiconductor material is slowly vapor-deposited -- atomic layer  by atomic layer -- onto a substrate; very precise junctions  between the different semiconductor materials can be obtained by  changing the deposition material abruptly. The free electrons  tend to remain on the interface layer between the different  semiconductor materials and can thus be separated from the  doping atoms. Ideally, they then fly in a perfectly straight  line. However, as no semiconductor material can be made  entirely without impurities, what really happens is somewhat  different: Electrons continue to be diverted by collisions.  Frank Mueller wanted to measure this deviation, so he built a  barrier into the electrons' race track -- the interface between  gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. The barrier  only lets the electrons through at a very narrow point, the  emitter, behind which there is a collector to catch the  electrons arriving in a straight line. Electrons deviated by  collisions miss this collector. The greater the distance  between the emitter and the collector, the greater the  attenuation of the stream -- indeed, there are more collision  centers on a longer path. The distances between the collision  centers can now be measured to approximately one-ten-thousandth  of a millimeter. The jury selected these two researchers, along  with Christian Plass-Duelmer of the Institute of Geosphere  Chemistry and Dynamics, who studied the significance of the  oceans as a source of light hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, from  a total of 24 candidates. Five theses came from information  technology alone.</p>

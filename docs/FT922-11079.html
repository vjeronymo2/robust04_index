			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Nippon Life to diversify into European currencies FOR AN institution with Y30,000bn (Pounds 127bn) of assets, Nippon Life, Japan's largest life assurance company, has a surprisingly small presence in Europe. Last year, it lent no more than Y25bn through its 20-person office in London. In addition, only Y50bn of the company's investments in European bonds and equities is managed from London - pin money, in Nippon Life's terms. Yet the weight of Nippon Life, along with other Japanese life firms, is likely to be felt far more in the European capital markets in the years ahead. 'The big trend is diversification from the US to Europe,' says Mr Haruaki Deguchi, newly-appointed managing director of NLI International, Nippon Life's operation in London. The desire to diversify their portfolios of foreign currencies lies behind the move, he says. At the end of 1990, only around 18.5 per cent of Japanese life companies' foreign currency assets were denominated in European currencies - roughly the same as their investments in the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. But by the middle of the decade, Mr Deguchi estimates, the European share will have risen to 25 per cent. Even with no net new investment from the life companies, that shift implies a Y1,500bn switch of money into Europe over the next three years. Most will be managed from Japan, rather than Europe. Nippon Life manages a single, Y50bn closed-end fund from London to gain experience of European equity and bond investment, says Mr Deguchi. Tax regulations prevent it doing more: investment orders channelled through London to the company's Tokyo headquarters would be classified as investments made in the UK, and so be taxed there. Meanwhile, lending to European corporations seems unlikely to grow rapidly. All of Nippon Life's lending, most of it for periods of 10-20 years or longer, is denominated in yen. The currency is an obstacle - though, with the market in longer-dated swaps becoming more liquid, it is possible for the company to meet its objectives of lending fixed rate yen while enabling borrowers to raise floating-rate debt in dollars or other currencies. However, with the Japanese long-term prime rate remaining stubbornly high, the demand from European companies for yen loans looks likely to stay depressed. Last year, Nippon Life's lending through London - all of it booked in Tokyo - was down from Y40bn to Y20-Y25bn, and little growth is expected this year. Any substantial growth in Nippon Life's operations in Europe is unlikely before Japan relaxes the restrictions under which most parts of the financial sector work. For life companies, those restrictions are more severe than for banks or securities firms, preventing them even from entering banking or securities business through overseas subsidiaries. The growing prominence of Japanese life companies in Europe is in marked contrast to the trend internationally. The core of their business - lending to Japanese companies - shrank during the 1980s as they increased their foreign currency investments, chasing in particular the higher yields on US dollar investments. Yen-denominated loans fell from 60 per cent of assets at the start of the 1980s to nearly half that at the end. That trend has reversed, in part due to the higher yields available on domestic yen loans. Now, with a question mark over the ability of Japanese banks to service loan demand inside Japan - and with the banks themselves looking to tap life companies for subordinated debt - the life companies are expected to direct less of their investment internationally.</p>

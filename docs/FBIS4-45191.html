			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   94WB0038A Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 27 Apr 94 STATES  Section pp 1, 3, 4 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0038A </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO     [Text] Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, 26 April--The  Democratic Forum Party congressman from Matamoros, Argelio  Hinojosa, stated today that the drug traffic on the Tamaulipas  border has increased during recent years as a result of the  complicity between those engaged in that activity and the police.    He commented: "There is obvious protection for drug  trafficking rings given by the various federal, state, and  municipal police forces. Therefore, despite the official stories  to the contrary, that activity has increased."    He claimed to have made charges to this effect on repeated  occasions, but said that they were not heeded because there was  no will to attack the problem, since "people in high places are  implicated in this crime."    The legislator noted that the rise in drug trafficking is  well known, as shown by the constant executions of "narcos" in  several of the state's towns.    He added that the problem is alarming, but admitted that  Tamaulipas society is by now used to living with violence,  caused mainly by drug traffickers on the border.    He declared that the complicity between police and "narcos"  is an age-old situation, contributing to the wealth of many  policemen, particularly that of State and Federal Judicial  Police [PJF] assigned to the area.    He concluded by saying: "It is incongruous that PJE [State  Judicial Police] agents earning a monthly salary of 1,200 new  pesos should own residences and late model vehicles."    Today, the mayor of Abasolo, Juvenal Ramirez Lucio, claimed  that drug traffickers have established an air route in the  municipalities of Jimenez, Soto la Marina, and Abasolo for  transporting narcotics to the United States. He added that the  Attorney General's Office (PGR) had, nevertheless, minimized the  situation.    He indicated that small planes often fly at low altitudes  over the region to avoid being detected by the authorities; an  activity that has proven alarming to the area's residents.    He explained that reports of this have been given to the PGR  representative on various occasions, the response being a  promise to conduct operations in the area.    He commented: "As mayors, all we ask of them is air  surveillance, and that they notify us when they intend to arrest  someone living in an Indian community, to avoid frightening the  people."    He added that the settlers' fear was heightened even more  two  months ago, when a drug trafficking ring kidnapped two young  residents whom it suspected of having appropriated a cocaine  shipment dropped from a plane in flight that was being pursued  by the PGR.    He noted that the peasants were brutally tortured, to the  extent of causing the death of one, while the other was severely  injured.    He explained that the peasants, especially those in the  community of La Esperanza, the largest in Abasolo, often find on  their plots of land electrical equipment that has been dropped  from planes in full flight, carrying contraband to the country's  interior.    He said that the route is used in both directions, because  some also follow it to transport "fayuca" [smuggled goods for  street vending], although the most disturbing use is for drug  trafficking.    It should be mentioned that, according to police reports,  during the past four years four small planes carrying drugs from  Colombia have crashed in those municipalities.    In one case, the "narcos" managed to escape with a ton of  cocaine, which they concealed on a farm in this town, where it  was later discovered by the PJF.</p>

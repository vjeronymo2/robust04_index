			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African synthetic fuel decision sparks new row THE South African government's decision to authorise the continued operation of the controversial R12bn (Pounds 1.65bn) Mossgas synthetic fuel project has prompted renewed calls for deregulation of the fuel industry in the country. The decision, announced by Mr George Bartlett, minister of mineral and energy affairs, follows a recent special report by the auditor-general recommending that Mossgas, which came on stream recently, continue to operate as there were sufficient social and economic benefits to offset the project's marginal viability. The green light for for the Southern Cape project - which converts underground natural gas into petrol, diesel and kerosene - coincided with the government's announcement that petrol prices would be increased by 7 cents a litre to R1.82 from September 15. This will bring the price increase since last October to 19.7 per cent. Mr Bartlett said the weakening rand/dollar exchange rate necessitated the price rise, but the Automobile Association rejected that explanation, saying it was the result of the high subsidies required to support the synthetic fuel projects, Mossgas and Sasol. Mr Roger Hulley, energy spokesman for the opposition Democratic party called for the deregulation of the oil industry. He said the motorist was having to pay a price 40 per cent higher than world crude oil prices because of a misguided synthetic fuel policy. The legacy of the years of sanctions is that South Africa still has a highly regulated oil industry. The government sets the retail price, which may not be undercut. It limits the number of petrol stations, sets the wholesale margin and still purchases crude oil for the industry. Although government still favours the current regulatory structure, it has contributed to the deregulation discussion by recently publishing a 32-page document 'Government's involvement in the oil industry'. Mr Bartlett said the cabinet had decided that Mossgas should receive import parity revenue for its products. The import parity price, which Sasol, the other synthetic fuel producer receives, is the base price at which fuel in South Africa is sold. It is 8-10 cents a litre more than the export parity price that the local oil industry receives for its exported product. Local oil companies will be compensated for any losses incurred through having to take Mossgas's production. Mossgas will also receive tariff protection for a period of 10 years similar to that paid to Sasol (an average of 12.5 per cent since 1979). The auditor-general's report, which was drawn up by Deloitte and Touche, found that, with sunk costs excluded, and based on import parity prices, Mossgas would be viable. It would, however, remain sensitive to changes in international fuel prices and to the exchange rate. The joint committee on public accounts that considered the report said that no further money should be invested in Mossgas unless the investment could be justified in terms of normal commercial considerations. Mossgas's origins lie in the desire of the South African government, during the sanctions era, to source 40 per cent of its fuel needs locally. As such, it was a strategic decision, not justifiable on economic criteria. Its continued operation, however, is justified in terms of job creation and foreign exchange savings.</p>

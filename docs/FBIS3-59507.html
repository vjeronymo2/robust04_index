Althoff, general secretary of the League  of German Electrical Engineers (VDE). "No one can get by any  more without our technology -- without `vitamin E' (for  electronics) large sections of the economy would be unfit for  battle." And in fact German businesses -- from electronic plant  construction and energy distribution through measurement,  regulation and communications technology, the automobile  industry and engineering to medical technology -- are leaders in  the application of microelectronics.    But for that very reason there is no real feeling of  contentment. "About DM800 billion in sales and the jobs that go  with it are dependent on the most immediate access to a key  technology with compnents valued at DM5 billion. In technical  competition in this area the user requires detailed knowledge  about what is coming in good time to develop his own system.  Anyone who obtains the specifications of projected electronics  components even half a year later than the competition has an  insuperable handicap." He said that without intimate knowledge  about the possibilities of the semiconductors the user also  increasingly loses his power of innovation.    That is why Dr. Heinz Stephanblome, president of the VDE/VDI  Microelektronik company, thinks that the possibility of  purchasing chips en masse anywhere on the world market is a  dangerous illusion: "Anyone who has integrated circuits  developed in the Far East and purchases them -- even if it is  through the numerous design and production branches -- will one  day have to obtain help with installation, then finished mill  bars and finally all their equipment from over there." For with  increased integration more and more parts of the systems  themselves are migrating to the chip.    Says Althoff, "That is why the user needs proximity and  confidence in his chip supplier."    But Althoff is concerned: "The situation regarding the  direct  availability of microelectronics is very grim in Germany and  indeed all over Europe." The USA (particularly for processors)  and Japan (for memory) have clearly emerged as the centers for  mass production of highly integrated chips. Only two European  manufacturers (Siemens and Thomson) are represented in the top  group, and even they only manage to maintain their position "by  enormous expenses and cross-funding."    Cooperative efforts, like that between the giants Siemens,  IBM, and Toshiba, are one answer to the still growing financial  burdens of chip development. The trio's new generation of memory  storage (256 megabits) will swallow up a billion marks in  development costs and two billion marks in production  investment. But the Europeans still suffer under the handicap  that they have no access to the mass markets and thus to mass  production.    "In this market it is not only a question of mastering the  technical principles -- competitiveness is determined by costs,"  explains Althoff. But costs are not least a function of wastage,  and that in turn depends on practical experience in mass  production. But that is where Europe's chip factories are  lagging -- when they entered the microelectronics field they  were already several generations of circuitry behind and never  acquired the production knowhow of the Asiatics.    The only area in which they are maintaining good positions  is  in ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), the  client-specific circuits with generally low outlay and usually  not the most current technology. But "the more possibilities the  mass processor offers, the more the trend will be towards a  standard chip with specialized software. This will make  tailor-made circuits less significant."    The general secretary of the VDE considers it improbable  that  German suppliers can close this gap with the production of the  specialized software that would then be necessary: "The  labor-intensive production of software is already partly passing  to low-wage countries. This trend will intensify." The  recognition that hardware production, with its  capital-intensive, highly automated, and technically extremely  demanding hardware production, would be more appropriate for  Germany, is now of little use.    "Both of them are drifting away at the moment -- and we are  in a cleft stick. If motor vehicle electronics, traffic control  and high-resolution television -- chip-hungry technologies par  excellence -- pass over to Japan in the wake of entertainment  electronics, telefax and other parts of communications  technology, then we can all go home." He defines the danger for  Europeans: "Loss of linkage is a creeping process the results of  which we will not feel in their full rigor for another 10 or 15  years. But by then it will be far too late."    And there is more: "Losing access to the basic technology of  microelectronics would mean losing touch with a whole field of  new technologies which are just beginning to develop," Althoff  warns. "Anyone who doesn't have microelectronics doesn't have  the procedures either."    Here he is thinking of micromechanics, which  microelectronics  production technology uses for the production of tiny pumps or  transmissions, and also of the new generations of power  electronics components. "Anyone who wants to build a new, rapid  locomotive needs power electronics. In international competition  it can definitely make a difference if the Japanese get the  technical data and ultimately the structural components ito  their hands a few months earlier."    For example, if micromechanics, with its pioneering  application area of medical technology, still a strong German  domain, were to be strongly supported in Germany, that would  certainly be welcome. But he says, "That will only help for the  period of development. Afterwards we will again need mastery of  mass technology -- for instance a pump the size of the head of a  pin with which you could administer insulin within the body has  to be produced in great numbers."    At the moment Althoff sees the way out of the cleft stick  only in the political sphere: "We need a stronger technology  policy, even a kind of industrial policy, if we want to plot a  course for survival in time." He says that a whole package is  needed, including tax advantages, help in forming pools in the  production area and in the organization of sales with the goal  of large inventories, and the removal of unnecessary obstacles.  MITI still intervenes in the production cycle with specific  objectives; American microelectronics obtain many incentives and  financial resources from the military, their bulk purchaser: "We  Europeans cannot hold back."    He says that the EC is pursuing a more or less unclear  policy  in this area, one which makes life more difficult than necessary  for the microelectronics industry. As an example Althoff cites  the long-drawn-out normalization process in the new areas of  communications technology (mobile radio, radio data  transmission): "If these things had proceeded more  systematically for European industry we would have been able to  achieve larger market shares." For Germany in particular he  wishes for improved acceptance of technology: "Instead of  stirring up fears and allowing data protection to score  theoretical triumphs, those in authority would do better to get  rid of obstacles and over-regulation."</p>

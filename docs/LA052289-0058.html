			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> 40,000 ABORTION FOES RALLY IN ST. LOUIS  </P> <P> About 40,000 people rallied in downtown St. Louis to urge the reversal of Roe  vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. Those at the  "Show-Me Life" rally, held at the Old Court House and organized by the Missouri  Citizens for Life, carried placards, banners, posters and balloons marked with  anti-abortion slogans. The crowd heard an address by Sen. John C. Danforth  (R-Mo.), who said that the high court either should overturn the 1973 decision  or modify it so Congress can settle the controversial issue. Danforth compared  the rally to the pro-democracy demonstrations at Beijing's Tian An Men Square.  "The winds of change are blowing halfway around the world, and they are blowing  here today," the senator said.  </P></p>

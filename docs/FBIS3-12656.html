			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Bassam Abu-Sharif [adviser to PLO Chairman  'Arafat] has called for the removal of the Jewish settlements  from the occupied territories and proposed that the United  States finance their purchase for the Palestinians. He said:  Following the Hebron massacre that claimed the lives of 53  Palestinians, it is necessary to remove the Jerwish settlements  from the occupied territories to bring about peace between the  Palestinians and the Israelis. He stressed that the Hebron  massacre provided an opportunity for a two-stage settlement, and  said that the lesson that has been learned shows clearly the  need for the Israeli Army to withdraw from the occupied  territories in implementation of the UN resolutions.    Brother Bassam Abu-Sharif also said that U.S. President Bill  Clinton's invitation to the Palestinians and the Israelis to  hold serious negotiations in Washington gives an opportunity to  President Clinton to prove to the Arab and Islamic world his  interest in peace. Concluding, he said that it is Washington's  duty to intervene, in its capacity as a partner in the peace  process, to completely end the Israeli occupation and to finance  the purchase of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and  Gaza Strip for the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television Welcome back Tights, Camera, Action, the series devoted to dance. (Channel 4 at 8pm). This is an art form not often well served by television but by cramming in three short dances in half an hour you certainly get variety. Choreographers and dancers come from Canada, France and the UK, and some of the works have been commissioned by Channel 4. Men's magazines have come down from the top shelf in recent years, and although selling less than a tenth of the numbers of comparable womens' magazines they bring in the advertising and often do well. For Men Only (BBC 2 at 7.50) betrays its origins - it was commissioned by BBC Wales - but nicely examines the blossoming world of GQ, Arena, Esquire and FHM. Friday night is gardening night - and why not? Garden Club (Channel 4 at 9pm) returns for a nine-week run and for once follows rather than clashes with BBC 2's Gardener's World, which starts at 8.30. For folkies, Loudon and Co at 11.30 on BBC 2 is a must. The man is a melodic maverick and among his guests tonight is James Taylor.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Citibank to merge asset units CITIBANK, the US bank, is to combine its asset management businesses into a new global division - Citibank Global Asset Management  - with total assets of more than Dollars 55bn, writes Alan Friedman. The US bank is hiring Mr Neville Bowen, who has served since 1986 as chief executive of the investment management arm of the London-based Hill Samuel, as chief executive of the new unit. The Citibank asset management businesses being brought together include activities in 31 countries. Around Dollars 20bn of the Dollars 55bn in total assets comes from individual and private banking clients in the US, while the institutional portfolio amounts to Dollars 35bn. Most of the institutional funds under Citibank management are managed from London, and Mr Bowen is expected to divide his time between London and New York. Although Citicorp raised Dollars 102.5m by selling its Citibank Investment Management unit three years ago, the bank stressed that it remains a player in the institutional fund management business. Mr Richard Braddock, Citibank president, said that in merging the activities into one unit the bank hopes to become 'a formidable force - one of a handful of truly global investment firms'. Citibank's investment operations currently include portfolio management, cash management and a group of mutual funds. Fleet/Norstar, the New England banking group, is to become a part owner of the company that operates the NYCE electronic funds transfer network of automated teller machines. Fleet/Norstar will join eight other banks in the NYCE system, which is the largest cash dispenser network in the Northeast.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Poles apart at the border: Matthew Kaminski's rail journey to Vilnius is ended abruptly by frontier guards The clouds are starting to pass over fries and a Coke at MacBurger. It is around 9.40am in Bialystok, a north-eastern Polish city. Just hours ago I was asleep on the overnight from Warsaw to Vilnius. At 3.10am, there was a knock on the compartment door. I knew the routine. The train passes without stopping through a 10km stretch of Belarus, before heading into Lithuania. For some reason the Belarussians, who never before had their own state and still betray little national fealty, are the most vigilant at the frontier. A stone-faced, moustachioed guard curtly demanded passports. I handed him mine, dazed. He flipped through it several times and asked for a Belarussian transit visa. I told him I did not need one because I was a Polish citizen headed to Vilnius. Silent, he walked away with my documents. A Polish passport, issued in Washington years after my parents pulled me out of the third grade and emigrated west, has come in handy in the old Soviet empire, letting me pass through new and cumbersome borders without visas or bribes. Until now, there were no problems. Thirty minutes later he came back. He told me to follow him. We quickly walked down at least five dark train corridors, he always several steps ahead, to a compartment with seven border guards. They wore green uniforms, long overcoats and hats with large red stars. All Belarussian boys from Grodno, the border town: haughty, provincial, important. The captain, slouching in the corner, took the passport. Immediately, he demanded Dollars 30 (Pounds 20.20), about half the average monthly wage in Belarus. Or DM50. A boy sitting next to him confidently added British pounds would be fine, too. I again insisted I did not need any visa, no less a transit visa for a 15 minute stay. I flashed my Lithuanian press pass to prove my eastern roots. Nothing. They got mad. No English word - rude, insolent, hostile - can aptly describe certain behaviour encountered in the east. After a few verbal exchanges, one boy, hair rumpled, stuck the passport in my face, pointing to my official place of residence with obvious hatred: Washington DC, US. I tried to take the passport but he furiously slapped my hand and threatened to hit me. The others laughed. The young captain said, calmly, that I would simply be sent back. The first fight was over. I told him I could pay handsomely in Polish zlotys or Lithuanian litas; I only had Dollars 3. Swindling is a normal transaction cost here; principles should be left at home. But the captain laughed again. 'Funny money,' he said, contemptuously blowing air through his fingers. I lost. Often I had seen easterners bargain with that special (post) Soviet type: people in uniform, from greedy police officers to impertinent store clerks. Pleading, crying and bribing. Unfortunately I have not yet learned how to do that well. So I started yelling, a skill finely honed in the east, rolling off all the Russian curse words I knew. They took me off the train. The offer for hard currency - tvarda valuta - was made again at a Grodno police station, now with 20 Belarussians eyeing me over. An older man, with three silver stars on his epaulet, eventually brought me back to the rail station and shoved me on a west-bound train. I asked, several times in broken Russian, kak vash zavut? He only smirked and pushed me ahead. Once on the train - an express from Minsk to Bialystok - he said his name proudly, 'Ruslan Marchenko', and twice declared, I'm not sure why, 'This is the independent Republic of Belarus'. The wait back at the border took almost three hours. Polish customs officers now had their turn. Next door, three Georgians had at least seven bags. The Poles went through them all and confiscated, after much fuss, 65 bottles of honey-coloured alcohol intended for farmers' markets - so called targs or jarmarks - around Bialystok. The guards even made the Georgians carry the heavy goods off the train. At daybreak I was thrown off the second train, right at the border in a place called Kuznica Bialystocka. The morning drunks, Belarussians and Poles, were gathering at a rag tag station. Again half asleep, I bought a ticket on a regional train to Sokolka, a small city, via Czuprynowo-Kundzin, an even smaller one. Sokolka is a typical small eastern town - a mix of old peasant wooden homes, with chickens scraping in dirt-patch backyards, and concrete apartment blocks. Not exactly out of Kosinki's Painted Bird but not exactly modern, either. From there, an hour later, an overflowing bus brought me to Bialystok, the regional capital. At the grimy bus station, there was the Georgian family again, huddling around their bags, the woman crying. Poles, Belarussians, Romanians and gipsies were milling around as well. Russian is heard more often than Polish. MacBurger's white walls and tidy red tables are right across the street. A young cashier, in pressed white T-shirt, asked if I'd like something else. Still hungry, I'm now waiting for a pineapple burger.</p>

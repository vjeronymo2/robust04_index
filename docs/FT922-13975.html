			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Iraqi missiles 'are threat to Allies' BRITAIN said yesterday that Iraq has moved anti-aircraft missiles into the protected area of Iraq north of the 36th parallel which 'could pose a threat' to US, British and French aircraft patrolling the area. The move revives the possibility of an allied strike against Iraqi forces - an option General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, pointedly refused to rule out in London yesterday after talks on the rising tension in northern Iraq with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Gen Powell said after the meeting that he would not 'speculate on what we might or might not do with respect to the use of military action.' The US state department was last night preparing a formal warning to Iraq over the missiles. Officials said the Soviet-made SAM-2 and SAM-3 missile batteries had been moved within the last 10 days to Mosul, 32km north of the 36th parallel, beyond which Britain and the US have ordered Iraq not to stage military operations against the Kurds on pain of possible allied counter attack. The movement of missiles follows reports of renewed attacks by Iraqi forces on the southern fringe of Kurdish held areas in the north - including some around Mosul and Arbil north of the 36th parallel - and signs of a build-up of Iraqi armour in the north. Iraqi opposition groups in London also claim that a 36,000-strong Iraqi force last week launched a bloody three-day offensive, backed by helicopter gunships, against Iraqi Shias hiding in the country's southern marshes. These skirmishes and the deployment of anti-aircraft missiles, which could provide cover for an attack on the Kurds, has intensified top level consultations between Britain and the US on a possible punitive raid to deter President Saddam Hussein from threatening the Kurds - or from testing too far the resolve of the Gulf war allies in their undertaking to protect them. British officials said yesterday that Gen Powell had brought forward a long-intended trip to meet Mr Major in view of the deteriorating security position in Iraq. The two men gave no details about a possible response to the missile deployment. However, as a first step, Iraq is likely to be warned privately through its mission at the UN in New York that it risks an allied attack. The US, Britain and France patrol the area from the Incirlik airbase in Turkey, where a limited strike force has been based since the Kurdish uprising immediately after the Gulf war.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Australia is top bond performer AUSTRALIA was the top-performing bond market in April, both in US dollar and local currency terms, according to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index Monitor. All the government bond markets showed positive returns last month in local currency terms, but Australia led with a 2.56 per cent gain. The Australian market was boosted by falling yields, and headed the performance tables in US dollar terms with a 3.43 per cent return, helped by a moderate currency gain. Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a 26.67 per cent return in local currency terms (31.9 per cent gain in US dollar terms), making it the second best performing bond market after the UK. Apart from the UK gilts market, all the European government bond markets showed strong returns of more than 1 per cent in April. Japan was the worst performing bond market in local currency terms, with only a 0.15 per cent increase. However, the strong appreciation of the yen meant that Japan showed a 3.25 per cent gain in US dollar terms and therefore ranked second after Australia. France, Spain and Australia have shown the strongest gains since the start of 1991, with returns of 8.64, 8.26, and 8.03 per cent respectively. Japanese government bonds showed the best return in April in sterling terms, according to Kemper Investment Management Company. For a sterling-based investor, the return on Japanese government bonds was 5.08 per cent in April. New Zealand showed a 4.84 per cent gain and Australia a 4.4 per cent gain.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: A problem of pressure - Joanna Slaughter sums up her series on fee-based financial advisers David Norton, the chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, has likened the fees versus commission debate to the M25 London orbital motorway. He says: 'You go round and round in circles, not getting anywhere.' Certainly, views seem to be entrenched. The fee-based independent advisers who have been profiled in the past 15 weeks run very different financial planning firms. But, in general, they are united in believing that consumers can get genuinely unbiased advice only when an adviser is under no financial pressure to sell commission-laden insurance and investment products. Many of the fee-based advisers interviewed identified commissions as causing much of the malaise within the financial services industry. They feel they are in the industry vanguard, not least because the new commission disclosure rules laid down by the Securities and Investments Board - the industry's main regulatory organisation - look set to accelerate the move towards fee-based advice. 'Our time has come,' claims Tony Shepherd, a fee-based IFA from Kent. 'Commission disclosure will act as a catalyst. I see the independent sector diminishing and the more sophisticated end of the IFA market becoming fee-based.' Like other IFAs, though, Shepherd stresses that fee-based firms must do more than sell financial products if they are to justify their charges. Another is Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services. 'Our only function is to provide clients with added value,' he says. 'We are no different from an accountant or a solicitor. And it can't be all smoke and mirrors. Our businesses will fail if the client does not perceive that we are adding something.' Many IFAs feel added value goes hand in hand with professional qualifications. They argue that the public will not accept IFAs as members of a profession until the industry sets and enforces higher standards. Indeed, David Harris, managing director of Chantrey Financial Services, requires his advisers to acquire qualifications as part of their service contracts. Commission-based advisers tend to defend their position by claiming there is widespread consumer resistance to paying fees for financial advice. Some have pointed out that many of the fee-based advisers interviewed in the FT series run comparatively modest businesses; this reinforces their view that the audience for fee-based advice has a narrow base. They argue, too, that as fee-based advice can cost up to Pounds 200 an hour, it is often beyond the financial reach of many people. Few fee-based advisers would deny this, but none appears yet to have solved the problem of bringing impartial advice, at an affordable price, to small savers and investors. The tax regime also buttresses the status quo of commissions. They are exempt from value added tax but professional fees are not. Thus, it could be in the interest of clients for the fee-based adviser to take commissions, even if these are offset against fees later. Andrew Swallow, a fee-based IFA in Ipswich, says: 'Going to a fee-based financial adviser might be best, but there are occasions when the client should persuade him to take some commissions.' Most fee-based advisers think it inevitable that the industry will become polarised, with the better-off serviced by fee-based advisers while those with low incomes and modest assets are left largely to the care of bancassurers - those who sell insurance-related products through banks and building societies. Nevertheless, many claim that IFAs who rely on commission may under-estimate the public appetite for impartial fee-based advice. They cite the Institute of Financial Planning, which publishes a registry of its members and is trying at present to cope with a backlog of 300 inquiries from the public. Other sources of help for those seeking a fee-based IFA include Money Management magazine, which can provide a list of advisers in different areas of the UK who conduct at least part of their business on a fee basis; and the Association of Solicitor Investment Managers, which has a directory of members who undertake investment management and other financial services.

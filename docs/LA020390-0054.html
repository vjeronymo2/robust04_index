			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ORDINARY RETIREMENT HOME;  </P> <P> PAULEY PAVILION: UCLA CELEBRATES 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ARENA WHERE JOHN WOODEN  WON EIGHT OF HIS 10 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS BY HANGING UP JERSEYS OF LEW ALCINDOR  AND BILL WALTON TODAY.  </P> <P> In 1949, in his first year as basketball coach at UCLA, long before wizard and  Westwood started being used in the same sentence, John Wooden began each  practice by dust-mopping the floor of Men's Gym.  </P> <P> He used special oversized mops of his own design that he coaxed the school's  maintenance department to make. After Wooden and the team managers had made  sure that the dirt on the practice court had been swept away by a broom, he  would sprinkle water in front of the oncoming six-foot mops, covered with  towels.  </P> <P> That was how practice began on the second floor of Men's Gym, where basketball  workouts shared space with wrestling mats and gymnastics equipment, such as  trampolines. Students sometimes visited during basketball practice and started  bouncing on the trampolines.  </P> <P> "I used to facetiously say, when coeds in leotards would come use the  trampolines, that the players would notice them -- and of course I wouldn't,"  Wooden said.  </P> <P> The practice routine never varied, though, and it was always in the same  cramped, dusty locale, the upper floor of a building erected in 1932.  </P> <P> What were called UCLA home games were not often played at UCLA, although the  last Bruin game at Men's Gym was not until March, 1959. Wooden's Bruins played  most of their home games at the Sports Arena, Santa Monica City College, Venice  High School, Long Beach City College, Long Beach Auditorium and Pan Pacific  Auditorium.  </P> <P> "I had wanted a place and had been led to believe when I came to UCLA that  within three years we would have a nice place on campus," Wooden said. "Of  course, we didn't get it until after I had been there 17 years."  </P> <P> For the last 25 years, though, UCLA has had that nice place on campus. Pauley  Pavilion, named after the former head of the State Board of Regents, is marking  a quarter of a century of existence. In conjunction with the season-long  observance of its anniversary, the No. 33 UCLA jersey of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  who was Lew Alcindor in his UCLA days, and the No. 32 jersey of Bill Walton  will be retired today in a ceremony at halftime of UCLA's game against DePaul.  The jerseys of women's stars Ann Meyers and Denise Curry also will be retired.  </P> <P> When the building was still in the planning stages, Wooden fought for extra  room along the sidelines and in the end zones, as well as for visiting locker  rooms equal in size to UCLA's. Those were courtesies, he said, that should be  extended if under one's control.  </P> <P> "I think that our winning the (national) championship in 1964 and then  repeating it in 1965 was far more amazing than winning afterwards when we got  to Pauley Pavilion," Wooden said. "In 1964, for example, Alcindor was a junior  in New York City and (winning the national championship) attracted his  attention. In his senior year, we repeated as champions and that solidified his  interest.  </P> <P> "And when he visited us in that April, one of the things that I could do was  take him up to Pauley Pavilion (and say), 'Now that's going to be open,  (you're) going to play the first game ever played in it.' I think it's one of  the reasons Alcindor came. And of course, that's what helped us get a string  going.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he wouldn't have come if we hadn't had Pauley Pavilion. But on the  other hand, he wouldn't have come had we not won in '64 and '65 and attracted  his attention."  </P> <P> Since it opened in the fall of 1965, the Bruins have a 360-37 record there. In  the first 10 years at Pauley, UCLA was 149-2. The Bruins once won 98  consecutive games there. The streak started with the 1970-'71 season opener and  finally was ended on Feb. 21, 1976, when Oregon State won, 65-45. There are 10  NCAA championship banners hanging in Pauley and Abdul-Jabbar and Walton were  around for five of them. Wooden, of course, was there for all 10.  </P> <P> "I think I had a part in it, of course," Wooden said. "But no coach has an  exceptional record if he doesn't have exceptional players. I'm not trying to be  naive or excessively modest or anything because just as quickly I'd say not  every coach does well with exceptional players.  </P> <P> "Yes, I was part of building the tradition, but I was just a part."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar and Walton played major parts.  </P> <P> "I don't believe there's been a more valuable player in college basketball than  Kareem," Wooden said. "And I think that's pretty well proven. He would have to  be considered the main cog in our three consecutive national championships.  Now, of course, no other team has ever won three consecutive national  championships. We won seven. I honestly think that had he been eligible as a  freshman, we'd have won one more (which would have made it a mind-boggling 10  NCAA titles in a row).  </P> <P> "There were plenty of opposing coaches who said, 'Wait till he's gone, they'll  get their comeuppance.' But after he graduated, we won two more in succession  with Steve Patterson as center. He's sort of the answer to the trivia question:  'Who is the center of the national championship teams between Alcindor and  Walton?'  </P> <P> "Then Walton came. I would say that in many respects, and I've tried to be as  objective as possible, that Kareem is the most valuable player because he put  more of a burden on the opposing teams at each end of the court than Bill.  </P> <P> "But at the same time, if you graded the players on all the fundamental aspects  of the game on, say, a one-to-10 basis -- passing, defense, rebounding,  outletting, shooting -- I think that Bill might have the higher rating of the  two.  </P> <P> "You might say then that Bill would be the better basketball player, but Kareem  is more valuable. Well, that's altogether possible."  </P> <P> In those Camelot years at UCLA, when Alcindor and Walton each staked his claim  as the dominant center of the day, it was at Pauley they displayed their  magical powers.  </P> <P> 'THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER'  </P> <P> The very first game played in Pauley Pavilion was on Nov. 27, 1965. It matched  the two-time defending NCAA champion UCLA Bruins, ranked No. 1 in the preseason  polls, and the UCLA freshman team, led by the 7-foot-1, 18-year-old Alcindor  from Power Memorial High in New York City.  </P> <P> "That intra-squad game was weird for me," Abdul-Jabbar recalls. "I can remember  before the game, I didn't know what to think because I thought we could beat  them, but I really didn't feel that it was appropriate for me to speculate  about it. So I didn't. After all, it was the Bruins playing the Bruins. I tried  to keep my emotions out of it."  </P> <P> But the varsity couldn't keep his shots out of the basket. Before 12,051,  Abdul-Jabbar scored 31 points and had 21 rebounds in a startling 75-60 victory  for the freshmen. Two other prep All-Americans on the freshman team were guard  Lucius Allen from Kansas and forward Lynn Shackleford from Burroughs High in  Burbank. The varsity was led by forwards Edgar Lacy and Mike Lynn.  </P> <P> Ahead 36-31 at halftime, the freshmen went on a 10-0 run early in the second  half, Abdul-Jabbar scoring six of the points in that span. That intra-squad  game, is regarded as a watershed game in UCLA history. But at the time,  Abdul-Jabbar was not thinking about history being made.  </P> <P> "I just felt kind of odd that we could beat a varsity Pac-8 team like that," he  said. "You know, before the game, our assistant coach, Jake Hardy, said 'Listen  you guys, play hard, you'll beat that team by 15 points.' That's just what he  said. And that was exactly the score.  </P> <P> "All I remember is they couldn't press us and we were faster than they were. We  broke the press real easy. They'd pass it to me and I'd come up by our free  throw line in the backcourt there and I'd just hit guys cutting left or right  and they beat them down the court. That was an easy game for us."  </P> <P> Once Abdul-Jabbar became eligible for the varsity team as a sophomore, there  were whole series of easy games. He scored 56 points against USC in his first  varsity game and 61 against Washington State, both at Pauley. He scored lots of  his points on dunks, a shot that the NCAA banned after Abdul-Jabbar's sophomore  year. But if Abdul-Jabbar's headlines emanated from his shooting the ball, he  got perhaps his greatest pleasure out of passing it.  </P> <P> "I always enjoyed it because it was like automatic layups," he said. "I just  enjoyed spreading it around. It was fun. The game was fun and easy. We got our  challenge out of how well we could execute the things Coach Wooden wanted us  to.  </P> <P> "Probably the game I most remember is when we played Colorado State my  sophomore year. They were solid and they gave us a tough game."  </P> <P> The Rams, who featured power players such as 6-8 Bob Rule, 6-10 Dale Schlueter  and 6-10 Mike Davis, twice cut UCLA's lead to one point, but the Bruins won,  84-74, on Dec. 22, 1966, in Pauley. Against double- and triple-team defenses,  Abdul-Jabbar had 34 points, 20 rebounds and six blocked shots.  </P> <P> "For me, that game was crucial because I developed a lot of confidence in Coach  Wooden and what he knew," Abdul-Jabbar said. "He knew how to use his weapons a  lot more effectively than other coaches. Those other games where I scored a lot  of points, they weren't really challenges. This one, we were being tested. And  Coach Wooden had all the answers."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar said that if he were athletic director, he would make one change  at Pauley.  </P> <P> "I always wanted them to have the seats come up to the end lines," he said. "I  always thought that that took away from some of our home-court advantage. They  could put risers there.  </P> <P> "Pauley helped sell me on wanting to come to UCLA. When I came out to visit,  they hadn't put the floor in. They had finished everything but the floor. So  the floor was just a big concrete slab. You know, I walked in the building, and  geez, that was a very impressive building in 1965. It was state of the art. And  it's still on a par with the best arenas as far as sight lines and everything."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar, 42, divides his time between Bel-Air and Hawaii. His second book,  a diary of his final season with the Lakers, is due out shortly.  </P> <P> 'THE BETTER PLAYER'  </P> <P> Bill Walton said the Bruins played a lot of good games at Pauley during his  tenure in Westwood, but there was a pretty fair explanation.  </P> <P> "You know, we had such a great basketball team," he said. "We shouldn't have  ever lost any of the games we played, but we did. But some of the most special  memories I have of Pauley would have been in practice.  </P> <P> "We had incredibly competitive practices. And Coach Wooden was just really an  inspirational leader in terms of conducting practice and the importance of  practice. I loved them.  </P> <P> "Practice was just war out there. In 1974, we had a lot of great players on the  second string -- Swen Nater, Andre McCarter, Marques Johnson, Richard  Washington, Ralph Drollinger. Everybody knew that if you didn't produce, you  were going to the bench and somebody else is going to be out there playing. You  know, playing time is a very special deal."  </P> <P> Of all the special games Walton played at Pauley, perhaps the one that is most  remembered would be the UCLA-Notre Dame game of Jan. 26, 1974. The week before,  Notre Dame had beaten UCLA in South Bend, 71-70, ending the Bruins' 88-game  winning streak. Suddenly, the national rankings were reversed, Notre Dame was  No. 1 and UCLA No. 2.  </P> <P> In the first meeting, the Irish had overcome a 70-59 UCLA lead with 3:30 to go  by holding the Bruins without a point. Walton had played, wearing a reinforced  corset to protect a broken bone in his back. He scored 24 points and had nine  rebounds in his first game in two weeks. But when UCLA got its chance for  revenge at Pauley, the Bruins did not miss it. Walton made 16 of 19 shots,  scored 32 points and had 11 rebounds in a 94-75 victory.  </P> <P> So the Bruins had their 60th consecutive victory at Pauley. At that time, the  UCLA team was also known as the Walton Gang, and on that day, the leader was,  well, pumped up.  </P> <P> "I get pretty fired up for basketball games," Walton said. "That's one of the  things I like about basketball, you can get really fired up and go out there  and just let it all go. You can show your emotions. It's a total physical,  psychological and mental release. It is one that I just really miss releasing.  </P> <P> "Even in practice at Pauley, you had to have the attitude that the person you  are practicing against is the best in the world. Coach Wooden was able to get  that across to us. We believed him . . . and we still believe him.  </P> <P> "There were just so many players around who had phenomenal athletic ability and  Coach Wooden was just molding us all into fine young basketball players. The  enthusiasm and the optimism and the whole atmosphere and attitude that  surrounded the team -- we were expected to win the championship and not winning  every game would be considered a failure. That was the feeling we got in Pauley  or just hanging around Coach Wooden.  </P> <P> "He is an unbelievably special person. You know, you look at him and you watch  him and you live with the guy during the season. You see all this greatness  about him and he's always coming up with something better. He was perfect for  me.  </P> <P> "Pauley Pavilion was, by far, the nicest building in the country for college  basketball. The first time I went was one of Kareem's last games. My older  brother and I went up there together. He went up there on a recruiting trip. My  brother, Bruce, played football at UCLA and I sort of tagged along. I was a  junior (in high school). You know, UCLA was recruiting me, but this wasn't an  official visit or anything. When I walked inside, I just said, 'Hey, I want to  do this -- this looks perfect for me.'  </P> <P> "There was no hesitation or doubt in my mind that UCLA was where I wanted to  go. And Pauley Pavilion played such a big part in that. Of course, Coach Wooden  played a much bigger part."  </P> <P> Walton, 37, lives near San Diego and spends most of his time doing charity work  and being with his four sons, who are 14, 12, 9, and 8.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAMEWORTH, DROSSIN PUT THE DOUBTS TO REST  </P> <P> Between them, they had won five state Division I titles in cross-country, but  Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of Agoura High entered Saturday night's state  track and field championships at Cerritos College in Norwalk with something to  prove.  </P> <P> Despite all the honors bestowed on them for running over hill and dale during  the fall, neither had won a state title on the track.  </P> <P> Dameworth, the 1989 Kinney national cross-country champion, had come close last  year, finishing second to David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit in the 3,200 meters,  yet he and Drossin entered this year's state championship with a reputation for  failing to win crucial track events.  </P> <P> As of 8 p.m. Saturday, that image had been washed away as Dameworth followed  Drossin's victory in the girls' 3,200 with a win of his own in the boys' race.  </P> <P> Ten minutes after Drossin had run a personal-best and state-leading time of 10  minutes 29.60 seconds, Dameworth toed the starting line and proceeded to reel  off a personal-best and nation-leading time of 8:53.26.  </P> <P> "I kind of have mixed emotions right now," said Dameworth, whose previous best  was 8:53.85. "It means a lot to me that I finally won a state track title, but  I'm kind of disturbed. I wanted to run a lot faster time. . . . I was hoping to  run the first 800 in 2:11 and the first (1,600) in 4:21 or 4:22, but that was  shot from the start when no one else wanted to lead for the first two laps."  </P> <P> Dameworth in effect led from start to finish.  </P> <P> Hector Hernandez of Mar Vista briefly took the lead during the fifth lap, but  Dameworth dictated the pace.  </P> <P> The Charger senior passed the first 800 meters in 2:15.2 and 1,600 meters in  4:27.8 with Eliazar Herrera of Hoover, Angel Martinez of San Gabriel, Abe  Valdez of Camarillo, Obed Aguirre of San Fernando and Hernandez close behind.  </P> <P> A 2:14.9 for the third 800 brought Dameworth through 2,400 meters in 6:42.7 and  opened a gap over everyone except Herrera.  </P> <P> "I didn't know who it was, but I could feel someone close to me with two laps  to go," said Dameworth, winner of the past three state Division I cross-country  titles. "I was pretty nervous."  </P> <P> That anxiety ceased shortly afterward as Dameworth broke away from Herrera with  600 meters left while running his final 800 in 2:10.6.  </P> <P> Herrera (8:58.97), James Menon (8:59.05) of San Luis Obispo and Aguirre  (9:01.11) all recorded personal bests.  </P> <P> Like Dameworth, Drossin is not known for a blistering last lap, and she had no  intention of letting her race develop into a kicker's affair.  </P> <P> "The plan was to go with three laps left and that's what I did," said Drossin,  who won state Division I cross-country titles in 1987 and '89 and placed third  in '88.  </P> <P> But even Drossin, a junior, was shocked at how well her plan worked.  </P> <P> After Martha Pinto of Anaheim Katella led through the 1,600 in 5:19.9, Drossin  bolted into the lead with 1,000 meters remaining and was never challenged.  </P> <P> Running the last 1,600 in 5:09.7, Drossin defeated runner-up Pinto by nearly 13  seconds.  </P></p>

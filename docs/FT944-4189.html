			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A new Japan Japan has changed a good deal in the year since the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's last assessment of the country's economic prospects. The economy has finally begun to emerge out of recession. And the political turmoil of recent years - though far from over  -has given birth to a clear challenge to the one-party rule of old. The Japanese electorate will tomorrow gain a credible alternative to the ruling Liberal Democratic party, with the inauguration of the New Frontier Party, to be led by Mr Toshiki Kaifu. A few days later, the country will also gain a new central bank president, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who takes over from Mr Yasushi Mieno on December 16th. The OECD survey, published yesterday, gives reasons for both new arrivals to be optimistic about the future, but little cause for complacency. The report confirms that the economy entered a 'phase of gradual recovery in the second half of this year'. The organisation now predicts real GDP growth of 1 per cent in 1994, a little more than it forecast in June. GDP growth is expected to pick up further in 1995, to 2.5 per cent, though this will depend heavily on the strength of the yen and Mr Matsushita's approach to his new job. His predecessor's overriding objective was to foster economic growth without the barest hint of inflation. Consumer price inflation has indeed fallen steadily since the middle of 1993. The domestic deflator for GDP - a less distorted measure of domestic prices - fell in the third quarter of this year, for the first time in seven years. Most believe that official measurements significantly under-state the extent of the decline in prices, which shows little sign of being reversed. Signs of economic recovery recently appeared to be pointing Mr Mieno in the direction of tightening monetary policy. While the discount rate - at 1.75 per cent - has been unchanged for over a year, he has made sporadic attempts to push up overnight money market rates. Each has been foiled by further strengthening of the yen, and weakening of the stock market. Both should serve as a reminder of the other tasks which Mr Matsushita will inherit, none of which is as close to being achieved as the first. As the OECD point out, the feeble state of domestic demand argues for a further lowering of interest rates, if anything, since real rates remain relatively high. Mr Matsushita should also give a higher priority to speeding up the recovery of the financial sector, still burdened by misguided lending of the bubble era. He must lend weight to the government's still disappointingly tentative deregulation efforts. Another wave of such reforms is due to begin in the spring of next year. As the OECD admits, important steps have been taken in recent years to ensure that the fragile, consumer-led recovery of the past few months will lead to a longer-term re-balancing of the Japanese economy. In the medium term, the development of a new source of political authority in the Diet ought to facilitate more rapid reforms of the regulatory and fiscal systems. Japan is unlikely ever to repeat the heady export-led growth of the past few decades. Some of the seeds of a new kind of growth have been laid in recent years. They will need active nurturing, however. Japan's new, and not so new, leaders ought to convince themselves that it is a welcome task - and press on with it.</p>

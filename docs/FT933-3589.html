			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / British Steel may quit EC restructuring plan: Chairman wants tougher action to curb state aid BRITISH STEEL may pull out of a plan to restructure the EC steel industry unless the European Commission takes tougher action to curb state subsidies. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, will today warn the Commission that the company may not contribute to a levy to finance rationalisation among weaker producers because so little progress has been made to cut subsidies to state-owned producers in Italy and Spain. The levy is central to Commission plans to respond to recession in the industry by cutting 30m tonnes of production capacity. Mr Moffat will tonight warn Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, that the restructuring plan could fail if a subsidies deal is not agreed by November. He will be among a number of European steel industry leaders at a meeting in Strasbourg called to discuss the Commission's plan to restructure the industry. The Commission had originally asked steel companies to offer capacity cuts of 30m tonnes by September 30 to help reduce chronic overcapacity. But private sector companies such as British Steel, and the German producers Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, have held back, arguing it would be unfair for them to offer production cuts while the level of state subsidies to their competitors remained unsettled. Officially the Commission still hopes it can reach a deal on subsidies in time for the next EC industry ministers meeting on September 21. But with negotiations with Italian and Spanish producers continuing, this looks increasingly unlikely. Mr Moffat warned that failure by the Commission to reach a satisfactory agreement to cut state subsidies could cause bankruptcies in private sector steel groups. He remained hopeful that the Commission's problems clinching a deal to cut state subsidies would only amount to 'three or four months of lost momentum'. Mr Moffat said subsidised producers were delaying reaching an agreement in the hope that an economic upturn would ease the pressure on them to make cuts. He said: 'The current situation is an excuse for doing nothing.' British Steel was broadly in favour of the levy to help finance production cuts over the next five years, Mr Moffat stressed. But he said the company would not take part if the deal was not in its shareholders' interests. See Lex</p>

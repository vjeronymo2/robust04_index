			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Maxwell show banned as court fears 'prejudice' The High Court yesterday banned Maxwell: The Musical, the West End revue about the life of the late Robert Maxwell. Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, was granted an injunction preventing the show opening. A judge said there was a 'substantial risk of serious prejudice' upon the trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, and four others charged with fraud over the collapse of the Maxwell empire. The move - for which there is no legal precedent - came just four days before the first public preview of the musical due to be staged at London's Criterion theatre. The show's producer Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Mr Maxwell's private companies, said afterwards: 'Obviously I am bitterly disappointed, but the law is the law and sadly the show must not go on.' Although Mr Steadman could appeal against the injunction, he admitted last night that this was unlikely. The musical, which tells the story of the late tycoon through adapted Gilbert and Sullivan songs, had been scheduled to run for 13 weeks in London with a transfer to the US planned. The injunction will cost Mr Steadman, the sole backer of the show, about Pounds 1.1m. All 3,700 people who have bought tickets would have their money refunded, he said. The late publisher is named as a co-conspirator in six of the 10 fraud charges variously brought against those due to stand trial. Under the terms of the injunction, the musical could go ahead after all criminal proceedings have ended. However, this could be 18 months away, and Mr Steadman was yesterday unsure whether the show could be revived then. Pointing at posters for a show that would 'make you laugh, sing - and angry', Mr Steadman said: 'Well troops, the simple answer is - oh no, it won't' The Society of London Theatres said: 'Anything that has an effect upon what is already a pretty frail industry has to be bad news.'</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / CBI chief outlines areas for joint action to TUC MR HOWARD DAVIES, direc-tor-general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday outlined the terms for a closer working relationship between the CBI and the Trades Union Congress, telling the TUC Congress in Blackpool that 'my door will always be open'. Mr Davies's speech, the first by a CBI leader to the TUC, was generally well received, although about 50 delegates, led by Mr Arthur Scargill, the leftwing miners' leader, walked out. The CBI leader was unruffled by the reaction and attempted to allay the suspicion of delegates by stressing his humble background and his love of Manchester City football club. He said later that a walk-out by Mr Scargill was 'like a rained-off cricket match at Lord's, part of the British way of life'. Mr Davies's speech was interrupted several times by shouts and jeers, particularly when he repeated his view that the public sector pay bill should not rise, but there were as many interruptions for applause, notably when he urged more public investment in transport and training. Mr Davies said the main areas for dialogue between the CBI and TUC were manufacturing competitiveness, training and Europe. But he did not expect to see joint approaches to government by the two organisations. On Europe, Mr Davies said there could be Community regulations in which the common interests between employers and employees were greater than the differences. Afterwards, Mr Bill Morris, the leader of the left-of-centre TGWU general union, the biggest in Britain, said that 80 per cent of the speech could have been written by any member of the TUC general council. Points welcomed by union leaders included Mr Davies's commitment to the public sector, his emphasis on 'social dialogue' between unions and employers in Europe despite the UK's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and his view that 'senior management pay should be subject to exactly the same market and profitability disciplines as that of the workforce'. He drew the wrath of the local government union Nalgo when he compared changes in local government since 1979 unfavourably with those in the NHS. He also took issue with the view, expressed by several union leaders yesterday, that sterling was overvalued in relation to other European currencies.

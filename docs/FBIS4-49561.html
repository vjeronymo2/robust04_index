			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Economic Reference Forum" article: "Steadily Push Forward </F> Banking Reform"]    [Text] The risks of banking reform are not as great as  those involved in fiscal reform and can be pushed steadily  ahead. The guideline for banking work this year remains:  "Continuing to rectify the banking order, steadily advancing  banking reform, strictly controlling the gross amount of credit,  and effectively strengthening banking supervision and  management." The regulations laid down last year have achieved  great results, but should be further implemented this year,  because many things have not been completed and have not been  thoroughly solved. In addition, three requirements have been  set for work this year.    First, control the scale of investment in fixed assets by  all  possible means. In order to control the overall scale of  investment, we must control the amount of bank credit offered to  fixed-assets investment projects. Solid results must be  achieved in this regard. The State Planning Commission will lay  down an overall quota, and bank branches in every province must  be subject to such quantitative limitations. The overall  quantitative limit must not be exceeded by even one yuan,  because this has a bearing on the national economy and the  destiny of the nation. The scale of investment is already very  large, and has gone beyond the capacity of our national  strength. Therefore, the task for the banks this year is to  tightly control the scale of fixed-assets investment. If they  fail to do this, there will be big trouble in the overall  situation of the national economy.    Second, our specialized banks should be turned into  commercial banks, and the first step will be taken this year.  This will just be one step in the long process and is not a  step which will complete the whole process. If no further loans  are given to enterprises which operate in the red and fail to  repay their debts, there could be unrest in society. There are  still many such problems. Therefore, banking reform this year  will only take a first step. We can consider how to run  commercial banks in such circumstances. In general, however,  the supply of working capital may be loosened, but lending for  fixed assets must be strictly controlled. Loans for working  capital may be arranged more flexibly and financial support  should still be given to enterprises which can achieve  satisfactory economic results. Some enterprises that cannot  achieve good economic results still cannot be allowed to go  bankrupt immediately, and appropriate financial support should  still be given to them according to the opinions of local  governments. However, products cannot be just stockpiled in  warehouses. This year, pilot schemes should be carried out in a  number of provinces, and bankruptcy experiments can be carried  out first in a number of enterprises in every province.  Bankruptcy should be arranged for enterprises that have been  operating in the red for a long time and cannot stop incurring  losses after full preparations have been made, because if more  loans are given to them, this will just increase their unpaid  debts. After bankruptcy, their assets can be auctioned and the  enterprises reorganized.    Third, the People's Bank of China should actually transform  its functions and should really exercise banking supervision.  The functions of the bank must be changed, and this was the aim  of the reform we carried out last year. In the past, the  People's Bank was keen to directly arrange loans. Loans  throughout whole provinces were distributed by the People's  Bank. This confused the functions of the central bank and those  of the commercial banks. At present, the People's Bank no  longer performs such a function, because it has to perform a  more important function. It is not responsible for arranging  even a small percentage of credit and does not involve itself in  the distribution of credit-making quotas. It just plays its  role as the central bank in exercising overall banking  supervision and in keeping overall monetary order in every  locality.    At present, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing  some people's irregular fund-raising activities after credit has  been brought under strict control. Irregular fund-raising  activities and the irregular setting up of financial  institutions cause high interest rates and disruption to the  monetary order. Thus, the People's Bank is responsible for  carrying out inspections. Problems discovered should be checked  immediately and made known to all banks in the country. No  loopholes can be left in this field; otherwise, things could go  out of control. At present, some people just think that a  modern enterprise system can only be the joint-stock system  established through internal fund-raising means, with bank loans  withdrawn. Then, what should the banks do? If all enterprises  distributed large amounts of dividends to their workers or keep  the profits in their hands own rather than depositing them with  the banks, the banks will have no deposits and the state will  have no money to arrange necessary capital construction.  Therefore, it is necessary to organize and increase deposits.  The People's Bank must change its functions and must  impartially fulfill its supervisory task by checking  interest-rate battles, savings battles, and irregular  fund-raising activities based on high interest rates as soon as  these things are discovered.</p>

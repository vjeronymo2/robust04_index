			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: New World Symphony - Barbican Hall/Radio 3 Not the Dvorak, but a young Miami-based orchestra - 'America's musical academy' - inaugurated four years ago by the LSO's conductor Michael Tilson Thomas: it employs outstanding players who have completed their studies, but haven't yet joined full-time orchestras. They appeared at the Barbican on Friday and Sunday. Unfortunately I chose the wrong concert, the second, for the sake of the advertised Of Men and Mountains by Carl Ruggles (ruggedly original, almost unknown in Britain). They didn't play it, but replaced it with Copland's Billy the Kid suite: thin stuff, in all conscience, and not much of a musical exercise for the band. It was entertaining to hear, with its gun-battle for percussion near the end. So was Gershwin's Second Rhapsody, which was a showcase for Tilson Thomas as solo pianist (hard, brilliant, unrelaxed); the New World players got to show off their big-band skills. But again, this is little more than bottom-drawer Gershwin, for all its feverish glitter; and by the interval, all we had learned about the orchestra was that they are keen and highly proficient, and that their current first trumpet is quite remarkable. The serious challenge, and indeed a daunting one, came with the Fourth Symphony of Charles Ives, in which the London Philharmonic Choir joined. It is a dense, recklessly inventive work from 1916: plenty of familiar Ives devices the hymn-tunes, the distorted town bands, the suspended Impressionism - but used on a grand scale, heedless of performing difficulties, and to almost supra-musical ends. Certainly it is as much epic music-theatre as music, for prophetic Transcendentalist fervour supplies its main drift, in towering waves of sound and fragile, momentary bubbles. Eddying around it, however, are any number of vivid, disparate musical ideas, which need to be brought sharply to life if the score is to work. When I came home and found that the delayed Radio 3 relay was still going on, I discovered how expertly Tilson Thomas had differentiated Ives' strands, with ready responses from his players, and how well he directed them forward. That had been harder to tell at the Barbican. The second and fourth movements of this symphony pile lines upon lines upon lines, usually fortissimo; in the bright, up-front acoustic of this hall, they soon clotted into indeterminate roars. For home listeners, the BBC engineers and their many microphones sorted that out very well. On the spot, we were impressed but blankly overwhelmed.</p>

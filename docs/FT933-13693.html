			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram The unseemly scuffle between Spring Ram's management and its institutional shareholders is developing into a minor City classic. Three profits warnings from Spring Ram in eight months have, to say the least, left the management with a serious credibility problem. The finance director has been the one sacrificial lamb so far. But the company's furious shareholders, led by the Prudential, are still charging head first at the apparently immovable chairman and chief executive, Mr Bill Rooney. Without the injection of fresh management and adherence to a coherent strategy, Spring Ram's shares will continue to founder and its trading position deteriorate. As things stand, the company would be defenceless against even a derisory bid. Any profits forecast from Spring Ram in such circumstances would surely be greeted with hollow laughter. There is a danger that if the institutions oust Mr Rooney there may be boardroom defections which would leave the company rudderless. The onus must be on Spring Ram's sheepish board to resolve the situation. Ironically, Mr Rooney might be the greatest beneficiary from his own departure. He and his family trusts own 16 per cent of Spring Ram's equity and must crave the restoration of share price stability.</p>

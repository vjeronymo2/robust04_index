			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Strong interim progress by Perstop Perstorp, the Swedish specialty chemicals and plastics group, reported strong progress in the six months to February 1994, lifting profits after financial items to SKr270m (Dollars 34.07m) from SKr114m in the same period a year ago. The group said rationalisation, greater penetration of new markets, and the weakening krona had helped to compensate for poor market conditions in Europe. All six divisions increased sales, lifting total group turnover by 24 per cent to SKr4.99bn. Mr Gosta Wiking, the president, said that full-year earnings were expected to 'substantially exceed' last year's SKr331m level. 'The European economy remains weak, but many factors indicate that a levelling-off is in progress,' he noted. Sophus Berendsen, the Danish majority shareholder in Rentokil, the UK company, has proposed an increase in the dividend to DKr4.00 from DKr3.50 per share after increasing net profits last year to DKr1.21bn (Dollars 180m) from DKr465m in 1992, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Pre-tax profits increased to DKr2.04bn from DKr. 1.21bn and turnover was up to DKr9.87bn from DKr7.77bn. The increase in the group's earnings reflects Rentokil's acquisition of Securigard, the UK security company, and Berendsen's acquisition of Lucas Fluid Power, the hydraulics group.</p>

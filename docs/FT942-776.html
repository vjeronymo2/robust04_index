			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / NZ bank warns on inflation The New Zealand Reserve Bank faces an important test of its anti-inflationary powers as it seeks to manage the economy through a period of robust growth and higher inflation over the next 12 months, Mr Don Brash, the governor, said yesterday. Releasing the bank's monetary policy agenda for the next six months, he hinted that the bank would be comfortable with some additional, modest, firming in monetary policy. New Zealand financial markets treat the central bank's monetary policy statements in the same light as the budget, because of its role in setting foreign exchange and interest rate policy. Mr Brash said that over the coming year the country faced growth, wage and other cost pressures of a sort the bank had not encountered since the Reserve Bank Act was passed in 1989. While he did not see inflation taking off, pressures would push the rate from the current 1 per cent to between 1.7 and 1.8 per cent by late next year. This would be just below the 2 per cent maximum target allowed by the Reserve Bank Act. 'Inflation at these levels would provide little room for error, and with the economy continuing to grow strongly, New Zealand is more likely to encounter greater, not less, inflation pressures,' he said. He said the bank was comfortable with the latest rises in domestic rates, which have increased by about 1 per cent since February.</p>

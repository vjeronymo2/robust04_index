			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Vance tipped to lead UN mission to end South African violence THE UN special representative on South Africa is expected to fly in soon to begin discussions aimed at ending political violence and restarting constitutional negotiations. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has not yet named the envoy, but he has mentioned Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of state, as a possibility. The mandate contained in Security Council resolution 765, adopted unanimously on Thursday night after a two day debate on South Africa, steers a careful path between the positions of the government and the African National Congress (ANC). It includes a broad condemnation of the violence, in particular last month's massacre at Boipatong township, and while stressing that it is the government's responsibility to protect lives, does not suggest that Pretoria is involved in the killings. The resolution calls for the special representative 'to recommend, after discussions with the parties, measures which would assist in bringing an effective end to violence and in creating conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic  .. South Africa.' President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, differ widely on what would be appropriate measures, with the former indicating that he would accept UN observers taking part in efforts to end the violence, while Mr Mandela has suggested that a substantial UN monitoring force will be necessary. Prospects for a resumption of talks have nevertheless improved, although formal constitutional negotiations are not expected to take place before the UN envoy has reported back. Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting the ANC terms for the resumption of talks, while senior figures on both sides are concerned by the impact of the stalemate on tensions in South Africa. Discussions are continuing between the business community and trade union leaders in an effort to avert a general strike due to start on August 3. Meanwhile South African police announced yesterday that 78 people held over the Boipatong massacre will appear in court on Monday, charged with public violence. The Chamber of Mines' gold mine members and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) have agreed a 1992 wage review. However the NUM has declared a dispute in the coal mining sector after failing to reach a settlement with the chambers' collieries. The gold mining houses, with the exception of Goldfields of South Africa and Anglovaal, have also agreed to introduce a profit-sharing scheme which will distribute 20 per cent of profits to employees.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN FACES NEW ALLEGATIONS OF FAKING DATA;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE LATEST CHARGES WERE CONTAINED IN AN AFFIDAVIT THAT WAS FILED TO  SUPPORT A FEDERAL RAID OF THE CARRIER'S MIAMI HEADQUARTERS TWO WEEKS AGO.  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines, in court documents made public Friday, was accused of faking  aircraft maintenance records in Atlanta and Miami. The new allegations indicate  that improper maintenance practices that prompted an indictment of the carrier  in July continued up through last month.  </P> <P> The latest charges were contained in an affidavit that was filed to support a  federal raid of Eastern's Miami headquarters two weeks ago. The affidavit was  unsealed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn after Eastern lost an appeal to  keep the document secret.  </P> <P> The affidavit states that Eastern maintenance supervisors -- under pressure to  avoid flight delays -- routinely faked records to show that repairs were made  when they were not. The incidents described in the affidavit took place at  Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport and at Miami's airport from 1987 to November,  1990.  </P> <P> Most of the alleged safety violations took place before the machinists union  struck the carrier in March, 1989. The allegations are similar to those  contained in a July indictment of the airline that concerned maintenance  practices at New York's John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia airports.  </P> <P> Eastern vigorously denied the allegations. In a statement, the carrier said  most of the charges were vague and appeared to be made by mechanics who are  still on strike against Eastern. One of the government informants has been the  subject of disciplinary action at Eastern, the airline said.  </P> <P> Eastern stressed that the Federal Aviation Administration kept a close watch on  Eastern's maintenance practices and has found nothing amiss. And, in an  unusually strong counter-attack, Eastern bankruptcy trustee Martin R. Shugrue  accused an unnamed assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn of turning Eastern into  "a career-building case."  </P> <P> "The same assistant U.S. attorney leading the vendetta against Eastern has some  67,000 frequent-flier miles," Shugrue said in a statement. "Enough said."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. attorney said the office had no comment.  </P> <P> The latest round of charges is yet another blow to the troubled carrier. The  carrier's creditors have sought in bankruptcy proceedings to liquidate it. But  a bankruptcy court judge in November gave Eastern permission to spend $135  million from an escrow account, enough to keep it going through spring.  </P> <P> As it struggles to survive, Eastern has tried to build an image as a reliable  and safe airline. The allegations, if true, are especially troublesome for  Shugrue, who was appointed trustee in April. At least two of the alleged  incidents -- including a faked entry concerning an oil leak -- took place on  his watch.  </P> <P> Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline believed the new  allegations would have little effect on ticket sales.  </P></p>

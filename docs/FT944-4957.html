			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Medeva to pay Dollars 54m for anaesthetic maker Medeva, the acquisitive drugs group, yesterday stepped up its expansion strategy by announcing plans to acquire Inhalon Pharmaceuticals, the US anaesthetic manufacturer, for Dollars 54m (Pounds 34.6m). Shares in the group rose 4p to 175p after it said the deal, funded from existing cash reserves, would give it access to a market worth about Dollars 200m and would make a modest contribution to earnings next year. The move follows three months of talks with the Pennsylvania-based company, which only received approval for the US food and drug administration earlier this year to manufacture enflurane and isoflurane ,two of the most widely-used inhaled anaesthetics. It takes the total invested by Medeva in the past four years beyond Pounds 300m, and Mr Bill Bogie, chief executive, said the company was well on course to meet its target of doubling its market capitalisation to about Pounds 1bn in the medium term. Although Inhalon has yet to begin full-scale production and make any sales, Mr Bogie rejected suggestions that Medeva may have overpaid for a company which made losses of Dollars 2.3m in the year to June 30. 'The potential is enormous. There are only two other major players in the US  -Abbot and BOC - so getting into the market is very important for us.' Inhalon's products will be marketed and distributed by International Medication Systems, the US hospital product manufacturer and distributor, which Medeva acquired for Dollars 28.6m in 1992. 'By selling Inhalon's products through IMS's specialist hospital salesforce we can achieve significant operating benefits,' Mr Bogie added. Medeva also hopes to establish a niche presence in the anaesthetic market and use Inhalon's technology in overseas markets. The company is paying an initial Dollars 35m for Inhalon with further tranches of Dollars 10m and Dollars 9m payable in 1995 and 1996 depending on its production performance.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Meltdown' opera proves a damp squib The festive catch-all on the South Bank, 'Meltdown', ends this weekend. It seems to have been designed to entice that notional young-middle audience which has not really got into 'classical' music but warms easily to post-minimalism, to very loud, rhythmic, anarchical stuff, to highbrow raids on jazz and pop, to ethnic imports, to current 'performance' theatre and to films that incorporate any of those (the National Film Theatre is participating). I suspect that this omnivorous audience is a fiction, though there are sub-audiences aplenty for each of those fashions - and there are people who will try almost anything new-ish, especially in a balmy summer. But I guess too that the imagined eclectic omnivores reflect a wistful South Bank hope: if anything creditably new is going to turn up in these directionless times, it should surface amid the (mild) ferment of trends which actually draw non-classical audiences. Who knows? - Nicholas Snowman and his modernist South Bank crew might even be right about that. On Wednesday, however, a much-hyped Meltdown event proved a damp, grisly squib. That was Martin Butler's 'operatic adventure story' Craig's Progress, to a libretto by Stephen Pruslin. Butler's original idea was to make something operatic out of 'American comic-book narrative and design of the 1930s to '50s', and especially a disoriented Superman-figure (Craig) from now. As 'developed' by Pruslin  - a sometime associate, pianist and amanuensis for Maxwell Davies and Birtwistle - the idea founders in an inconsequent mess. Craig, the comic-book hero, undergoes 'adventures' which are too silly to be funny, and too elaborate by far to be staged on the tiny budget available. The high-flown synopsis in the programme barely connected with the naff Playschool antics on view. The words, when audible, were embarrassing, the would-be jokes worse, the action regularly crippled by empty verbal games. One felt acutely for the five pleasant, hard-working Mecklenburgh Opera singers, who will not wish to be remembered for this show. Butler is a skilful composer of incidental music. His score for Craig's Progress is largely incidental, and unremittingly bland. It uses ten winds to no imaginative purpose, with a pair of piano-duettists tinkling away to distraction: it was like continually bumping one's head against wind-chimes. There was a woeful absence of pace. The Epilogue, obviously inspired by Stravinsky's for The Rake's Progress, withered and died at the comparison. Falling between so many stools at once is an astonishing feat; Stravinsky himself remarked that between stools is sometimes the best place to be - but he hadn't heard Craig's Progress.</p>

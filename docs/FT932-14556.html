			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Tinker, tailor, playwright, spy - and victim - Christopher Marlowe's double life seemed bound to lead to a sticky end / Review of three imaginative scenarios A DEAD MAN IN DEPTFORD by Anthony Burgess Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 272 pages CHRISTOPHERUS, or Tom Kidd's Revenge by Robin Chapman Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 393 pages THE SLICING EDGE OF DEATH by Judith Cook Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 234 pages WRITING PLAYS and spying on the enemies of your country appear to be occupations that combine happily. During the first world war Somerset Maugham, based in Switzerland, was turning out brittle marital comedies for the London stage with one hand while sending back to Whitehall secret reports on the activities of German agents in Lausanne with the other. In leading this double-life Maugham was following in the illustrious footsteps of a British playwright who appears a few paragraphs higher (above Marston and Massinger) in the theatrical dictionaries: Christopher Marlowe. In Marlowe's period the threat to the security and sovereignty of England came not from Germany but from Spain. The Armada had been turned back, the King of Spain's beard well and truly singed in 1588, but that had not removed fears of a Spanish-led Catholic takeover, and these fears were exacerbated following the execution of Mary Queen of Scots by the prospect of an influx of Scottish Catholics under the banner of the new King, her son, from over the border. No one was more concerned about this than Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster-in-chief, who stood at the centre of an intricate spider's web of intelligence activity spreading into Scotland and over the Channel into France. Around the time of the Armada Marlowe had put himself sensationally on the theatrical map with Tamburlaine, parts one and two, performed by the Admiral's Men with Edward Alleyn in the title-role. The brilliant young playwright, son of a Canterbury shoemaker, seems in retrospect like a glittering dragon-fly caught in the espionage web and ultimately destroyed by it. As were later spies, Marlowe was recruited while still an undergraduate at Cambridge University. He interrupted his degree course to go on a mission to Rheims where he infiltrated the ranks of Catholic priests disguised as Huguenot refugees on their way to England. Back in London he put the finger on them and they were summarily executed. After Tamburlaine Marlowe had several more smash-hits to write - The Jew of Malta, Edward II, Dr Faustus - but in spite of being the most successful dramatist of his day, the long arm of the Service refused to let him be. Was Marlowe about to embark on some secret mission when he died suddenly as the result of a tavern brawl in the busy port of Deptford? It was a nerve-centre in those days of two-way traffic to and from the continent and it seems unlikely that Marlowe went there on a lunch date just for fun. Speculation about the causes of his sticky end in Deptford has been rife, with dozens of books aiming to solve the mystery. But with the 400th anniversary of Marlowe's death on May 30 1593 coming up soon, the trickle has become a torrent. Marlowe-mania is currently sweeping the bookshops and theatres. These three novels all cover exactly the same ground, spinning yards of fluent fantasy from the few scanty facts and documents. They each come to a different solution to the problem, and so does the play on the same theme, The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, now at the Barbican's Pit theatre. The salient point on which all the authors agree is that Marlowe's death was not the fortuitous event that the inquest implied. They all detect the hand of the Service as being implicated, either directly or indirectly. It was Leslie Hotson, an indefatigable American literary sleuth, who unearthed the findings of the official inquest on Marlowe's death. To fuel our suspicions, it was conducted not by the regular coroner but by one directly responsible to the Crown. 'In the event' says Judith Cook 'the official version raised more questions than answers . . . ' It is the version presented in Cook's novel, The Slicing Edge of Death (published on May 27) that I would advise anyone new to the game to read first. It deals with all the main points in by far the clearest and most comprehensible manner while stating in an Author's note at the end exactly what is invention and what is derived from historical evidence. Cook roots her exciting, readable novel firmly in the world of the playhouses and she highlights the rivalry between Henslowe's company, to which Marlowe was attached, and that of Richard Burbage, soon to be the Chamberlain's Men, where 'the upstart crow' from Stratford was beginning to make a name for himself. Hamlet had not yet been written. In the little scene often cut in performance where Polonius sends a pair of agents to Paris to spy on Laertes and report back to him, as well as in the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, we can see how strongly intelligence-gathering and its perils pressed upon the minds of the Elizabethans. But if the Hamlet we know had not yet come into existence when Marlowe died, there may well have been an earlier version floating around by Thomas Kyd on which Shakespeare's play was based. The unfortunate Kyd is given centre stage in Christopherus, or Tom Kyd's Revenge by Robin Chapman. One of the few alleged facts known about him is that he had the misfortune to harbour among his papers a rough draft of a blasphemous paper by Marlowe intended for Sir Walter Raleigh's putative School of Night (a kind of Elizabethan version of the Cambridge Apostles) which was discovered by the authorities when his lodgings were raided. Kyd was arrested and after being tortured signed a confession denouncing his former friend Marlowe as an atheist. Kyd emerges as a tragic figure with whom Chapman identifies movingly. He focuses on him in the period after his release when Kyd is attempting to rehabilitate himself and come to terms with his betrayal of his friend. This long wayward book is not for the squeamish but it is full of many fine imaginative flights concerning the principal figures in Marlowe's life: his patron Thomas Walsingham (cousin of Francis), Baines and Poley the duplicitous false friends, Nick Skeres and Ingram Frizer, the hired thugs (the latter twisted the knife on that fatal afternoon). Chapman makes it all seem very complicated in terms of these individuals' motivations. But no doubt, if we could know the truth, it was. They all re-appear in A Dead Man in Deptford. Anthony Burgess, that maestro of the mother tongue, has his own way of dealing with history, as a kind of musical fugue in which certain motifs constantly recur - drunkenness, blood-letting, whoring - and this novel is a typical Burgess performance. The homosexual side of Marlowe's relations with his patron and his performers is thoroughly exploited. Marlowe becomes a brash camp Elizabethan Guy Burgess, strutting and preening his hour upon the stage. The nauseating stench of the stews of a London infested by Plague comes across pungently. The people of this period loved to play with words as if they were notes in music and so does Burgess. In some ways he is closest to them emotionally, but once again he has not given us an easy read.</p>

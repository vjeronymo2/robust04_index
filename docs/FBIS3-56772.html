The Russian and American representatives drew the attention  of world public opinion to an important item of the Moscow  declaration, signed by the Presidents of Russia and the United  States, in which they have reaffirmed their support to the  United Nations Organisation and called for joint efforts to  strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping role. Vorontsov and Albright  stated in part:    "Both presidents have stressed the need to strengthen the  U.N. ability to keep the peace and prevent conflicts. They made  it incumbent on our two governments to work jointly in order to  improve the mechanism in this sphere. We express mutual  satisfaction, and this is particularly important, that our two  presidents have called for a Security Council meeting at summit  level to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.    "It is clear that by making this statement, both Russia and  the United States thereby recognise and prize the central role  played by the United Nations, particularly, the U.N.  peacekeeping operations and efforts to safeguard international  peace and security in this increasingly chaotic and unstable  world."    The Russian and American representatives also stated that  they would cooperate closely in the effort to ensure the success  of the U.N. Security Council meeting at summit level, proposed  by the Presidents of Russia and the United States.</p>

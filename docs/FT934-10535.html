			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Alcazar hangs on choice of American partner: Paul Betts explains the last stages of the European airline merger MERGER negotiations between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and Austrian Airlines are expected to enter a decisive stage this weekend. Although no deadline has been set, the four carriers are hoping to resolve the last significant issue threatening their four airline co-operation project called Alcazar. This involves the choice of a US airline partner for the Alcazar group. Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, yesterday said a breakthrough could be achieved during talks in Stockholm at the end of this week. However, Mr Jan Carlzon, the former SAS president who stepped down last month to devote all his efforts to the Alcazar project, also warned yesterday he would leave SAS if the co-operation talks were to fail, in remarks clearly designed to accelerate negotiations. Mr Carlzon said the choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large question that can still endanger Alcazar'. The problem has been made all the more difficult because three of the European carriers already have close links with different US airlines: KLM with Northwest Airlines, Swissair with Delta Air Lines, and SAS with Continental Airlines. But sources close to the negotiations said yesterday it would be 'tragic' if the US airline issue were to lead to a collapse of the proposed partnership to form a fourth airline force in Europe, designed to compete against the big three carriers - British Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France. They emphasised that the Alcazar airlines had reached broad agreement on several difficult issues including the valuation of assets, headquarter location for the new joint company and the constitution of a joint management structure. The four carriers have also identified more than Dollars 1bn in synergy benefits. Co-operation in European operations is understood to account for most of the gains with the US partner only playing a relatively minor role, according to sources close to the Alcazar partnership. Although the four airlines claimed there was no specific deadline to reach an agreement, they all privately agree that the talks cannot drag on indefinitely. 'The weekend talks are likely to be determinative. The question is how long can you spend evaluating just one last issue,' explained one source familiar with the negotiations. Another airline official conceded that the four carriers had perhaps underestimated the complexity of negotiating the four-airline alliance six months ago. 'After all, there has never been a transaction like this one negotiated in Europe before, involving six governments (the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway), and six quoted companies, since SAS is quoted separately in the three Scandinavian countries,' he said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A delegation of the Croatian parliament, led by  deputy speaker Zarko Domljan, is to take part today in the  proceedings of the parliamentary session of the Council of  Europe. The situation in the former Yugoslavia will be  discussed on the basis of the introductory speech by Thorvald  Stoltenberg, one of the cochairmen of the Geneva conference.    The office of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of  Europe yesterday made a decision to freeze Croatia's current  status until further notice. This means that the decision to  remove its status as a special guest was not implemented, but  also that the procedure to receive Croatia as a full member of  the Council of Europe has been suspended.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic warned at the European  Parliament in Strasbourg of negative consequences of a possible  withdrawal of the UN units from Bosnia-Herzegovina and demanded  a wider mandate for the world organization's forces in  establishing peace. We support all decisions of the NATO  alliance and humanitarian activities by the United Nations,  Granic said and added that Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina upholds  humanitarian activities.    Granic stressed that there are no units of the Republic of  Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that there are volunteers  within the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], underlining that  there are volunteers from many European countries in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian foreign minister expressed support for the  continuation of the peace negotiations in Geneva, where pressure  should be intensified on the parties in the negotiations to sign  a peace agreement.</p>

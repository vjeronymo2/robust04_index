			<p>BFN     [Text] During the two days of negotiations the Ukrainian  and Russian delegations have never reached a mutually agreed  decision on the Black Sea Fleet. After the consultations of the  heads of the Ukrainian and Russian Governments with Ukraine's  President Leonid Kravchuk, the first variant of a joint document  appeared under a conventional title agreement between the  governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the first  stage of settling the Black Sea Fleet issues. It is unclear as  yet what the second, the third, and the subsequent stages will  be, and how many stages at all are to follow.    Experts worked up this agreement. However, none of the sides  was satisfied with the last variant, despite the fact that the  delegations were trying to find a compromise solution.    According to Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy  Shmarov,  the stands have been brought closer to each other. However,  there are key points that we failed to solve. Only mutual  respect for the laws of both countries can lead to a concrete  result, he pointed out.    Sevastopol became a stumbling block. The Russian side refers  to it in the document as the main base of the Russian Black Sea  Fleet, claiming its right to the whole city, where there will be  no place for Ukrainian sailors and ships.    Ukraine is ready to grant Russia the base in Sevastopol; but  it does not agree to give up the whole city for the base.  Besides, as Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy  said, Russia insists that the entire shore-based infrastructure  should be passed to it, something Ukraine cannot agree to, which  is only natural.    Unexpected for the Ukrainian side was also the solution of  the issue on dividing the ships that came up at the previous  meeting in Sevastopol. This has been reported by Colonel  General Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian deputy defense minister. The  Russians declared that Ukraine had already received a certain  part of the ships apportioned to it, proceeding at this point  from the very understated data on the current quantitative  composition of the Black Sea Fleet. With such an apportioning  offered by Russia, Ukraine will receive only a minimum of the  ships and will be deprived of the entire shore-based  infrastructure. In the end, it will cease to be the master of  its own land.    Despite a number of nonessential differences, the  delegations  again took their seats at the negotiating table today.</p>

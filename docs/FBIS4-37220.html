			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar,  professor at Gaza's Islamic University and a Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] sympathizer, has explained the rules that  will govern the movement's actions in the coming stage, that is  when the National Palestinian Authority assumes power in Gaza  and Jericho.    Al-Zahhar, a leader of the former Palestinian deportees in  Marj al-Zuhur in south Lebanon, said that the rules pertain  first to Hamas' relationship with the Palestinian Authority and  secondly with the Israeli occupation the status of which, as he  put it, "has not changed."    In remarks to MENA's correspondent in Gaza, al-Zahhar said  relations with the new Palestinian Authority are governed by  several rules. First of all, there will be no infighting, but  Hamas opposes curtailing the privileges of any Palestinian  faction, especially those who made the intifadah bear fruit  through their efforts, blood, and years in jail or exile.    Al-Zahhar continued: "We are not seeking power. I do not  expect Hamas to vie for power because if it had really wanted  power, it would have joined the plan from the beginning and  acquired a respectable number of posts."    Asked whether Hamas will participate in the coming  Palestinian elections, Dr. al-Zahhar said: "We will not  participate in the Autonomy Authority at all. As we have always  done, our participation will be through student councils, local  councils, and professional associations. This will be our  natural service to the Palestinian citizens."    Al-Zahhar concluded his remarks by declaring that Hamas will  not lay down its arms until all Palestinian soil [kamil al-turab  al-filastini] is liberated from the occupation and, as he put  it, from the occupation's supporters.</p>

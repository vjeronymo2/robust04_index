			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hilton and Ewart combine to build 5-star Belfast hotel The Northern Ireland economy was given a boost yesterday with the announcement of a Pounds 17m development to build a Hilton Hotel in Belfast. Hilton International, the hotel subsidiary of Ladbroke Group, has set up a joint venture with Ewart, the Belfast-based property developer, to develop the hotel. Mr Paul McWilliams, chairman of Ewart, said they had been in talks on the development for many months. 'Everybody is now taking credit for having great foresight.' He added that following the IRA ceasefire the move was a tremendous boost for the province. 'We are all hopeful that it will be the start of a better future.' The building of the hotel, the first five star in Northern Ireland, is being financed by Pounds 6m of share capital, 60 per cent from Hilton, with the balance provided by grants and short term loans. The hotel is being built in the Ewart's Laganbank development, valued at about Pounds 100m. The company is about to announce a 450,000 sq ft office block which will almost complete the development. Ewart's shares rose 1p to 70p.</p>

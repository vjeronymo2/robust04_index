			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: New closing peak for Footsie Index THE LONDON stock market celebrated the closure of Wall Street for Thanksgiving Day by gaining more than 32 points yesterday to reach a new closing peak of 2,741.8, less than three points under the trading peak also established in the middle of May this year. The advance reflected the better news on the US economy reported this week as well as hopes that a settlement of the GATT dispute will be confirmed in spite of bitter resistance by French farmers. The absence of New York trading was also reflected in foreign exchange markets, although the impending hike in Irish interest rates to 100 per cent indicated the continuing uncertainties in this area. The FT-SE Index opened nervously but was soon encouraged by firmness in stock index futures, where the absence of a recent US seller proved enough to push the December contract ahead. From mid-morning, the market moved forward steadily and the final reading on the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 32.2 on the day. On May 11, the Footsie touched 2,744.5 before closing at 2,737.8. Trading volume increased to 598. m shares yesterday, boosted by renewed buying of equities ahead of the closure today of the two-week trading account. The account has brought significant profits in share prices but traders noted that there was little inclination to take profits yesterday. On Wednesday, Seaq turnover of 522.1m shares was worth Pounds 1.13bn in terms of customer business. Dealers suggested that yesterday's upswing in London was helped by the absence of Wall Street but also assumed that the New York market, which had gained 17.56 Dow points overnight, will return strongly from its one-day holiday closure. The international blue chips moved up sharply, benefiting both from the absence of any US selling and also from hopes of transatlantic support when Wall Street gets back to work. The weak spot was ICI, still restrained by the bearish views on the prospective demerger plans which have been expressed by London brokerage houses over the past week. However, gains in oil shares on hints of progress at the Opec talks were not taken too seriously in the stock market against the backcloth of oil price uncertainty. Leading store and retail sectors advanced in spite of doubts cast over hopes for further cuts in UK base rates by the rise in German money supply disclosed this week. The absence of any move in policy at yesterday's Bundesbank meeting was no surprise. Traders sounded pleased with yesterday's advance in UK equities, the first genuine upturn of the week, but admitted that much will depend on whether the New York market opens higher today. On the domestic front, evidence of the economic recession is only too clear on every side. One strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities house, pinpointed the UK unemployment levels as the the key factor for any recovery in the domestic economy. Higher employment would help boost consumer confidence and also act as a favourable indicator for the industrial and commercial property sector, which is still weighed down by the overhang of office properties in London and other business centres.</p>

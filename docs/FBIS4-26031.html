			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential  Council member, met yesterday in Beijing with Chinese Vice  President Rong Yiren. He gave him a message from Brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential  Council chairman, to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The message  concerns ties between our country and the PRC as well as the  latest developments in our country.    The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that during the  meeting, Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential  Council member, briefed the Chinese vice president, and through  him the Chinese leadership, on the events and the bloody battles  imposed on our people by the forces of apostasy and secession,  which have violated the will of the people and dealt a  treacherous blow to their aspirations and great achievements.    Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that Yemen  rejects any attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs. He  also underlined the need to respect the political aspirations of  the Yemeni people in unity, democracy, and progress.    The brother Presidential Council member voiced the  appreciation of Yemen -- both people and government -- for the  attitude displayed by the Chinese Government in the  international forums in support of the Yemeni people's  aspirations, unity, and democratic march.    For his part, the Chinese vice president welcomed Brother  'Abd- al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani. He reviewed the ties between the  Yemeni and Chinese peoples and stressed the need to continue and  improve cooperation in all fields. He also said he regrets what  is going on in Yemen and said he hopes problems will be resolved  through dialogue. He asked the Presidential Council member to  convey his and the Chinese president's greetings to the Yemeni  leadership and people.    In a related development, a lengthy meeting was held between  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, and  Qian Qichen, China's vice premier and foreign minister.    The brother Presidential Council member reviewed all  developments in our country and shed light on all attitudes and  attempts by our country's political leadership under Brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential  Council chairman, to resolve the political crisis. That crisis  started in 19 August 1993 and escalated since then according to  a planned scheme by the gang of apostasy and secession, starting  with the seclusion [of Ali Salim al-Bid] and the political  maneuvers, and ending with the ill-omened declaration of  secession, which directed a stab to the will of our people and  their national principles.    He also stressed that all legitimate constitutional  institutions are keen to start the dialogue within the framework  of the national constants, particularly unity, democracy, and  respect for constitutional legitimacy and its institutions. He  explained that the political leadership has responded favorably  to all the good initiatives by the brothers and friends. He  stressed that Yemen abides by UN Security Council Resolution 924  on the situation in our country and supports all the efforts  seeking to help resolve problems within the framework of the  national constants, respect for the principle of noninterference  in domestic affairs, and the protection of Yemen's sovereignty  and unity.    The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister voiced his  appreciation for the clarifications made by 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al- Ghani, Presidential Council member. He said China was  among the first states to support Yemeni unity when it was  established in 1990 since Yemen, a country with a great history  and an old civilization, has always been a united country. He  regretted the fighting in Yemen and wished Yemen, a friend of  China, unity, prosperity, stability, and progress. He  underlined his country's position, which supports the solution  of crises through peaceful dialogue and noninterference in the  others' affairs since this is one of the most important  principles on which international relations are based.    The two meetings were attended by Brother Ghalib Sa'id  al-Abukhi, our ambassador in Beijing.    'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member,  received at his place of residence in the Guest House in Beijing  the brother Arab ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions,  as well as the Arab League representative. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani gave a comprehensive review of the developments in  our country. He also answered the ambassadors' questions. They  all wished Yemen stability and prosperity under the canopy of  its unity, which is considered a gain for all citizens of the  Arab and Muslim nations.</p>

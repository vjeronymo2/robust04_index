			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Murayama under fire over prices Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime minister, faced mounting public criticism yesterday over his government's decision to end a price freeze on public sector services at the beginning of next year. The move overturns a decision in May by the previous government of Mr Tsutomu Hata to delay increases in public charges, ranging from telephone bills to motorway tolls, for fear of harming economic recovery. The Liberal Democratic party, then in opposition, strongly resisted such a move. Apart from an adverse impact on the economy, the price rises have been condemned as supporting multi-layered bureaucracy. Public service operators, including the Japan Highway Public Corporation, have been accused of creating numerous affiliating groups to accommodate retiring bureaucrats. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, criticised yesterday's decision as a step back in Japan's move to reform its politics and industry. To reduce the mounting public ire, cabinet members attached conditions to the price rises, including rationalisation and cost reduction programmes by companies and public service organisations. Meanwhile, workers' union groups, long supporters of the Social Democratic party, revealed yesterday that they were ready to drop their endorsement if the SDP goes into the next election together with the LDP.</p>

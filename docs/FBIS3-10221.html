			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] President Aristide intervened  this morning before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.  During a news conference following the meeting, he opposed the  pilot study for a resolution that is currently under discussion  in the Security Council.    As I see it, he said, it is a bad project, adding that he  discussed the project on 1 March in Paris with the head of  French diplomacy Alain Juppe and with President Francois  Mitterrand. I came out totally satisfied with those talks, said  President Aristide.    In its current form, according to informed sources, the  pilot  study to the Security Council for a resolution does not provide  a date for the return to Port-au-Prince of President Aristide  and will make the imposition of new sanctions depend on an  active search for a settlement by President Aristide.    On Saturday [5 March], Aristide is due to go to New York,  where he will hold talks with UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali. He indicated that he is expecting from the  secretary general specifications on the points the secretary  intends to discuss in the interview. Aristide added that he  would promote discussions of Haiti in the Security Council.    President Aristide continues to insist that General Cedras'  resignation precede the nomination of a prime minister in  Port-au-Prince. He did his best to minimize his divergences with  the United States, which are the source of the resolution now  being studied. During his news conference this morning, Father  Aristide stated that the United States and France were playing a  positive role in enforcing the return of democracy in Haiti. He  also stated that he was totally satisfied with the talk that he  held a few days ago with U.S. ambassador to the Vatican Raymond  Flynn, but he recognizes that Washington sometimes speaks with  forked tongue.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Greenalls cautious despite 10% rise GREENALLS GROUP, the pubs and hotels operator, lifted interim profits by 10 per cent but said it was still waiting for 'tangible evidence of a real recovery that will be sustained.' Though economic indicators were showing signs of an upturn, the trading background remained challenging, said Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive. 'Trading in the hotel sector generally has not improved and although occupancy is increasing, room rates remain under pressure throughout the industry.' Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 26 moved ahead from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 25.7m - below market forecasts; the shares lost 13p to 414p. Operating profits of the group's pubs rose 7.7 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Drink sales were 4.4 per cent higher and food sales rose 20 per cent. Spending on acquisitions and refurbishment totalled Pounds 11m in the first half and expenditure of Pounds 27m is planned during the rest of the year. The 109 Premier House branded pub restaurants and lodges lifted operating profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 3.45m, helped by growth of 44 per cent in accommodation income and 34 per cent in food sales. Spending on acquisitions and development in the first half totalled Pounds 9m and a further Pounds 16m will be spent this year. De Vere hotels maintained profits at Pounds 6.1m. Occupancy rose from 53 per cent to 62 per cent but achieved room rates fell 12 per cent to Pounds 44. The group will open a new four-star hotel, Oulton Hall, near Leeds, shortly. 'Overall, we look forward in the second half to stable trading conditions,' Mr Thomas said. Off-licence operating profits improved from Pounds 1.81m to to Pounds 2.31m, reflecting a full contribution from the Blayneys chain, acquired last year. In contrast, drinks and services operating profit fell 26 per cent to Pounds 2.53m, mainly due to depressed volumes and a decline in contract packaging in the soft drinks market. Manufacture and distribution of Del Monte products will begin later this year. Gin and vodka production was 15.4 per cent higher and increased volumes of own-label products helped raise the group's share of the UK white spirits market to 12.9 per cent. The interim dividend goes up from 4.84p to 5.08p, payable from fully diluted earnings per share of 11.12p (10.65p).</p>

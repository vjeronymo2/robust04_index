			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Sperskiy report: "Chile's Army Equipped With </F> Russian Planes?"]    [Text] Chilean Air Force Brigadier General Gonzalo  Miranda, commander of the Santiago air force district, was in  Russia for a working visit. He was received by Colonel General  Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Federation Air  Force. The Chilean guest visited the Gagarin cosmonaut training  center located in Zvezdnyy Gorodok. There he looked at the  simulators used by cosmonauts preparing for their flight, and  had a discussion with Lieutenant General Petr Klimuk, chief of  the center.    Gen. Gonzalo Miranda confirmed that the possibility of  purchasing Russian-made war planes, which are to replace the  obsolete British planes, is currently being studied. But the  final solution of the question and setting aside of the required  funds for purchasing is up to the Chilean Government. Gen.  Gonzalo Miranda was rather optimistic about prospects for  Chile-Russia cooperation in the sphere of outer space. He  pointed out that in our day and age there are actual  possibilities for developing joint projects and their  implementation in the interests of both countries.</p>

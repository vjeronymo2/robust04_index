Vardzelashvili from Tbilisi] </F>   [Text] The reaction in political circles and among the  population in Georgia to Boris Yeltsin's visit to the republic  is not unequivocal. However, most politicians and inhabitants  of Georgia assess positively the signing of the bilateral treaty  with Russia.    The Department for Sociological Studies at the Georgian  Academy of Sciences and also leading republic's newspapers have  published the results of the sociological poll of the population  following the Russian president's visit to Georgia.    According to the poll results, 67 percent of respondents  assess positively the normalization of Russian-Georgian  relations; 10 percent of those polled view the visit by the  Russian delegation negatively. As for the rest, they find it  difficult to define their position.    At the same time, 90 percent of respondents believe the  establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia is in  Georgia's state interests.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / State ultimatum for Air France and SNCF MR Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, yesterday warned that Air France and the SNCF rail group, two of France's largest public sector companies, should reduce their reliance on government support. His warning reflects the new tough stance of France's new centre-right government towards the public sector signalled earlier this week by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister. He announced that state companies could no longer depend on the government to bale them out financially and to protect them from international investors. Mr Bosson continued this theme by warning that Air France was in such difficulty that 'the very existence of the company is at stake'. He said the airline should accelerate its restructuring programme and would have to 'rely on itself'.</p>

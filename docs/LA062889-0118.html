			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIRECTOR DEFENDS DFG RECORD OF MANAGEMENT AT COMMISSION HEARING  </P> <P> Director Pete Bontadelli's Dept. of Fish and Game sailed through a six-hour  hearing before the Little Hoover Commission Tuesday, but the Fish and Game  Commission seemed to be in trouble.  </P> <P> The Little Hoover Commission, which is investigating how well California's  natural resources are managed, was far more impressed by Bontadelli than it was  with FGC President Bob Bryant, whose group oversees the DFG.  </P> <P> This was the second of two hearings; the first was last May in Los Angeles.  Representatives of developers, conservationists and sports enthusiasts  testified.  </P> <P> After the testimony, at least one Hoover commissioner questioned whether the  Fish and Game Commission was needed.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure," said commissioner Albert Gersten of Los Angeles, after a tough  grilling of Bryant. "That commission is totally subservient to this department.  </P> <P> "You say to yourself, if I can save $429,000 (the commission's annual budget)  by not having a commission, maybe I'm better off having more manpower in this  department."  </P> <P> However, when the Hoover commission releases its conclusions and  recommendations to the California legislature in the next three to six months,  it probably will suggest restructuring, not abolishing, the commission, which  commissioners characterized as little more than a "rubber stamp" for the DFG.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't mind if they worked harder," Gersten said. "Clearly, this (Bryant)  is a fine man that came up. But the equation I get from the commission is that  they're as close to a rubber stamp as they can get."  </P> <P> When there is a conflict in policy, Gersten added, "They say, 'We'll work it  out.' Sure, the commission will cave in every time."  </P> <P> The Fish and Game Commission is a group of five citizens appointed by the  governor to alternating six-year terms for the purpose of setting policy, which  the department administers. The Hoover panel seemed to be left with the  impression that the FGC does little more than issue hunting and fishing  regulations.  </P> <P> Bryant, 60, a farmer from Yuba City, Calif., argued that his commission was  effective, but he was not as convincing in defending his group as Bontadelli  was in defending the DFG.  </P> <P> Bontadelli, 41, is a glib administrator who has been a legislative aide or DFG  deputy for 17 years.  </P> <P> During his testimony, Bryant, sat next to Harold Cribbs, the FGC's executive  secretary, who often prompted Bryant's replies by whispering in his ear -- or  simply answered for him.  </P> <P> Once, Gersten said to Cribbs, "Would you like to answer? I see you whispering.  I wouldn't mind Mr. Bryant answering these questions. He's the witness."  </P> <P> Doris Allen (R-Cypress), a state assemblywoman who has been an adversary of the  DFG for five years, said later, "Mr. Bryant looked intimidated to me. He really  didn't respond well. It's too bad, because he does know (the subject)."  </P> <P> Bryant testified: "(In) almost every decision made by the commission, some  member has gone out (in the field) to see what's going on. We don't take the  word of the department all the time. We keep asking questions until we get good  answers."  </P> <P> Cribbs: "The commission is not a rubber stamp for the department."  </P> <P> Gersten said: "I find it distressing to have the president of the commission  come up here and defer everything to the executive secretary."  </P> <P> Bryant: "Well, Mr. Cribbs deals with it every day."  </P> <P> Gersten: "Maybe you should."  </P> <P> Richard Spotts of the Defenders of Wildlife, said that by proposing a mountain  lion hunt two years ago, the commission demonstrated "it was out of step with  the feeling of most Californians."  </P> <P> Dr. Peter Moyle, a professor of fisheries at UC Davis, said of the FGC: "As a  policy-making body, it's way behind the times."  </P> <P> However, they and other witnesses -- Mickey Bernstein of the California  Wildlife Federation, Jim Crenshaw, representing the United Anglers of  California, and W.F. Grader of the Pacific Coast Federation of (commercial)  Fishermen's Associations, Inc. -- agreed that the department was doing a  satisfactory job, considering its limited funds and personnel and political  constraints.  </P> <P> Bontadelli testified for two hours.  </P> <P> "Our employees, if they err," he said, "tend to err on the side of protecting  the environment. . . . hunting and fishing license sales are decreasing at a  time when our problems are increasing."  </P> <P> At one point, Bontadelli said: "We function as a staff to the commission."  </P> <P> Gersten responded: "We keep going round and round about who's in charge."  </P> <P> Bontadelli also fended off a conflict-of-interest charge by the Waterfowlers  Against Baiting organization that DFG officials had been guests at one of the  controversial hunting clubs.  </P> <P> Hoover Commissioner Barbara Stone told Bontadelli: "At the end of the day, I'm  so sympathetic toward the department that I can't understand why anyone would  be so stupid as to become director."  </P> <P> Everyone laughed. Bontadelli smiled.  </P> <P> Bontadelli said afterward: "We do the best we can with what we've got, and I  personally believe the commission also tries to do its best."  </P> <P> Gersten: "I do think that Mr. Bontadelli is doing his best. I'm not sure I  would say the same thing about the commission."  </P></p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Quota plan halts coffee price slide COFFEE PRODUCERS did just enough at their meeting in London this week to halt the latest slide in world prices. But the market's response to their plan for export curbs, announced yesterday lunch-time, was far from euphoric. The July position at the London Futures and Options Exchange recovered from a morning low of Dollars 715 a tonne to end at Dollars 728 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day and down Dollars 4 on the week. The producer delegates, meeting under the auspices of the International Coffee Organisation, were painfully aware that failure to agree a unified stance to take to the first round of negotiations of a new International Coffee Agreement on June 22-26 was likely to unleash a fresh wave of speculative selling that might send prices back to the 22-year lows reached three weeks ago. So it is perhaps understandable that discussion of details was not allowed to obstruct the search for consensus at this week's talks. The resulting proposals envisage a global export quota of about 62m bags (60 kg each), some 10m bags below annual demand, incorporating selectivity between different types of coffee and shared out between producing countries on the basis of export performance in the free market that has operated since the collapse of the previous ICO quota scheme in July 1989. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, decribed these proposals as 'deliberately vague'. But he said it was apparent that the producers were in 'a very positive mood' and were aware of the need to put a transitional accord into operation as soon as possible to prevent a renewed slide in coffee prices. Some ICO delegates suggested that this 'transitional' arrangement - which would put the quota system into immediate operation, rather than waiting for full ratification of a new pact - could be up and running by the end of September. London traders felt that was rather optimistic, however, in view of the need for producers to work out operational details of their plan and sell it to the ICO's consuming country members. In particular, said Mr Eagles, they would have to satisfy the US, the biggest consumer, whose willingness to tolerate an agreement that would compromise its laissez-faire principles is based solely on its eagerness to support the war against the Colombian drug barons. The American administration is insisting on quota selectivity between four groups of coffees: Colombian milds, other milds, Brazilian and other arabicas and robusta's. The imbalance under the previous non-selective quota system between supplies of the more sought-after milds and arabicas and the coarser, mainly African-produced robusta types was one of the reasons for the collapse of the agreement. The cocoa market's woes continued meanwhile as talk of producer selling continued and users remained on the sidelines. A Pounds 4 decline yesterday took London's July futures quotation to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 541 a tonne, adding Pounds 15 to last week's Pounds 23 fall. At the London Metal Exchange attention remained focussed on the zinc market, which continued to be distorted by a squeeze on supplies available for nearby delivery - despite a further rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh record. Cash zinc ended the week Dollars 72.50 up at Dollars 1,442.50 a tonne, while the three months delivery position was unchanged at Dollars 1,284.50 a tonne; so the cash premium widened from Dollars 85.50 to Dollars 158. Aluminium prices suffered from the effects of the dollar's strength until Thursday, when the three months price appeared to be heading for a test of the bottom end of the Dollars 1,320-Dollars 1,330 a tonne support band. But yesterday a weaker dollar allowed light Far East buying to push the price up Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 1,328.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16.25 on the week. A 1,375-tonne fall in LME aluminium stocks was less than traders had been predicting and had little market impact. At the London International Petroleum Exchange dealers enjoyed a livelier time as North Sea oil prices broke through the Dollars 20 a tonne barrier for the first time in six months following the unexpected agreement by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna last week to roll over its 22.98 barrels a day second-quarter output ceiling. The July crude oil futures price gained nearly Dollars 1 a tonne when trading resumed on Tuesday, after the long weekend, and held steady for the rest of the week.  ------------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS      (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------ tonnes Aluminium   -1,375 to 1,238,125 Copper        -975 to   264,750 Lead           +50 to   136,700 Nickel        +402 to    27,792 Zinc        +8,575 to   265,525 Tin           +310 to    13,085  ------------------------------------</p>

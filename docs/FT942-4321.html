			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Curriculum proves vital for Woodhead Chris Woodhead is about to take on his second Herculean educational task in little over a year. John Patten, the education secretary, has nominated him for the post of HM Chief Inspector of Schools - arguably the second most powerful job in English education. The job will require Woodhead to run the Office of Standards in Education (Ofsted), a non-ministerial government department which has just started a controversial system for inspecting every state school at least once every four years, using lay inspectors. Although his appointment starts on September 1, he will not be able to give it his undiluted energy until he has finished his present job - slimming down the national curriculum for England and Wales. As chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, it has fallen to Woodhead to carry out the review which has been headed in masterful style by Sir Ron Dearing. The task of getting large groups of academics to agree on lopping a fifth of the content from the curriculum was never going to be easy, and some teachers on SCAA's working groups - particularly in English and History - have publicly dissented from final proposals. They claim that the authority's officials had dominated the process. However, the review has been completed according to timetable, and ministers are happy with the way the task has been handled - as Woodhead's appointment demonstrates. Woodhead's promotion is the latest in a startling series. A graduate of Bristol and Keele, he taught English in secondary schools before moving into local government in 1982 - not usually a springboard for advancement in central government circles. As recently as 1990, he was deputy chief education officer for Cornwall County Council.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Samac, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- The main headquarters of  the Srpska republic's army [VRS] and the supreme command of the  VRS are attaching particular emphasis to the defense of Serb  Posavina [Serb-held northern corridor along the Sava river]  following Croat and Muslim threats announcing an all-out  offensive against this strategically important area, Manojlo  Milovanovic, the commander of VRS main headquarters, said today.    We have decided to concentrate our forces and defend the  part  of the Srpska republic between Brcko and Doboj, General  Milovanovic said. Accompanied by Major General Novica Simic he  was attending a celebration of the second anniversary of the  liberation of Samac.    After the Washington agreement and the establishment of a  truce at the border with the republic of Serb Krajina, the  Croatian Army deployed strong forces between Brod and Brcko,  Milovanovic said. The Muslim army is also bringing fresh units  to the front line between Gracanica and Brcko, with an objective  of breaking through the Serb defense and gaining access to the  Sava river, which we will not allow at any cost.    According to Milovanovic, last night the Croatian forces  opened heavy fire from their strongholds of Orasje and Zupanja  on the Serb positions and villages between Samac and Brcko.    We are now warning them that we will respond to any future  attacks with full force against military targets in the Republic  of Croatia, Milovanovic stressed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Minister of Transport,  Communications and Public Works Roman Hofbauer today declined to  comment on whether Slovakia would insist on Radio Free Europe  [RFE] ending its broadcasts January 31.    Last month Hofbauer decided to cancel a 1990 agreement  between RFE and Czechoslovakia which granted the station the  right to broadcast on a medium wavelength until 1996. As a  legal successor to Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic is bound  by the agreement.    Asked for a response to a U.S. State Department spokesman  who  said America hoped Slovakia would reverse its decision, Hofbauer  said he was unaware of any such statement.    Talks between Slovakia and RFE on continuing broadcasts,  possibly on a shortwave frequency, are scheduled for January 20.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pechiney trims half-time deficit Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium and packaging group, yesterday announced a slight improvement in first-half results, narrowing net losses to FFr321m (Dollars 59.88m) compared with a deficit of FFr397m in the first six months of 1993. The company, which is slated for privatisation, forecast a marked improvement in second-half results on the back of a recovery in aluminium prices and increased contributions from other of its industrial activities. The results for the period included a fall in profits at Pechiney International, the packaging arm of the French group. Net profits fell to FFr314m from FFr439m in the first half of 1993.

Operating profits across principal sectors saw varying fortunes, falling to FFr890m from FFr905m in the packaging division, and rising to FFr214m from FFr195m in the turbine components activities. The aluminium businesses improved from a loss of FFr138m to a deficit of FFr45m, At Pechiney International, sales were largely stable at FFr17.7bn. Operating results were also in line with the first half of last year, recording a profit of FFr1.08bn in the first six months of 1994.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Labour finds way round the pickets - Campaign Diary Labour is unrepentant about barring party officials, MPs and candidates from the BBC during the strike-hit election coverage on Thursday. The decision, taken by acting leader Margaret Beckett, left BBC journalists trying to put the Labour viewpoint during studio discussions. A few made it on to the screens anyway - taking part in artificial press conferences attended only by BBC journalists. 'OK, it was a device, but it meant we didn't break the rules,' said an official.                          *      *      * Tony Blair's success in collecting the nominations of 136 Labour MPs caused some confusion among the Sunday newspapers, which were unsure how many Labour MPs there are, and how many sit in the shadow cabinet. The papers split equally between 268 and 269 MPs, but The Observer plumped for 21 shadow ministers, and The Independent for 19. In fact, there are 270 Labour MPs, with one Labour-held seat vacant following the death of John Smith. Two MPs - speaker Betty Boothroyd and deputy speaker Geoffrey Lofthouse - do not vote on party matters, leaving 268 free to nominate candidates. There are 18 elected members of the shadow cabinet, plus the leader and deputy leader, the chief whip, the leader and chief whip in the Lords - although neither peer has an automatic vote - and the party chairman if he is not already a member. That makes a potential total of 24. Since the leader's seat is vacant, and David Blunkett, the party chairman, sits as an elected member, the correct total is 22. But it falls to 20 if the two peers are excluded, or 19 if you exclude Blunkett, who has said he will take no part in the election to protect the neutrality of the chair. Why is nothing ever easy in the Labour party? Alec Kellaway, the Newham Liberal Democrat candidate who defected to Labour a day before last week's by-election, will forever be known at Westminster as Which Way Kellaway. But he has also made a lasting contribution to the political argot: Kellaway - one who flits from from party to party, usually embarrassing both.                          *      *      * Lots of politicians have problems with grammar. Margaret Thatcher, who had a habit of omitting definite and indefinite articles, was a particular offender. But John Prescott takes the biscuit, as anyone who heard his virtually incomprehensible speech on voting systems at last year's Labour conference will know. Reporters usually clean up Prescott's prose, as they did Thatcher's. But as the Labour leadership campaign gets under way, here is a sample of unedited Prescott talking during a BBC interview yesterday about the Beveridge Commission's 1944 definition of full employment as an unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent of the workforce: 'Two and a half million is the level that is set by the government on claimants. There is something like about 4 to 5m people available for work according to the ILO in Britain. Because we fiddle the figures we don't know. So if you ask me about the 2 1/2 per cent, 2 1/2 per cent of 2 1/2 m is a different kind of definition to that of 4 or 5m.' I don't know what it means either. Prescott added: 'There is no intelligent debate about these matters. I want to re-introduce intelligent debate.'                          *      *      * The City seems unsure whether to take the European elections seriously. Some currency and bond dealers remember with trepidation the millions of pounds made and lost after the Danish 'No' to the Maastricht treaty in June 1992, and the narrow French 'Yes' a few months later. Steve Hannah, head of research at Japanese investment bank IBJ International, points to the increased power of the European parliament, the implications of a poor showing for interest rates and the Tory leadership. But others think the City will greet the results with a yawn. David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'The apathetic attitude of the British electorate is likely to be reflected in the apathetic response of the markets.'</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cargill sheds its secretive image CARGILL, the Minnesota-based grain trading and commodity trading empire that ranks as the biggest privately-held company in the US, yesterday announced a 28 per cent rise to Dollars 450m in earnings for the year ended May, 1992. The publication of the profits, which marked the first time Cargill had done so in its 127-year history, is part of an attempt by the company to shed its secretive image. Cargill said cash-flow for the 12 months increased to just over Dollars 1bn from Dollars 885m in the 1990-91 period. The group's turnover for 1991-92, which was not disclosed, is believed to have been about Dollars 49bn. The company, which is majority controlled by the Cargill and MacMillan families, did not provide any breakdown of earnings or turnover. It is believed, however, that the grain trading business, which accounts for much of Cargill's revenues, was hurt by the slump in US farm exports. Cargill is estimated to handle about a quarter of total US grain exports. Cargill employs a workforce of more than 60,000 people in 54 countries and divides its operations into five main divisions. These are its grain and commodity trading; its industrial holdings in steel cutting, fertiliser production, salt mining and resin manufacture; its meat business; its agricultural operations in feed and seeds; and its food supply division.</p>

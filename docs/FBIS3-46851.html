			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rachel E. Khan] </F>   [Text] President Ramos yesterday moved to streamline the  bureaucracy by transferring 15 agencies and corporations under  government departments.    Following the cabinet workshop last Tuesday, the president  issued Executive Order No. 149, calling for the transfer of  regular agencies to mother departments for "better policy and  program coordination and integration and administrative  supervision." Moreover, he directed the affected agencies to  prepare within two months a Function, Rationalization and  Integration Program (FRlP) which will be assessed by the budget  and management secretary, who will in turn make a full report  and recommendation to the president.    Moreover, Mr. Ramos said that the FRIP should include the  streamlining and rationalization of the agency's functions,  programs, and activities; the policy integration and  rationalization plan for the departments affected by the  transfer, and, the significant refocusing, abolition, scaling  down or phasing out of functions, programs and activities, and  the corresponding shifts in structure and resource allocation.    The following agencies have been affected:    -- the National Statistical Coordination Board, to the  National Economic and Development Authority [NEDA];    -- the Commission on Filipino Language, to the Department  of Education, Culture and Sports;    -- the Philippine Center Management Board, to the  Department of Foreign Affairs;    -- the National Statistics Office to NEDA; and,    -- the Statistical Research and Training Center to NEDA.    Government-owned and controlled corporations transferred to  government departments include:    -- the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, to the  Department of Finance;    -- the Laguna Lake Development Authority, to the  Department of Environment and Natural Resources; and,    -- the Philippine Center for Economic Development, to the  University of the Philippines System.    On another note, the chief executive likewise ordered the  transfer of six agencies set to be abolished to departments for  the time being. These are:    -- the Economic Support Fund Secretariat, to the Department  of Public Works and Highways;    -- the Board of Liquidators, to the National Development  Corporation;    -- the Development Coordinating Council for Leyte and  Samar and the Kalinga Special Development Authority, to the  Department of National Defense;    -- the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority, to the  Presidential Commission on Good Government;    -- the Philippine Human Resources Development Center, to  the Presidential Management Staff; and,    -- the Philippine Gamefowl Commission, to the Games and  Amusements Board.</p>

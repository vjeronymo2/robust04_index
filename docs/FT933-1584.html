			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Technology: SAP learns to adapt to the world of client-server computing Of the handful of European software houses which have achieved success in international markets, two are German, SAP and Software AG. Both came to prominence in the 1980s. Both are also going through considerable cultural and technological changes as they adjust to new technologies and to ways of processing data prevalent in the 1990s. SAP's international success is based on its understanding that companies derive most value from integrated business software which obeys common standards throughout the organisation, where the definitions used by the back office in accounting are the same as the front office uses in selling. Its R/2 product for IBM mainframes proved especially popular with multinational corporations, who were able to instal the same system in each location, benefiting from consistent information descriptions, one-time data input and real-time working. Among SAP's customers are ICI, Esso, Mobil Oil and British Rail. Of the top 10 US corporations, eight use SAP software. Germany remains the company's main market, with 80 of the top 100 largest industrial companies as customers. If the company has a fault, it is a certain rigidity of approach, something it shares with Software AG. One analyst says: 'It is a very engineering-oriented company'. The change to client-server, open system designs, will not prove easy. R/3 was at first intended to replace R/2, but now both will be offered in parallel for the foreseeable future. According to the consultancy Ovum: 'At issue is the extent to which R/3 systems are capable of achieving the high volume performance of their ancestor R/2.' The US remains a critical market for SAP and it has doubled its staff there in the past 15 months to counter an earlier lack of marketing aggression. It has formed a number of alliances to help its cultural shift. Siemens Nixdorf is a reseller of SAP software and consultancy partners include Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Schitag Ernst &amp; Young. Last year, it announced a technological and marketing agreement with Software AG.</p>

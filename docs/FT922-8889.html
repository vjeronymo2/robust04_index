			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Midland complains to Bank over leak MIDLAND BANK has complained to the Bank of England that its business could be seriously damaged by the tactics being used by Lloyds Bank in its takeover battle for the UK clearer. However, the Bank is thought unlikely to intervene. It is anxious to remain strictly neutral in what is becoming an increasingly heated battle between two of the UK's top banks. Midland claims that Lloyds is raising fears that Chinese control of Hong Kong after 1997 could have a seriously damaging effect on the Midland bank business, should the rival bid from Hongkong Bank succeed. Midland's alarm follows the appearance in newspapers over the weekend of parts of an early draft of a submission by Lloyds to the Office of Fair Trading. Senior officials at Midland, including Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, are convinced that the leak was deliberate. 'Our concern is not so much with the tactic of leaking - which we are accustomed to from Lloyds - but the scurrilous nature of what they are leaking,' Midland Bank said last night. The leaks have stiffened the determination of Midland's board not to disclose confidential commercial information to Lloyds Bank which has already been supplied to Hongkong Bank. The issue will be considered by the Takeover Panel in the middle of this week. Midland argues that the two cases are quite different since Hongkong Bank has already put in its bid and is a 15 per cent shareholder, while Lloyds is a direct competitor. Last night Lloyds strongly denied that it had leaked any information to the press or that it was running a dirty campaign to destabilise Midland. 'We have apologised for the leak and it certainly didn't come from us, since it does us serious harm. We are at least as annoyed about it as Midland is,' a Lloyds spokesman said. Midland is understood to have been particularly upset by implications in the leaked material that it might need fresh capital after the merger. 'We are more strongly capitalised than Lloyds,' a Midland spokesman said. He accused Lloyds of skirting over UK competition issues by stressing in its draft submission the possible problems of Hongkong Bank after Hong Kong returns to China in 1997.</p>

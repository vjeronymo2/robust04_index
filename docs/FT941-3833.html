			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Serbs put new price on Bosnia peace Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Serbian republic in Bosnia, said yesterday that the region's Serbs would back a Washington peace plan - which already envisages creating a Bosnian-Croat and Moslem federation - if any Bosnian Serb territory could link up with Serbia proper. The preconditions, put forward in Belgrade yesterday, are aimed at expanding the proposed federation of Bosnia to a broader confederation encompassing Serbia and Montenegro. In effect, it would re-invent part of ex-Yugoslavia. Mr Koljevic was speaking after holding talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region. But western diplomats in Belgrade said any preconditions could undermine the Washington plan - which is due to be signed in the US on Friday - because Croats and Moslems would not accept any re-invention of the old Yugoslavia. Croatia's fight for independence was about breaking away from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. More importantly, UN and US diplomats in Vienna, who are hosting the Bosnian Croat/Moslem talks, said the viability of any Croat/Moslem federation would require Bosnian Serbs ceding control of land they hold in the republic to about 49 per cent. They already control about 70 per cent of the territory and show no signs of giving up any land. Mr Koljevic said it was 'difficult to believe that this (confederation) is a serious possibility because the other two sides have rejected any confederation with Yugoslavia'. Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, require consent from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and the Bosnian Serbs, for the federal plan for Bosnia. Without the full, and unconditional, consent of the Serbs the federation is meaningless because it will have no agreed boundaries between the federation and Serb-held territories in Bosnia. Mr Koljevic said the Bosnian Serbs were willing first to negotiate a peace agreement, but they would only attend talks 'under equal conditions', implying that sanctions on Serbia would have to be first lifted. A UN official said yesterday the US might be prepared to lift the sanctions if Mr Milosevic agreed to extend diplomatic recognition to Croatia. This would mean recognising the republic's borders, as well as disowning the Krajina Serbs, who have declared their autonomy in south-western Croatia.</p>

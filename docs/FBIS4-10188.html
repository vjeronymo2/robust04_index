			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cony Stipicic] </F>   [Text] The subject of the FBI in our country has become  nearly as untouchable as its detectives were years ago. The news  that Chile had asked the United States to open an FBI liaison  office in Chile caused considerable impact last year. The debate  extended to many sectors. Politicians, police, and government  officials spoke about the controversial subject. Some people  even qualified the initiative as interference in Chilean  domestic affairs. It is said that Washington was surprised by  this reaction and preferred not to touch the subject in public  in order not to continue creating a flurry.    The problem is that nowadays, no one or very few people know  what will happen with this initiative. Before leaving, the  Patricio Aylwin administration said everything was status quo  and opening a FBI office depended on the dedication of a new  U.S. Embassy building. The current administration has not made a  decision yet on the matter but everything indicates that it will  stay the same. That is, the FBI will come.    Neither Carabineros nor the Investigative Police have  coordinated meetings yet with the eventual "liaison" officers,  even though they will be work colleagues. Meanwhile, the U.S.  Embassy is totally silent on the subject. "There is nothing  new," is all they say. And when one tells the Embassy that we  are not asking for news but for the date when the new Embassy  building will be ready, all the Embassy answers is that it  probably will be ready by the middle of next year, without  further details.    Something more concrete, however, was learned. The FBI  already has assigned the "individual" who will work in the  office that will be opened in Santiago. It will be only one  agent. There will not be two, three, or four agents like it was  once said. Unofficially, it was revealed that the number of  agents interested in being transferred to Santiago was far  greater than expected, something that had not happened in a long  time in an American institution.    The U.S. State Department and the Chilean Interior Ministry  still must take some joint steps. Apparently, the two  institutions have not discussed the subject lately, after it was  announced by former Minister Enrique Krauss on 16 July 1993.    As vice president of the Republic, Krauss then said the  purpose of asking for the opening of an FBI office in Chile was  only to strengthen cooperation between the Chilean forces of  order and the FBI in the struggle against international crime.  <H5>  Maximum Alert </H5>   One of the people who expressed a warning on the subject  noted that Chile is becoming -- due to its economic development  -- an attractive country for international traffickers and other  types of criminals. This would make it necessary to reinforce  the Chilean police by increasing its operational capability  instead of creating a situation that would demand the  participation of foreign agents. But this will not be the case  because the U.S. agents will not have any power to operate. The  Chilean law, like those in every other country of the world,  prevents foreign agents from operating in territory other than  their own country. Their task, therefore, will be merely to  exchange information in addition to granting technical and  academic support.    There were also protests from those who feared the fact  would  be misinterpreted by Chilean police in the sense that FBI agents  were being brought to Chile because things were not being done  properly here. While some politicians tried to minimize the  issue, others tried to explain the government's true purpose to  the Chilean people: That it did not aspire to have agents with  operational capability in Chile; that the idea was to have an  FBI agent who would allow for a more fluid and expeditious  relationship between the security forces; that bringing an FBI  agent did not represent interference in domestic affairs; and  that by no means did it reveal a government weakness in its  struggle against drug trafficking.    Everything boiled down to a mere discussion until a group of  National Renewal legislators decided to ask the government to  withdraw its invitation to the FBI. They argued that the  initiative violated the law currently in force and national  sovereignty because, according to the Constitution, Carabineros  and the Investigative Police are in charge of safeguarding  domestic order.    The government was indignant and Krauss said it was "great  insolence" to believe that the Chilean Government and police  institutions could be manipulated by foreign interests.    But those directly affected were barely consulted on the  subject. Carabineros, through Director General Rodolfo Stange,  at first reacted negatively, although in an indirect manner. A  few days later, however, Carabineros suggested it might view  this initiative as positive for cooperation in the police field.  Carabineros, though, still has not disclosed its official  stance on the issue.    The opinions within this force are varied. A Carabineros  source stated those who are against the idea or choose not to  state their opinion do so because they are not fully aware of  the effect that a liaison with the FBI in Chile may have.  Carabineros believe this difference of opinions is positive.  The same person made an interesting comment: The FBI office in  Santiago will not be autonomous; it will be subject to the U.S.  Embassy. It will, in fact, be located in the Embassy building.    He also asserted that it is merely another of the 21  officies  the FBI already has throughout the world, which is also the case  of the Chilean Armed and security forces. Carabineros has  attaches in some embassies, like in Spain, Colombia, the United  States, and Costa Rica, as well as missions stationed in El  Salvador and Ecuador, among other countries.  <H5>  Between Doubts and Advantages </H5>   The Investigative Police has voiced its full support for the  initiative. The thing is that its agents, for some time now,  have maintained a cooperative relationship with the FBI office  in Montevideo, which is in charge of coordinating actions in the  Southern Cone. The FBI has four agents in Montevideo. But the  distance, although short, causes certain inconveniences. The  relationship is not as fluid as it should be.    Carlos Espinoza, administrative chief of the Santiago  Interpol National Headquarters, said one must admit that the FBI  is in the vanguard of technological developments and this is  highly positive for the development of criminal investigations  carried out by Chilean agents. Espinoza said: "If we reach a  point in our investigations at which our resources prevent us  from going any further, as has been the case, there are our FBI  friends who, somehow or other, can help us complete our work."  He added: "They have more technology than we do, but our human  resources, the quality of our professionals, are good. When  they need something they get it done properly and in time."    Carabineros also offers human resources. Their offer,  however, is less specific than the offer of the Investigative  Police, dedicated mainly to criminal matters. Carabineros has a  greater choice of professionals.    They also point out their viewpoint of another social  situation, in addition to their experience in confronting other  social phenomenons in the crime field also applicable in the  United States. This is the case of the struggle against  delinquency in the capital's outskirts, also applicable to the  actions carried out in the United States in neighborhoods or  areas where different ethnic groups are gathered.    There are coincidences on the reasons why the United States  may have so readily accepted the Chilean Government request to  install an FBI office here. Basically, they refer to the degree  of economic development reached by Chile, which makes it  increasingly vulnerable to the much-talked-about  "internationalization of crime." In other words, that important  foreign delinquents increasingly choose Chile in which to commit  their crimes or hide.    In view of this situation and the globalization phenomenon  the world is experiencing in all fields of action, few see the  purpose of denying the existence of a liaison with U.S. police  in Chile. A person linked to this issue commented: "We cannot  close our borders if there is a tendency toward rapprochement  and international police cooperation throughout the world," and  added, "why would we hesitate before crime if it can only be  fought by working."    There are some who believe one must suspect the U.S.  attitude  to readily accept the request. Some believe that "the gringos  do nothing for free." But others believe there is nothing wrong  with that. Police forces believe Chile also has done the right  thing. Although many may say the benefits are shared, it is true  that Chile will benefit even more.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (17): Taking stakes in other companies - GWR Group Few radio listeners in the west of England will not have heard the slogans 'Better music mix' and 'No rap, less chat,' writes Roland Adburgham. Remorselessly, they are repeated on GWR-FM, the commercial radio station. Mr Chris Scott, station director in Bristol, describes them as 'positioning statements.' In terms of position, GWR Group, based in Bristol and Swindon, has established itself as the UK's biggest commercial radio company after Capital Radio. Earlier this year, it took over a clutch of Midlands and East Anglian stations and now holds the permitted maximum of 20 radio licences. While lobbying the government to raise the limit, it has been taking stakes in other radio companies. It holds 17 per cent of Classic FM, the national commercial station, and has shareholdings in various companies from Plymouth to York. In July, GWR, which is quoted on the unlisted securities market, won Price Waterhouse's award for the West of England business of the year. In the six months to March 31, it had a turnover of Pounds 7.8m, an increase of 90 per cent on the same period last year. Pre-tax profits nearly trebled to Pounds 930,000. In the west, GWR-FM, together with its sister AM station Brunel Classic Gold, lifted the combined market share to 30 per cent this summer, based on Radio Joint Audience Research, compared with 20 per cent in the same period last year.

Output is heavily influenced by telephone interviews, in which listeners are asked to rate songs on a scale ranging from 'haven't heard it' or 'dislike it' to 'I really like the song.' The format of news bulletins is also influenced by listener research. There is strong interest shown in local and UK news, but very little in reports about the royal family. Mr Simon Cooper, area director, explains that this is because royal stories are mainly visual in appeal. The group's ambitions now include expansion in eastern Europe. In Poland, it has taken a stake in Inforadio in Warsaw, in partnership with BBC World Service. It has also a 48 per cent holding in Radio FM Plus in Sofia, Bulgaria. Back in Bristol, at GWR's studios at the Watershed media centre, a 'positioning statement' jingle has been recorded for the Sofia station. In Bulgarian, it means 'Only hits.'</p>

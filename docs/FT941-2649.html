			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 73% public take up of MDIS Shares in McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services company, have proved harder to sell to the public than to institutions. The group said yesterday that all the shares had been placed with institutions at 260p a share. Some 25.6m of the 73.1m total had been available under clawback arrangements to satisfy public applications and priority applications from eligible employees. However, only 8,585 valid applications, for 18.7m shares or 73 per cent, had been received. The flotation, valuing the group at about Pounds 250m, is the largest in the information technology sector this year but analysts said they were not surprised by the public under-subscription. MDIS, a company which specialises in applications software and software tools, was hard to sell to a general audience. There was also a perception that the market was changing and the window of opportunity for new flotations closing. Mr Anthony McGrath, of Baring Brothers, sponsor to the issue, said the public offering had been made in deference to Stock Exchange demands. It had always been considered a challenge for a company like MDIS.</p>

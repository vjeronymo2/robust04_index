			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Fashion: Flower power for a very Nineties summer - The floral frock is back. But, says Avril Groom, the modern version is a long way from Laura Ashley IT IS 40 years since Laura Ashley started making tea towels and aprons on her kitchen table in London's Pimlico and 25 since she launched the first of her printed dresses that were to alter the fashion perceptions of a generation of British women. This year, appropriately, the floral frock is back - but what would the late Laura make of it now? She was designing in a tradition going back to the 18th century, fabrics from which inspired some of her flower-sprig prints. The tradition periodically surfaced in fashion until the 1920s. Historically it belonged as much to the milkmaid in simple printed cotton as to the lady in summer garden silks but, if fashion can be said to mimic television series, the Ashley look was aimed Upstairs rather than Down. It was essentially British, rural and, in the early 1970s, aspirational. The floral frock's latest reincarnation is none of these. Now that design thinking deems it unworthy to look like a possessor of wealth, inspiration comes from the opposite end of the social scale. In this case that means either wartime flea-market Parisiennes with drooping cigarettes and clumpy wedge sandals, or East European gipsy refugees and their sanitised fashion equivalents, the neo-hippies in mismatched print layers. The roots of this odd skewing of a classic look are decidedly French. The young Parisian deconstructionists have embraced it enthusiastically, with designers such as Martin Margiela seeking out 1940s dresses to recut and mix with devastating effect. But the origins of it lie with the often-prophetic Jean-Paul Gaultier, a disciple of bondage corsetry and mannish tailoring who first showed he had a softer side with a memorable mid-1980s collection of faded flower-print chiffon overalls, aprons and lingerie lace, layered over his usual pinstripes. He called it 'La concierge est dans l'escalier' and has said since that he has 'the tastes of a concierge'. Now this is what everyone claims and, though Gaultier's look took some time to take off, by last summer every city girl in France and Italy looked like a concierge in a floppy, navy or black sprig-printed button-through frock worn with tennis shoes and tanned legs (still perfectly good styling for hot weather this year). On the catwalk, printed overalls and turban-tied headscarves came even from that icon of 1980s success-dressing, Chanel. Add an injection of American grunge nostalgia and the resulting style makes you look, even if you inhabit a large country house, as if you should wield the duster rather than the purse strings. It sounds unpromising, yet this is a style with charm and practicality. The secret of making it look good is, as with so much of this summer's fashion, in the layering. Too often the traditional British floral frock does not tally with the traditional British summer climate and disappears under ill-assorted cardigans or coats. This year that is exactly what it is supposed to do, but naturally the results are best if it is thought through and co-ordinated first. Colour-matched mixed prints, stripes and spots can look richly wonderful, if slightly Bohemian. A classic floral frock from last time round passes muster if you give some fresh thought to layering. Put a stripey T-shirt or a skinny jumper under it, making it more useful on cooler days, plus another cropped or skinny knit on top. In warm weather, sandwich it with this summer's light, transparent layers such as a lacy camisole, a loose chiffon shirt or a crochet waistcoat. Strappy dresses that will become sunfrocks in high summer can be layered pinafore-style for now. And why stick to one dress when you can wear two? A button-through frock can double up as a fluid coat, this season's favoured way of expressing softness and newer-looking than a jacket. By wearing the dresses together or separately you also multiply your choices. This need not be an expensive option. The floral frock is everywhere, from chainstore versions not much over Pounds 20 through the middle of the market to designer originals such as Ralph Lauren's fragile silk slip at Pounds 700-plus. The designer end gives you silk, chiffon, subtle prints and more swirly fabric for your money; the middle good shapes but a tendency to polyester; the chainstores offer still nice floppy viscose, though with a skimpier one-sized cut, shaped with ties at the back and, harking back to the 1940s originals, a resurgence of shoulderpads. The comforting thought is that, after the passion for layers has faded, all these dresses will slide easily back under a plain tailored jacket to become the classic British summer look once more. To show how concierge style suits gracious summer living, we photographed it at Llangoed Hall, the Wye Valley hotel owned by Sir Bernard Ashley and decorated by his son Nick, former design chief of Laura Ashley. Here we show how, mixed with other good, simple pieces, the chintzy print can look softly elegant - just like the floral frock.</p>

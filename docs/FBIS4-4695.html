			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chipa Thar from MYANMA ALIN; date not given: </F> "Do Not Slaughter an Elephant To Distribute to the Community"  -- from the "Their Views" program]    [Text] We have been kept informed of the reports tabled at  the National Convention plenary session through the extracts of  important portions broadcast by the radio and published in the  press. We are grateful for this. Being fully aware of the  motto that the emergence of the new constitution is the duty of  all citizens, the extracts are of particular interest to us  because the future constitution will be based on what is being  discussed at the plenary session. The following is our review  of the proposals and discussions at the National Convention  plenary session held from 23 to 31 March.    There were discussions aimed at altering, adding provisions  to, and criticizing the basic principles that had been laid  down. Frankly, they amounted to subtle and outright opposition  to the basic principles that had already been laid down. The  entire world -- not just Myanmar [Burma] -- is aware of the 104  basic principles that have been welcomed and supported by  hundreds of thousands of people at mass rallies.    As a member of the public, I believe that the National  Convention must implement its work step by step. If  retrospection, criticism, and blame for past events are  accepted, then the implementation of the original objective will  be marked by confusion and slowness instead of progress. It  will be viewed as excessive magnanimity and concession.    The very essence of democracy is to follow the wishes of the  majority of organizations. If the tendency to challenge the  majority is practiced -- like the maxim of one against the  entire village -- it will not only amount to disrespect for  democracy, but the destruction of democratic practices.    In some matters, what the majority likes may be identical to  what the individual likes, while in some cases what the majority  likes may not be approved of by an individual or what an  individual likes may not be acceptable to the majority. A  genuine politician tends to concede to the wishes of the  majority if his wishes clash with those of the majority. A  self-centered and subjective person can end up fighting against  the entire world.    We heard the discussions by flexible delegates who gave  priority to the national interest over the interests of their  own national races and regions. We respect and admire these  people who expressed in their reports a willingness to be abide  by whatever decisions are made by the National Convention and  declared categorically that they would not secede from the Union.    At the National Convention there were those who were noble  as  well as those who were petty. There were expressions of belief  and terms tinged with anger, pride, sarcasm, and insinuation as  well as sincere and polite presentation of views.    We were amazed at how those self-centered people, who are  prisoners of their own subjective views, made small concessions  but then sought exorbitant and greedy demands in an intimidating  manner from the other side, which was barely left with anything.    It is like killing an elephant for distribution to the  community. They made the demands to exploit the existence of  national races who are the same as them living in other regions,  although the demands could mean the extinction of others living  in these regions. The emergence of self-administered zones is  not a matter based on one's wishes alone. Wishes can lead to  anxiety, over zealousness, and one-sidedness. It is easy to  remedy this matter if the basic principles are followed as they  were laid down.    Merely having sufficient population is not enough for the  emergence of a self-administered zone. To be more specific, a  national race may have a population of 1 million, with 3,125  people spread out in 320 townships. Are we to prescribe the 320  townships for that particular national race? The crucial point  to consider is collective residence in congruous territory. If  a national race that does not constitute a majority in a  township claims a self- administered township, it will amount to  a blatant act of dominance over the majority of national races  residing in that particular township. The use of pressure  cannot bring about a stable administration; only concrete  conditions will bring about a just decision.    Government organizations are fully informed of the concrete  conditions regarding government work. Myanmar has its census  figures with records and gazetteers in each village tract, ward,  and township. Furthermore, it is not difficult for a government  to carry out field work to assess the current situation. If a  commission is formed and field work is carried out, it will take  much time.    Let there be arguments and excuses. In the final analysis,  the truth -- concrete evidence, records, gazetteers, and  statistics -- will be presented, and time will determine what  should happen. It is important, however, not to store arrows  before war. Our delegates should not be overzealous and proud.  They should say what they have to say and demand only what they  have to demand in the interest of the entire nation and people.    We should avoid slaughtering an elephant to provide a single  meal to the community.</p>

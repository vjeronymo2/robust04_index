			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Lewis] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The South African Police  [SAP] on Tuesday [19 April] appealed to the public to disregard  alarmist rumours about impending widespread violence, food  shortages and similar speculation in the run-up to the elections.    It said it was aware of the rumours and a growing number of  facsimile messages urging the public to take special  precautions. "It is in our best interest that we remain calm and  rational. The SAP requests the public to disregard  irresponsible, inaccurate rumours. There are assurances from  many companies that the services they provide will continue to  be provided during the election period."</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs resist pressure as Russia and US at odds The Bosnian Serbs reaffirmed objections to the latest peace plan for Bosnia yesterday, as the plan's five sponsor nations remained at odds over ways to enforce compliance. The Bosnian Serbs' renewed display of ambiguity in the face of international pressure came on the eve of a meeting in Geneva tomorrow of the five-nation 'contact group' pressing the peace plan - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. Earlier General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, said he was certain the Bosnian Serbs would come round to accepting the plan. The Russian minister's optimism was not shared by officials from other contact group nations. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, characterised the initial qualified Serbian response last week as 'tantamount to a rejection'. With the Americans and Russians divided over how to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, and European governments nervous about their troops in Bosnia, diplomats fear splits in the 'contact group' could ultimately lead to an escalation of fighting. In Britain, officials fear the US may take a harder line than others in the contact group, urging extension of Nato's role in Bosnia and subsequent lifting of the arms embargo. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, warned ministerial colleagues in London yesterday that if Washington did not accept a more graduated approach to increasing pressure on the Serbs, Britain could be forced into a rapid withdrawal of its troops. That warning was echoed publicly last night by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who said that an escalation of the conflict resulting from removal of the arms embargo would make the position of UN troops 'untenable'.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway unveils reorganisation of gas sales policy NORWAY HAS unveiled details of a reorganisation of its gas sales system designed to give foreign oil companies greater influence over their natural gas reserves and to facilitate more efficient gas resource management. From August the foreign companies will be represented in two-year rotations on a supply committee augmenting the existing Gas Negotiating Committee, comprised of the three Norwegian oil companies. Gas sales administration has hitherto been conducted solely by the GFU, comprising Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum. Under the new plan, Statoil, providing the secretariat and chairman, will lead the supply committee, which will include Hydro and Saga and foreign oil companies Total, Norske Shell, Conoco, Elf Aquitaine, Esso, Phillips Petroleum and Neste Petroleum. It will take over GFU's role as adviser to the Ministry of Industry and Energy on the disposition of gas reserves and will advise the ministry on the development and utilisation of gas pipeline infrastructure and production capacity. 'The decision to establish a separate supply committee was taken by the Ministry of Industry and Energy in order to put greater emphasis on upstream issues and gain broader planning of supplies before the GFU starts sales talks,' Statoil explained. The foreign oil companies will be selected for two-year terms on the basis of their operatorships of licences.</p>

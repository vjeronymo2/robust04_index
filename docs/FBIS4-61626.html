			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin and Yevgeniy Skukin report: "Signatures </F> of Reconciliation. More Signatures Appeared Under Social Accord  Treaty Yesterday"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Before the ceremony began,  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondents turned to those who had been  invited to St. Vladimir's Hall to put their signatures to the  accord document.    "The treaty which we are signing," Yelena Voldemarova,  chairman and coordinator of the Moscow Confederation of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said, "is something Russia  undoubtedly needs. But it is more the initial form of accord  rather than the only necessary one. With its help we at the  level of political parties and the three branches of power are  -- figuratively speaking -- drawing up the ground rules. But  genuine accord cannot be achieved unless all strata of the  population are involved in the process. In particular, this is  the task being set by the Russian Land Movement [Rossiyskoye  Zemskoye Dvizheniye], of which I am the chairman."    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What specifically do you plan to do?    [Voldemarova] First and foremost we need to create the legal  possibility for transformations. A board of trustees has now  been set up on the initiative of the Land Movement, the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, the Union of Russian Small Towns, and  the Russian Local Self-Government Union. This is a coordinating  structure for implementing local self-government. If we succeed  in initiating the adoption by parliament of a law on local  self-government, then, in our view, we will have taken a real  step toward nationwide accord.    "The accord is a life belt for society," in the view of the  famous economist Pavel Bunich, who was representing the Union of  Industrialists and Leaseholders in the Kremlin. "It could be of  educational importance. For instance, since the start of the  year the State Duma has not passed a single economic law. The  accord document will prompt parliamentarians to move in this  direction. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that the  recession does not continue this year. This is not wishful  thinking. The decline cannot continue, otherwise it will be a  collapse, not a recession!"    In the opinion of Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the  Association of Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural  Cooperatives, in economic activity it is time to stop "pulling  the blanket" only over ourselves and living on the basis of  narrow departmental or regional interests. He believes that the  agreement being signed is also aimed at preventing extremes and  at stopping people from resorting to tough measures.    ...The treaty has been signed by representatives of the  Agro-Industrial Union of Russia, the Union of Young  Entrepreneurs, the Chamber of Trade and Industry, the  Interregional Society of Merchants, commercial banks....    Those present in St. Vladimir's Hall were addressed by  Russian Federation Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Cossiga vetoes asbestos law FOR THE second time in less than a month President Francesco Cossiga has used his constitutional powers to block legislation already approved by both houses of the Italian parliament. First he blocked a law providing new measures to accommodate social work for those who wish to replace obligatory military call-up on the grounds of conscientious objection. He has followed this up by refusing to sign a law bringing Italy into line with the European Community on the elimination of asbestos in industry. In the case of the conscientious objectors law, President Cossiga claimed the provisions for social work were inadequate. In the case of the asbestos law he said that there was insufficient financial cover for the L80bn expenditure over the next three years. But in both instances the main political parties have reacted as if the President were deliberately seeking to undermine their authority. The asbestos law took two years to steer through committee and both houses. President Cossiga's action has also caused something of a constitutional stir since parliament dissolved at the beginning of the month prior to the April 5 general elections. After much argument, parliament is expected to take the unusual step of briefly reconvening next week to consider a decree passing the conscientious objection law, which President Cossiga would be unable to block a second time round. The president's objections to the asbestos law appear to be on firmer ground since even for the current year the proposed financial cover is uncertain. There is also strong pressure from the asbestos lobby, which employs 2,500 directly and another 25,000 indirectly, for a longer phasing out period. This may mean the law will have to await the next parliament.</p>

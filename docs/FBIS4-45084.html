			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "ITC Plans To Emerge as Global Player"] </F>   [Text] Calcutta, May 26 -- ITC [India Tobacco Corporation]  has re-emphasised its objective to emerge as India's first  multinational even as it announced a bonus issue of shares after  reporting a net profit of Rs. [Rupees] 206 crore for 1993-1994.    "...Strong Indian companies should go overseas with their  products and services as India's flag bearers," ITC Chairman  K.L. Chugh observed while reporting a gross income of Rs. 4,280  crore in the last fiscal.    Explaining his company's corporate strategy in a liberalised  regime Mr Chugh said: "It has been my firm belief that in order  to integrate ourselves fast with the global economy, foreign  investment and technology should be inducted through  multinationals in areas that are needed."    Mr Chugh's observations made after a meeting of the board  here yesterday are significant because the company recently  thwarted British American Tobacco (BAT)'s [as published] efforts  to get a controlling stake and hive off some of ITC's  non-traditional businesses.    It was, however, obvious that Mr Chugh's corporate  philosophy  of taking on multinational predators applied only to hostile  takeover bids.    Though the ITC Chairman did not specifically mention the  Centre for its support during his successful operation to  stonewall BAT, it was clear that the company perceives a period  of closer ties with the Union Finance Ministry.    ITC's profits before tax increased 34 percent over that of  1992-93 to Rs. 350 crore (Rs. 261.48 crore). With a market  capitalisation of Rs. 6,794 crore it continued to be among  India's blue chips. The company's foreign exchange earnings  totalled Rs. 822 crore.</p>

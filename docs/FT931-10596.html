			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: US and Bosnia WITHIN THE next few days the Clinton administration has to take its first big foreign policy decision: how to respond to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, which has the support of the EC and, not insignificantly, of Russia. The plan has had a bad press in the US, not helped by the arrogant and abrasive manner in which its British co-author, Lord Owen, has been presenting it. There are in fact good reasons for objecting to it, both of principle and of pragmatism. The principled objection is that the plan partially ratifies the territorial gains which the Serbs have achieved by 'ethnic cleansing', and virtually dismantles a state and government which the international community has recognised as legally sovereign. The pragmatic one is that the plan will be diabolically difficult to implement. On past form the Serbs will not willingly relinquish either territory or weapons, whatever pieces of paper they sign; and the Bosnian army will be equally reluctant to give up territory it holds in north-eastern Bosnia. Thus it is clear that even if the plan is formally accepted by all three parties, significant external forces will be needed on the ground to implement it; and this could not be a pure peacekeeping force in the classic UN tradition, authorised to fire only in self-defence. It would need a mandate to use force to reimpose the ceasefire, in cases where one or more of the parties on the ground was failing to abide by its terms. European leaders believe that such a force would be credible only if the US took part in it. This fact has been used by those arguing against the plan in the US. Few American politicians, and even fewer military leaders, like the idea of exposing GIs to such risks. Yet it is a disingenuous argument when used by people who claim to espouse the Bosnian cause. If the US rejects the plan, or sticks to its initial position of being prepared to support the plan only if it is accepted by all three parties, the Moslems will take that as a promise of US support for them, and hold out for better terms. The question is, what form would that support take? A popular answer in some circles in Washington is that the arms embargo should be lifted so that the Bosnians can fight their own battles. That sounds good as a rhetorical position, but would be a very poor way to help the Moslems if in fact the Serbs and Croats once again got the lion's share of the weapons. Some would go further and use US air power to compensate for Serb superiority in heavy weapons. Such a policy would certainly not be sanctioned by the Security Council, given the Russian veto. The US's desire to avoid risks to its own troops is understandable, as is its reluctance to endorse the Vance-Owen plan. Yet the only alternatives are riskier, both for the Bosnians whom the US wishes to help and for the wider peace of Europe.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOLAR-CAR FANS WORK ON AUTO OF FUTURE TODAY  </P> <P> In the land of broad-beamed Mercedes, 12-cylinder BMWs and the high-speed  autobahn, a small group of tinkerers and enthusiasts are working on a car of  the future that follows a completely different line of development:  solar-powered city cars, small and light, with battery-charged top speeds of  around 45 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "Where we are now is one second after the birth of this idea, says Ike  Clef-Prahm, a Hamburg advertising executive and solar-car fan.  </P> <P> "We have to ask ourselves, 'What will individual transportation look like in  the next century?' " he says. Besides the problems of pollution, noise and  crowded streets, oil-industry projections say world petroleum reserves will run  out by around the year 2030.  </P> <P> To suggest some answers, Clef-Prahm and friends organized West Germany's first  major road rally for solar vehicles, the Hansa Solarmobile Cup from Luebeck to  Hamburg, inspired by Switzerland's annual Tour de Sol.  </P> <P> Some 80 solar-powered cars, motorcycles and mopeds from West Germany, Denmark,  Switzerland and the Netherlands converged on northern Germany for the 115-mile  run in September.  </P> <P> According to solar enthusiasts, the car of the future will not simply be  electric. It must be energy efficient -- meaning light -- at best perhaps less  than 1,000 pounds and no more than about 10 feet long.  </P> <P> Solar-mobiles built in small series in Switzerland and Denmark have sleek hulls  of strong, lightweight synthetic materials with highly energy efficient engines  and extremely low wind resistence values.  </P> <P> Solar-mobiles convert 70% of their energy input into motion, contrasted with  20% at best and as little as 5% in the city for regular cars.  </P> <P> "There is a new concept of traffic behind these autos," says Clef-Prahm. It is  based on statistics: West German studies show that the average urban car trip  takes one or two people some 12 miles and that drivers cover an average 25  miles a day.  </P> <P> Hence the solar city car, with one or two seats and able to carry 40 to 50% of  its own weight, with a top speed around 45 m.p.h. and a range of 40 or 50 miles  on a single battery charge.  </P> <P> Recharging is done overnight or during workday parking from electricity  produced by photovoltaic cells at home or at "solar stations" -- such as three  that have been set up in the West German town of Kassel.  </P> <P> The solar city mobile is for driving to the subway or commuter train station,  shopping and running errands in town, and picking up a child or two from  school.  </P> <P> That is the vision. For now, solar-mobiles remain rare in West Germany,  contrasted with neighboring Switzerland, where up to 300 cruise the streets, or  Denmark, where some 1,500 Danish-produced vehicles have been sold.  </P> <P> Far less than 100 solar-mobiles have been licensed for West German roads. Solar  auto construction in the country is a field dominated by hobbyists and workshop  tinkerers, such as Hans-Juergen Benecke, a Hamburg secondary-school teacher.  </P> <P> Benecke and 12 students turned a small Italian car body into a 1,000-pound  solar auto that can do 40 m.p.h. for 45 miles. Its home power base is a set of  solar cells on the school roof. The next project is to build five with updated  technology for a top speed of 50 m.p.h. and range of 60 miles.  </P></p>

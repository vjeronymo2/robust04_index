			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 22 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- After issuing an  emergency decree on Thursday, President Carlos Roberto Reina  said today that he hopes to overcome the three-month energy  crisis affecting his country in 60 days. He said he hopes the  measures taken to resolve the energy crisis throughout the  nation will be effective and will end the constant power  rationing to which people have been subjected. The measures  include purchasing electricity from countries such as Panama,  which began sending 13 megawatts through the Central American  interconnection system this Friday for an initial period of  three months at a cost of $3.8 million. A power-generating barge  will be leased and will arrive in the coming days in the  northern port of Puerto Cortes. Private plants will also be used  to generate electricity.    According to official reports from the National Enterprise  for Electric Power (ENEE), the country's daily deficit is over  80 megawatts, which has prompted the creation of a rationing  schedule. Reina appealed to the people to conserve energy while  the crisis is overcome. "I am working as hard as I can so the  Honduran people will not suffer so much with these problems," he  added.    Also, he said the state will collect $26 million in arrears  maintained by "wealthy" businessmen for several years with the  ENEE, which might help to solve the current problem. "To achieve  this, we must cut down on our energy use. It is time for people  to help solve the crisis," the president stated. The current  energy crisis is the result of a lack of water at the Francisco  Morazan hydroelectric plant, the country's largest such plant,  which supplies 63 percent of national demand. According to the  same sources, a lack of foresight by previous governments and  neglected maintenance of the thermoelectric plants that also  generate power are also to blame for the problem.    The government trusts that Central American countries, like  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, will supply electricity to Honduras,  but these nations have reported that they also face problems  because of the drought.</p>

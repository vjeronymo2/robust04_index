			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] The 24th OAS General Assembly today continued  hearing requests for Cuba's reintegration into that regional  organization, from which it was separated in 1962 because of its  political differences with the United States. On the second day  of sessions in Belem do Para, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim spoke of Cuba's reintegration into the OAS Assembly and  insisted on the need to reevaluate Cuba's situation within the  hemispheric community. Outgoing OAS President Joao Baena Soares,  as well as Brazilian President Itamar Franco, recommended during  last night's inaugural meeting that Cuba's reintegration be  studied. This topic was not on the agenda of the meeting, which  will conclude on 10 June.</p>

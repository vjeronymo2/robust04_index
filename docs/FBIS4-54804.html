			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Deputy Prime Minister Valentin </F> Karabashev by Venelina Gocheva and Khristofor Karadzhov; place  and date not given: "Berov Stopped Privatization"]    [Excerpts] [24 CHASA] Mr. Karabashev, you decided to act  ahead of the prime minister and resigned before he kicked you  out.    [Karabashev] I think that such a move is normal. Since the  prime minister stated in front of the National Assembly and the  people that he was dissatisfied with my work as minister of  trade and deputy prime minister, he should have replaced me  already on 27 April. It was abnormal not to do it. Since I  adhere to normal things, I resigned.    I intended to do it already last week because of differences  with the prime minister, including on the issue of reshuffling  the cabinet. However, I decided to wait a bit longer, because I  hoped to reach a compromise.    [24 CHASA] What was it that you did not like in the proposed  reshuffling?    [Karabashev] Initially, I was offered the posts of deputy  prime minister or a minister without portfolio, without  precisely determined functions. From the conversation with  Professor Berov I did not understand what precisely I would be  responsible for. Mainly from other people I also understood that  he himself did not know this. Apparently, it was not the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] that changed its attitude toward  me, but rather that he simply did not have an alternative  candidate for my post. [passage omitted]    [24 CHASA] Was not the fact that Mr. Matinchev was appointed  acting prime minister the reason for the cooling of your  relations with the prime minister?    [Karabashev] This act indicated a certain lack of confidence  in me, and in the final analysis this was confirmed by the  proposals for reshuffling the cabinet.    [24 CHASA] All right, what are the differences between you  and the prime minister?    [Karabashev] We differ on the Law on Privatization and the  privatization process itself. There also were serious  differences during the preparation and the adoption of the  regulations on the state participation in the privatization and  the related functions of the Privatization Agency. If you  recall, there were great differences during the preparation of  the documents related to establishing the Interdepartmental  Council on the Military- Industrial Complex. The  supradepartmental organ that was proposed then contradicted the  constitution. In the final analysis, the proposal was rejected  after I and Minister Bikov objected. You could also recall the  disputes regarding the adoption of the so-called privatization  list for 1994, which although it had no legal value, inflicted a  severe blow on the privatization process.    Contrary to Prof. Berov, who said in the parliament that I  am  the reason for the fact that there is no privatization, I  maintain that he is the cause. This is related to his desire to  replace the market privatization by a mass privatization already  during the first days of his tenure. [passage omitted]    [24 CHASA] With your resignation from the parliament [as  published] the Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] ceases to  be a ruling party.    [Karabashev] It was not a ruling party anyway, because my  influence in the cabinet was rather weak.    [24 CHASA] Do you know what President Zhelev thinks about  your resignation?    [Karabashev] I talked to President Zhelev prior to my  resignation....    [24 CHASA] Did he try to dissuade you?    [Karabashev] No.</p>

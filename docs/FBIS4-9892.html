			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Deputy Attorney General Miguel Montes Garcia, the  special assistant prosecutor in charge of investigating the  murder of Revolutionary Institutional Party [PRI] presidential  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, has charged that several  individuals acting according to plan took part in the crime. In  other words, a plot existed and the individuals conspired with  one another.    In a news release, Montes says that, according to  investigations, Mario Aburto Martinez, Tranquilino Sanchez  Venegas, and Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela -- the latter is a  former Judicial Police member -- may have acted in concert.  Montes also mentioned in the news release the simultaneous  participation of Rodolfo Mayoral Esker, Rodolfo Rivapalacio, and  two other people who have been identified visually but whose  names and whereabouts are still unknown. Montes says the  investigation could later be expanded to include a larger number  of people. Here is the complete message that Montes read for the  media this morning:    [Begin Montes recording] Ladies and gentlemen, as was  reported in a release issued by this office on 31 March, we have  found new evidence leading to several important details related  to the Colosio assassination.    1. Several individuals participated in concert with the  intention of killing Colosio.    2. So far, the simultaneous participation of the following  individuals can be mentioned, although this does not rule out  the possibility that the investigation might be expanded to  include a larger number of people some time in the future: Mario  Aburto Martinez, assassin; Tranquilino Sanchez, who watched  General Delmiro Garcia Reyes, who was in charge of security at  the outer perimeter, thereby making it possible for Aburto to  approach and walk up beside Colosio; Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela,  who pushed back the crowd making a path for the individual I  will mention next; one participant, visually identified but  whose name and whereabouts are unknown, who stood in front of  Colosio and then threw himself to the ground with the purpose of  blocking Colosio's movements and permitting Aburto to put  himself in a position to fire on Colosio; one participant,  identified visually, a man who was wearing glasses, but whose  name and whereabouts are unknown, who blocked other people's  movements until he positioned himself on the candidate's left  side, crouching moments before Aburto fired; Rodolfo Mayoral,  son of Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, who pushed and blocked  Colonel Federico Antonio Reynaldo del Pozo, the man in charge of  security at the inner perimeter, diverting the colonel's  attention and forcing him to relax his vigilance; Rodolfo  Rivapalacio, who hired Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, and Rodolfo  Mayoral to be part of the group seemingly created to maintain  order. This is according to the list of the members of the  group. The last name on the list has been altered.    3. Similarly, it has been confirmed that, during the meeting  and before the assassination, Sanchez and Rodolfo Mayoral stayed  with Aburto and chatted with him in a clear demonstration they  knew one another.    4. The facts, based mainly on video footage and pictures  studied by the authorities, constitute firm evidence, reinforced  by eyewitness testimony, that confirms the actions perpetrated  by the accused and validate the origin and authenticity of the  material analyzed. Other circumstances, which are part of the  investigation and which also point unmistakably to a criminal  conspiracy, are also being studied.    Sanchez, Mayoral Valenzuela, Mayoral Eskes, and Rivapalacio  have been handed over to judicial authorities. [end recording]</p>

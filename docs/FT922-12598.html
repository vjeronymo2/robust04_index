			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Japan hits at US and Europe over world trade: Confidential letters call for swift action to end Gatt row JAPAN has sent unusually tough letters to Washington and Brussels expressing concern that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is stalled because the European Community and US have not fulfilled their obligations. The Japanese government has become increasingly frustrated by the failure of the EC and US to honour Uruguay Round proposal deadlines under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This frustration has finally surfaced in the two confidential letters sent by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister. In the past, Tokyo has preferred to sit on the sidelines while the EC and US argue over agricultural trade and industrial tariffs. The government now believes that the multilateral round has reached a 'critical phase' and that Brussels and Washington must act quickly. Japan has therefore joined a growing number of interested parties expressing their disquiet that resolution of the round, which will now miss its Easter deadline, is proving so protracted. More than 100 chief executives worldwide signed a letter published in the Financial Times yesterday. In it they argued that 'the continuing stalemate over the trade negotiations has contributed to the deterioration of the economic climate and the postponement of many business initiatives'. In Brussels, ahead of an EC-US summit in Washington next Wednesday, the European Commission moved yesterday to damp hopes of a breakthrough in the five-year-old round. The meeting is between President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which currently holds the Community presidency. It is widely seen as the last chance to conclude the round this year and give a much-needed boost to world economic growth. A spokesman for Mr Delors said that 'up to now, nothing indicates that there will be an agreement'. Mr Watanabe, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, expressed his disappointment that Washington is seeking many exemptions in services trade negotiations and failed to meet a deadline last month for the submission of a list of industrial products and suggested tariff reductions. Japan, one of about 15 countries to meet the deadline, submitted a 450-page document, while the US furnished only a few pages and said qualitative reductions were still under consideration. The foreign minister lamented that the US had not submitted its list apparently because bilateral negotiations with the EC are yet to be completed. He regretted that the EC was using the same excuse to justify its non-compliance. A senior Japanese negotiator explained that Mr Watanabe was irritated because the US and EC have the expertise to compile the tariff lists. He believes their failure has set a poor example for developing countries for which the process is far more exacting. 'It is six weeks since the deadline passed and still they have not produced a list. How long are we supposed to wait? What sort of signal does this send to other countries?' the official said. In a separate letter to Mr Frans Andriessen, Commission vice-president, Mr Watanabe expressed concern about the absence of detailed industrial tariff proposals and about the EC seeking exemptions to liberalised trade in services, particularly international shipping.

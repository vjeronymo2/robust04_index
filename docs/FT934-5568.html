			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (34): Plenty of high quality entries The third year of the Business Software Challenge competition saw a record number of entries, writes Claire Gooding. The projects described here are from the shortlist of eight that provided the final winners in two categories: Best Business Solution. Overall Winner. The breadth, ingenuity, and, in some cases, professionalism of the entries gives some indication of the standard as the report below indicates. The hope is that several of these will develop into commercially saleable products. The Software Challenge was created to encourage students in higher education to write applications to solve real business problems. Sponsored and funded by Computer Associates with Pounds 20,000 worth of prizes, this year's competition was supported by FT Software At Work, the British Computer Society, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the Institute of Management. The panel of judges consisted of competition sponsors, academics and specialists from a number of disciplines. The final candidates had to demonstrate how their designs addressed a particular problem. At the top of the shortlist were those who showed a flair for finding an unexplored niche and responding to the real needs of users. Two cash prizes were awarded, with the runners-up receiving software from Computer Associates. Readers requiring more information about the winners, or who may wish to enter for next year's competition should contact: The Competition Secretary, Business Software Challenge 90s, 22-24 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2PX.

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED IN BOY'S DEATH FROM ALCOHOL  </P> <P> Two brothers from Thousand Oaks were ordered Friday to stand trial on charges  of involuntary manslaughter in the April death of a 14-year-old boy who died  after they allegedly gave him part of a bottle of whiskey and bet him he could  not chug it all without getting sick.  </P> <P> Malibu Municipal Judge Lawrence J. Mira said the circumstances surrounding the  death of Leland (Lee) Scovis -- the youngest of five teen-age boys chaperoned  by the defendants on a camping trip to Leo Carrillo State Beach -- were tragic  and egregious.  </P> <P> "It seems to me a loaded gun is not unlike 80-proof liquor," Mira said. "The  coroner indicated that the blood alcohol level was more than twice what he  thought lethal."  </P> <P> David Campbell, 29, and Patrick Campbell, 23, will each stand trial on one  count of involuntary manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor  and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The two are free  on $5,000 bail each.  </P> <P> Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park was ordered to stand  trial on charges of being an accessory to involuntary manslaughter and five  counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Vernon, who is free on  her own recognizance, is the sister of one of the boys and is engaged to David  Campbell.  </P> <P> Leland was invited on the April 14 camping trip by Vernon's brother, a friend  of his, according to testimony during the hearing.  </P> <P> At the beginning of the trip, David Campbell told a park ranger that he would  take responsibility for the boys and then gave them alcohol, witnesses said.  Patrick Campbell allegedly bet Leland that he could not drink the two to three  inches of alcohol left in a half-gallon jug of whiskey without getting sick,  according to testimony.  </P> <P> Leland drank the whiskey and collapsed shortly after that, witnesses said. He  vomited and over the next one to two hours, Patrick Campbell cleared his airway  to help him breathe. Patrick Campbell and the boys also tried to revive Leland  by dragging him to the ocean's edge and letting cold water wash over him.  Leland eventually stopped breathing and was taken by helicopter to Westlake  Medical Center in Westlake Village. He died two days later.  </P> <P> Leland's blood alcohol level shortly after drinking the whiskey may have been  as high as 0.52%, said Joseph Lawrence Cogan, forensic pathologist for the Los  Angeles County medical examiner's office.  </P> <P> Leland's family members, who have sat through hours of testimony in the  four-day preliminary hearing, said they were happy with the ruling but said it  did little to ease the pain.  </P> <P> "Very frankly, I'd forgive them if they saw him in trouble and took him to  help," said Leland's mother, Jenny Scovis. "But to see a kid lie there and  gurgle -- I wouldn't do that to a dog or cat or anything."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Carol A. Clem, who is representing  David Campbell, said she had no comment on Mira's decision.  </P> <P> But Patrick Campbell's attorney, William J. Hardy, said he was not surprised.  </P> <P> "It may very well have to go to trial to resolve the manslaughter case," he  said.  </P> <P> The three will be arraigned in Santa Monica Superior Court on Aug. 31.  </P></p>

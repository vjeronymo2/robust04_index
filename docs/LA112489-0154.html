			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FLOYD WOULD LIKE '91 RYDER NOD  </P> <P> Ray Floyd said in September that he did not want to captain the U.S. Ryder Cup  team in 1991. He arrived for this weekend's Skins Game and said he has changed  his mind.  </P> <P> "I'd like to do it. It was one of the most memorable experiences I've had in  golf," Floyd said today.  </P> <P> He served as captain of the 12-man American team that tied Europe's best in the  biennial Ryder Cup matches in September. He said then that he didn't want to do  it again.  </P> <P> Since World War II, no one has served as an American Ryder Cup captain in  successive matches. The captain, selected by the PGA of America, is expected to  be named next spring.  </P> <P> "I would certainly do it if I was asked," Floyd said. "But that has not been  the precedent."  </P></p>

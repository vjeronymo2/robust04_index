The survey endorses recent official data showing  a pick-up in output and contradicts more gloomy reports, notably  last week's survey by the British Chambers of Commerce.    Positive trends found by the CBI include improved business  confidence, an increase in manufacturing orders and output, and  the first sign of an increase in investment in plant and  machinery since July 1989.    There appears to be continued downward pressure on costs  with  more manufacturers expecting to cut costs than at any time since  the first survey in 1958.    However, the CBI said it had two main areas of concern about  the UK's economic prospects in 1994. The first was the tax  increases and government expenditure cuts which "will remove a  significant proportion of purchasing power from the economy."  The second was the recent appreciation of the pound "which may  well hold back export growth."    Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs  committee, said "the survey alone would not indicate a need to  relax monetary policy further." But in view of "the shadow of  those tax increases," he thought it would be "necessary and  desirable to reduce interest rates."    Business confidence increased for the fifth quarter in  succession, according to the survey. The number of firms which  were more optimistic about business in general exceeded those  which were less optimistic by 27 percent. This balance, which  indicates the trend, compares with plus 1 percent in October.    Optimism has been fuelled by an increase in output and  orders. The balance of companies reporting an increase in  manufacturing output was the highest quarterly figure since July  1989.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second issue of concern was the authority granted in State law for the State agency to grant variances, including variances from Federal requirements. However, the revised general permitting regulations state that: (1) The State agency ``shall not issue variances from any Federal requirement to obtain an air quality permit, unless explicitly authorized to do so in writing by [USEPA],'' and (2) the State agency ``shall issue a permit *&blank;*&blank;* only if [various conditions have been met including that] the permit does not reflect a variance from any federally enforceable applicable requirement *&blank;*&blank;*.'' For purposes of this action, these provisions render the second issue moot, insofar as the State agency no longer has the ability to grant variances from Federal requirements. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to state that USEPA believes that the statutory provision for variances is not being approved and that issuance of a variance from Federal requirements would be contrary to both State and Federal regulations and would have no bearing on enforcement of the applicable requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third issue of concern was that public notice for new source review permits was provided for only in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) containing several outdated references. The revised general permitting regulations provide public notification procedures and a 30 day public comment period. Minnesota has clearly committed itself both in the MOU and its regulations to continuing to provide for proper opportunity for public input into permitting decisions in accordance with USEPA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all three of these issues, Minnesota has made clear through its revised general permitting regulations that the SIP as revised by the rule under consideration in this action would satisfy Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA believes that the three issues discussed above are no longer impediments to today's proposed conclusion that Minnesota has satisfied nonattainment area permitting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth issue of concern was whether Minnesota had satisfied the requirement of 40 CFR 51.160(a) to assure that new sources do not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the air quality standards. The general permitting regulations in Minnesota's SIP require permits for facilities with emissions above 25 tons per year of any criteria pollutant except lead, or with more than 1/2 ton of lead emissions per year. (At such a facility, any modification would require a permit.) The recently submitted permitting rules raise some of these size cutoffs. In support of the raised cutoffs, the State's recent submittal includes a modeling analysis to show that the revised size cutoffs do not interfere with attainment or maintenance. A preliminary review indicates that this analysis adequately supports the size cutoffs in the current SIP. Consequently, USEPA believes that the general permitting rules in the SIP as supplemented by the Offset Rule satisfy 40 CFR 51.160(a). Nevertheless, USEPA is reserving judgment on the acceptability of the recently raised size cutoffs, which will be addressed in the context of rulemaking on the more recent submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth issue of concern pertained to a provision in the State's Rule 7001.0150 authorizing the State not to enforce ``local laws, rules and plans.'' Although this provision clearly applies to local laws and not Federal laws, this provision is arguably ambiguous as to whether the State is authorized not to enforce Federal as well as local rules and plans. The recent rule revisions did not modify this provision. Nevertheless, the State's intent is presumably that the regulations only authorize nonenforcement of relevant local laws, local rules, and local plans. USEPA is expressly not proposing approval of any provision for State nonenforcement of Federal rules or Federal plans. USEPA solicits public comment on this element of the proposed approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA has reviewed whether the new requirements in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have been satisfied. These new requirements include an analysis of alternatives, and a requirement for submitting information to the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse. The Amendments also introduce numerous new requirements that are not currently relevant to Minnesota, in part because the State has no ozone nonattainment areas. The TSD provides a more detailed discussion of the new requirements and how these requirements are addressed in Minnesota. The conclusion of this review is that Minnesota has satisfactorily addressed these requirements as they currently apply in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA is currently developing a rule to implement the changes under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the new source review provisions in Parts C and D of Title I of the Act. The Agency anticipates that the proposed rule will be published for public comment in the spring or summer of 1994. If USEPA has not taken final action on Minnesota's new source review submittal by that time, USEPA may generally refer to the proposed rule as guidance regarding the approvability of the submittal. USEPA expects to take final action to promulgate a rule to implement the Parts C and D changes sometime during 1994 or 1995. Upon promulgation of those regulations, USEPA will review new source review SIPs to determine whether additional SIP revisions are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 189(e) states that ``control requirements applicable *&blank;*&blank;* for major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall also apply to major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  levels which exceed the standard in the area.'' On June 25, 1993 (at 58 FR 34397), USEPA proposed such a determination of the insignificance of particulate matter precursors in Minnesota. If that proposed action is finalized, section 189(e) would no longer require new source review of major particulate matter precursor sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA believes that the regulations submitted by Minnesota on August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, satisfy the requirements under Part D for a new source permitting program in nonattainment areas. Therefore, USEPA proposes to approve this SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the rules in the SIP, permits for nonattainment area sources that satisfy the substantive requirements of the Offset Rule (Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060) would be processed in accordance with permit processing provisions in the Consolidated Permit Rules (Rules 7001.0010 through 7001.0210 and Rules 7001.1200 through 7001.1220). Rulemaking of May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033) approved the Consolidated Permit Rule as satisfying attainment area permitting requirements but noted that nonattainment area permitting requirements were not met. Today's action proposes to lift the current ban on construction of major new sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas, and would impose Minnesota's Consolidated Permit Rule and Offset Rule as Federally enforceable requirements for such new sources and modifications. Subsequent rulemaking will address the approvability of more recent revisions to State permitting regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

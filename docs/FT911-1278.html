			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Legal challenge to east German newspaper sale A DM850m (Pounds 290.1m) privatisation deal ran into difficulty yesterday as the German opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) announced a legal challenge to last month's sale of east German newspapers to western press groups. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, SPD party treasurer, accused the Treuhand, the Bonn government's industrial holding company, of acting illegally in deciding the sale of 10 former Communist newspapers in the biggest east German privatisation to date. The SPD is pressing an ownership claim to at least seven of the newspapers, based in regional towns around east Germany, on the grounds that they belonged to the party before its property was confiscated by the Nazis in 1933. Mr Klose said a Berlin administrative court might decide as early as next week whether to grant the SPD's request for an injunction to delay the transaction. Purchasers of the daily newspapers include west Germany's largest press groups, ranging from Springer, which publishes Bild and Die Welt, and Grunerand Jahr to the Burda and Bauer companies. Mr Klose said the SPD was not seeking to regain full ownership rights but wanted an economic stake in the newspapers. The party would also be prepared to negotiate compensation. The SPD is also complaining about separate sales last year of daily newspapers in Chemnitz and Halle to west German publishing concerns friendly to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister. The SPD charges that the two politicians used their influence to steer through the sales rather than putting them up for general bidders in the manner of last month's transactions. The Bundesbank yesterday warned that Germany's inflation rate could approach 4 per cent by the end of the year, in the wake of a landmark 7 per cent pay deal in the metal-working industry reached at the weekend. Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian regional central bank and a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, ruled out interest rate cuts in coming months as a result of the 'stiff breeze' blowing on the inflation front. Mr Muller said the annual rate of price increases was likely to rise to 3.5 to 4 per cent by the end of the year, fuelled by tax increases as well as by latest wage settlements. This compares with the present rate of 2.5 per cent. The weekend pay deal, coming after a week of warning strikes organised by the IG Metall trade union, was reached for 700,000 workers in the pace-setting North Wurttemberg-North Baden region in south-west Germany. Made up of a 6.7 per cent rise plus other top-up payments, the accord is likely to become the norm for nearly 4m west German metal industry workers. The agreement is also expected to be adopted for 1m east German metal-workers.</p>

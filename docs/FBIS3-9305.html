			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to Gabor Kuncze, the Alliance of Free  Democrats' [SZDSZ] nominee for the post of prime minister, the  government is pursuing propaganda that highlights its successes  in the run-up to the elections. Therefore, Kuncze criticized  the government. He said that to provide a complete picture one  also had to talk about negative phenomena. Zsuzsa Ladanyi  reports on the forum for the inhabitants of Kalocsa [central  Hungary].    [Ladanyi] People are filled with fears and this is  frightening for me. [passage omitted] Kuncze added that many  people did not hand over their recommendation slips [for  candidates in the 8 May elections] because they were afraid that  their data could be registered somewhere and be misused. I  think this fear is unfounded and the institutions of democracy  are stable in Hungary, Kuncze said. [passage omitted]    We heard at the forum in Kalocsa that Kuncze had found that  people were paying attention more and more to what the various  parties were saying. Thus, it is important for them to be aware  of the election possibilities. Therefore, it is particularly  sad that discussion programs, which have counterbalanced  government propaganda and in which opinions have been set out  against one another, have been taken off the television. What  happened at state radio [dismissals] will also lead to this.  The next government should guarantee the impartiality of  television and radio and supervise impartiality, Kuncze said.    He said that a high turnout at the elections was extremely  important so that the coalition had sufficient backing and that  extremes do not get into parliament, said the SZDSZ's nominee  for prime minister at the forum for inhabitants of Kalocsa.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / City hopes exceeded by rise in retail sales Retail sales rose faster than City expectations last month, but official figures released yesterday indicated that shops were having to cut prices to attract customers. Sales volumes rose an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between July and August, outpacing City forecasts of 0.3 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said volumes were also 3.7 per cent higher than the same month last year. The volume of sales was biggest in food, clothing and household goods, where price competition is most fierce. Cold weather and competitive pricing boosted sales of autumn fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best month for this financial year. Competitive pricing strategies appeared to affect the seasonally adjusted values of retail sales, which rose at almost the same rate as volumes, by 3.9 per cent from the same month last year. On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to trends, the growth in sales by food retailers far exceeded those in any other sector and the retail sector as a whole. In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers only 0.1 per cent higher. Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that retailers were achieving volume increases by aggressive discounting. 'Retail sales growth is being bought at the expense of profitability,' he said. Recent figures have been giving contradictory evidence about consumer demand. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey, published on Tuesday, showed the fastest rate of growth since December 1993. The CSO's estimate for August sales initially showed a 0.3 per cent fall, However, although that was revised upwards to a 0.1 per cent decline yesterday. Quarterly figures, which smooth out volatility in month-on-month data, show that the volume of sales in July to September was 0.9 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 3.6 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The Treasury welcomed the data as a signal of a continuing steady upward trend in retail sales. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director at the British Retail Consortium, said the figures gave retailers reason to 'look forward with cautious optimism to growth through the Christmas trading period'. But Mr David Hillier, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said: 'Some people are going to get hung up on the increase in volumes being higher than expected.' He said that since both quarterly and annual growth had been hovering around the same levels since the end of 1993, 'growth appears to have reached a plateau'. And while the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail sales after a fall in August, analysts pointed out that consumer spending was not increasing so dramatically.

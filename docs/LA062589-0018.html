			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE AND SAVING WHALES  </P> <P> As reported by The Times, the whale population seems to be in alarmingly low  numbers and the Japanese, who continue to hunt whales, take on the selfish,  clannish attitude of their so-called right to eat whale meat. The Japanese,  despite all of their progress in joining the rest of the world successfully  economically, have failed on ecological matters. They seem to consider it their  divine right to decimate these magnificent creatures while at the same time  turning a deaf ear to world opinion.  </P> <P> It has come to the point where I watch my Japanese television, drive my  Japanese car, and play music on my Japanese piano with deep regret.  </P> <P> MATTHEW HETZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

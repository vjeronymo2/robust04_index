			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Aleksandr Mineyev]    [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun -- Russia and the United States  have today practically agreed the text of a draft UN Security  Council resolution in connection with the nuclear problem of the  DPRK. This was announced by Andrey Kozyrev and Warren  Christopher, the heads of the foreign policy departments of the  two countries at a news conference in the Russian Embassy in  Brussels after the talks, which were held here.    This joint initiative was discussed on the instructions of  the presidents of Russia and the United States, Kozyrev said.  As a result: There has occurred a drawing-together and  coincidence of approaches on all the fundamental questions, and  only the drafting work remains for the representatives of the  two countries in New York.    The main aim of this initiative, in the words of the Russian  minister, is to get the DPRK to observe the regime of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The draft resolution will  clearly indicate that sanctions against Pyongyang are inevitable  in about 30 days if the DPRK does not take positive steps. To  help it take such steps and open the doors to positive movement,  Kozyrev said, it is proposed to use the opportunity of the  conference and already in the very near future, send the  relevant invitations. In this way, these 30 days should be  used, including by means of convening the conference, in order  to avoid sanctions which, of course, are an extreme means.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An international fleet of planes repatriated thousands of Mauritanian and  Senegalese fleeing bloody communal rioting in both West African countries.  Mauritanian refugees in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, boarded planes from  France, Morocco and Spain for the 300-mile flight to the Mauritanian capital,  Nouakchott. The aircraft then brought back to Dakar some of the 7,000  Senegalese who had taken refuge in a mosque in Nouakchott. Both capitals were  reported calm after a week of violence, sparked by a dispute over border land,  that left more than 200 people dead.  </P></p>

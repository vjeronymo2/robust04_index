			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hil raises funds for German plant Hil Technologies, a designer of electrically powered commercial vehicles, is offering 25m Pounds 1 shares at par to raise funds to build a manufacturing and assembly plant on a former Russian military base near Eisenach, Germany. The unquoted company hopes to raise Pounds 18m in the UK and Hong Kong. It needs a minimum of Pounds 15m to trigger an offer of Pounds 45m towards the project from Treuhand, the privatisation agency operating in former East Germany. The company grew out of Hil Electric, which raised Pounds 500,000 under the business expansion scheme to fund the design of electrically powered commercial vans. Hil believes there is a potential volume market for environmentally friendly commercial vehicles. Its aim is to begin construction of the plant in early 1995. The first phase of the plant, which would be operated by a subsidiary, Hil Automobilwerk Eisenach, would be an assembly facility producing 45,000 units by 1998. Hil hopes customers will include large fleet vehicle owners attracted on commercial grounds as well as ecologically minded companies and institutions. Hil's prospectus has been sent to 2,500 institutions and individual ethical investors. Closing date is November 30.</p>

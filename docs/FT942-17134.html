			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper surrenders gains - Market Report COPPER prices surrendered early gains at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon to end only just above last Thursday's levels. But other metals picked themselves off their lows by the close. 'It was a very mixed day - not a great deal of business, and nothing going in any direction for long,' commented one trader. He suggested there might have been 'a bit of an Easter hangover'. Copper prices struggled after an inconclusive break above Dollars 1,910 a tonne for three months delivery. By the close of the after-hours 'kerb' session the price was threatening to fall below the Dollars 1,900 level and test downside targets around Dollars 1,880. ALUMINIUM prices moved in the other direction, the three months pushing through a Dollars 1,310 target, although fairly stiff resistance was found above that level. Late commission house selling trimmed off some of the market's gains and final business was at Dollars 1,314, up Dollars 5 up from Thursday. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures managed to stage a sharp recovery in the afternoon after a troubled start. The July position finished Dollars 22 higher at Dollars 1,385 after begining in the minus column following the overnight reverse in New York. 'It managed to hold this morning though, and then there was aggressive buying from one quarter,' one dealer said, adding that that had prompted investment funds to move in.

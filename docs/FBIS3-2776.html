			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and concurrently foreign minister,  held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at  the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning.    Qian Qichen said: The meeting between President Jiang Zemin  and President Clinton in Seattle last November marked a new  phase of Sino-U.S. relations. Since then, a favorable momentum  for improving relations between the two countries has emerged,  with the two sides increasing contacts and expanding  cooperation. More than a month ago, we met in Paris and  discussed every aspect of Sino-U.S. relations. Both sides  expressed their wish to make progress through active efforts.  We hope that Mr. Secretary of State's current visit will  achieve concrete results [ju ti cheng guo 0367 7555 2052 2654].    Qian Qichen said: "We are deeply disappointed at some things  which happened prior to Mr. Secretary of State's visit. A  senior U.S. official came to China to prepare for the secretary  of state's visit and took actions that interfered in China's  internal affairs without regard for Chinese law. Thereafter,  the U.S. media played up [da si xuan ran 1129 5127 8694 2676]  the event, and U.S. government officials attacked China time and  again in their remarks. All these acts clearly go against  President Clinton's statement in Seattle in which he emphasized  that the United States supports a strong, stable, and prosperous  China; they also disrupt [gan rao 1626 2371] the secretary of  state's current visit."    Qian Qichen pointed out: "Sincerity on both sides and a good  atmosphere are needed for dialogue. I hope to conduct a frank  [tan shuai 0982 3764] dialogue with the secretary of state in an  atmosphere of mutual respect so as to enhance mutual  understanding, reduce troubles, and avoid confrontation, and so  that our dialogue will help improve Sino-U.S. relations and make  Mr. Secretary of State's current visit a success."    Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side on issues of  concern to the U.S. side. Qian Qichen said: China is a country  that stresses the rule of law. We can only do what Chinese laws  allow us to do.    Qian Qichen also elaborated to the U.S. side on issues of  concern to the Chinese side, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan  and the sanctions it has imposed on China.    On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug  trafficking, Qian Qichen noted: China and the United States  have signed the "Sino-U.S. Memorandum on Cooperation in Fighting  Against Drug Trafficking." In January of 1990, a U.S. court,  without regard to China's judicial sovereignty and repeated  representations, granted political asylum to Wang Zongxiao, a  criminal in the Jinliyu drug smuggling case, who had gone to the  United States to testify. This has erected an obstacle to  bilateral cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.    In discussing most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Qian  Qichen said: Mutual extension of MFN status by China and the  United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial  arrangement made by the two sides according to agreements on  trade relations between the two countries; it is the basis of  normal Sino-U.S. trade relations. Disruption of this basis will  ruin the development prospects for Sino-U.S. economic relations  and trade. This will bring harm to both China and the United  States. The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any linkage  between trade and issues that have nothing to do with trade.    Christopher said: Both the United States and China are  countries that shoulder global responsibilities. Both sides  share common interests in maintaining peace and security. The  two countries share each other's views or hold similar views on  many global and regional issues. Mutually beneficial economic  relations and trade between the two countries are expanding, and  they are contributing to the prosperity of both countries. A  strong, stable, and prosperous China conforms to the national  interests of the United States. President Clinton hopes that  the United States and China will build a more constructive  relationship.    The talks proceeded in a frank [tan shuai 0982 3764] and  businesslike [ren zhen 6126 4176] atmosphere.    Present at the talks were Vice Foreign Minister Tian  Zengpei;  Xu Huizi, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army; U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary  of State Lynn Davis; and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner.    After the talks, Qian Qichen hosted a luncheon in honor of  Christopher and his delegation.</p>

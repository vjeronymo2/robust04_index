			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko: "Where Do People Get Money?"; </F> first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The reality of Russia's situation is probably much  different from what is generally perceived. Developing and  prospering parallel to the deep crisis of material production is  a vast unregistered service sector.    According to a widespread view, the slowing of the inflation  rate in recent months is caused by the more frequent nonpayment  of wages and salaries at enterprises and organizations. This is  confirmed by bank statistics which show that cash money  circulation is falling in Russia. According to official data,  real wages and real minimum pensions are decreasing, which, it  is generally believed, account for 85-90% of the monetary  income of the population. But according to the same data, real  cash incomes of the population... grow (by 12% in four  months  of this year). Bank statistics register the growth of physical  persons' deposits. The personnel at currency exchange offices in  Moscow testify that each day a great number of their clients  convert rubles into dollars; the sums exchanges are frequently  within the limits of average monthly earnings. Finally, the data  from the State Committee of Statistics of Russia on the volume  of the sale of foodstuffs indicate the growth of the  population's solvent demand.    <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-066-43A>      Figure </FIG>    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Volume of Sales in Stores with Various Forms of Ownership and at City |  |Markets was as Follows (in tons)                                          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |March 1993    |March 1994    |April 1993    |April 19994   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beef          |435.7         |438.1         |408.1         |418.4         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pork          |255.1         |363.5         |251.1         |342.5         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Boiled sausage|196.2         |210.0         |196.8         |213.7         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Half-smoked s-|145.4         |192.0         |151.4         |183.6         |  |ausage        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Butter        |153.8         |205.3         |161.6         |201.6         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vegetable oil |130.9         |149.8         |130.7         |148.6         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sour cream    |167.9         |190.1         |177.8         |185.7         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cheese        |55.5          |86.9          |66.4          |87.8          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sugar         |254.6         |275.2         |282.5         |286.1         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pastry        |71.3          |75.1          |71.5          |76.9          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tea           |18.7          |28.2          |19.1          |28.6          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Macaroni      |35.3          |57.1          |37.3          |58.0          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Potatoes      |563.6         |601.1         |584.0         |587.0         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vodka (thousa-|324.2         |307.6         |323.0         |286.4         |  |nd liters)    |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      A drawback to this table is the fact that its figures do not  cover all of Russia. They show the volume of sales in foodstuffs  in an artificially limited number of stores and markets in only  132 Russian towns which the Statistics Committee has observed  for a number of years. But this data is comparable since the  situation has been studied on a regular basis.    Judging by this data, demand does not switch from more  expensive foodstuffs to cheaper ones, for instance, from sausage  and pastry to macaroni and bread. Contrary to the generally  accepted view, the cost of foodstuffs relative to the real wages  of the population (minus taxes and with a correction for the  inflation index) has decreased by 13-15% on average.  Contrary  to the same view, the growth of the sales of macaroni and bread  does not exceed the growth of the sales of cheese, sausage,  butter and meat. There was not even a complete switch to  potatoes from private kitchen-gardens, and more potatoes were  bought in the trading network than a year ago. As for the  decrease of the sale of vodka, this evidently testifies to the  growth of sale outside stores.    Where do people get money? What do workers live on whose  enterprises have not paid their wages for 3-6 months? And,  incidentally, whence such a growth of foodstuffs when the output  of the food industry is officially stated as decreasing and the  import is falling?    A considerable number of Russia's citizens have found  alternative sources of subsistence which are not registered  officially. Yuri Yurkov, Chairman of Russia's State Committee of  Statistics, with whom we discussed this problem described these  sources as "handicrafts" in the sense that they belong in the  sphere of services: various kinds of repairs and construction,  consultations, lectures and similar activities. Yurkov also  expressed his doubt that the rate in the reduction of the index  of the gross domestic product calculated by his committee on the  basis of official data is close to reality. This is a truly  historic statement, since it is the first time that the  economist in charge of statistic agencies admits that his own  conviction differs from official material which he himself  publishes. The structure of the gross domestic product shows a  sharp reduction of industrial output and an equally sharp  increase of the share of retail turnover and paid services. The  chairman of the State Committee of Statistics of the Russian  Federation said that he feels that the share of paid services  grows much faster than we record it.    The cash turnover in the taxless sector of the economy is  evidently not big enough so far that it can affect the inflation  index in the country. Besides that, as Yurkov justly said, the  money paid in this sector is really and truly earned. Here no  products are produced which cannot be sold immediately and no  services are offered which do not have a constantly enhanced  demand.    The chairman of Russia's Statistics Committee believes that  the original financial source in the taxless sector of the  economy are the incomes of participants in foreign-economic  activity. The effectiveness of export operations compared to the  extreme inefficiency of domestic production is accompanied,  first, by the release of a considerable share of resources which  were formerly processed in Russia and, second, by the transfer  to foreign-economic activity of a considerable number of  initiative and highly professional workers. Besides that the  import of cheap food into Russia from and through "near abroad"  countries which is not registered by official statistics has  evidently proved profitable. That is why stores have foodstuffs  to offer despite the fact that officially registered imports and  their domestic production are decreasing. The hearings on this  subject conducted by the State Duma at the end of April showed  that, following the introduction of new import tariffs, the  state has been practically deprived of income from imports which  have become illegal and are mainly effected through the  transparent borders of the "near abroad states."    The growing incomes of the participants in foreign-economic  activity stimulate the domestic demand for high-quality and  costly services in various sectors. The illegal character of  profit is evidently one of the causes of the deep-going  stratification of Russian society. To people who cannot declare  the source of their incomes the speed of the use of money is  probably a more important factor than effectiveness. They are  threatened simultaneously by law-enforcement agencies and the  criminal world, and that is evidently why consumption receives  more than is required by rationalism and simply the norms of  behavior in society.    Persons servicing the thin layer of super-rich "new  Russians"  form the present "middle class" (middle in the level of incomes)  whose requirements are more modest but whose number is greater.  Their requirements are, in turn, satisfied by less well-off  categories of the population. The involvement in this chain  allows a considerable number of our citizens to exist tolerably  well and sometimes quite comfortably. Russia in fact continues  to live on oil dollars, the only thing that has changed being  the system of the distribution of incomes.    A considerable number of people, continuing to be on the  staff of enterprises which are "latent bankrupts," have taxless  sources of income which sometimes exceed the official, taxed  earnings. A part of these incomes is converted into U.S.  dollars, especially at the initial stage of redistribution,  which are turned into rubles when required. The "junior serving  personnel" of this sector, more inclined to keep their savings  "in the sock," on the contrary convert the surplus of earned  rubles into dollars. The vast cash dollar turnover of the  economy (it is assessed at about six billion dollars in Moscow)  has allowed so far to support the appearance of relative  financial stabilization in the ruble space.    It is interesting to note from the psychological point of  view that although the Russians treat US dollars as a means of  payment, even preferable to rubles, they often do not regard  them as money. Dollars are spent easier than rubles, as if they  are not earned but fall from the sky, as bonuses did under  Soviet power in addition to the main earnings. This ease of  spending is probably one of the reasons for the incredibly high  dollar prices of consumer goods in the Russian Federation.    If this concept is correct, the overbalance of the  "handicraft" sector, which was absolutely untypical for former  Russia, probably threatens us with much faster, sharper and  irreversible changes than those with which we are ready to  reconcile ourselves. Nor are any prospects visible in the event  of the fall in demand for our resources on world markets or the  exhaustion of these resources.

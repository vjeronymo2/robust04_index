			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Toyota signals hopes to step up China role Toyota yesterday gave the strongest indication yet of its interest in setting up vehicle manufacturing operations in China, with the announcement that it would establish a support centre for component suppliers there. This came as Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Japan's largest car company, flew to Beijing yesterday, with other senior Toyota executives on a five-day tour to strengthen ties with Chinese leaders and investigate the market. Mr Toyoda, who is leading a group of Japanese vehicle parts executives, will discuss the plan with the Chinese government and local vehicle makers. The establishment of a supplier support centre is in response to calls by the Chinese government for foreign manufacturers to help the country develop its motor vehicle parts industry. In July, China announced a moratorium on all new vehicle manufacturing facilities until 1996 and invited foreign companies to extend support in building up the country's components industry. The establishment of a supplier support centre, where Toyota engineers would extend technical assistance to parts suppliers, is not in itself a big commitment by Toyota to the Chinese market. However, the move reflects Toyota's interest in establishing manufacturing facilities in China, once the government moratorium on new facilities has been lifted, and reflects its belief in the potential of the Chinese market. 'It is a step looking towards the future and our ambitions for the Chinese market,' a Toyota representative said yesterday. The company is considering setting up a joint venture manufacturing facility in China, he said. Toyota sold about 50,000 vehicles last year in China, or a quarter of all Japanese vehicle sales in China and about 3 per cent of the entire Chinese market of 1.5m. The Japanese company provides technical assistance to a bus manufacturer in Shenyang and an affiliate, Daihatsu Motor, extends similar help to a passenger car maker in Tianjin. Toyota itself, though, has been slow to express an interest in manufacturing in China. It was not among a handful of foreign car companies - including Peugeot, Volkswagen and Chrysler - which were quick to set up joint ventures in China while such investment was still open. However, the company says it now feels the market has enough potential to justify local manufacturing.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KITCHEN CABINET: NEW YEAR SEES RETURN OF FAVORITE COOKWARE  </P> <P> Searching for a good contemporary cookware? I used to recommend All-Clad  cookware with confidence, having proven its cooking efficiency and cleaning  ease. However when the line started disappearing from market shelves, I was  disheartened. And so were some cookware shop owners. The good news from  All-Clad Metalcrafters Inc., of Canonsburg, Penn., is that its  precision-crafted cookware line is back in full production using all new  machinery, thanks to the new takeover. Favored by professional chefs, the  multi-ply cookware had limited distribution in the past and wasn't widely  available.  </P> <P> Now here's the only American cookware company (and one of only two in the  world) that produces and bonds its own metals under one roof. As a matter of  fact, it is the only company in this country that manufactures four types of  cookware: copper, anodized aluminum, aluminum and stainless steel.  </P> <P> Every piece starts with a highly polished surface interior of 18/10 stainless  steel bonded onto a thick core of pure aluminum for even heat distribution and  retention. These layers are bonded to a wear-resistant outer layer, which could  be any of the four metal types previously mentioned.  </P> <P> For old-world charm and elegance, there's Cop-R-Chef ($366 for five-piece  starter set, $160 for oval au gratin and $150 for oval omelet pan). It's tough  on the outside with an extra thick copper layer and easy to clean with its thin  stainless steel cooking surface that never needs to re-tinned. The solid brass  handles are designed to stay cool even after lengthy cooking periods. Another  style is LTD. ($260 for five-piece set), featuring a charcoal black exterior  made of hardcoat anodized aluminum with resistance to scratch and chipping. One  of my favorite open stock vessels here is the wok with a long handle and  brightly polished domed cover.  </P> <P> Master-Chef Cookware ($252 for six-piece set) offers abrasion-resistant brushed  aluminum alloy exterior and same stainless steel exterior and aluminum core.  </P> <P> And then there's Magna-Core Multi-purpose Cookware ($220 for five-piece set),  which has seven bonded layers of magnetic and conductive metals, making it  ideal for induction cooking as well as conventional gas and electric ranges.  The pieces are highly attractive with their shiny steel polish.  </P> <P>  All All-Clad cookware types are available at Jordano's (Santa Barbara) and  Williams Sonoma. The LTD cookware is available at Bullock's and Montana  Mercantile (Santa Monica). Bed, Bath and Beyond (West L.A.) has Master Chef and  LTD cookware.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who says microwave dinnerware and cookware have to be plain white ceramic or  plastic utensil? Go for more sophisticated porcelain service with microwave  foods, whether they be dishes reheated or started from scratch. The new wave of  microwave and conventional-oven safe cookware are available in pretty pastel  patterns.  </P> <P> Fans of Villeroy &amp; Boch patterns would be happy to know about the  additional new pieces that have been adapted for microwave cooking. Used with  matching dinnerware groupings, or as a complement to other china, the patterns  are Albertina, Mariposa and the popular Amapola and Basket (from $12.50 to  $175). The cookware collection includes a variety of convenient sizes from  single serving dishes to large casseroles and baking dishes.  </P> <P>  Villeroy &amp; Boch Microwave Cookware are available at Villeroy &amp; Boch  Creation store (Beverly Hills) and Bullock's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fairwinds Dinnerware (from $40 for 20-piece set) consists of a wide variety of  white porcelain pieces with fine floral prints in varied colors around the rim.  All are dishwasher safe, does not stain and detergent proof. They can go from  freezer to oven to table and retain heat well.  </P> <P> Additional serving items are included in Fairwinds' Porcelain Plus line, which  are designed with soft round corners that prevent hot spots when microwaving.  The open stock units consist of various size rounded casseroles with cover,  covered soup dishes, stackable cooker, divided dinner plates, beverage server,  rectangular bakers, mugs and squarish hot lunch plates. The pieces are break  and chip resistant; also the company offers a one-year warranty against  manufacturing defects.  </P> <P>  The Fairwinds Dinnerware and Porcelain Plus are available at May Company.  </P> <P> Another porcelain microwaveable set is Noritake's freezer to oven to table  collection called Gala Cuisine. The full range covers regular china pieces  including an oval vegetable baker, a quiche/pie dish, a souffle/serving bowl,  shallow as well as deep covered casseroles, roaster/baker. There are five  patterns in the Gala Cuisine line, basically white with colored patterns:  Copper Bud in blue and copper-red trim, multihued American Flowers, Clearlake  with simple scalloped blue lines, blue Dutch Tile and the attractive pastel  floral Coram pattern.  </P> <P>  Noritake's Gala Cuisine is available at Greco Gifts (San Pedro), Robinson's,  Broadway, May Co. and Buffum's.  </P> <P> </P></p>

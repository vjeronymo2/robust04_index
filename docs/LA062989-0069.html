			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILLMORE'S BENEFIT BANG  </P> <P> If the Fourth of July in your neighborhood sounds like the shelling of Da Nang,  you might look to the otherwise quiet town of Fillmore -- and its churches,  charities and civic organizations -- for an explanation.  </P> <P> In addition to picnics and patriotism, the Fourth in Fillmore means fireworks  sales. And fireworks sales mean a reliable source of cash for perennially  strapped nonprofit groups, which must vie with each other year-round for the  limited funds available in a town of 11,400.  </P> <P> For 17 years, Fillmore has bucked the anti-fireworks trend in California,  opening its streets to droves of residents from Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa  Barbara counties -- anyone on the lookout for such non-explosive delights as  sparklers, whistlers and spinners. Firecrackers and skyrockets are banned.  </P> <P> Thirty-eight of the 85 cities in Los Angeles County allow fireworks sales;  among jurisdictions banning their sale are the city and county of Los Angeles.  In Santa Barbara County, only Santa Maria permits them. And Fillmore is the  only one of Ventura County's 10 cities to allow them.  </P> <P> Despite the misgivings of some local fire officials, who would prefer to see no  sales, many fireworks vendors in Fillmore say their organizations would be in  dire straits without them. Thanks to a city ordinance passed in 1972, they are  able to turn the town into a star-spangled enclave of red, white and blue -- as  well as fluorescent orange and chartreuse -- fireworks stands the week before  each Fourth.  </P> <P> "You can only have so many carwashes," said Dale Crockett, a member of the  Fillmore Chamber of Commerce's board of directors. Crockett hopes to help the  chamber take in $10,000 to $12,000 this week, with the money going toward the  organization's rent and building upkeep, publishing tourist information and  paying the salary of its one employee.  </P> <P> Other organizations hope to bolster their coffers for such causes as feeding  the hungry and homeless, donating eyeglasses to the poor, outfitting the town's  Little League teams, providing college scholarships and maintaining local  churches.  </P> <P> In what is mainly a good-natured cooperative effort, they hawk the wares of  Pyrodyne American Corp. -- Freedom Fireworks and Magic Dragon Fireworks -- from  18 plywood huts along California 126.  </P> <P> Terry Metzler, who spends much of her time at the Fillmore United Way Volunteer  Services stand, can't afford to lose sleep worrying about the competition.  After all, her husband, Michael, the Sunrisers Rotary Club treasurer, is making  his fireworks pitch less than a mile down the road. Both will moonlight in the  booth run by their church, St. Francis of Assisi. And as Fillmore Chamber of  Commerce members, it just wouldn't be neighborly not to pop in for a stint or  two there, too.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Plenty to Go Around'  </P> <P> "Oh, we're not out to outsell each other or get all the customers," said  Metzler, whose organization uses much of its fireworks income (it's hoping for  $30,000 this year) to help feed the hungry and homeless. "There's plenty to go  around."  </P> <P> In fact, during the town's eight-day boom, it's not unheard-of for people who  have sold all their stock to hop across the road and ask neighboring vendors  for some spare fireworks to tide them over until the next shipment arrives,  said Fillmore resident Mike Brown, who helps run the Foursquare Church's stand.  </P> <P> But one aggressive vendor is all business, to the dismay of other groups.  </P> <P> Mike Nichols, pastor of Beth-El Baptist Church, has taken out advertisements in  area newspapers offering free fireworks and discount prices, and he has 20  people at a time manning his 64-foot stand, the biggest in town.  </P> <P> "Some people in town are grumbling that I'm trying to undercut their sales, but  that's not true," he said. "The more people we can draw in, the more their  businesses will do, too."  </P> <P> Nichols has gone a step beyond the usual fireworks-stand security guard: He has  equipped the stand with an interior and exterior infra-red alarm system. And  few would-be burglars would be inclined to grapple with burly,  camouflaged-clothed security guard Pete Dempsey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Good Cause'  </P> <P> "We are selling fireworks for a good cause, but we have to be realistic, too.  And that means we have to advertise and we have to take steps to really protect  our stands from people who want to steal our stuff," he said.  </P> <P> Security is just one problem stemming from the sales.  </P> <P> Pat Askren, chief of Fillmore's volunteer Fire Department, complains that many  who buy fireworks don't stay and use them within the city limits, as the law  requires. Askren has asked the city to curtail the sale of fireworks, taking a  stance he acknowledges as unpopular in a town full of struggling charity  organizations.  </P> <P> "I hate to see kids get hurt with fireworks, and I don't really feel a lot of  the parents are smart enough to watch their children," said Askren, who has  seen children seriously burned because they stepped on still-smoldering  fireworks.  </P> <P> "But people in California think it's their God-given right to set off  fireworks, and if we don't give them the safe-and-sane stuff, they'll go out  and get the big stuff. Then we could have some real problems," he said.  </P></p>

The source, declining to be named, said the paper was the  Palestinian version of a draft understanding, details of which  were released earlier the same day in Israel.    If Israel accepts the latest document, the negotiations  could  result in agreement within two or three weeks, he said.    The PLO earlier denied Israeli claims that they had drawn up  a draft agreement on launching Palestinian autonomy and said  negotiators still had to hammer out an accord.    "We are trying in good faith to reach an agreement but,  unfortunately, we have not reached it," said PLO negotiator  Nabil Sha'th.    "We are going back to Taba in the old format of the  negotiations," he told journalists, referring to the Egyptian  Red Sea resort where the autonomy talks opened two months ago  before moving to Cairo.    Egypt wound down its mediation efforts after a three-day  meeting here of a liaison committee headed by Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and executive committee member Mahmud  'Abbas for the PLO.    Sha'th refused to comment on a draft understanding and said:  "Our agreement was not to publish anything and anybody who is  publishing anything is violating the agreement."    An Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of  Jericho, under the September 13 autonomy accord, was to have  started on December 13 but the deadline passed because of three  main stumbling blocks.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel are at  loggerheads over the size of Jericho, the control of  international crossing points and security for Jewish settlers  in the Gaza Strip.    According to Israel's draft, the size of an autonomous  Jericho will be doubled from the original offer and the border  crossings into Jordan and Egypt will be jointly manned but  Israel would have the final say.    But PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said Thursday in Amman that his  organisation had rejected the Israeli draft.</p>

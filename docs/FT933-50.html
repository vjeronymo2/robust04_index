			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet deal welcomed THE long-awaited sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer division by Grand Metropolitan finally took place yesterday, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle clinching the deal in a move warmly welcomed by industry analysts. S&amp;N will pay Pounds 736m for the 1,600-strong chain of public houses and restaurants, which at a stroke gives it the competitive presence in south-east England it has so far lacked. However, the group will have to sell or otherwise untie some 748 houses from its enlarged estate to comply with the government's Beer Orders. S&amp;N shares retreated on the news, with inevitable worries over the Pounds 405m one-for-four rights issue the main culprit. The issue, which is of stock units automatically convertible into new ordinary shares, is in two stages at a total price equivalent to 390p per share. S&amp;N finished the day 11 off at 459p in turnover of 2.9m. Analysts broadly agreed with S&amp;N that the deal will be earnings neutral this year. For GrandMet, the deal was the third big surprise to hit the market in the past four sessions, following on from the senior management changes announced last Friday and the Pounds 175m restructuring charge on Monday. Industry specialists said the S&amp;N price was a fair one and the deal benefited from relief that Chef &amp; Brewer was not parcelled off, as had been predicted at one time. GrandMet shares leapt on the news but faded to close a net 2 off at 416p. Turnover was another considerable 8.1m. Whitbread had long been the market favourite to land Chef &amp; Brewer. However, specialists now expect the group to turn its attention to the Harvester chain, owned by Forte, which is also concentrated in the south-east, and this was reflected in Whitbread 'A' shares, 12 lower at 529p. The asking price for Harvester could be in excess of Pounds 100m. Some optimists were even suggesting that an announcement could accompany Forte's results this morning. Forte shares were steady at 237p.</p>

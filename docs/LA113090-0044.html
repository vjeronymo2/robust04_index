			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAND-WRINGING BY DEMOCRATS  </P> <P> Ex-Gov. Jerry Brown, chairman of the state Democratic Party, decries the fact  that registered Democrats did not turn out in sufficient numbers in the last  election to help their candidates ("Clarion Call for a New and Fair Deal,"  Column Left, Commentary, Nov. 18).  </P> <P> Perhaps if the Democratic hierarchy would pay more attention to the grass-roots  Democrats instead of making them spear carriers and fund funnels, plain old  Democrats would be willing and anxious to vote.  </P> <P> Jerry ought to hark back to the days of the lively California Democratic  Council (CDC) when the club movement had some clout, and candidates eagerly  sought its endorsement. There's no substitute for involvement.  </P> <P> RAY KOVITZ  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

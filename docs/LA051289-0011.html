			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH WINS OK TO REBUILD HALL  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has voted to allow the Neighborhood  Church to build a social hall on its bluff-top property at Malaga Cove.  </P> <P> The vote on Tuesday brought to a close eight years of controversy between the  church, a popular site for weddings and other social activities, and its  neighbors, who said the addition would increase traffic and noise.  </P> <P> After numerous public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City  Council, the church and the neighbors, who banded together as the Malaga Cove  Homeowners Assn., agreed to 21 conditions under which the permit was granted.  Among other things, the conditions limit the church to two weddings on  Saturdays and ban Sunday weddings.  </P></p>

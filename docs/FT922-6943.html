			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Honda hit by fall in domestic sales - Changes planned to give local management more autonomy HONDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday reported a 1 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit to Y130.76bn (Dollars 1.01bn), and announced changes to its management structure to give executives in the US and Europe more autonomy. In common with other Japanese car makers, Honda has suffered from the downturn in the domestic market, where new registrations were 5.1 per cent down January to April, compared with the same period last year. But the company is still planning to expand its share of foreign markets. It said net profit for the current year is likely to fall by about Y5bn from last year's Y64.9bn, itself down 14.9 per cent, partly because of costs related to the commencement of UK production, scheduled for this October. A series of management promotions and title changes have created four clear divisions of Honda's car business, covering Japan, the US, Europe and 'others,' with each of the regions apparently given more control over local design, research and marketing. 'We felt that we had to make our management more flexible in these regions. Basically, the international car market is very stable, with no area promising rapid growth, and we have to adjust to this stable growth era,' Honda said. The company's consolidated sales rose 2.1 per cent to Y4,391bn, with a 3.9 per cent increase in car sales and a 2 per cent fall in revenue from motorcycles, even though there was a 6.4 per cent increase in sales by volume. The company said motorcycle sales were helped by strong demand from other Asian countries, although revenue was hurt by an appreciation of the yen. Parent company pre-tax profits, more exposed to the weak domestic car market, fell by 21.3 per cent to Y66.9bn on a 4 per cent increase in sales to Y2,911bn. For the current year, the parent is expecting slight sales growth at Y2,920bn and profits flat at Y67bn. 'We are not very optimistic in our estimations for the domestic market this year. Total sales in the market will probably be at the same level as last year's 7.43m units. Sales will be at that level or a little lower,' the company said. The company sold about 669,000 cars in Japan last year, unchanged from the previous period, 953,000 in the US, up from 952,000, and 196,000 in Europe, up from 173,000, while the 'others' accounted for 143,000, an increase of 22,000 units. As with many leading Japanese companies, Honda is planning to reduce capital spending, with the target this year Y200bn, down from Y237.8bn last year.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Gould to quit politics for academia Mr Bryan Gould, a leading Labour party figure of the past decade, yesterday announced that he was quitting politics to return to his native New Zealand to take up an academic post. Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs claimed that Mr Gould's decision to become vice-chancellor at the University of Waikato was a blow to Labour's fortunes and a sign that the party did not have credible policies. There were mixed reactions in the Labour party. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said Mr Gould's decision reflected 'bad political judgment and a certain tinge of bitterness' at having been defeated by Mr John Smith in the party's leadership battle two years ago. Mr Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, said that Mr Gould's decision was a 'disaster' for the Labour party. He added: 'His talents have been ignored and sidelined. We need every bit of talent like Bryan's we can get.' Mr Gould will resign his seat in Dagenham from September 1. He had a majority of 6,773 at the last general election. Mr Gould, Labour's campaign co-ordinator at the 1987 general election, did not lose the opportunity to attack Mr John Smith's leadership - especially its 'espousal of monetarist policies' and its emphasis on 'prudence rather than radical reform'. He said: 'While I very much welcome the prospect of a Labour government it is, I fear, unlikely to be a government which I could serve in or support with a great deal of enthusiasm. 'The two major parties have now moved so much back into the centre that there is very little ideological difference between them.' After his defeat in the 1992 leadership election Mr Gould quit the shadow cabinet, attacking the party's pro-European policy and urging it to adopt policies geared to job creation. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said Mr Gould's decision to quit was 'an admission that Labour cannot win and does not deserve to win'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'It is a sad day when Bryan Gould believes the modern Labour party cannot provide such an original mind with neither home nor future.' Mr Smith praised Mr Gould's 'distinguished contribution' to Labour politics, and wished him every success.</p>

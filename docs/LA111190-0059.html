			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> What do you mean the election is over? No more negative ad campaigns? No more  back-stabbing, mudslinging "I'm-gonna clean-up-this-state" rhetoric? No more  candidates versus the big corporation, greedy land-developing, old-boy network  toxic polluters? Oh, what will I do? Same thing I did last election -- not vote  out of disgust!  </P> <P> PATRICK CERVANTES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Background and Topics for Discussion  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The White House formed the IITF to articulate and implement its vision for the NII. The Task Force is chaired by Ronald H. Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, and consists of three committees_the Telecommunications Policy Committee, the Information Policy Committee, and the Committee on Applications and Technology. Working with the private sector, the IITF committees are seeking to develop telecommunications, information and technology policies to promote applications that best suit the needs of the United States. Within the Telecommunications Policy Committee, chaired by Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, is the International Telecommunications Working Group, chaired by Carol C. Darr, Deputy General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In recognizing that the NII will be a part of a much larger Global Information Infrastructure, the Administration believes that the principles that inform our view of the NII also must guide the development of a GII. To that end, the Administration has identified five principles essential for the creation of a global information infrastructure: &bull;Encourage private investment; &bull;Promote competition; &bull;Create a flexible regulatory framework; &bull;Provide open access; and &bull;Ensure universal service. The International Telecommunications Working Group recognizes that any re-examination of U.S. international telecommunications policy must take into account the international dimension of technological convergence. Measures adopted by other governments in response to this convergence are likely to affect a broad range of issues related to the interconnection of the U.S. NII with foreign networks, such as access to, and interoperability of networks, investment, foreign aid and assistance, technology transfer, and evolving international regulations. In response to these issues, the International Working Group, through six informal subgroups, has identified six areas that should be addressed: &bull;U.S. participation in international and regional organizations and standard-setting bodies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Foreign trade barriers affecting the U.S. industry and the development of the NII and, as a related question, the role of foreign entities in the implementation of infrastructure; &bull;International aspects of pending telecommunications reform legislation; &bull;Impact of U.S. export controls; &bull;Electronic information exchanges between U.S. and foreign research organizations; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

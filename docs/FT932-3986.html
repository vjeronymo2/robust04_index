			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Reproducing a positive image It can be a laborious process to get a copy of a photographic print if the original negative has been lost. Japanese film specialist Fujifilm has developed a machine which can produce photographic reproductions of a print or transparency in minutes. The machine uses a thermal development and transfer technology similar to that used in colour photocopiers. An image of the original picture is taken on to film and then transferred on to paper. However, the picture is a true photo, with a much higher resolution than the images produced by a colour copier. The process also has environmental advantages as the traditional 'wet' chemical process - where a series of chemical baths are used to develop the film - is no longer needed. Fujifilm believes the Pictrostat 2000 machine will find a place in rapid film processing outlets. Fujifilm: Japan, tel: 03 3406 2111; UK, tel: 071 586 5900.</p>

She said the FA-18 Hornet jets based at El Toro hold the practice  sessions several times a year. They will be landing as if the runway at the air  base were the deck of an aircraft carrier.  </P> <P> The exercises are scheduled from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and  Wednesday, according to the spokeswoman.  </P></p>

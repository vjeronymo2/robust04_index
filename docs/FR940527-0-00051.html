			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the State does adopt and submit the anticipated rule revisions, USEPA intends to rulemake promptly on such submittal. Some of the anticipated revisions are discussed below in the context of other comments. To the extent that these revisions simply revisit issues already discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking and do not raise new issues, USEPA can publish notice of final action on such revisions without another notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters found the visible emissions limitation on storage piles to be unreasonably strict. This limitation, in Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;07(B)(6), permits no visible emissions from storage piles except for 13 minutes per hour. These commenters noted the likelihood that continuous equipment operation would lead to continuous visible emissions, and so the limit ``is impossible to achieve.'' One commenter presented a survey of visible emissions readings at storage piles in which 21 of the 22 hours of readings exceeded the limit. This commenter also noted that every part of the Ohio EPA data set used to support its rule development that was taken of vehicular traffic at a coal pile showed greater than 13 minutes per hour of visible emissions. This commenter was further concerned that Ohio apparently intended to apply the above limitation to load-in operations, which the commenter believes should be given a separate opacity limit. Another commenter also stated that it had taken readings which ``indicated that,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> with RACM in place <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (emphasis in original), the operations on [an observed storage pile] could not comply'' with the limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A related concern regards the method used to evaluate visible emissions from storage piles. One commenter objected that the question of whether Method 22 readings should be taken at a fixed point or a moving point depending on the movement of a bulldozer is not addressed in any formal guidance and is based on ```guidance' consist[ing] primarily of a memo written by John Summerhays'' of USEPA Region V. The commenter notes further that the ``Summerhays memo'' is inconsistent, insofar as it recommends that visible emissions for roadways be read at a fixed point but for storage pile be read at a variable location reflecting source relocation. Furthermore, the commenter believes that most of the material that becomes airborne near a bulldozer promptly redeposits and should not be counted as visible emissions. For these reasons, the commenter believes that the method is impracticable and unclear and should not be approved. In addition, several other commenters indicated that Ohio's visible emissions limitation, as evaluated by this method, cannot reasonably be achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenters have provided evidence suggesting that Ohio's limit is difficult to meet. Nevertheless, USEPA believes that this limitation is achievable. Ohio submittal included a study involving opacity readings at numerous storage piles which was used to develop these limits. Although the commenters have provided supplemental data and reviewed the subset of data from Ohio's study that was obtained at coal piles, the commenters have not provided a rationale for concluding that coal piles are different from other types of storage piles or that the limits which Ohio's study shows to be reasonable for storage piles in general are not reasonable for coal piles in particular. For example, the commenters have not shown either that coal piles are more continuously worked or that coal pile operations are more prone to cause emissions than other storage piles. One commenter's own data set includes results implying that adequate moisture leads to compliance, and it is possible to achieve compliance by restricting operations. The commenters did not provide any detailed information on the control measures in place at the time of the readings, and thus have not demonstrated that a greater level of control could not achieve the limit. The commenters have also not addressed typical durations of truck or stacker loading or demonstrated that such loading cannot be restricted in duration or conducted with curtains or other controls to achieve compliance with the State's limit. Notwithstanding the commenters concerns, in accordance with Section 116, USEPA cannot disapprove an enforceable, achievable State submittal because it is too stringent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters have correctly noted that USEPA interprets Method 22 to provide for evaluating whether visible emissions are occurring anywhere at a storage pile. The alternative is to conduct this evaluation only at a fixed point. This alternative would provide meaningless results, since visible emissions would likely only be identified for those moments when an emissions generating event (e.g. bulldozing) happened to occur at the fixed location. Although the commenter is correct that Method 22 is not explicit on this issue, USEPA's interpretation is longstanding and is analogous to USEPA's longstanding interpretation that Method 9 opacity readings are also to be taken at the densest part of a plume at the time of each reading. Clearly the interpretation of test methods affects the stringency of the limitation, but this does not constitute grounds for disapproving the State's submittal, nor does it constitute grounds for altering USEPA's interpretation of the test method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA recognizes that the State is discussing potential rule revisions with the companies that appealed its rules. However, no specific revisions have been identified or proposed. If and when the State adopts and submits an alternative limitation (e.g., an appropriate opacity limitation), USEPA will conduct prompt rulemaking on such a revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters objected to the limits on the number of minutes of visible emissions from roadways and labeled these limits unreasonable. One commenter notes that ``Method 22 would allow observations to be made at the rear wheels while following vehicles down the road. As the Utilities continuously have hauling trucks entering and exiting the premises, this standard is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part of Ohio's submittal is a summary of a study demonstrating that the limits it adopted can be achieved. As with the storage pile limit, discussed above, USEPA believes that this limit is achievable. Also as with the storage pile limit, USEPA cannot disapprove a State submittal simply because commenters consider the limit too stringent. Again, if and when the State adopts and submits a replacement limitation (e.g. an appropriate opacity limit), USEPA will conduct prompt rulemaking on such replacement limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern about the 20 percent opacity/3-minute average limit as applied to ash handling. The commenter concedes that emissions are generally low when ash is pneumatically conveyed, but recommended 6 minute averaging to permit reasonable time to clean up spills. For loading of ash into dump trucks, the commenter noted limits on the extent to which the ash could be watered, summarized a series of opacity readings showing about half of the 3-minute averages exceeding 20 percent, and recommended a 35 percent opacity limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For pneumatic loading, the commenter has conceded that the limit is generally achievable, and even with respect to spill conditions has not demonstrated that reasonable measures will not yield compliance with the 20 percent/3-minute average limit. For dump truck loading, the commenter has not indicated what control measures were undertaken during the ash loading events that did and did not comply with the 20 percent limit or what differences might explain why compliance occurs in some cases and not in others. Therefore, the commenter's information does not demonstrate the limits to be infeasible and, in fact, suggests that reasonable measures yield compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that the limitations imposed for open dust sources in Cuyahoga County should not be considered to represent best available technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Best available technology'' is a requirement for new sources, which are not addressed in this rulemaking. Therefore, this comment is not germane to this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

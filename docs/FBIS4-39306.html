			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Rudnev report: "Joint Search For MIA's: Americans </F> Obtain List of `Kozelsk Convoy', We Get `Klaus Dossier'"]    [Text] The latest, 10th, plenary session of the Russo-U.S.  commission to trace U.S. MIA's has ended in Moscow. Assessing  its results, Doctor of Historical Sciences General Dmitriy  Volkogonov, the commission chairman, noted at the traditional  news conference that their more than two years of work had been  in the nature of a multilateral international humanitarian act.    The two-year investigation may not have brought any  sensations, but it has nonetheless revealed many secrets. After  World War II there were more than 20,000 U.S. citizens on Soviet  territory who had been released from German imprisonment by  Soviet troops. The overwhelming majority of them were  repatriated. Several people died in transit camps and,  admittedly, not all the graves have been located. The Americans  are doggedly searching for them with our help.    Checks on one eyewitness led the commission members in a new  direction. At issue is a camp for U.S. POW's built by the  Japanese in the South Kuril Chain. According to locals, during  World War II it held between 500 and 12,000 Americans. Neither  the Russian nor the U.S. researchers as yet have any  documentation to confirm this. But their joint expedition to  Iturup Island revealed traces of a POW camp. Who was held there  is a mystery.    Another "black spot" from World War II was the Tashkent camp  for interned U.S. pilots. The researchers have no doubts about  its existence. But not a single document about the camp has yet  been found in a single Russian archive -- including Defense  Ministry, state security, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs],  and CPSU archives.    The search for documents about the Tashkent camp  unexpectedly  led researchers to the previously unknown episode of the  transportation in the winter of 1941 of, according to archive  materials, several dozen "British and French internees." Just  who they were -- whether it was just British and French and what  happened to them -- is as yet unknown. The commission members  are concerned about the fact that the unknown convoy repeated  the route taken by the Polish officer POW's (ending at the  Kozelsk camp) who were shot in 1940. Once all the formalities  in declassifying the list of the "Kozelsk convoy" have been  carried out, it will be passed to the Americans.    The Russo-U.S. commission is interested in any information  on  an incident that took place over the Barents Sea 1 July 1960.  Soviet fighters shot down a U.S. aircraft that had violated the  state border. Two U.S. pilots survived and two died. The  survivors and one dead body were handed over to the U.S.  authorities. It is not known where the other American is buried  -- his grave is being sought.    The Americans have been given documentary information on the  areas where around 500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots  or air defense troops came down. Records of the interrogations  of more than 50 U.S. pilots involving the Soviet special  services have also been passed on....    The "Vietnam document" on 1,205 U.S. POW's originally  obtained through Soviet foreign intelligence channels and handed  over to the U.S. researchers last year continues to exercise  public opinion. The commission members are disinclined to  discuss whether the figures cited in it are realistic, but they  are confident of the document's authenticity.    The plenary session of the commission naturally discussed  Russian citizens missing abroad. According to Gen. Volkogonov's  figures, there have been 106 local wars and armed conflicts  since World War II. And at the will of the state Soviet  citizens participated in almost every clash. The list of MIA's  in these wars includes thousands of Russian names.    Clearly, the Americans had prepared carefully in advance of  this discussion. Because the gift they presented to the Russian  side was truly a gift from the gods -- the so-called "Klaus  dossier," a document that had until recently been a complete  secret not only to our researchers but to the Americans as well.  It is claimed that U.S. State Department staffer Klaus was the  only man privy to all the U.S. intelligence reports on conflicts  involving Soviet citizens. Moreover, the "Klaus dossier"  contained information from other confidential sources as well.  Familiarization with this material may be the key to revealing  what happened to thousands of our fellow countrymen lost without  trace during various conflicts.</p>

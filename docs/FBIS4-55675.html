			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak by Amir </F> Hodzic in Geneva; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Zubak, [words indistinct] of the  negotiations between the Bosniak and the Croatian sides?    [Zubak] I think that the issues that we discussed in Vienna  were in fact the most difficult ones, and the most testing ones  for the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, for  the implementation of the Federation Constitution. This is of  utmost significance since we have now overcome the most  difficult problems.    [Hodzic] You were here in Geneva for the meeting of the  contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. How would you comment on  their joint statement?    [Zubak] That communique issued by the European Union, that  is, [words indistinct] and the United States, is completely in  line with what we agreed on. However, it is questionable in  those parts where it refers to possible territory for the  Federation after the demarcation, that is, if the [word  indistinct] accept to join it. As far as I personally am  concerned, I think that the Federation has to be a geopolitical  whole, to be tenable, that is, that it can function as a state  community. It has to have communications and road connections,  it has to be economically strong enough to provide security for  its citizens, and a standard of living that is normal, that is,  a standard of living that is equal to the European one.    [Hodzic] In your view, what are the next top priority tasks  [words indistinct] in order to implement the Federation  Constitution and the Vienna Agreement on the ground?    [Zubak] You see, I have maintained [pauses] I am one of  those who is against deadlines of six months for the  implementation of the Constitution since I believe that this is  unrealistic. I still believe that [word indistinct] the cease-  fire holds, and then we can [words indistinct] for the  Federation. Anything hasty or ill-prepared [words indistinct]  could possibly cause incidents [words indistinct]. That is why  I believe that we should -- as agreed in Vienna -- first adopt  [word indistinct] at the Constitutional Assembly, then explain  to the people the advantages of the new political and  territorial demarcation, and then go into further implementation  of the Vienna Agreement.    [Hodzic] Do you think there will be problems on the ground  in implementing the Vienna Agreement?    [Zubak] Well, you see, there is a need to talk to the  people, give them information, provide them with explanations  [words indistinct] the Constitution, and everything that we have  agreed on. Once the people are told, I do not believe that  there will be any problems with the implementation, either with  the Bosniak people or the Croatian people.    [Hodzic] Thank you very much.</p>

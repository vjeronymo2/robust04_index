			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT DECISIONS  </P> <P> Martin Schram (Op-Ed Page, July 10) is definitely correct in writing that the  American public has voted for the abortion ruling and an ultra-conservative  Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The greedy American public has "voted their pocketbooks" in the last three  elections, beguiled by promises of "no more taxes."  </P> <P> Most Americans cannot sense the danger of an ultra-conservative Supreme Court.  When individual freedoms are eroded, all people suffer ultimately.  </P> <P> It should be noted, that in helping the lowest person up the totem pole you  really help yourself.  </P> <P> ESTHER BAIN RUSSO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No light on the problem Sir, Re Observer's story, 'Checking out' (June 22), there cannot be many visitors to Moscow over the past few years who regret the (temporary?) closure of the Rossiya Hotel. This building was constructed, I believe, for the Olympic Games which were not in fact held in Moscow as planned. However, local folklore opined that the cockroaches were brought in by foreign athletes taking part in the substitute Goodwill Games. As conference organisers it has been our lot to be accommodated at the Rossiya from time to time and delegates, speakers and staff have all suffered the indignities of these light-sensitive creatures. Our prize for fortitude however goes to Mrs Barbara Mills who spoke at our event, Europe-USSR law and co-operation, in 1991 when director of the Serious Fraud Office. At a farewell dinner during which discussion turned to 'roaches she admitted that, as she had not had a single light bulb in her room for two days, she was unaware of the problem.

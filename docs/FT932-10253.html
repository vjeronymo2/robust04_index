			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Distances and Antiphonies - Birtwistle premieres Key aspects of Harrison Birtwistle's music were freshly illuminated at the weekend. Two new works - the first brand-new, the second a deuxieme given only a few days after the world premiere, in Paris - were played in two successive concerts, by the Ensemble InterContemporain at the Purcell Room on Friday, and by the Philharmonia under Pierre Boulez at the Festival Hall on Saturday. (The Philharmonia, whose recently-forged Paris connections seem to be resulting in lively new things happening on both sides of the Channel, was patron of both events.) The opportunity to encounter Five Distances for Five Wind Instruments (Friday) and Antiphonies for piano and orchestra (Saturday) side by side was a particular boon, since the direct result was to forbid easy critical generalisation - always a good thing. Taken on its own, the former work might suggest that Birtwistle's muse has without losing its muscularity become unprecedentedly relaxed, even genial, and able to pack complex ideas into an ever-smaller handful of well-placed notes. Taken likewise, the latter would surely prove the converse, that his music has never seemed more massively structured, aggressive in cut and thrust, and difficult to follow from moment to moment. Together, the two works indicate, rather, that Britain's leading composer of middle years has not lost his immense capacity for adventure and surprise. Also, they demonstrate Birtwistle's abiding fascination with musical visions, multifarious in substance however diverse in scale, to which the listening 'eye' must repeatedly be returned during the course of unfolding for glimpses of the same subject matter from new vantage points; and, consequently, his unparalleled ability to invent music that sounds at once fiercely new, richly many-layered, and as though it had always been there. In the wind quintet, it is the differentness of the five instruments, their refusal to blend in the manner of strings, that creates the unfolding drama. Any alliances solidified en route are soon subject to disruption; two or three voices temporarily joining melodically above the critical punctuation (Stravinskianly cross-cut) of the others are destined to stray apart, even come to blows, in ways that define powerful new identities for each component instrument and a powerful new mode of chamber-musical argument. Eventually, the music seems to peter out into pacific accord, except that subversive stutters from the bassoon keep hinting otherwise: a wonderfully robust touch, characteristic of a composer whose attainment of artistic order always involves fierce physical confrontation. The new concertante composition - emphatically not a concerto - is much harder to grapple with and assess. As in previous Birtwistle works, setting up a strong solo element within a large-orchestra context, all notions of 'solo' and 'orchestra' are inevitably put to the most stringent tests, with violent batteries of percussion and frenzied internal contests of internal groupings as part of the process. On this occasion, though, I continually lost touch with that distinctness of identification, timbral, harmonic, and in terms of tempo, which normally guarantees the mounting exhilaration of a new Birtwistle experience. Antiphonies - written in memory of Howard Hartog, revered publisher and later artists' agent, and played with formidable brilliance by Joanna McGregor and the Philharmonia - seems the toughest nut the composer has offered for cracking in many years. More than one go is plainly needed to get at its nourishing centre. Philharmonia concert, sponsored by AFG, to be broadcast tonight on Radio 3.</p>

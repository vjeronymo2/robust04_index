			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ground Rules of Encounter"] </F>   [Text] To suggest that the historic show of unanimity in  Parliament on Tuesday over Kashmir is a clear demonstration of  national resolve would be tantamount to stating the obvious. In  effect, the resolution achieves much more. The categorical  affirmation that Jammu and Kashmir [J&amp;K] "has been, is and  shall  be an integral part of India" and that "all attempts to  interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met  resolutely" establishes the bottom line of the country's  position on the subject. After this resolution, it is beyond the  scope of any government, present or future, to flirt with  outrageous proposals aimed at eroding national sovereignty in  J&amp;K. It puts paid to both sinister and well-meaning  "self-determination" projects and imposes a parliamentary veto  on all attempts to redraw the map of India. Equally, it signals  to separatists throughout the country that the territorial  frontiers of India are non-negotiable and that demands for  "autonomy" have to be articulated keeping this position in mind.  Regardless of other internal arrangements, the national  tricolour must fly from Kashmir to Kanyakumari .    Although the timing of the resolution was dictated by  extraneous considerations, notably Pakistan's spirited bid to  complete the "unfinished agenda" of partition and Washington's  helping hand to Islamic terrorism, the resolution is calculated  to have a salutary effect on the country's own morale. For the  defence personnel engaged in the difficult and, sometimes,  thankless job of fighting the insurgents, the resolution is  reassurance that some cynical politicians will not barter away  their sacrifices. For the dispossessed citizens of the Kashmir  valley -- both Hindu and Muslim languishing forgotten in refugee  camps there is at least a glimmer of hope that the will return  to their homes one day. And ordinary citizens can delight in the  realisation that no responsible person -- at least not yet --  can hope to remain in public life without acknowledging the  emotive strength of Indian nationalism. Tuesday's resolution has  established the parameter of national debate and international  opinion will, in time, pay due heed to it. The collective echo  of some 880 million cannot, after all, be treated as a casual  refrain    There will, of course, be the dissenting voices and these  are  likely to be highlighted by the pathological India-haters, not  least in international fora. But after this show of national  solidarity, the private agendas of "Track-II" diplomacy will no  longer be able to masquerade as representative Indian opinion.  The capitulationists should be certainly listened to, but with  the same degree of seriousness reserved for the lunatic fringe  in democracies. Parliament has clearly set out the ground rules  for coping with this ferocious assault on Indian nationhood; the  onus is now on the Government to ensure it is translated into  practice. The nation has shown the will and the Government must  evolve a way.  *</p>

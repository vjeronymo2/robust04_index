			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / People: Anna Walker promoted at Oftel Anna Walker likes competition. Not necessarily in a personal sense, although yesterday she radiated quiet satisfaction at her triumph in the cross-Whitehall contest for the post of deputy director general at the Office of Telecommunications. She replaces Bill Wigglesworth, who retired last month. The competition for which her passion seems boundless, however, is the interplay between private and public organisations, the cut and thrust between utilities emerging from the protection of state ownership and younger challengers and the erudite accounting issues surrounding charging structures. A graduate in history from Oxford, she joins a small female elite among the industry watchdogs which includes Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator. After university, she had spells with the British Council and the Confederation of British Industry, where 'I began to see what government gets up to'. She joined the Department of Trade and Industry in 1975 and worked on a succession of regulatory and privatisation issues, including the reform of legal services, coal and rail privatisation and the early stages of the Citizen's Charter. She has been with Oftel for some 30 months as director of competition, and says the job has 'real interest and real responsibility'.</p>

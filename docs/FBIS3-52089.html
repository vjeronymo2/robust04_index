			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Gilat] </F>   [Text] "In a secret meeting between Israeli and Syrian  representatives in Norway last October a joint, six-clause  document was drafted. This document outlines Israeli and Syrian  policy regarding a future peace agreement between the two  countries." This was said by Dr. Yosi Olmert, an expert on  Syria who participated in the meeting and was involved in the  drafting of the document.    According to Olmert the contents of the document was brought  to the knowledge of senior political circles, including Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and raised a lot of interest and hopes  in Jerusalem and Washington. Olmert notes the October meeting  was the last in a series of six meetings organized by an  American fund named "Common Ground Research Fund" [name as  published].    Olmert claims that due to leaks of the document no more  meetings were held since October.    The Norway meetings were held under the auspices of  Norwegian  Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. Mr. Holst and his wife  attended the opening of the meetings, which were held in the  same Oslo castle in which the agreement of principles between  Israel and the PLO was formulated.    The Israeli academics who participated in the meetings were:  Professor Aharon Lev-Ran of the Jaffee Center for Strategic  Studies, Dr. Dori Gold, Brigadier General (reserves) 'Amos  Gilboa', and Dr. Yosi Olmert. The military commentator Ze'ev  Schiff also attended one of the earlier meetings.    Two Syrians attended the meetings. One of them remains  anonymous due to his sensitive position vis-a-vis the Syrian  regime. The other is Professor 'Aziz Shuqri, dean of the  Damascus University Law School. Shuqri, an expert of  international renown, is known to be very close to the top  Syrian political echelon.    "It is true that this was an academics' meeting, but the  Syrian representatives can be seen to reflect the positions of  the Syrian establishment," according to Olmert. Olmert claims  that in a structured and rigid country like Syria people are not  allowed to attend such meetings without the knowledge and  authorization of the government. Syria, unlike Western states,  does not have to take into consideration public opinion and the  media. It does have a small group of persons, however, who are  allowed to speak abroad and who serve as a sort of trial balloon  for the future moves of the Syrian regime. The positions they  express probably reflect the future positions of the Syrian  regime.    Olmert reveals that an intensive 48-hour marathon of talks  was held in Oslo last October which resulted in the joint  document. This document caused a lot of interest in Israel due  to several points:    -- This is the first time the Syrians have provided full  details regarding their concept of peace. From the document it  clearly transpires that the Syrians understand full peace to  include open borders, normalization, economic, trade, and  cultural relations, embassies and consular relations.    -- It is not stated in the document that during the  withdrawal it will be necessary to evacuate all the Israeli  settlements on the Golan Heights. It is stated that their  status during the withdrawal will be subject to negotiations.    Two main points are not included in the document:    -- The duration of withdrawal. It is clear that there are  substantial gaps between Syria and Israel regarding this point.  The Syrians expect Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights in  three or four years; Israel unofficially believes the process  should take much longer to complete.    -- Security arrangements. Obviously this issue will prove a  future bone of contention between Israel and Syria if and when  they enter concrete negotiations. It is assessed that Syria  will agree to mutual demilitarization of territories, but will  not agree to a deep demilitarization of all the area from the  future international border to Damascus.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Management: Capitalism on the steppes - Kenneth Gooding visits a Kazakhstan gold mine - one of the first to use western-style business techniques This is a country where you discover that the office manager is a prominent heart surgeon. He can no longer afford to follow his profession because it does not pay enough to support him and his family. This is a country where the plant has a 'vodka room' rather than a vending machine dispensing tea and coffee. With vodka costing the equivalent of 5 cents for a full-strength bottle, it is a cheap perk. This is a country where prices have risen 20 fold since 1989 so there are not enough bank notes to go round. For the past six months most public-sector workers have instead been given vouchers to exchange for food and other essentials. Sometimes cheques are issued to top up the vouchers. But the local banks do not have any money to honour them. This is Kazakhstan, once part of the former Soviet Union. Mark Wilson, who has worked for mining companies in many western countries, says managing in Kazakhstan is different from anything he has previously experienced. He found it difficult to adjust to the fact that while people were well educated - it is claimed that the literacy rate in Kazakhstan is higher than in the US - they had not been taught to show initiative or be willing to take responsibility. Set Kazakhs a target and they will attempt to achieve it, even when common sense suggests that pressing on regardless could have costly, even disastrous, results. For example, at first Wilson found his employees would keep a machine running at full stretch to achieve production targets, ignoring all warning signs that it needed attention until it ground to a noisy halt. It was also impossible to persuade any Kazakh to admit mistakes. Wilson recalls one frustrating conversation with a group of employees after something had gone wrong. 'Ok, who stuffed it?' he inquired. All heads were shaken. He said: 'Well, it couldn't have been me, I was in bed.' They brightened. 'Ah] Then you must have dreamt it.' After decades of Communist rule, when everyone was promised cradle-to-grave care, many Kazakhs do not understand the western approach to work, Wilson suggests. 'Why bother to turn up for work on time and why stay sober after lunch when you get the same treatment and pay, no matter what?' The first time he fired someone for persistent lateness and drunkenness, policemen were at his door early the next day to tell him he could do no such thing. Wilson had a hard time convincing them that the man was working for a privatised company and could be fired. Wilson is project manager at the Bakyrchik Gold joint venture, one of the first in Kazakhstan to involve western capital and management. For the past year he has overseen the installation of new process plant to extract gold from the ore at the Bakyrchik gold mine, on Kazakhstan's north-eastern steppes, 1,000km from the capital Almaty. In the past, Russian metallurgists had tried various ways to extract the gold without success. They settled for sending the ore to nearby copper smelters so the gold could add value to the concentrate they produced. But this meant that the arsenic in the Bakyrchik ore went up the smelter chimneys into the atmosphere. Wilson applies western psychology when attempting to instill the 'fair day's work for a fair day's pay' concept. He suggests that if you have to fire a Kazakh employee, it is a good idea to wait until he or she has collected a first pay packet at the end of the month. That way the employee knows what rewards are available provided the rules are followed. Bakyrchik joint venture employees are paid cash, not vouchers. They earn an average of Dollars 100 (Pounds 64) a month, which in theory is about 20 per cent more than the gold miners who are still employed by the state precious metals organisation. But the miners are having to make do with vouchers. Many of them cannot wait for the time when the joint venture takes over the mine as well. Wilson is helping to spread the capitalist message. Already about 20 per cent of the joint venture employees have been persuaded of the benefits of having savings accounts in local banks and regularly deposit 70 per cent of their earnings in them (personal tax rates are very low). As there is little to buy in the small town of Auezov, the frontier town next to the mine, Wilson arranges buses to take employees to Semipalatinsk two hours away by road, where there are at least a few goods in the shops or on sale in the markets. The relative affluence of the joint venture employees has divided the local community. Those who work for the western-managed company are given the cold shoulder by the rest of the town. Recruiting is a problem because local people are not used to the idea that they can be fired if they do not perform adequately. Wilson used to ask an employee who had been working well if he or she had a friend who might be interested in joining the joint venture. That does not work any more because, when newcomers did not meet requirements and were fired, they frequently blamed the friend who recommended them for the job. The venture needs two more drivers, Wilson says, and he knows his personal driver has two out-of-work brothers with driving licences. But his driver will not ask his brothers if they would like to join Bakyrchik. 'He says that if they do not measure up and I have to fire one or both of them, I will be angry with him,' says Wilson. There have been some cost benefits to operating in Kazakhstan, according to Wilson. Some tanks in the new plant are made of titanium, bought at a cost of Dollars 16 a kilo compared with the Dollars 110 it would have cost to have them delivered from the US. The joint venture's ball mill was bought locally for Dollars 93,000 compared with the Dollars 650,000 it would have cost in the west. On the other hand, Wilson points out: 'A light bulb you could buy in the west for a few pennies costs Dollars 10. And it is impossible to get a toothbrush here, or a toilet roll.'</p>

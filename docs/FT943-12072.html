			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Leading Article: China trade Taiwan's statement yesterday that it is ready to meet the full obligations of a developed country on joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade looks shrewdly calculated. In seeking thus to force the pace of its membership negotiations, Taiwan has thrown down a challenge to Beijing and to Gatt members' acceptance of China's demands that it be admitted first. The move comes at a delicate stage in China's Gatt accession talks. Beijing hopes to conclude them in time to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the Gatt early next year. However, though the political atmosphere has been improved by the US decision to renew China's Most Favoured Nation treatment, decisive breakthroughs have yet to be made. Recent talk in Beijing of presenting Gatt with an accession package in September on a 'take it or leave it' basis does not bode well for rapid agreement. China's size and economic potential make it desirable that it be admitted to Gatt as soon as possible. However, clear conditions must be set for its entry if it is not to risk destabilising the organisation. Above all, Beijing must introduce far more transparency into the workings of its economy which, for all its recent reforms, is still patterned on the state trading model. It should also commit itself to a fixed timetable for conforming fully with Gatt rules, and to regular international monitoring of its progress. That argues for granting Beijing a post-entry transition period, a concession which the US, alone and unreasonably, opposes. However, China must also be prepared to negotiate constructively. Any refusal to do so should not become a pretext for the Gatt to soft-pedal negotiations with Taiwan, or to delay its admission, once satisfactory terms are agreed. To exclude the world's eleventh largest exporter in deference to the demands of a large country, which is not even a member, would betray Gatt's central principles. Furthermore, there is no obvious legal basis for requiring that Beijing be admitted first. The new WTO charter neatly sidesteps the contentious issue of Chinese sovereignty by defining members as states and customs territories, not as governments. The Gatt should overcome its fears of antagonising China and break the artificial link between the two sets of accession negotiations. To do so would not only be fair; the prospect of a race between Beijing and Taipei to complete accession talks would concentrate minds in both capitals.</p>

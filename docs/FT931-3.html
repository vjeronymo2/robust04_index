			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow Two years after it tapped shareholders for Pounds 162m to fund expansion, Taylor Woodrow can afford to pay no more than a token 1p dividend. Land and property write-downs and losses on troublesome contracts have whittled away its balance sheet. Despite the rights issue, the company has lost almost 40 per cent of its shareholders' funds since 1989. Continuing problems at its Channel tunnel, Euro Disney and Storebaelt projects were largely responsible for a Pounds 32.5m loss in its contracting division. The revelation of a Pounds 4.2m provision on a Saudi Arabian contract came as a further nasty shock. Shareholders might reasonably demand retribution for such poor performance. But the triumvirate thrown up by Taylor Woodrow's reshuffle, all of whom were on the board at the time of the rights issue, seems intent on completing the job itself. The board has been cut from 18 to seven. Thirty directors of subsidiary companies have also departed. Overhead costs have been hacked back and its loss-making steel fabricator closed. It is a pity such action was not taken at the start of recession. Taylor Woodrow retains some attractive property assets. But there are enough high-yielding property companies around for investors who want direct exposure to the sector. The chill recessionary winds have left Taylor Woodrow with severe financial hypothermia. Cash is still being withdrawn from the extremities to preserve heat at the core. It will be a while before the company warms up sufficiently to regain much movement.</p>

The minister said before today's meeting of the People's  Assembly Committee for Energy and Industry, chaired by Dr. Amin  Mubarak, that the ministry is following up on the latest  developments in nuclear stations around the world so that they  will be ready at the appropriate time whenever a decision is  reached to implement the nuclear stations.    Mahir Abazah added that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor  explosion restricted the expansion of many developed countries  in the field of nuclear stations. Examples are the United  States, Italy, and Germany.    The members of the committee had demanded that modern  technology specializing in the use of nuclear reactors for  generating electricity be introduced to deal with the rise in  the price of electricity in Egypt. They noted that there are  those who maintain that there are pressures on Egypt not to set  up such stations.</p>

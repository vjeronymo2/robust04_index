			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (1): On the move once more - Rejection of European Economic Area membership has provided the government with an opportunity to shake the Swiss out of their complacency. A range of liberalisation measures is now being introduced A YEAR ago, the European Community was forging ahead confidently to a united future, while the doggedly neutral Swiss were agonising over whether or not to participate in the process of European integration. Today, it is the EC that is in a dither over its future, while Switzerland, having made its fateful decision not to board the Eurotrain, at least for the time being, is moving ahead purposefully to create a more liberal, competitive society on its own. 'We have to be economically at least as liberal as the EC,' says Mr Adolf Ogi, transport minister and this year's president of the confederation, (see page three of this survey: interview with Mr Ogi). The president and the government as a whole regret that a majority of the Swiss people voted in an historic referendum last December against joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free trade area being created between the EC and the member-countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). And they are at pains to point out that Switzerland does not seek to isolate itself from Europe or the world. After all, the Swiss voted last year at long last in favour of joining the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They also endorsed a treaty with the EC that commits Switzerland to drilling two new rail tunnels through the Alps at a prodigious cost of more than SFr30bn. Moreover, as the recent row over exports of Pilatus trainer aircraft to South Africa showed, there is a new sensitivity to international opinion in this formerly aloof country. The government is even reviewing its long cherished neutrality policy, conscious that it must do its share in multilateral efforts to build and protect the post cold war order. The government is now trying to turn the EEA rejection into an opportunity. Mr Ogi hopes the vote was the shock that was needed to shake the Swiss out of their arrogance and complacency - 'we were a bit spoiled,' he says. Bern is pressing ahead with economic liberalisation measures that would have been impossible to implement even a year ago. From last week, for example, the immigration door, hitherto nearly closed, is wide open to highly qualified citizens of other European countries, the idea being to help Swiss-based companies compete everywhere for the best talent. Further measures to bust the country's notorious cartels, open public procurement and remove a number of sly non-tariff barriers are due to be implemented later this year. And another attempt will be made to introduce a value added tax. Regeneration and liberalisation are also the themes of the day in Swiss industry, which has had its own struggles with complacency in recent years. The important watch industry is the most famous case, fully recovered from the competitive challenge from Japan in the late 1970s and once again leading its field with innovative products and processes. In the heavy engineering sector, several venerable and world famous companies, such as Brown Boveri, Sulzer Brothers, Oerlikon-Buhrle and Alusuisse, have shaken off rigid old habits and become vigorous again. The country's financial sector, which grew so fat and rich during the international financial turmoil of the late 1960s and 1970s that it largely missed the competitive challenges of the 1980s, is undergoing a long overdue shake-up. In the past two years, some 60 banks have been taken over or closed, including two of the largest, Bank Leu and Swiss Volksbank. Outmoded laws and regulations are being revised to make Swiss financial markets competitive with those elsewhere. All this does not mean that Switzerland is about to experience a great economic boom. In or outside the EEA, its economy is still heavily dependent on trade with neighbouring European countries, especially lacklustre Germany. THE latest forecasts indicate that the economy will suffer a third year of modest decline in GDP this year with only very gradual recovery in 1994. Unemployment, hitherto unknown to the Swiss, has become a serious problem as companies have shed their inhibitions about redundancies and immigrant workers no longer return to their countries when they lose their jobs. Government deficits, bloated by the recession-driven rise in welfare payments, are expected to reach a combined SFr10bn or about 3 per cent of GDP this year, still modest by international standards, but shocking to the thrifty Swiss. It is still too early to tell what will be the economic impact of the country's decision not to join the EEA. For one thing, the EEA treaty has not yet come into effect, and probably will not do so until next year because of wrangles over writing Switzerland out of it. There have been sporadic reports of Swiss exporters facing increased red tape at EC borders and of local companies shifting new investments outside Switzerland. But in the current slump, no one expected investment to be buoyant. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, Swiss researchers were struck-off EC project committees, but the government is confident that these decisions will gradually be rolled back as the committees contemplate the size of Swiss financial contributions to their budgets. The government's biggest anxiety is over civil aviation and, in particular, access for Swissair to the about to be opened EC skies. This, of course, is as much a political as an economic issue. Swiss negotiators were careful to include aviation in the treaty agreed last year with the EC settling the painful problem of lorry transit through the Alps. The idea was that Switzerland would finance and build two new high speed rail tunnels through the Alps and the EC, in return, would agree to negotiate a bilateral air traffic agreement with Switzerland in the event that the country did not join the EEA. Bern has lost no time in calling on the EC to honour its commitment, but the EC seems in no hurry. There have been suggestions that the negotiation could proceed more quickly if the Swiss were to give ground on other matters. Spain, for example, is unhappy about Swiss restrictions on imports of garden vegetables, especially tomatoes. It is also angry that the financial aid coming from the EFTA countries as their EEA joining fee will now be significantly smaller because Switzerland is not among them. It probably matters that the EC commissioner for transport is Mr Abel Matutes, a Spaniard. The Swiss fear that other EC countries will notice that this is perhaps an opportune time to raise any old scores they have to settle with the country. The EEA vote has had a psychological impact on the Swiss. Hitherto aloof and confident, they are showing signs of isolation. In the past, the many Europeans who married with Swiss were always eager to get a Swiss passport. Now the reverse is happening. One hears several reports of the Swiss in these partnerships hastily filing for EC passports. Switzerland's multicultural society continues to show other strains. The recent angry demonstrations by women all over the country at the mistreatment of a woman candidate for a vacant Cabinet position incidates a new impatience with male domination in their society. Next month's plebiscites on the future of the army could also unveil deep divisions over an institution that has been one of the few unifying forces in this diverse country. And the country's leaders remain unable to resolve their outsize drug problem. People were horrified to learn the other day of a 12-year-old girl in Zurich who had turned to prostitution to pay for her heroin addiction. But even this harrowing problem should be kept in context. Switzerland remains surprisingly civilised, as I discovered anew one afternoon a few weeks ago when my bicycle was stolen from a downtown Zurich pavement. A few minutes after discovering the theft, I spotted a scruffy young man walking the bicycle along the street and confronted him. He was immediately defensive and claimed to have just bought it in 'Heroin-gasse,' the drug addicts' black market, for SFr40. He asked me to reimburse him, but when I threatened to call for police help, he immediately returned it and walked quickly away. If this had happened in New York or London, I would have been lucky to have escaped uninjured - let alone with my bicycle.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AL DIB ENDORSED;  </P> <P> BERNSON BACKS BERNARDI'S OPPONENT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, breaking with City Hall protocol,  Tuesday endorsed Al Dib over fellow Councilman Ernani Bernardi in the northeast  San Fernando Valley's 7th District race.  </P> <P> Bernson offered no criticism of Bernardi, his colleague for the past 10 years.  He said he was supporting Dib, a 55-year-old past president of the Arleta  Chamber of Commerce who recently sold his produce business to campaign  full-time, because he has been a friend and a longtime political supporter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tireless Worker'  </P> <P> "I know from personal experience that Al Dib will be a dedicated, energetic and  experienced representative for the people of the northeast Valley," said  Bernson, who also has given Dib the maximum $500 contribution permitted by law.  "Over the years, Al has been a tireless worker on just about every important  community service project in the area."  </P> <P> Bernardi, who has never been opposed for reelection by a colleague, said: "Hal  Bernson is over 18. There isn't anything I can say about it."  </P> <P> It is rare, but not unheard of, for council members to endorse a challenger  over an incumbent. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is the only other council member  this year to buck tradition. She is supporting slow-growth activist Laura Lake  over Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in the 5th District race.  </P> <P> Bernson and Bernardi have generally agreed on issues, but relations between the  two reached a low point in 1985 when Bernardi publicly attacked a Bernson  proposal to clean up a crime-ridden, run-down area of Bernson's West Valley  district. Bernardi, who sometimes bucks another council tradition of deferring  to a colleague on a matter in his district, helped kill the plan. But Bernson  said Tuesday that he harbored no ill feelings toward Bernardi.  </P> <P> Bernson said the endorsement "ought to be looked at as endorsement not against  Ernie but for Dib."  </P> <P> Dib, a Democrat-turned-Republican, ran unsuccessfully for the council's old 1st  District seat in 1973 and 1977. He is among seven challengers to Bernardi in  the April 11 election in a district that is largely new to the councilman  because of the 1986 council redistricting.  </P></p>

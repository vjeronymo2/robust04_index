			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN MARCOS  </P> <P> A car show was shut down by San Marcos officials Sunday when a large group of  spectators became rowdy.  </P> <P> City Manager Rick Gittings said a shopping center parking lot at San Marcos  Boulevard and Pacific Street was too small to accommodate the crowd, which  overflowed onto the streets and created traffic problems.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Sheriff's Department estimated the crowd at 6,000  spectators, including gang members from Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San  Diego. There were no arrests or injuries.  </P> <P> Gittings said there were people with open containers of alcohol, which is  prohibited by the city. A fight also broke out, he said.  </P> <P> "The promoter never envisioned that that many people would show up," Gittings  said. "He was too successful in his promotion. The event just got out of hand.  People parked illegally on the streets."  </P> <P> Gittings said that Louis Garcia came to his office late Friday and requested  permission to hold the second California Vehicle Art Show, but the request was  denied. A city permit was not required for Garcia to hold the show at the  parking lot.  </P> <P> Garcia said the American Red Cross was co-sponsoring the event, according to  Gittings.  </P> <P> However, a spokesman for the Red Cross, Tom Custer, denied any involvement with  the promoter.  </P></p>

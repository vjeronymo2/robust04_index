			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanja Modric: "The Manolic-Mesic Parliamentary </F> Storm"]    [Text] The steering committee of the new party, the  Croatian Independent Democrats [HND], the founding of which was  announced by Josip Manolic about a month ago, after he had been  relieved of all his duties in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Community], will today be presented to the public at the news  conference that will be held at the European Center in Zagreb.  The fax sent to the editorial offices of the Croatian papers  yesterday around noon, containing information about the event,  finally eliminated the doubts about whether Manolic would  persist in founding the party of HDZ malcontents, and dispelled  speculations according to which Stipe Mesic, the number one  Parliament man, had withdrawn and gone back to the party in  power. Namely, today's news conference will be held by Josip  Manolic and Stipe Mesic, presidents of the two chambers of the  Croatian parliament.    It is therefore evident that Mesic has not "calmed down"  after the mild, but indicative, reprimand issued to him at the  Club of HDZ Representatives on 7 April by Dr. Franjo Tudjman,  president of the party and president of the state, himself. The  high officials of the party in power who, after this event,  claimed publicly and privately that Mesic would undoubtedly stay  in the party, interpreting Mesic's fiercely critical interviews  as harmless scenes caused by "Stipica's ruffled temper," were  not right either. (Another) precedent has thus emerged in  Croatia: Two key parliament men, both founders of the party in  power, are leaving their political nest and becoming part of the  opposition. Whether President Tudjman's threat that "this  state," headed by him, will not remain "politically and legally  helpless" against the dissident Manolic will be actualized, and  who else it could include, is yet to be seen. However, it is  already clear that Manolic is neither alone, nor has he agreed  to the role of the defeated, which he has too readily been  offered by the HDZ center.    Trying to find out which people would appear before the  reporters at the European Center on behalf of the HND, we phoned  the party center in Nova Ves 23a, which is temporarily in the  offices of Azur. It is interesting that the owner of the company  is Josip Zebic, an HDZ member known to the public for having  been the first president of the committee for renaming the  Zagreb streets and squares.  <H5>  The HND Founding Assembly by 1 May? </H5>   We talked to Darko Hrastovec, who introduced himself as one  of the founders of the new party. He said that the "independent  democrats" consist of a "wide circle of people," but he would  name only Perica Juric, a HDZ representative, and father  Tomislav Pavao Duka, who has recently left the party in power  and become an independent representative. Hrastovec also told  us that they would present the HND aims and program today. He  announced that the founding assembly of the HND was "probably  going to be held by 1 May." The party will then file a  registration request to the Ministry of Public Administration of  the Republic of Croatia. Unless someone comes first, the  "independent democrats" will have the registration number 65.  Namely, there are at present 64 political parties on the  ministry's list, and it is difficult to remember even the names  of some of them.    The registration of Manolic and Mesic's party will be  conducted in compliance with the new Law on Political Parties,  which came into effect in late August last year, and which made  the conditions for founding a party twice as strict as before.  According to the former law, 50 people were necessary to found  a party, and now it takes 100. They have to be "persons of age  and fit for work," citizens of the Republic of Croatia.  Attorney Slobodan Budak explained to us that, in compliance  with the constitutional right to free political association, it  is not necessary to file a registration request to the Ministry  of Public Administration, but rather an application. The state  body cannot refuse registration of a party if the associated  holders of the same political views meet several basic formal  conditions. The application must be filed with the ministry up  to 15 days after the founding assembly of the new party takes  place, the name of the party must be different from the  registered names, and the documentation must contain the minutes  from the founding assembly, a statute, a program, and the list  of the founders' names, with the evidence that they are Croatian  citizens. The ministry has the obligation to deliver the ruling  up to 30 days after the application has been sent, and the party  has the obligation to publish their program in one ofthe daily  papers or in NARODNE NOVINE. Any party whose program "instigates  or calls to violent endangering of the democratic constitutional  system, independence, integrality, or territorial integrity of  the Republic of Croatia" will be denied registration.   <H5>    The Overture to Preterm Elections? </H5>   One of the questions provoked by the news of the founding of  the new party is whether this act will deepen and prolong the  parliamentary crisis in Croatia, and if Manolic and Mesic's  departure from the HDZ will actually leads to early elections.  The answer will emerge when all the names that the "M and M" are  counting on are "presented" to the public. Namely, if six  "turncoats" from the Chamber of Counties, members of the party  in power, and 16 of them from the Chamber of Representatives  join the HND, the HDZ loses the majority in the parliament.  Naturally, it would take absolute cooperation of the entire  opposition, which, as we have learned, is not too united, to  achieve such parliamentary balance. Namely, there have been  announcements that, in case the least favorable version of the  development of events occurs, the HDZ could procure a coalition  with the Croatian Peasants Party [HSS] and thus keep the  parliament majority. Some opposition leaders believe that Drago  Stipac [HSS president] would agree to this, although there are  many HSS members who would oppose this fusion. The  representatives of the Serbian National Party, who, according to  some interpretations, will be "cooperative" with the party in  power because they have received a great amount of money to  finance the activities of the Serbian association Prosvjeta,  have recently stated that "the coalition with the HDZ is out of  the question." Other opposition parties have also decidedly  declined any possibility of forming a coalition with the HDZ.    After certain papers have already stated who some of  Manolic's sympathizers from the Club of HDZ Representatives are,  and after some of them immediately distanced themselves publicly  from "flirting" with the new party, it would be unrewarding to  present the names to the public. However, very soon they will  be known. Some claim that the secret followers of Manolic and  Mesic will find it easier to decide to make public appearances  in their new roles as soon as the new party is registered and  thus becomes a valid political subject in parliament. Many thus  believe that there are many surprises in store regarding the  transfer from the HDZ to the HND. Many have connected the  forecasts concerning the success or failure of the new party  with the support the founders have managed to "win" in the  influential international circles, which is still completely  unknown here. In the lobbies there has been talk that Manolic  has sent his recently published reply to Tudjman to many foreign  addresses, allegedly adding a special "annex" with explanations.  For the time being it is impossible to check whether these are  only rumors, and there is no information about what the response  to this mail has been.    At any rate, the "tempest in the teapot," which is how  President Tudjman called the effects of Manolic's disobedience,  has undoubtedly turned out to be a real, big storm. Will it be  overcome by democratic or "political and legal" means?</p>

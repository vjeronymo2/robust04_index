			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In terms of their qualifications, participant Governors must have securities clearance and/or settlement expertise, background or responsibilities. To ensure that floor members are not over-represented on the Board, the Exchange has stated that management will use its best efforts to ensure that the newly created participant Governor positions will not initially or thereafter be filled by floor members. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the event that a floor member is elected to fill a participant Governor position, the Exchange has stated that it will promptly notify the Commission. In addition, if the Exchange's best efforts do not succeed in ensuring that floor members do not fill participant Governor positions, the Exchange is committed to revisit this issue.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley &amp; Lardner, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 8, 1994 (``July 8 Letter''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Exchange proposes to allow a participant Governor to be re-categorized as a member Governor, or a member Governor to be re-categorized as a participant Governor, so long as both positions are within the same class. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change will provide this increased flexibility only if the Governor being recategorized otherwise meets the qualifications for his or her new position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notes 6 and 14. According to the Exchange, the President will recommend and the Board (or Executive Committee) must approve the recategorization of a Governor. The CHX has stated that, after initial implementation of the proposed rule change, the recategorization provision mainly will be used to help fill vacancies on the Board. Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley &amp; Lardner, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on August 17, 1994. A recategorization will not affect the qualifications for serving in a given Board position or the length of the Governor's term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the CHX, the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1), 6(b)(3) and 6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(1) of the Act requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure the fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or a broker-dealer. Finally, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Commission's opinion, changes in the composition of the board of governors of a national securities exchange typically raise difficult regulatory issues, due to the board's special role and responsibilities in managing the business of an exchange and in ensuring that the exchange fulfills its obligations under the Act. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, before the Commission can approve a proposed board reorganization, the Commission must be satisfied that all exchange constituencies, including the public, are fairly represented in its governance. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For discussion of the powers of the CHX Board, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  see supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notes 4&hyph;5 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission previously has indicated that allowing a single constituency to dominate exchange governance may be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22058 (May 21, 1985), 50 FR 23090 (May 30, 1985) (File Nos.

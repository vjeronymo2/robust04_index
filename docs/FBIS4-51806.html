			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance said it will sell a  government-owned 72.6 percent stake of Citizens National Bank  [CNB] from November on a gradual basis in its first step to  privatize state-run banks. Before selling the government-owned  shares, the ministry will allow the CNB to increase its capital  by 20 billion won by way of making it go public and listing it  on the Korea Stock Exchange in August. But even after the  privatization of the CNB, it said the CNB's function to support  small- and medium-sized firms will continue. CNB's paid-in  capital is 191 billion won and its equity capital amounted to  406.4 billion won as of the end of 1993.    It also plans to sell the government-owned 1.6 percent stake  of Korea Exchange Bank [KEB] this year and the Bank of  Korea-owned shares will be sold some time during 1994-1995. Out  of KEB's total paid-in capital worth 605 billion won, 65.3  percent is held by the central bank [Bank of Korea]. KEB's  equity capital amounted to 1.6 trillion won as of the end of  1993.    Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Korea Housing Bank (KHB)  will also be privatized sometime during 1996-1997, it said.    The ministry said it will privatize first those banks which  have the most similar characteristics with commercial banks.  The ministry's move to privatize state-run banks is part of its  policy to exempt commercial banks from extending  government-supported policy loans and make specialized banks  exclusively deal with the policy loans in the long-run.</p>

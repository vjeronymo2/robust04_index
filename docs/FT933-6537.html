			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Pakistan foreign minister attacks US over new sanctions Mr Abdul Sattar, Pakistan's foreign minister, yesterday accused the United States of acting on wrong information and groundless suspicion in applying new sanctions against Pakistan, writes Farhan Bokhari from Islamabad. He said Pakistan regretted the move, which came in the wake of allegations that Pakistan and China had breached the international Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Mr Sattar denied that Pakistan had violated the MTCR, although it had not yet formally ratified the regime. China had provided a small number of short-range tactical missiles to Pakistan several years ago, he said. It had done so after Pakistan was attacked by Soviet-made Scud missiles, from Afghanistan. Officials said sanctions were unlikely to damage Pakistan's economy, since US aid had already been cut off because of allegations over Islama - bad's nuclear programme.</p>

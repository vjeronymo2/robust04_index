			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Saudi squeeze For most of the past three decades, British chancellors of the exchequer would have happily swapped places with Saudi Arabian ministers of finance when it came to drawing up their annual budgets. Even at the start of the 1980s, Saudi oil revenues were still flowing so plentifully that spending levels were decided principally by the absorption limitations of the economy. What was left swelled the reserves. And such was the cushion of reserves that even a poor year for oil revenues required no early policy response. However, the Gulf war cost most of the reserves and today the two ministers have far more in common. Each is battling to cut spending: one, in order to provide scope for eventual tax cuts, which might just persuade the electorate to allow the government to continue in power; the other, to avoid taxation, which if introduced might just persuade the public of the need for representation. The more drastic action has been announced, if not fully acted upon, by the government in Riyadh. This year's budget, unveiled in January, called for overall spending cuts of 19 per cent. Next year's, now under preparation, aims to take another step towards achieving a balanced budget within five years, and given the continued flatness in oil prices should involve further sharp spending cuts. Assessing the success so far achieved is difficult because of the manner in which Saudi Arabia has historically approached government overspending. Instead of wielding the knife, the Saudi government prefers to turn off the tap. Programmes and projects tend not to be scrapped, but payments are delayed. Within the kingdom, this is causing mounting pain for many companies. Overseas, credit insurance institutions have been reviewing terms of cover for exporters to Saudi Arabia, and in some cases refusing it on short-term contracts. Although oil prices have firmed as a result of the latest Opec agreement, there is little sign of a significant upswing to ease Saudi budget pressures. The fiscal deficit as a proportion of gross national product should this year have dipped below the 10 per cent figure estimated in 1993, but is still nearly double that of the UK. Sooner, rather than later, the government will have to grasp the political nettle and increase its revenues by other means. A more ambitious privatisation programme is an obvious candidate, especially if it involves subsidised public utilities. There is, equally, scope for a range of indirect taxes aimed mainly at the kingdom's most affluent consumers. At some point, however, Saudi Arabia will have to act like most other middle-income countries and tax its citizens directly - a development with important political implications for the royal family and for buyers of Saudi oil. The kingdom should begin preparing its citizens for this now.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Disputes over employees' terms threaten council tendering plans LEGAL confusion is threatening the government's plans to extend competitive tendering in local government, according to companies and councils involved. The problem concerns the status of employees' terms and conditions when contracts change hands. At least two local authorities have had their tendering plans thrown into disarray in the past week by disputes over the law on the transfer of 'undertakings' - agreements covering staff terms and conditions. Private contractor Initial Cleaning Services said last night that the uncertainty could 'completely destroy the government's marketing, testing and competitive tendering programme, unless it is resolved soon'. Mr Rodney Brooke, secretary of the Labour-run Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'Local councils are between the devil and the deep blue sea. If they seek to transfer undertakings, they risk government penalties; if they don't, they risk being sued by their employees.' The Institute of Directors said it was 'deeply concerned about the current confusion'. It wants the government not only to clarify the existing position, but to seek to change the 1977 European Community directive on employees' acquired rights. The government insists that 'as a general rule' regulations on undertakings do not apply to local authorities in spite of recent court decisions. It believes that new employers do not inherit the terms and conditions of employees who used to do the job for the local authority. However, several local authorities have been given conflicting legal advice and believe that new contracts must respect former employees' rights. Oswestry district council, in Shropshire, is about to take the government to court on the issue. It is challenging an Environment Department instruction that it should put its refuse collection out to tender again because it included a transfer of undertakings clause in its original contract. Dyfed county council, in south-west Wales, was last night faced with reinstating 950 staff it made redundant last month following a dispute over transfer of undertakings.

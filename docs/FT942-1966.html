			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Growth of 10% expected in first quarter: Eastern German economy The east German economy is expected to grow by 10 per cent in real terms in the first quarter this year compared with last year and the productivity gap in some sectors is narrowing between western and eastern German enterprises. However, the upswing in the economy is far from becoming self-sustaining, with the region still reliant on west German financial transfers. And growth in gross domestic product comes from a very low base. Gross domestic product fell by more than 30 per cent in 1990. In separate reports, the Federal Statistics Office, the Bundesbank, and Deutsche Bank Research, conclude that the 'de-industrialisation' in the five eastern states since 1990 is now complete, providing a foundation for gradual growth. This involved a massive restructuring of industry, including modernisation and closures. But export demand, the main engine driving the west German economy, remains extremely weak in eastern Germany. According to yesterday's annual report by the Statistics Office, east German exports totalled DM12bn (Pounds 4.88bn) last year, a fall of over DM1.79bn on the previous year. East Germany's total exports last year represented only 2 per cent of Germany's total export trade, compared with 30 per cent in 1989. Last year, over 52 per cent of east German exports were targeted on the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, consisting mainly of mechanical engineering, chemical, and machine tool building products. East Germany's exports to the region shrank by 80 per cent in the first few years after unification, following German monetary union and the collapse of Comecon, the former eastern trading organisation. But as the Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank Research indicate, the restructuring since unification, and continuing high level of investment, which was up a real 17 per cent in the first quarter, is improving competitiveness in some sectors. For example, car production at plants built since unification by Opel, BMW, and Volkswagen, rose by 45 per cent in the first quarter this year - and can match, if not exceed west German productivity levels. Competitiveness in retailing and construction is also approaching west German levels, according to the Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank. Deutsche cautions that productivity across the sectors varies widely, depending on the nature of the investments, lay-offs and restructuring, and high unit wage costs, which are on average 50 per cent higher than in west Germany, continue to delay international competitiveness. Overall industrial production in eastern Germany is expected to increase throughout 1994 after growing 21.6 per cent year on year in the first quarter. New orders - for the whole German market - grew by 20.1 per cent in the same period, and domestic orders rose by 27.6 per cent, an indication that the east German economy is producing items which industry requires. However, the region remains heavily dependent on western German goods, particularly of consumer products, which last year were six times as high as eastern German deliveries to western Germany. But there are signs that west German companies that have invested in eastern Germany are 'importing' the products back into western Germany. 'More east German firms are now establishing a foothold in the west German market with new, improved products. The investments in recent years are bearing first fruit,' says Deutsche.</p>

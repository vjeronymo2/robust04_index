			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- After significant  contacts with Romanian officials and a concert at Radio Hall  conducted by Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the chief  diplomat was received by Romanian president Ion Iliescu on 8  April at the Cotroceni Palace.    Summing up his discussion with the Romanian head of state  and  other officials, Willy Claes said that the political statement  he signed in Bucharest offered a framework "comprehensive  enough" to allow for the development of relations, especially  legal and economic. The Belgian foreign minister said that when  there are sufficient guarantees of stability in Romania, Belgian  investors would not hesitate to do business in Romania.    The same day, the Belgian foreign minister had an interview  with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase, during which he  said Western Europe did not intend to treat countries in Central  and Eastern Europe differently than any others.    Minister Willy Claes had to cut his Romanian visit short  because of recent events in Rwanda which cost the lives of  several Belgian UN officers stationed in that country. He left  Romania in the afternoon of April 8.</p>

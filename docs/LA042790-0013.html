			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER IN GIRL'S FATAL FALL FROM TRUCK  </P> <P> A plea of not guilty was entered Thursday by a 28-year-old man charged with  murder in the death of a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly pushed from a  moving pickup truck on Interstate 5.  </P> <P> Jesus Hector Garcia of City Heights is scheduled to appear in Municipal Court  May 10 for a preliminary hearing. On Thursday, Municipal Judge Terry J. Knoepp  set bail at $500,000.  </P> <P> "This case is extremely serious because it involves different factors," Deputy  Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz said outside the courtroom. The suspect "left the scene,  and the case involves a 12-year-old which was either pushed or tried to escape.  He also has two prior drug offenses. Bail is appropriate."  </P> <P> Public Defender Alex M. Loebig Jr. disagreed.  </P> <P> "It is way too high," he said. "He's a pretty straight guy, been working, owns  his own home. It was just an accident. The girl has a history of acting up.  She's a runaway. I don't know if she was a bad person, but she was emotionally  unstable. He was just giving her a ride home because her relatives asked him.  She may have jumped out of the car."  </P> <P> A bail review hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> "We hope to get the bail drastically reduced," Loebig said. "We are concerned  that he left the scene of the crime, and it's too bad he did, but it was just a  tragic reaction to a devastating accident that took him by surprise. He said  that she got hysterical and jumped out."  </P> <P> According to police, the victim "walked away" about two weeks ago from  Hillcrest Receiving Home, a facility for children under county care. The mother  described the girl as "incorrigible," authorities said.  </P> <P> Katz said an inquiry into the incident is continuing.  </P> <P> "We have numerous witnesses, and police felt they had sufficient evidence to  file murder charges," he said.  </P> <P> A witness told police that he saw the incident about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. The  witness said a red, four-wheel-drive Toyota pickup truck with oversized tires  was northbound on I-5 when he saw the girl lean toward the driver, the  passenger door open and the girl being ejected. The girl landed on a service  road about 50 feet north of the Old Town exit.  </P> <P> Sylvia Marie Rodriguez died of multiple injuries, according to the coroner's  office.  </P> <P> Police obtained a search warrant based on information from relatives who knew  the suspect. Garcia was arrested Tuesday shortly before 4 a.m. at his home in  the 3400 block of 45th St. Police also recovered a 1989 red Toyota pickup with  large tires.  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Departures The last of the old guard at Simon Engineering departed this week as Peter Cook resigned from the board to pursue other interests. The move came as no surprise to Simon-watchers, and completes a reorganisation of the board since Maurice Dixson arrived last year as chief executive. Cook joined Simon in 1977 as finance director, and subsequently held a number of executive roles. In January, he was relieved of his responsibilities as managing director of the industrial services division. Since then, he had been concentrating on the group's disposal programme, and had been due to retire at the end of this year.</p>

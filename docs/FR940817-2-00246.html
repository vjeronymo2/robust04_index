			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3.2. Dosing scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The dosing strategy used in experimental studies is an important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable in the development and expression of neurotoxicity (WHO, 1986). Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicants can produce neurotoxicity following a single exposure, while others require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated dosing. Repeated dosing represents the typical pattern of human exposure to many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical substances. Significant differences in response may occur when an acutely toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of material is administered over different exposure periods. For some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicants the onset of neurotoxicity can occur immediately after dosing, while others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may require time after exposure for the toxicity to develop. Effects of repeated exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may result in a progressive alteration in nervous system function or structure, while latent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual effects may be discovered only in association with age-related changes or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable environmental or pharmacological challenge (Zenick, 1983; MacPhail et al., 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure adequate assessment of neurotoxicity, study designs should include multiple dosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regimens, e.g., repeated exposure, with appropriate dose-to-response intervals of testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conduct of neurotoxicological evaluations in studies utilizing excessively toxic doses should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3.3. Other factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are a number of other factors that should be considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design and interpretation of studies using animal models (WHO, 1986). Design factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include such issues as using properly trained personnel to conduct the studies, the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate numbers of animals per group to achieve reliable statistical significance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling the time-of-day variability. Time of testing relative to exposure is also important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for assessing neurotoxic endpoints such as behavior, and experiments should be designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generate a time course of effects, including recovery of function, if any. Housing is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important environmental design factor, because animals housed individually and animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housed in groups can respond differently to toxic agents. Temperature, as an experimental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable, may also affect the outcome of neurotoxicological studies. The responsiveness to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some chemicals (e.g., triethyltin, methamphetamine) varies with ambient temperature (Dyer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Howell, 1982; Bowyer et al., 1992). Some neurobiological endpoints, such as sensory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evoked potentials, can be influenced by the endogenous temperature of the animal (Dyer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1987). Therefore, changes in body temperature, whether due to fluctuations in ambient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature or to some chemically induced effect such as inhibition of sweating, can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confound the interpretation of measures such as evoked responses unless proper controls are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the experimental design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because a variety of other physiological changes can influence neuronal functions, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is important to recognize that chemical-related neurotoxicity could result from treatment-induced physiological changes, such as altered nutritional state (WHO, 1986). As part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicological profile, correlative measures, such as relative and absolute organ weights,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food and water consumption, and body weight and weight gain, may be signs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological change associated with systemic toxicity and may be useful in determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative contribution of general toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3.4. Statistical considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experimental designs for neurotoxicological studies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently complex, with two or more major variables (e.g., gender, time of testing) varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in any single experiment. In addition, such studies typically generate varying types of data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including continuous, dichotomous, and rank-order data. Knowledge and experience in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental design and statistical analyses are important. There are several key statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concepts that should be understood in neurotoxicological studies (WHO, 1986; Gad, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The power, or probability, of a study to detect a true effect is dependent on the size of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study group, the frequency of the outcome variable in the general population, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude of effect to be identified. Statistical evaluation of a treatment-related effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves the consideration of two factors or types of errors to be avoided. A Type I error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to the attribution of an exposure-related neurotoxicological effect when none has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred (false positive), while a Type II error refers to the failure to attribute an effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when an exposure-related effect has actually occurred (false negative). In general, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of a Type I error should not exceed 5 percent and the probability of a Type II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> error should not exceed 20 percent. Power is defined as one minus the probability of a Type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determination of power also requires knowledge of the difference in magnitude of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome measures observed between exposed and control groups and the variability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome measure among subjects. The sample size required to achieve a given level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical power increases as variability increases or the difference between groups decreases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous data (i.e., magnitude, rate, amplitude), if found to be normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed, can be analyzed with a general linear model using a grouping factor of dose and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary, repeated measures across time. Post hoc comparisons between control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other treatment groups can be made following tests for overall significance. In the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple endpoints within a series of evaluations, correction for multiple observations (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bonferroni's) might be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Descriptive data (categorical) and rank data can be analyzed using standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonparametric techniques. In some cases, if it is believed that the data fit the linear model,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the categorical data modeling procedure can be used for weighted least-squares estimation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters for a wide range of general linear models, including repeated measures analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The weighted least-squares approach to categorical and rank data allows computation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistics for testing the significance of sources of variation as reflected by the model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.2. Tiered Testing in Neurotoxicology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The utility of tiered testing as an efficient and cost-effective approach to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical toxicity, including neurotoxicity, has been recognized (NRC, 1975). Briefly, first-tier tests are designed to determine the presence or absence of neurotoxicity, while second-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tier tests characterize the neurotoxic effect (NRC, 1992). There are at least two aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tiered testing, one involving the type of test used (Tilson, 1990a) and the other involving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosing regimen (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

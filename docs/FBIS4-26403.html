			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As of 1  June, the China Press and Publications Administration began to  control the total quantity of book registration numbers used by  publishing houses. Books to be published in one year will be  controlled at the level of some 70,000.    In recent years, some publishing houses in China published a  large quantity of books beyond the scope of their business, or  even resold book registration numbers for profit. After 1985,  book registration numbers increased by an average of 15 percent  each year. This seriously affected book quality. Recently,  three publishing houses in Beijing which seriously violated the  relevant regulations were ordered to suspend operations. They  were China Broadcast and Television Publishing House, Beijing  Yanshan Publishing House, and Haiyang Publishing House.    In its recent circular, the China Press and Publications  Administration laid down rules for controlling the use of book  registration numbers every year. In the future, if any  publishing houses are found to be reselling book registration  numbers for profit, the numbers they can use will be reduced by  over 15 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen: "The Third </F> Path"]    [Text] The bartender is a schoolteacher by day. His wife  works part-time in the same restaurant as a waitress. She also  has three other jobs.    This is an everyday situation in the United States, as  described by one U.S. newspaper. It is certainly not an unusual  situation. In round figures one in three employees in the United  States is considered a part-time or casual worker with a limited  contract of employment. By the year 2000 it is expected that  more than half the work force will find itself in this situation.    The problem is not part-time work in itself. The problem is  that part-time and casual work is part of the trend in the  United States where employees' rights are rapidly being  undermined. Employers do not need to pay health insurance or  pension contributions for those who are employed on these terms.  They can fire workers as they please, without any notice. And  extremely low wages often go hand in hand with this absence of  rights.    The United States has created a good 2 million jobs over the  past 14 months. But many of these jobs are well below the  standard that we in Denmark and Europe associate with proper  work.    The Americans work with the concept: "the working poor."  This refers to the many people in the United States who, it is  true, have been given work but at a wage under the poverty line.  More than half of the over 30 million Americans who live below  the official poverty line are a member of families in which at  least one person is employed.    President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert Reich have set  themselves the task of changing this situation. Reich stated  recently:    "The question presents itself whether the advanced economies  are condemned to choose between more jobs with lower wages or  fewer jobs with good wages. I hope and believe that the answer  is no."    I agree: The answer is no. There is a third way between  more jobs with low wages or fewer jobs with good wages. A way  that is founded on creating proper jobs. This way will be  strengthened with the Nordic countries and Austria as members of  the European Union [EU]. And it will continue to be followed  when the countries of East Europe join.    In the past few years the EU countries have concerned  themselves most with staking out this third way on the basis of  the European welfare tradition. The Danish Government has been  one of the driving forces in this work.    We have to admit that over the past 20 years Europe has been  much worse at creating new jobs than both the United States and  Japan. But we must not combat unemployment by creating social  gulfs that are completely unacceptable in our societies.    The discussion of this problem was at the center of the EC  summit in Copenhagen last year. It was stressed that much more  can be done to promote employment if the countries make a  concerted effort to get their economies going. In addition, the  EC Commission was asked to draft a white book with the title,  "Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment."    On some central points the EU's initiative is in line with  the Danish Government's policy.    The European point of departure is that it is not low wages  and poor working conditions that will strengthen our economies  in international competition. Under no circumstances can we  compete in these areas with the Southeast Asian and East  European countries, for example.    Our economic future depends first and foremost on whether  we are able to make our labor forces good enough, whether we are  creative enough in the development of new products, and whether  we are in the lead in the use of high technology.    The EU is preparing the way for major public investment  projects in two areas that are very central to our economic  development. One is energy and transport. The other is  telecommunications.    The Danish Government has to a large extent persuaded the  other EU countries to attach great importance to restructuring  their taxation systems. Taxes on labor must be reduced, and on  the other hand taxes on pollution and resource use must be  increased. This makes it easier for companies to employ people,  but punishes us all for the ruthless exploitation of natural  resources.    The EU countries are well aware that there is a need for a  drastic increase in investment in education, research, and  product development in the field of high technology where Europe  is clearly lagging behind both Japan and the United States.    An important part of European thinking is the better  distribution of work. Here too we in Denmark have been in the  vanguard with the visionary leave reform that has been  introduced.    Even though the EU has backed a number of sensible joint  approaches, it is clear that the EU countries are unable to  agree on everything. Some nonsocialist governments -- headed by  the British Conservatives -- would have liked to have given  prominence to other aspects that have more in common with the  pre-Clinton United States. They advocate lower unemployment  benefits, a reduction in the wages of those with low earnings,  and cuts in social benefits, for example.    In its white book the EU Commission also mentions these  views. But it also issues a warning against repeating the U.S.  trend -- a warning that both Jacques Delors and I myself have  voiced in the European debate. The white book says, among other  things:    "In particular, a greater downward wage spread would lead to  a significant real-term fall in the lowest wages. This would be  impossible without a reduction in unemployment benefit and  social insurance arrangements. In combination with an increase  in the use of part-time employees it would also, all things  being equal, make the present distribution of income more  unequal and at worst create a poverty group who cannot live  decently on their wages and therefore lead to a form of  exclusion that is just as destructive as unemployment."    Social democratic and nonsocialist attitudes to unemployment  are at odds in Europe, as they are in Denmark.    The social democratic parties in Europe have jointly drafted  an important initiative for a European employment policy. This  initiative, which has the title "Put Europe to Work," is a  program for what I have called the third way in the battle  against unemployment.    Here in Denmark nonsocialist politicians have voiced views  that are the same as those coming from conservative forces in  Europe.    Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders Fogh Rasmussen said  recently that the United States is the country that comes  closest to his ideal of a liberalistic society. The  Conservatives' leader, Hans Engell, has argued in a somewhat  toned-down version that we should look at U.S. methods of  boosting employment.    Attitudes to what should happen to the welfare state in  Denmark and Europe are inextricably linked. We will work for  the third way in Denmark and in Europe. That is why it is so  important to elect a large number of social democrats to the  European Parliament.</p>

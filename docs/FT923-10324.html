			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: While Bosnia is burning THERE HAS long been a painful mismatch between events in the former Yugoslavia and the international response. But at no point has the gulf between the conflict on the ground and the externally sponsored negotiations to stop it seemed more shocking or embarrassing than now. While the Serbs continue their campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the European Community peace conference in London sets up a co-ordinating committee on constitutional change. While tens of thousands of Moslems flee to neighbouring countries, the British government proposes a new international conference on Yugoslavia - at the end of next month. That the west feels helpless in the face of the Yugoslav horrors should not really be surprising. Months of arduous mediation efforts by Lord Carrington on behalf of the EC have failed to bring the Bosnian factions any closer together, as this week's desultory and futile negotiations in London have made clear. There can be no assurance that a wider international conference will have any greater success unless the combatants themselves want to stop fighting. But to admit the difficulties is not to excuse the impossibly confused and half-hearted approach which western governments have displayed in recent weeks. The EC has discredited its peace effort by failing to back it with adequate resources, and through its clumsy attempt to hand over implementation of a half-baked ceasefire agreement to the United Nations. The UN's paymasters have hobbled its peacekeeping and humanitarian mission by stinting on the number of troops they are prepared to sanction, either to keep relief supplies moving from Sarajevo airport to other parts of Bosnia or to demilitarise and police UN-protected areas of Croatia. Partly as a result of such failures on the part of their member governments, the two organisations have found themselves at loggerheads when they should be working together constructively. The newly proposed international conference offers an opportunity to begin sorting out the mess. With representatives of the EC and UN at the same table, they should be able to avoid the crossed wires of the past few weeks and to devise a common strategy to deal with the growing refugee problem as well as with actual and potential conflicts on the ground. And with the US government and other interested parties involved, a wider conference should carry greater weight than one sponsored by the EC alone. To fulfil these requirements, however, and to win credibility, such a conference will have to be carefully prepared. It will have to be given a structure durable enough to lay the foundations of peace - or capable of defining what action to take, including possible military action, in the event of continuing war. That means it should have permanent and purposeful leadership - Lord Carrington and Mr Cyrus Vance for co-chairmen, perhaps, rather than the temporary occupants of the EC presidency - and be given the resources and manpower to do the job. Above all, though, if such a conference is worth convening at all, it is worth convening rapidly. If it really has to be delayed until the end of August, the intervening period must be used intensively to ensure that all parties arrive prepared to take, and support, the necessary hard decisions.</p>

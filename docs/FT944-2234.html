			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Saatchi forced to stand down as chairman Mr Maurice Saatchi was last night forced to stand down as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded in 1970, after the board succumbed to pressure from a group of US shareholders. However, at 7.30pm he was still considering an offer to stay on as chairman of one of the group's advertising subsidiaries, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. The board yesterday formally recommended that the holding company drop 'Saatchi' from its masthead. It will be retained only by the advertising subsidiary. The board was reluctant to take the decision but was told by its financial and legal advisers - there were 12 lawyers in the boardroom - that they had no choice in the face of shareholder pressure. US shareholders controlling 30 per cent of the shares, led by Harris Associates of Chicago, have been campaigning for Mr Saatchi's removal, because of their anger at a proposal that he receive a Pounds 5m option package. They were also furious at Mr Saatchi's opposition to dropping the 'Saatchi' name from the holding company masthead. A decision was also taken at the board meeting, at the group's headquarters in London's Charlotte Street, for a new option scheme to be put in place to reward company directors and senior executives. Unlike the 'super option' scheme, which was criticised by the shareholders, the new plan will meet the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers, the investment institution lobby group. The board was told by its advisers that it had no option after soundings were taken on Thursday of UK investment institutions, led by unit trust group, M&amp;G, which owns 5 per cent. The informal poll, made by M&amp;G, showed that shareholders controlling a further 28 per cent would either support a motion to oust Mr Saatchi or ab-stain. Because shareholders owning more than half the group were showing no support for Mr Saatchi, the company's merchant bank, SG Warburg, was forced to tell the board that it could see little alternative to Mr Saatchi's departure. Mr Saatchi had during the day been making a last-ditch attempt to persuade the board of the possible damage to the company from his departure. On Thursday he contacted his friends, John and Forrest Mars, owners of confectionery and foods group, Mars, who said they would review whether to keep their advertising business at the company if he went. Mars is one of the group's biggest clients He also presented the board with letters backing him from several senior executives. Four of the group's six non-executives were present.</p>

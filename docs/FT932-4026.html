			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major taunts Smith with election 'score' PRIME MINISTER John Major yesterday brushed aside Labour calls for a general election as he insisted he was 'getting on with the work in hand.' Looking more composed after his ordeal on Wednesday at the hands of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, Mr Major sparked uproar in the chamber with the robustness of his response. 'You might have overlooked it but we had an election last year,' he told Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. 'We won it and you lost it. The score is 4-0 in elections recently. In due course it will be 5-0.' Mr Smith made repeated reference to Mr Lamont's savage resignation statement as he tried to press home the advantage gained from his own scathing personal attack on Mr Major's leadership delivered earlier this week. 'Who is better placed to know than the ex-chancellor the weaknesses of this administration and the weaknesses of you?', he asked. 'Don't you understand the significance of the ex-chancellor's revelations is that they come from a close political colleague and ally who sat beside you, right at the heart of government?' But Mr Major - encouraged by the more supportive mood on the Tory back benches - declined to be goaded. He had 'no intention' of adding to what Mr Lamont had said or 'providing you with an opportunity to extend it'. The Labour leader's references to Mr Lamont's words had been 'very selective'. With the former chancellor looking on impassively from the back benches, the prime minister went on to quote one of his predecessors, Harold Macmillan, saying the government had 'a little local difficulty,' adding 'We will get over it. I am getting on with the work in hand.' This prompted Mr Smith to accuse Mr Major of being 'incapable of learning from anything and anybody.' The prime minister had 'sent apprehension throughout the land' when he announced that it was business as usual yesterday morning. 'Since your authority and that of your government is now in tatters, won't you, for once, put the national interest first and let the people decide in a general election,' the Labour leader continued. 'Why will you not let the people decide if they want you and your wretched government?' Earlier there had been a burst of misplaced anticipation when it emerged that Mr Archie Hamilton, another minister who left government in last month's reshuffle, was poised to make a personal statement. In the event, the former armed forces minister showed impeccable loyalty to Mr Major - and prompted a cheer from Tory MPs - by proclaiming his intention to support the government from the back benches. 'I am sure we will see the growth of the economy that we all so fervently desire and the recognition of all that the prime minister is doing to bring it about,' Mr Hamilton said. He said he had asked Mr Major in January if he could leave the government when it was next reshuffled. 'As a result of the unexpected timing of the reshuffle I may run the risk that some may think I did not go voluntarily but was sacked,' he said.</p>

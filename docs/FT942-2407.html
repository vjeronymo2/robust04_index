			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Colombia upset Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu scored one goal in each half as Romania surprised Colombia 3-1 in a Group A game on Saturday in Los Angeles. Colombia, rated by many as among the best of the 24 qualifiers, started well but could not reassert themselves after going 2-0 down against a team that counter-attacked furiously. The US and Switzerland drew 1-1 in the weekend's other Group A game, at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan - the first World Cup match ever played indoors. The game drew an overnight television rating of 5.8 points in the US, beating the US Open Golf Championship. The ABC television network, which carried the game, also said Sunday the game produced an 18 share in a survey of 31 markets. A ratings point represents 942,000 homes in the United States. The share is the percentage of televisions tuned to the program at the time.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF NUCLEAR TESTS  </P> <P> Uranium miners and people who lived downwind from nuclear testing would get  money and an apology from the government for the radiation sickness they now  suffer, under a bill the House approved Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This bill is an apology to those people and their heirs on behalf of the  government and the American people that they were subjected and sacrificed for  the Cold War nuclear weapons," said Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah), sponsor of the  bill.  </P> <P> Known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, the measure was passed on a  voice vote. President Bush opposes the bill, which is awaiting floor action in  the Senate.  </P> <P> Those affected lived in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and  Wyoming. Many are Navajo Indians.  </P> <P> The legislation stems in part from 10 years of work by Stewart Udall, former  congressman and secretary of the Interior, who represented the uranium miners  in a lawsuit against the government in 1979.  </P> <P> The courts ruled that the government was immune from prosecution because  national security needs required a huge flow of uranium ore to make weapons  that could be used against the Soviets.  </P> <P> The courts ruled similarly in the cases of the so-called "downwinders." Udall  said that, despite the rulings, some of the judges who handled the cases wrote  opinions that counseled the plaintiffs to seek redress from Congress.  </P> <P> "Today, the House of Representatives restores our nation's honor by holding the  government responsible for Cold War abuses that have stained our collective  consciences by causing death and injury to its own people," Owens said. "The  Cold War can't be over until we have paid the debt to the civilian victims."  </P></p>

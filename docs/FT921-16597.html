			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressures on sterling ease THE PRESSURES on sterling eased slightly on Tuesday after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, warned that there would be no devaluation of the pound in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. With little business being transacted in the currency markets ahead of the new year holiday, dealers said it had taken only a small amount of buying interest to boost the pound. In particular, traders welcomed Mr Lamont's strong rejection of calls from within his own party for a realignment of the ERM currencies. Further support for sterling came from the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Brian Corby, the CBI president, said it would be 'absolutely foolish' to contemplate a devaluation. He added that a devaluation could lead to higher interest rates. As trading in the London market drew to a close, sterling was quoted at DM2.8375, unchanged from Monday's close; it was higher at Dollars 1.8710 from Dollars 1.8670. In spite of sterling's modest recovery, it still remained firmly at the bottom of the ERM. The Spanish peseta - the strongest currency in the ERM grid - was 6.2 per cent above the pound, just below the level at which the Bank of England would be forced to defend the UK currency. Many analysts still believe the pressure on sterling will eventually force the government to raise interest rates. With money market rates at 11 per cent, signalling a  1/2 point rise in base rates, those pressures are likely to grow as the new year begins. The impact of the Bundesbank's decision to lift interest rates before Christmas is likely to be felt throughout the ERM this month unless German rates ease back. But with German inflation not yet under control, dealers said there was unlikely to be any relief from the Frankfurt money markets. The dollar was steady to slightly firmer against the D-Mark. Analysts noted that since the reduction in Japanese interest rates, the dollar had stabilised and was beginning to edge modestly higher against European currencies. However, it continued to weaken against the yen. Dealers believed the yen's strength against the dollar had been encouraged by Japanese monetary authorities and was a response to the visit to Japan of Mr George Bush, the US president. The yen's rise against the dollar would allow US exports to become more competitive in Asian markets and would help deflect attention away from the politically sensitive issue of Japan's trade surplus with the US. Trading is likely to remain thin for the rest of this week and the market is not expected to be back to full strength until Monday. The release of the December US purchasing managers survey today will be closely examined for signs of recovery. The dollar closed at DM1.5170 from DM1.5200 and at Y124.95 from Y125.70.</p>

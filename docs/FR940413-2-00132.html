Preston; Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Douglas D. Preston was employed by the Berry Construction Company at the Iowa Electric Light and Power Company's (IELPC or Licensee) Duane Arnold Energy Center where he was granted unescorted access. IELPC holds Facility License DPR&hyph;49, issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR part 50 on February 22, 1974. The license authorizes IELPC to operate the Duane Arnold Energy Center located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Preston first applied for employment with Berry Construction Company and was subsequently granted unescorted access to the Duane Arnold Energy Center on or about June 19, 1990, based in part on the representations he made on his access authorization applications. One of the representations was that he had not been arrested and convicted for any criminal offense other than minor traffic violations. The Licensee submitted fingerprint cards to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and subsequently was informed that Mr. Preston had a record of arrests, convictions, and imprisonments prior to 1978. However, while waiting for the results of the FBI fingerprint check, Mr. Preston's employment at the Duane Arnold Energy Center was terminated for a lack of work. Mr. Preston's deliberate false statements on his access authorization application on or about June 19, 1990 were essentially the same as his 1993 false statements (addressed below), but are not being cited in this Order as a violation because they were made before the effective date of 10 CFR 50.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 21, 1993, Mr. Preston again applied for a position at the Duane Arnold Energy Center and was hired on June 21, 1993 by the Berry Construction Company as a laborer with responsibilities involving NRC-licensed activities. On June 23, 1993, Mr. Preston filled out an access authorization application and again denied having a criminal history. The Licensee granted Mr. Preston temporary unescorted access to the plant on or about July 15, 1993. On or about August 13, 1993, the Licensee received the results of a second FBI fingerprint check which again detailed Mr. Preston's criminal history. Mr. Preston, when questioned by an IELPC investigator on August 13, at first denied having a criminal history and then admitted that he had lied about his criminal history to gain employment in 1990 and again in 1993. He further stated that he would lie again to gain employment in the future. The Licensee than revoked Mr. Preston's unescorted access based on the deliberately false information regarding his criminal history on his access authorization application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above Mr. Preston engaged in deliberate misconduct on or about June 23, 1993, by deliberately falsely stating on the access authorization application that he had no criminal history for crimes other than minor traffic offenses. The Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.5, in part, prohibit any employee of a contractor of a licensee from literately submitting to the licensee information that the employee knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. Mr. Preston's actions constitute a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a). Information concerning criminal history is material to the determination the licensee must make to meet 10 CFR 73.56(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee, its contractors, and the licensee and contractor employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material respects. Mr. Preston's actions in deliberately providing false information to the Licensee constitute deliberate violations of Commission regulations and his statement to the Licensee that he would do it again have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that nuclear safety activities within NRC jurisdiction can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would be protected if Mr. Preston were permitted to be engaged in the performance of licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Mr. Preston be prohibited from being involved in the performance of activities licensed by the NRC for a five year period. In addition, Mr. Preston is required to notify the NRC, for an additional five year period, of his acceptance of employment in NRC-licensed activities so that appropriate inspections can be performed. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the deliberate misconduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 50.5,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Railway projects won by Mowlem MOWLEM MANAGEMENT has won two railway projects. The largest is a Pounds 10m design, manage and construct contract for repairs, refurbishment and upgrading of depots, sheds and sidings at 29 sites throughout the London Underground network. The work comprises the provision of staff facilities, offices, canteens, storage and toilets. The buildings are between 15 and 100 years old; some will be refurbished while others will be demolished and replaced by new buildings. All the train sheds will be refurbished and other work includes the upgrading of safety, maintenance and cleaning equipment. The second, at Upminster in Essex, is a Pounds 2.4m contract for a British Rail signalling facility which will centralise and upgrade signalling on the London, Tilbury and Southend railway. The two-storey 1,250 sq metre building will be built on piled foundations, have a steel frame with metal cladding and a roof of pressed metal sheeting. After Mowlem has completed building works signalling equipment will be supplied and fitted by GEC under a separate contract. Work is due for completion by October 1993. In Gibraltar Mowlem Management has been awarded a Pounds 3.5m contract for the Europa Business Centre. This EC-funded scheme involves the alteration and refurbishment of a former Ministry of Defence dockside warehouse to create a small business centre comprising industrial units, office suites and a training centre.</p>

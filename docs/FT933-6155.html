			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Troops will leave Lithuania 'today' RUSSIAN troops are to be withdrawn from the Baltic republic of Lithuania today on schedule, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian president, said yesterday in a national radio address. A spokesman for Russian Presdent Boris Yeltsin later confirmed the troops' withdrawal, but refused to say if it would be today. The normally good relations between Russia and Lithuania were soured earlier this month when Russia said it would suspend the withdrawal of 2,500 service personnel and their families because Lithuanian negotiators had insisted on raising the issue of compensation for damage done since the first Soviet occupation in 1940. Russia is in neither the mood nor any condition to make reparations for a Soviet past it disavows. Evidence of this came yesterday when Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to Mr Yeltsin and chairman of a commission to determine events which led up to the shooting down in 1983 of the South Korean civilian airliner KAL007 over Soviet airspace, said that the Soviet Union bore no guilt for the incident. Mr Filatov said pilot error had taken the plane 350 miles off course, deep into Soviet airspace.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Safety Study Launched: Boeing said it is taking several steps to ease concerns  by the Federal Aviation Administration about procedures for reporting aircraft  defects as well as cross-wiring problems found in Boeing planes. Boeing is  modifying its procedures for reporting incidents to the FAA to ensure the  reports are made in a timely manner. The concerns arose after several 757s were  found with miswired fire-suppressions systems. Boeing also has launched a study  to develop common design solutions to prevent possible errors in assembling and  maintaining smoke and fire detection and extinguishing systems on its aircraft.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins Brewery board near to thwarting rebels THE BOARD OF Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, yesterday said it had almost amassed sufficient support to thwart attempts by rebel shareholders to change the board. And at yesterday's annual meeting the board commanded more than 60 per cent of the support of shareholders who were voting on a number of issues. But a vocal minority, led by Mr Richard Cattermole, denied Hoskins the 75 per cent support required to pass a special resolution authorising the company to issue new shares to make selective acquisitions. The dissidents want to remove Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother, Mr Robert Hoar, from the board. Resolutions to replace the brothers, whose family holds 30 per cent of Hoskins, with Mr Cattermole, head of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels operator, and one of his associates, will be put to the vote at an EGM on November 18. Mr Cattermole said: 'It is meaningless of Mr Barrie to boast of having almost half the votes already since shareholders can change their minds right up and at the EGM.' The EGM is likely to be a bruising affair judging by yesterday's annual meeting. The brewery was accused of 'skullduggery' and 'unfair play' by some of the dissidents when one of their members, Mr Norman Blyth, had his proxy vote ruled out of order. Although he is chairman of Caswan Properties, which has a 3.1 per cent stake in the brewery, Hoskins said Mr Blyth had no written authorisation from his company to cast his vote on its behalf. Mr Hoar, who for a large part of the AGM was barely audible, was criticised for selling nine pubs for Pounds 2.45m to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, leaving it with its brewery and seven houses. The deal, however, eliminated borrowings. Hoskins now has cash of about Pounds 750,000. Hoskins reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 83,060 last year, but extraordinary charges reduced the attributable gain to Pounds 16,625.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Big Six accounts groups lift fee income THE WORLD'S largest six international accountancy networks boosted fee income 6 per cent to Dollars 31bn (Pounds 20bn) in the last year, according to figures to be published today by International Accounting Bulletin. KPMG Peat Marwick topped the list with income from 124 affiliated firms up 2.3 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn in the year to September 30, while it reduced staff and partner numbers by 4 per cent to 73,488. The remaining Big Six firms - in descending order by fee income  - were Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Price Waterhouse. With the exception of Arthur Andersen, most of the international networks are loosely integrated associations of firms which share referrals but not profits or liabilities. Because they are partnerships, none publishes profit figures. In spite of reduced staff numbers and the prolonged effects of the global recession, fee income for the leading 28 networks rose by 11 per cent, comparable with the previous year. Andersen reported fee income up 12.7 per cent to Dollars 5.6bn in the year to August 31, and was one of very few firms to increase staff from 59,797 to 62,134. Kreston International boosted fee income 34 per cent to Dollars 189m, Clark Kenneth Leventhal by 23 per cent to Dollars 487m, and Nexia International by 19 per cent to Dollars 483m. Much of this growth came through the addition of new members to the networks of the firms. Only one network - GMN International  - reported a decline, with income down 0.6 per cent to Dollars 165m. The 28 international accountancy networks listed generated fee income of nearly Dollars 41bn in the latest financial year. But the figures in the report, published by the Lafferty business information group, illustrate the continued dominance of the leading 'Big Six' accountancy networks. The top six firms reported income of Dollars 31bn in their most recent year, with a substantial jump from the seventh largest, BDO Binder Hamlyn, at Dollars 1.2bn to the sixth, Price Waterhouse, at Dollars 3.8bn. Total employment across the 28 networks was about 500,000.</p>

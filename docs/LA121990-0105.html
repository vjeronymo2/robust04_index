			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI RESEARCHERS TO STUDY S&amp;L FRAUD  </P> <P> The troubled savings and loan industry will go under the microscope in a  research project headed by two UC Irvine faculty members.  </P> <P> The National Institute of Justice has awarded a $240,000 grant to Henry Pontell  and Kitty Calavita, both of UCI's social ecology department, to conduct the  first comprehensive study of fraud in the nation's S&amp;L industry.  </P> <P> For the next two years, Pontell, an associate UCI professor, and Calavita, an  assistant UCI professor, will examine the magnitude, nature and role of  white-collar crime in the thrift industry.  </P> <P> The UCI researchers said their preliminary studies have shown that S&amp;L  fraud falls into three broad groups which they describe as unlawful  risk-taking, looting and cover-ups.  </P> <P> In practice, fraud at any institution could encompass all three categories,  they said.  </P> <P> The researchers will concentrate on the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles  (including Orange County), San Francisco, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Houston, Miami and  Washington.  </P> <P> They will analyze government reports, transcripts of congressional hearings and  statistics from U.S. attorney's offices. They also will rely on interviews with  regulators and prosecutors, and will try to identify ways to improve  regulations and law enforcement efforts.  </P> <P> There is no indication that they plan to interview current or former savings  and loan executives.  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (12): Market stopped in its tracks - Securitisation The rise in US interest rates in recent months has clouded the outlook for the asset securitisation business in the US. While the volume of asset-backed securities grew by 9 per cent to Dollars 56.8bn in 1993, the market has stopped in its tracks this year. By April, Dollars 15.4bn in asset-backed securities had been issued, down from Dollars 15.7bn in the first four months of 1993. The larger mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market has also experienced a reversal but when it came it was later in the year, and more severe. While first quarter MBS new issue volume grew by about 6 per cent to a record Dollars 108.8bn, it plunged 75 per cent in April when only Dollars 7bn of securities were issued. The downturn in the asset-backed and MBS markets also reflected the increase in bond market volatility. As Ms Patricia Bonan, head of asset-backed finance at Chase Securities in New York, explains: 'It is not the absolute level of interest rates, but interest rate volatility that has kept investors on the sidelines.' Nevertheless, the business of securitising assets remains in a healthy condition, and innovation is still a feature. Last year, car loans and receipts were the most heavily securitised form of asset (volume totalled Dollars 24.9bn), followed by credit and card charge receivables (Dollars 19.1bn). However, many other types of assets are being securitised in greater numbers as issuers seek a cheaper way to finance their asset growth. Recent innovations include securitised automobile dealers' loans (the money vehicle manufacturers lend to their dealers to purchase new cars and trucks), agricultural equipment loans, automobile leases, and loans granted to companies by Eximbank, the government body which provides export credit guarantees. Innovation in the MBS market has been hit by the turmoil and volatility of recent months which left participants reeling - particularly those active in the MBS derivatives market, where volatility destroyed their assumptions about prepayment levels and made the pricing of securities such as collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs) extremely difficult. As prices fell and liquidity dried up, some leveraged funds which had taken big positions in CMOs came unstuck. Askin Capital Management was forced into bankruptcy in April because of its huge CMO-related losses. Those seeking security in the MBS market were attracted by the launch of collateralised mortgage obligations by Ginnie Mae (the Government National Mortgage Association). Although existing CMOs issued by other government mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) are popular because the underlying mortgages are supported by an inferred federal guarantee, Ginnie Mae's mortgages enjoy an explicit federal backing. Thus, its CMOs will carry a zero risk weighting - a big attraction for conservative investors. Although securitisation is a huge market in the US, its development in the UK is at an early stage. Banks and building societies seeking to diversify their funding sources have started to experiment with this financing technique. In the past year, Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank have launched mortgage and personal loan securitisations. Regulatory constraints have hampered the use of securitisation by building societies which last year had just under 60 per cent of the UK mortgage market. The tradition of lending through floating-rate mortgages as opposed to fixed-rate mortgages also puts the UK at a disadvantage because variable-rate assets are more difficult to match. The Building Society Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, is due to publish guidelines in the next two months on how building societies can securitise their assets. Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth-largest, is close to becoming the first society to fund its mortgage lending business through securitisation. Nationwide and Skipton have also carried out similar studies. Leeds has spent the past two years setting up a system to securitise its mortgages so that it can handle higher mortgage volumes. Leeds plans shortly to test the system by using a pool of its mortgages as collateral to raise up to Pounds 100m from a small group of banks rather than through selling securities in the public market. The form of securitisation which the Leeds plans to undertake offers societies another way of gaining access to wholesale markets. If more societies approach the regulatory limits on their wholesale funding, this might prove an attractive alternative form of funding. By comparison, Germany and Denmark have long-established mortgage bond markets through which mortgage banks can raise funds by issuing bonds which are backed by their assets. In Germany, the Pfandbrief dates back to a special decree by Frederick the Great in 1769, while in Denmark, the first mortgage credit institutions were set up at the end of the 18th century to meet the large financing needs after the great fire in Copenhagen in 1789. Dr Helmut Scholz, management board member of Bayerische Vereinsbank, a leading Bavarian mortgage bank, says Pfandbriefe are much safer than mortgage-backed securities because they are issued on the basis of the German mortgage bank act which ensures investor protection through a system of stringent regulations. Danish mortgage banks are also subject to strict regulations, says Lars Rohde, management board member of Realkredit Danmark. For example, banks are required to balance their lending and borrowing and they are not allowed to take foreign exchange or interest rate risks. Despite the high degree of investor protection and liquid secondary markets, both German and Danish mortgage bonds trade at a fairly wide yield spread to government bonds. The differential is thought to reflect the low take-up by foreign investors and mortgage banks in both countries have recently been publicising their bonds abroad in a bid to attract more foreign investment.</p>

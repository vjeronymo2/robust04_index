			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Halt called to Tajik clashes SUPPORTERS and opponents of Tajikistan's conservative authorities clashed in and around the capital of the former Soviet republic yesterday and at least four people were believed to have been killed, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. But after several hours of violence, the first in a month of political confrontation, the two sides in the republic concluded a truce. They agreed to talks and called for the withdrawal or disarming of militia units. President Rakhmon Nabiyev declared a state of emergency, imposing a 9pm-5am curfew, putting troops on alert and banning rallies, political activity and strikes. But neither he nor the speaker of parliament, Mr Safarali Kenjayev, the main target of opposition anger, appeared in public. Moslem and liberal opponents of the conservative government have been demonstrating for five weeks in different parts of Dushanbe. But yesterday's shooting, amid pouring rain in and near the capital, was the first serious violence in what has been largely a standoff. Opposition groups demanded, and secured, several concessions, including the resignation as speaker of Mr Kenjayev, seen as the power behind President Nabiyev's leadership. But he was appointed to the post of security chief last week, sparking fresh protests, and was given back his job as speaker at the weekend, enraging anti-government protesters.</p>

This is a very rude outburst throwing a wet blanket over the  North-South working contact for the exchange of special envoys  now promoted as part of the implementation of the steps of  simultaneous action agreed upon between the DPRK and the United  States. It is also a sinister attempt to create artificial  obstacles and block the exchange of special envoys.    Kim Yong-sam's talk about "nuclear card of the North" was  aimed at isolating and stifling the North by branding it as a  "nuclear culprit."    While taking an insincere attitude toward the exchange of  special envoys, Kim Yong-sam claimed that unless a "meaningful  exchange of special envoys" is realised, the United States would  never hold the third round of talks with the North." This is an  imprudent outcry of a fool. It is ridiculous, indeed, for the  colonial puppet who has no interest in the settlement of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and has no say to  obtrusively behave as if he were a spokesman of the U.S State  Department.    This meant, in other words, that the traitor Kim Yong-sam  ordered the United States to do this or that. But the folly of  the colonial puppet wielding the baton at his master will make a  cat laugh.    The traitor also talked about the "importance of the  cooperation system." This revealed once again his true color as  a dyed-in-the-wool flunkeyist and heinous traitor to the nation  who stoops to any infamy to do harm to fellow countrymen.    Facts show that as long as Kim Yong-sam the fool remains at  the "presidential" post in "Chongwadae," the Korean nation  cannot live in peace even a moment nor can the desire of the  South Korean people for independence, democracy and national  reunification be realised.    The Kim Yong-sam group engaged in treacheries will have to  pay for the arch crime it has committed against history and the  people.</p>

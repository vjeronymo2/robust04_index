			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR busy BTR was by far the busiest stock with turnover in the ordinaries reaching more than 41m shares. Most of this - almost 18m traded at 356p for cash - was accounted for by the take up of BTR's enhanced scrip dividend. There was also substantial switching, dealers noted, from the ordinaries to the warrants. The ordinary shares closed 5 1/2 higher at 347p. The 1993-94 warrants, up 4 1/2 at 65p and the 1998 warrants, which moved up from 38p to 47p, were the pick of the derivatives. The undoubted star of the sector was again Royal Bank of Scotland whose shares continued their move to record levels after the scintillating profits performance from Direct Line, the telephone insurance business, which announced trebled profits of Pounds 50.2m last Thursday. Royal is scheduled to announce its preliminary figures on Thursday with analysts looking for profits in excess of Pounds 200m. The dividend total is expected to rise by 8 per cent to 9.5p. At the close Royal shares were a further 9 higher at 384p, after reaching a peak 386p. Turnover was a hefty 6.3m. Marketmakers were said to have been caught acutely short of stock in the life assurance sector as the market began to take the view that the chancellor may not, as has been widely rumoured for many weeks, interfere with the life and pensions sector in the budget next week. Legal &amp; General jumped 13 to 508p, Lloyds Abbey 13 to 436p and Prudential 14 to 350p. TSB continued to attract keen interest, slipping back to 207 1/2 p at one point, the lowest level since the end of September, before stabilising to close a net 4 off at 209p. Turnover of 4.6m, although by no means outstanding, was slightly above average. 'There was some stock around and the shares dipped below 210p, which has been viewed as a support level. If they close below 210p then the charts point to the shares dropping below 200p,' said one specialist. TSB's preliminary figures are expected in January. A strong drinks sector was the subject of some recovery buying, according to analysts, with a strong sense that the maligned sector was at last beginning to turn. Among those showing good gains, Scottish and Newcastle gained 10 to 482p, Wolverhampton and Dudley 5 to 488p and Allied Lyons 13 to 596p, with a Kleinwort Benson buy note adding impetus to the latter's rise. There were 40m new Whitbread shares issued yesterday, taken up by former investors in the Whitbread Investment Company which was bought out by its parent group in September. And next Thursday, when the tightly-traded B shares cease to exist, a 20m further shares will be issued to existing B shareholders. These new shares are being issued at 482p, against yesterday's closing price for the A's of 533p, a rise on the day of 15. Anslysts do expect some weakness in the shares, but point out that those taking up new shares have already turned down a cash alternative. A positive agm statement from Lloyds Chemist sent the shares forward and also helped Boots. Group sales in the 21-week period were up 9 per cent on a year ago. Its shares gained 10 to 310p. Boots shares climbed 9 to 534p in a strong stores sector which had benefited from a bout of arbitraging against the futures market, according to dealers. Elsewhere, Great Universal Stores added 15 to 580p, Kingfisher 10 to 667p, Marks and Spencer 9 to 420p and Next 5 to 188p. A substantial bear squeeze developed in Delta, the heavy electricals/engineering group, whose shares raced up 24 to 504p, in relatively thin turnover of only 406,000 shares. The performance of the stock was all the more remarkable because one leading UK house was said to have issued a 70-page sell note on the shares. 'There are conflicting views on the stock, and the market today was squeezed up,' said one dealer.' After the market closed Mercury Asset Management said it no longer had a notifiable stake in the group. The announcement by Land Securities that it had secured a lucrative pre-let contract from the Department of Environment launched the shares forward, finishing 11 ahead at 739p.</p>

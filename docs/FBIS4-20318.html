			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Wen (1324 5113): "Propertied Class On the </F> Rise"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]    A booming private economy, a large infusion of foreign  capital, and the marriage between them and the market system  have inevitably led to widening income gaps, hence the emergence  of a host of property owners of substantial means. We call this  segment of the Chinese economy the "propertied class" and  propose to identify its components.    The first component consists of home-grown individual  households. Starting with next to nothing, a large number of  self-employed individuals in China have prospered in recent  years. As the unemployed or people waiting for employment, they  were the objects of pity of the salaried society in the early  1980's, only to become the first batch of beneficiaries of  reform thanks to a historic opportunity. Formerly "speculators"  and "profiteers" who transported goods long distances for sale,  they gradually accumulated enough capital to open a restaurant  or a clothing store, or to go into business retailing textiles  made of chemical fibers. Women who once sold eggs now sit right  next to the counter to keep an eye on video game machines  nearby. After making a fortune doing business in a small way, a  number of individual households became more ambitious as their  wallets expanded and set their sights on television sets,  recorders, electric fans, refrigerators, even computers. In the  city where I live, all five electrical appliance stores that  opened for business in 1992 are run by individual households.  More recently, encouraged by the speeches made by Deng Xiaoping  as he toured the south, individual households began flexing  their economic muscle almost overnight. Individual households  from Wenzhou head north to the Sino-Russian border and south to  where China abuts Myammar and Vietnam to participate in border  trade. Their counterparts from Jiangsu and Zhejiang march into  Sichuan and line the roads there with gas stations, sinking tens  of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of yuan into the  business. The area is so heavily dotted with gas stations that  the eye cannot take them all in. According to the latest survey  by the State Statistics Bureau, about 20 percent of urban and  rural households are high-income households earning over 10,000  yuan a year, including 5.30 million households who make more  than 50,000 yuan annually. Perhaps man is a born economic  animal. These people, previously referred to by political  economists as the "lumpen-proletariat" (in Marx's words), are  reinvesting the enormous wealth they have accumulated instead of  spending it to build houses to live in. That way they steered  clear of the possibility of becoming mere big-time consumers and  instead turned themselves into owners of capital goods. No doubt  the moment an individual householder who used to do everything  himself opens a store, hires help, and is addressed as "boss" by  his employees, he crosses the threshold into the "propertied  class."    The second component consists of township and town  enterprise  shareholders. The township enterprise is a form of enterprise  unique to China. Most of these enterprises are built with funds  raised by peasants and manned by peasants hired to do the job.  Typically a township enterprise has only a few major  shareholders, three to five perhaps. The ownership of a major  stake in the enterprise distinguishes the major shareholders  from the ordinary peasants whose investment can be anywhere from  100 yuan to 1,000 yuan and even more from the larger number of  peasants who are paid for their labor. They hold managerial and  distribution power and own the capital goods. As such they  belong in the "propertied class."    The third component consists of capital owners from  overseas.  After reform went under way and the open policy was introduced,  China in reality is no longer an unadulterated socialist  economy, with all forms of capital from overseas penetrating  into the mainland economy. Whether they are involved in  Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint  ventures, or wholly foreign-funded enterprises, these overseas  investors must be considered card-carrying members of the  capitalist class, something that absolutely nobody would  disagree with. This is so even though some of them are red  capitalists and even though their capital does not take the form  of funds but technology and intellectual property rights. They  hold overseas passports but are part of the propertied class in  the mainland's society and economy.    The fourth component consists of shareholders of state  enterprises other than the state. As state enterprises adopted  the shareholding system and as the state issued shares on a  large scale, reserving only enough to maintain its controlling  shareholder status, more and more state enterprise shares find  their way into the hands of private individuals. Assuming that  the state needs to own just 25 percent of the stock of an  enterprise to be the controlling shareholder, as some economists  estimate, then 75 percent of the shares are in the ownership of  non-state shareholders. This proportion represents a substantial  amount of money. Should the state decide to sell off a number of  small enterprises and declare some mismanaged enterprises  bankrupt and auction them off, then the state will own an even  smaller percentage of the stock. Taking up the slack is foreign  capital, as noted above. In addition, most of the shares will  become the capital of private enterprises and township and town  enterprises and the incomes and, subsequently, the capital of  individual households and the salaried class. The owners of  private enterprises and township and town enterprises,  individual households, and wage-earning employees who own a  substantial number of shares have also joined the ranks of the  propertied class by virtue of their ownership of a large number  of shares. It must be made clear in passing that there is a  point at which a difference in degree becomes a difference in  kind. It would be absurd to lump together with the propertied  class a salaried worker who has purchased 100 or even 1,000 yuan  worth of shares. If, on the other hand, the income he derives  from the shares he owns exceeds his wage, it is clear where he  belongs.    The fifth component consists of idle profiteers. There is  gradually emerging in China a class of jobless idlers who do  nothing decent all day but are kept alive by deposits and bonds  worth more than tens of thousands of yuan, reaping a bonanza of  interest and dividends. Although these assets are not on the  surface direct capital-goods capital, they benefit from the  redistribution of production profits in the form of short-term  loans. Accordingly these assets are no longer ordinary wealth  but financial capital. This class of profiteers who live off  assets should rightly be included in the propertied class.    The sixth component consists of celebrities in the movie,  television, cultural, and sports communities who have parlayed  their fame into capital. As an intangible asset, fame has made  some individuals enormously wealthy. Already there are dozens of  singers who command 10,000 yuan per concert appearance at home.  Every Olympic gold medalist is a millionaire. A leading actor  has now accumulated a fortune exceeding billions of yuan,  rivaling that of some rich women in Hollywood. True to form,  such wealth is promptly converted into capital. Some goes into  advertising to finance the expanded reproduction of fame. Some  is directly invested in industrial and commercial real estate to  earn production profits. Typical of this group are such  celebrities as Li Ning [2621 1337], Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556  1987] and Zhan Rong [3277 1369]. They too are members of the  propertied class.    The seventh component comprises scientific and technical  [S&amp;T] workers who transform knowledge into productive  forces. By  patenting their inventions and innovations and selling them to  the highest bidders, or by entering into cooperative schemes  directly with a production unit to turn their inventions and  innovations into commodities, S&amp;T workers have reaped a  windfall. Because of the government's drive to develop primary  productive forces, the ranks of S&amp;T personnel who  successfully  marry knowledge with commercialization will only continue to  swell. The realization of wealth drives home the actualization  of value and also motivates them to pursue even more wealth. The  most successful among them have been elevated into the  propertied class.    The eighth component is made up of administrative officials  who abuse their office for personal gains. Although discipline  inspection, supervision, and oversight by public opinion have  kept administrative departments as honest as possible, there are  still some administrative officials, particularly leading  cadres, who have amassed considerable properties by abusing  their office. Insiders say that some leaders stand to receive  thousands of yuan, even 10,000 yuan, in cash in bribes, gifts,  and bonuses at year end. After being ensconced in top jobs for  years, some as long as a dozen years, a number of bureaucrats  have stashed away a fortune made up of all sorts of dubious  incomes. They too are members of the propertied class, their  passport to that club being their official positions.    [passage omitted]</p>

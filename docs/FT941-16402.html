			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Russian far right warns the west again Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist whose victory in Russian parliamentary elections has precipitated a rush of applications among Russia's neighbours to join Nato, said yesterday that any expansion of the alliance would lead to World War Three. 'It would be a huge mistake and a tragedy for Nato, Europe and the whole world if they move to take in our neighbours,' he told reporters. 'This would mean Nato took the path of preparing for World War Three against Russia.' His latest statements, the tone of which changes to suit his mood or domestic audience's requirements, followed earlier attempts to woo western opinion by declaring his adherence to democracy, peace, and a desire to meet US President Bill Clinton. 'We will not allow a single foreign division near Russia's borders. Any military unit which receives orders to move towards Russia will be exterminated,' said Mr Zhirinovsky. He also predicted yesterday that the Baltic states, which already have their own fledgling armed forces and are among those states which want to join Nato, would be reabsorbed by Russia of their own free will to deal with their economic problems. Meanwhile, the reformist, pro-western Russia's Choice bloc announced yesterday that its strategy for dealing with a man it describes as a fascist threat to mankind was to try to get him prosecuted for warmongering talk. 'Many of the actions and declarations of (Zhirinovsky's) Liberal Democratic party are clearly covered by articles of the existing criminal code,' said Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice. 'We have drawn this informally to the attention of the general prosecutor's office and will do this formally.' Meanwhile, a senior western diplomat has warned that Nato will get the worst of both worlds with its hurried US-inspired response to new applicants. On the one hand it is promising security guarantees it is not yet in a position to offer these countries, while on the other, he said, making it more difficult for reformers in Russia to hold the line against ultra-nationalists.</p>

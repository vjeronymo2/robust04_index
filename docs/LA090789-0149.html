			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEDGES ADD $600,000 FOR CRISIS CENTER  </P> <P> A children's crisis center slated for construction at Camarillo State Hospital  is expected to receive an important boost from two donors today.  </P> <P> Ronald McDonald's Childrens Charities has pledged $300,000 to help build the  facility, which is to cost $6 million to $10 million. Financier David Murdock,  who built the luxury development of Lake Sherwood in Thousand Oaks, has also  pledged $300,000, Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said this week.  </P> <P> "The generosity . . . has given a meaningful kickoff to a very important  project to the victimized children of Ventura County," said Schaefer, who  represents Thousand Oaks. "I wish there was no need for a facility of this type  but sadly there is."  </P> <P> Schaefer and the donors will announce the grants today at the new Sherwood  Country Club, which Murdock built as part of the Lake Sherwood development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 85 Children  </P> <P> The proposed crisis center, called Casa Pacifica, would house as many as 85  abused, neglected and abandoned children who are now placed in temporary foster  homes or sit in police stations and other institutional settings while the  county tries to find homes for them.  </P> <P> As many as 70 abused or neglected children are placed in temporary foster homes  each month, county officials said.  </P> <P> Last year, the state Legislature approved a bill allowing Ventura County to  build the center on 23 acres at Camarillo State Hospital. The 541-acre hospital  property, which once housed about 7,000 patients, serves less than 1,200  mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors has earmarked $2 million to build Casa  Pacifica. The Youth Connection, a private, nonprofit group that hopes to raise  the balance, will start building the cottage-style facility in phases as money  becomes available. Plans call for the Youth Connection to sublease the center  from the county for a nominal amount and run it.  </P> <P> The Ronald McDonald's Childrens Charities was founded in memory of Ray Kroc,  who started the McDonald's restaurant chain. It awards grants to children's  groups worldwide for health care, medical research, rehabilitation facilities  and special education programs, and will donate $100,000 for each of three  years to build Casa Pacifica.  </P> <P> Murdock, a high-profile developer in Ventura County, agreed to match the  McDonald's grant, Schaefer said.  </P></p>

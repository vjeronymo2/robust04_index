			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gerald L'Ange] </F>   [Text] Tunis -- The South African [SA] Government would  give serious consideration to requests for reparations from  countries that had suffered damage from the actions of previous  governments, President Mandela said in Tunis yesterday.    And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African  heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan  wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday  both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to  meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict.  He said Mandela would meet the two parties.    Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis  yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan  war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President  Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit  in Tunis.    He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total  Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi  to help resolve the Angolan dispute.    On possible reparations by South Africa to African  countries,  he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had  helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not  for reward but from a sense of duty.    Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to  requests for reparations in the light of indications that the  Angolan government might seek such payments.    "We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving  past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a  demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider  that matter seriously".    He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring  country about damage done by the previous government "we cannot  take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we  are not responsible for its crimes.    "But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully.    "We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and  as  people not affiliated to any particular organisation.    "Now that we are free we are not going to give any material  resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than  to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have  a secure future.    "It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped  us."    Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to  attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him  and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times  had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart, as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings, and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (1) or (2) of this section apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient to acquire equipment, buildings, or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

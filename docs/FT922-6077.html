			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Courts and cash tax limits of the power of prayer: Problems of strategy and finance inthe Christian Science church CHRISTIAN Science reading rooms are usually calm, quiet places befitting a religion that emphasises the power of prayer. But beneath the surface, the Boston-based First Church of Christ, Scientist has been riven by a debate over strategy, finances and leadership. At the centre of the US-based religion's problems has been an ambitious attempt - now partly abandoned - to build a miniature media empire. The effort, started in the 1980s, has cost dearly and dented the church's finances. Distressed at this and the manner in which those finances were being handled, some senior figures resigned earlier this year. They included John Hoagland, one of the principal forces behind the media expansion, who stepped down as one of three trustees of the Christian Science Publishing Society. Since then an uneasy lull has descended and the external spotlight on the church's affairs has dimmed. But, with three events scheduled to take place over the next month, it seems unlikely that matters will stay subdued. For a start, lawyers will appear in a probate court today, attempting to assert the church's right to a Dollars 98m (Pounds 55.3m) bequest against competing claims from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Stanford University. Meanwhile, the First Church of Christ, Scientist - known to Christian Scientists as the 'Mother Church' - is preparing a comprehensive report on its finances. This should reach members by the annual meeting on June 8. And there is still the vexed question of what the Christian Science movement does with its 'Monitor Channel', the US cable operation which caused many of its financial difficulties in the first place. A deadline of June 15 has been set for its sale, and if a buyer cannot be found the operation will close. This all represents unwelcome publicity for a movement founded by Mary Baker Eddy, then Mrs Patterson, in 1866. The 45-year-old New Englander, who lived near Lynn in Massachusetts, suffered bad internal injuries after a fall. She attributed her subsequent recovery to the invocation of divine power through prayer, and spent the rest of her life spreading a gospel of Christian healing. The church itself was formed in 1879. However, its early years were marked by organisational upheavals, and what emerged was a structure which differed significantly from that of other organised forms of Christianity. Today, most Christian Scientists have dual membership, both to a local democratically-run 'branch' church, and to the Mother Church, governed by a 'self-perpetuating' board of directors. The religion has long been active in the publishing world - starting with The Christian Science Journal, which Mary Baker Eddy founded in 1883. However, for most of this century its flagship operation has been the Christian Science Monitor, a respected daily newspaper with strong international coverage and a predominantly secular approach. Reputation notwithstanding, the Monitor has been the victim of falling circulation recently. It sells 108,000 copies a day, a third down on a decade ago. It was in the mid-1980s that the Mother Church started to build up a broader range of media operations. It began to produce TV and radio news programmes, acquired a TV station in Boston, and started to transmit shortwave radio broadcasts worldwide. The most ambitious project, however, was the Monitor Channel, a 24-hour news and current events channel. This began to air in early 1991 and, at one stage, employed several hundred people. These wide-ranging media operations required substantial subsidies from the church. Detailed estimates of the losses have varied substantially, but it is generally acknowledged that the aggregate annual deficits ran into tens of millions of dollars. That, in turn, has prompted much internal debate about the expansion strategy. Some Christian Scientists have viewed this as a justified extension of the church's activities. Others have argued that the effort was diverting the religion from its core principles, at worrying cost. In the event, financial outlays and the growing dissension put an end to the ideological debate. The church, having borrowed money from its pension fund to back the Monitor Channel, announced on March 9 that it would shed the operation. Today church officials say that efforts to find a buyer are continuing and note that representatives were out in force at a big trade show recently. However, if a new owner is not secured by June 15 they are emphatic that the channel, already reduced to minimal technical staff, will simply shut down. This complex interplay of finance and ideology has not been confined to the media expansion. Earlier this century a heavy-going book, The Destiny of the Mother Church, was written by a Mr Bliss Knapp. Like his parents, Mr Knapp was a prominent member of the Mother Church, and the book was published privately in 1947. The Mother Church regarded the work as ideologically suspect and declined to treat it as 'authorised' literature. But, under a bequest set out before his death by Mr Knapp and his immediate relatives, the church stood to receive millions if it reversed this policy by 1993. Late last year it did indeed decide to make the book available in print through the Christian Science Publishing Society. It now sells in reading rooms for Dollars 15. Whatever the real motivation for this change of heart, some Christian Scientists have had misgivings, suspecting that the Mother Church was abandoning principles for the sake of money. In fact, the funds have not been forthcoming immediately. The two alternative beneficiaries, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Stanford University, are still seeking to determine whether the Knapp bequest conditions have been met by the Mother Church. And there, in uneasy fashion, matters stand. 'We put a lot of stock in the power of prayer,' comments one church member, trying to explain that the very secular spotlight which has been turned on the church misreads the more spiritual approach of the membership to the church's difficulties.</p>

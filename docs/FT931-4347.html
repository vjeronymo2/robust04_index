			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes hits Pounds 333m - Pre-Christmas boost and strong US performance behind advance BUOYANT pre-Christmas trading in Britain and a strong performance in the US helped Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer, lift pre-tax profits 5.7 per cent to Pounds 332.7m over the 53 weeks to January 2. The result, which compares with Pounds 314.7m last time, was ahead of analysts' forecasts. It was achieved in spite of a deterioration in performance in continental European markets and the Pacific Rim region. Sales rose to Pounds 3.37bn (Pounds 3.23bn). Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said the improved trading in Britain had continued in January and February. He did not expect the effects of recession to be any worse in continental Europe this year and the company had already acted to strengthen its operations there. Changing competitive conditions were offering more opportunities for acquisitions on the continent, which the company was well-placed to exploit. 'We see acquisitions, as opposed to organic growth, as a card we can play,' he said. Mr Cadbury added that the recent acquisition by Philip Morris, the large US tobacco and food group, of Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolates division, was unlikely to have much impact on Cadbury in the UK. In the UK, a strong contribution from beverages lifted trading profit to Pounds 172.6m (Pounds 160.2m), though a Pounds 14m restructuring charge depressed the performance of confectionery. The Cadbury and Trebor Bassett businesses increased market share, while Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages raised volumes. In the Americas, trading profit advanced to Pounds 72.8m from Pounds 42.8m, thanks to an 89 per cent rise in the results from beverage operations. Carbonated drinks and Mott's juice performed well in the US, while Aguas Minerales, the Mexican soft drinks company acquired last year, met expectations. In continental Europe, trading profit fell to Pounds 49m (Pounds 76.2m) on a poorer performance by the soft drinks businesses. The company blamed difficulties in the Spanish market, recession, poor summer weather, higher marketing costs and a decline in sales through hotels, restaurants and cafes. However, trading profit on confectionery rose 18 per cent. In the Pacific Rim, trading profit slipped to Pounds 55.9m from Pounds 64.2m, due to effects of poor weather on beverage sales in Australia. Marketing spending grew 13 per cent to Pounds 388m, though capital expenditure fell 18 per cent to Pounds 191m. Net cash flow from operations improved by Pounds 42m, while debt was reduced to Pounds 462m (Pounds 542m). Earnings slipped to 26.81p (27.51p) but the final dividend is raised 6.5 per cent to 9.9p, bringing the total to 13.2p (12.5p). See Lex</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (5): Worse than its bite - The impact of new tax rules It is too early to measure the impact of the UK's new system of taxing the company car benefit, implemented on April 6, but it is unlikely to be revolutionary. The new system, which replaces the scale charges based on engine size and price thresholds, with a tax based on the list price of the car, was first set out by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in his March 1993 Budget and was aimed at ending distortions in the new car market. Since the measure is meant to be 'revenue neutral', for every employee who finds he faces a higher tax burden, there should in theory be another paying less tax as a result. A revolution is not expected because the high increases in scale charges over the past few years have already forced many company car drivers to rethink the utility of taking the company car. Moreover, the 1991 Budget which ushered in the requirement for employers to pay national insurance contributions on car provision as well as the recession, has prompted many companies to review their attitude towards the cost of providing cars for employees. A recent report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy, found that the proportion of employees earning between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 25,000 and receiving a car dropped from 70 per cent in 1992 to 60 per cent in 1993. The trend was also noticeable, though less marked, among those earning more than Pounds 25,000: 93.4 per cent received a company car in 1993 compared to 94.5 per cent a year earlier. The new taxation system has the virtue of relative simplicity. The employee pays tax at his marginal rate, on 35 per cent of the list price of the car the day before it was registered. This price must include VAT, delivery charges, and accessories of Pounds 100 and over. The status of personalised number plates, which had been in dispute, has recently been clarified by the Inland Revenue which has decided that they do not count as an accessory. The list price is capped at Pounds 80,000 - more expensive cars are taxed as though the price had been Pounds 80,000. Drivers covering 2,500-17,999 business miles are allowed a reduction of a third on their assessment, while those covering more than 18,000 receive a discount of two-thirds. There are also reductions for the age of the car. If the company car is four or more years old at the end of the tax year, there is a further one-third reduction on top of the deductions for business mileage. The rules differ for classic cars or those without a list price. If a car is 15 years old or more at the end of the tax year, or has a market value of Pounds 15,000 or more (which is higher than the manufacturer's list price when the car was first registered), the price for tax purposes will be the open market value of the car and its accessories. Fuel provided for private use is taxed on the basis of the car's engine size and whether it is petrol or diesel-powered. But there is no tax if the employee pays for private motoring fuel himself. So who are the winners and losers under the new system? A survey released earlier this year by WF Corroon, an actuarial and benefits consultancy, found that middle managers driving mostly Fords, Vauxhalls and Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 would lose the most under the new system, with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra tax. In general, the losers are drivers who chose cars at the top of the old bands. Sedgwick Noble Lowndes says that as a result of the new taxation system, it expects to see 'a move to the more basic financially beneficial models, without the tax-hungry extras, as long-overdue renewal dates are reached.' It also believes that the trend 'may be particularly pronounced in companies where a 'trade-down' option is provided and if employee demand for this facility intensifies, then increasingly schemes must become more flexible to include the choice to trade down or up.' The new tax system is also expected to encourage more emp- loyers to provide a cash alternative with a concomitant increase in the take-up of such offers. However, Mr Paul Wigham of Price Waterhouse says: 'In our experience, only a very small proportion of employees have opted for the cash alternative although it is growing in popularity as companies are offering slightly more.' Take-up has been low because unless employers can make savings, they do not want to be more generous than they have to be. Mr Wigham says: 'In general, employers are pitching the cash alternative at about Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,500 less than the car would have cost them.' It can be difficult to judge whether the amount of cash on offer is a good offer or even a fair one. Mr Wigham suggests that: 'As a rule of thumb you should calculate your annual mileage and check what the cost will be (the AA and RAC publish mileage costs guides which take depreciation, insurance and tax into account) and compare that with the after-tax increase in salary being offered.' However, the calculation is complicated by the difficulty of putting a price on the convenience factor of driving a company car. Many employees find the luxury of foregoing the hassle of arranging a replacement car or negotiating with the insurance company after an accident, not to mention the convenience of not having to shoulder the burden of an increased premium due to an accident, an invaluable benefit. In general however, those who are most likely to benefit by taking the cash alternative are employees with business mileage of under 2,500 miles - the pure 'perks' drivers. They will pay proportionately the largest amount of tax, since they will not benefit from the mileage discounts. They are most likely to see savings if they take the cash offer and then buy a cheaper car for their personal use than the one they would have been offered by the company. Alternatively they could combine a smaller salary increase with an interest-free loan from the employer to help with the purchase of a car. If the car being bought is the company's, it would have to be purchased at market value to avoid further tax. The loan benefit would not be taxed so long as the loan is for a maximum of Pounds 5,000 and there are no other outstanding loans from the employer. The new tax system does not herald the demise of the company car, according to Sedgwick Noble Lowndes: 'The wholesale removal of the company car as a benefit is unlikely to become a widespread reality. As long as the car does not become a financially unattractive proposition to the majority of employees, it will still remain a benefit option in most organisations to aid in attracting and retaining senior staff, even though the cost to employers has significantly increased since mid-1992 due to the introduction of national insurance contributions.'</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: The fundamental approach to shares - Serious Money THESE are difficult times for savers. Interest rates have fallen across the board, and many will be looking for an alternative to building societies. Gilts are one option, since many issues offer a higher yield than is available from cash. However, shorter dated issues offer yields of only six to seven per cent; and many medium-dated issues are trading above par, which means that investors are locking themselves in to a capital loss. Investors might also be cautious about buying gilts at a time when the government is being forced to issue so many of them to cover a large, and growing, budget deficit. What about equities? Many savers will have memories of buying at the top of the market in 1987 and will be cautious about repeating the same mistake, particularly as the FT-SE 100 Index reached an all-time high on January 4. So, it is worth a look at the fundamental ratios to see what they tell us. First the good news. Although both the Footsie and the FT-A All-Share have recently reached all-time nominal highs, they have not done so in real (adjusted for inflation) terms. On that basis, the All-Share is still below its levels in 1987 and 1989 and indeed, those achieved in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Secondly, the yield ratio still makes shares look relatively attractive. This measures the relationship of gilt and equity yields - when the ratio is high, gilts are offering considerably greater returns than shares, and this often indicates that share prices are too high. When the ratio is low, shares may be cheap. Experts argue about the usefulness of the ratio, but two recent examples illustrate its merits. According to Datastream, the ratio reached its low of 1.73 (for the period 1976-93) on July 27 last year. Since then, shares have risen by almost 20 per cent. The ratio's high for the same period was 3.46, achieved two weeks before Black Monday's share price crash. At the moment, the ratio is around 2, well below the 1976-93 average of 2.3. If one compares the returns on equities and cash, shares also look relatively attractive. Again one can argue about the significance of this ratio, but if one uses three-month Libor to illustrate cash returns, this ratio reached its peak (for the period 1976-93) at the start of 1990. As theory would expect, 1990 proved a very good year to be in cash and a very bad year to invest in shares. The current ratio is 1.56, well below the 1976-93 average of 2.35. In practice, this means it is now possible for top-rate taxpayers in the right pep to achieve a higher net return than they could achieve at most building societies. BUT now the bad news. The price-earnings ratio measures the relationship of share prices to corporate profits; the higher the ratio, the more expensive (in theory) share prices are. The ratio reached its 1976-93 peak (21 on the FT-A 500 Index) in the summer of 1987. The p/e on the FT-A 500 is now 17.3, well above the 1976-93 average of 11.2. On that basis, share prices are expensive, not cheap. Bulls would argue that the UK is coming out of a recession and that profits will soon rise sharply. The historical p/e is thus irrelevant; it is future earnings that matter. However, the UK was also coming out of a recession in the early 1980s; and historic p/es were much lower then than they are now. The dividend yield on the All-Share has proved quite a good guide to the attractions of shares over the years. On the plus side, it is currently higher than inflation (a rare occurrence over the last 25 years); on the negative side, at 4.4 per cent, it is lower than the historical average of five per cent, which has proved a good benchmark through high inflation eras and low. So, what is the message of all these statistics? One certainly cannot say 'shares are cheap; fill your boots'. But history has taught Britons that it is unwise to ignore shares altogether. So the first choices for those who want to buy equities should be low-cost unit or investment trust savings schemes (to smooth out the highs and lows); or one of the many types of guaranteed products on the market. The latter can be complicated so read the small print. I have had considerable response to my article two weeks ago about Michael O'Higgins's stockpicking theory. Let me stress that this is no 'magic' route to profits (no such thing could ever exist); and that, as one reader correctly pointed out, a portfolio of just five stocks must inherently involve more risk. Just to restate the theory; it involves taking the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the index and, of those, selecting the five with the lowest share prices. The process needs to be repeated once a year, with old stocks discarded. The FT-30 index which I used to provide a British counterpart to the Dow is less frequently updated than it used to be. A reader with a good database might want to test the theory using the FT-SE 100 Index since launch. The current constituents of the FT-30 are: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, BOC, BTR, Blue Circle, Boots, British Airways, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, Marks and Spencer, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, SmithKline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle and Thorn EMI.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Two splinter groups, the  United People's and the New Political Reform Parties, have  recently agreed in principle to merge and are likely to make an  official announcement early next month.    The merger agreement came when the two parties' heads, Rep.  Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party (UPP) and Rep. Pak  Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party (NPRP), got  together on Thursday. But they attached the condition that they  would serve as joint representatives of the new party, informed  sources said Saturday.    The UPP will convene its Executive Council Saturday  afternoon  to ratify the merger and begin discussions with the NPRP on such  matters as the new party's name and reorganization of local  chapters.    In addition, six independent lawmakers are reportedly poised  to join the prospective party -- Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim  Chun-won, Kim Chin-yong, Chong Tae-yong, Chong Chu-il and So  Hun. If they were to join, it would be possible to organize a  new parliamentary negotiating body with the incumbent 12 UPP  lawmakers and Rep. Pak of NPRP being affiliated.    However, it was not known whether another splinter party,  the  new Korea Party, would also join as its head, Rep. Yi  Chong-chan, is keeping mum on the merger.    As the two parties have agreed in principle to merge,  chances  of all opposition parties reaching a "grand union" with the  Democratic Party as its central axis have become remoter,  observers said.    A UPP official revealed, "we agreed in principle on a  party-to-party merger after a series of contacts with the NPRP  for the organization of a parliamentary negotiating group. If  the issue of grand union of the opposition circles arises, we  will think it over at that time."</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPE OKS FREEZE ON GAS EMISSIONS  </P> <P> European nations agreed Monday to freeze emissions of the gases most  responsible for global warming by the year 2000, Swiss Interior Minister Flavio  Cotti said.  </P> <P> But at the parallel Second World Climate Conference here, resistance from the  United States helped water down a statement from nearly 100 countries,  disappointing environmentalists by setting no target dates for controls on gas  emissions.  </P> <P> Cotti said the Europeans' decision came at a meeting of the six-nation European  Free Trade Assn. (EFTA) and the 12-member European Community (EC), shortly  before the conclusion of a worldwide conference on what to do about global  warming, known as the greenhouse effect.  </P> <P> The EFTA-EC decision means the United States and Turkey are the only two  members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not  committed to a freeze or reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.  </P> <P> The draft agreement will be signed Wednesday at the end of the 10-day Second  World Climate Conference.  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Government to forgo profits from National Grid sell-off The government has rejected calls from its backbenchers to take a share of the profits from next year's sale or demerger of the National Grid. The electricity transmission company is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies (recs) of England and Wales, which were given it when they were privatised in 1989. Analysts estimate the company may be worth Pounds 5bn. The government owns a golden share in the National Grid which allows it to demand a share of the profits when it is sold or demerged next spring. Some Tory MPs have urged ministers to use the golden share to extract up to Pounds 2bn for the Treasury. However, in a move that will further boost the electricity companies' profitability, the Treasury has argued it would be an improper use of its golden share, which it says was only intended to prevent foreign ownership of the grid. While ministers are privately angry over the large salaries and share options awarded to electricity company chiefs, they do not believe the government should intervene in the running of a private industry. The government's decision has infuriated some of its own backbenchers as well as provoking criticism from the Labour party. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'I see absolutely no reason why the recs should milk a fortune out of the National Grid that was built by the nation and not by them. 'Shareholders in the recs would receive from the sale of the grid almost as much as it cost them to pay for the whole industry when it was privatised. If the National Grid is sold, the public must get its share.' Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, warned that voters were losing patience with the privatised utilities. 'For the government to hand over the grid lock, stock and barrel to the shareholders of electricity companies is hardly popular capitalism,' he said. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the Commons' trade and industry committee, has asked Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, what protection, if any, was given to taxpayers when the National Grid was handed over to the recs and why they will not be receiving anything from the flotation or demerger.

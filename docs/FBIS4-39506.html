			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>   [Text] According to the Ukrainian Labor Ministry,  Ukrainian employment centers registered 236,800 jobless persons  in the first quarter of 1994. 123,400 of these were registered  back in 1993.    However, hidden unemployment increased at industrial  enterprises, particularly those under the Ministry of  engineering, MIC [Military Industrial Complex] and conversion.    As tentative estimates by the Labor Ministry suggest, about  2,200,000 workers were on unpaid leaves in the first quarter, or  14.2 per cent of the total number of workforce. March's  official unemployment rate was stated at 0.35 per cent.    However, as independent experts' data, which were made  public  at the International Conference on Economics in Kiev in late  May, suggest, Ukraine's hidden unemployment minimal rate is in  excess of 7 million workers. Meanwhile, some 120,000 jobs  remain vacant.    The State's employment bodies and local authorities are  reported as intending to step up implementation of the national  and territorial employment programs, which involve, in  particular, creation of new jobs at enterprises of all  proprietorial forms. However, no one can tell how many of these  or how soon they will be created, except 279,100 jobs reserved  for citizens certified as unable to compete on par with others  on Ukraine's labor market.</p>

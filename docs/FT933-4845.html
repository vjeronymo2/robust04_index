			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: Gilbert and George pay China's price - Art THERE are many ordinary people here, people off the street. The China Art Gallery is always the place where you see whether the political trend is going backwards or forwards, the young Chinese said. We were talking in front of 'City Drop,' one of 55 recent pictures by Gilbert and George on show there until 3 October. He liked 'City Drop' which shows Gilbert and George tumbling from the sky above a panoramic view of London. So did Long Xizu, professor of the Central Institute of Minorities, and a famous establishment critic of photography and art. His interpretation of the picture was fascinating. He thought that 'City Drop' meant that no matter how hard we try, even if we jump up into the sky, it is impossible to escape what we have created. And sometimes, no matter how beautiful those things are, everyone wants to escape. As we were walking round, he told me of the conversations he could overhear. A young man told an older one he thought the pictures 'wonderful.' 'What's so wonderful?' asked the older man. 'There's no beauty there. Everyone is standing up side down.' The Chinese have had long and painful practice in looking for meaning in paintings, or indeed any other works of art, and the meaning of the Gilbert and George show both in itself and as an exhibition with government support  -it was organised through the cultural section of the Chinese Embassy in London in co-operation with the China International Exhibition Agency, a department of the Ministry of Culture in Beijing - has been the talk of the Beijing art world ever since the English artists arrived. The art community, though small, is remarkably active, and spans the avant garde, professors in art schools and representatives of the Ministry of Culture, the body that still determines the fate of official art. The official view seems to be that an exhibition of the works of 'Mr Gilbert and Mr George,' the distinguished and famous western artists, is a fine example of cultural exchange and friendship between our two countries. The unofficial view, expressed by young Chinese who take a pride in aggressive cynicism, is that 'they must have paid a lot of money to the China Art Gallery'. While each of these statements is true, neither is the whole truth, nor does their combination add up to it. Four years after the Tiananmen Square incident and in the final stages of its bid to secure the Olympics, permitting such a major exhibition would have been irresistible to any government in need of a boost to the 'liberal' aspect of its image. The China Daily, the English language paper popped under all hotel guests' doors, even implies as much in its listings entry for the show. As to the money, these days, and indeed throughout the 1980s, the temporary exhibition spaces of the China Art Gallery are available for rent. Some of the young avant garde painters have hired small rooms for shows - not always without incident. The week before the Gilbert and George show opened, an exhibition by a group of young painters was closed after gallery officials demanded that some of the more controversial works be moved to another venue. One exhibitor staged a protest event, cutting his long hair; he was arrested and the show closed down. The Gilbert and George show occupies three rooms on the first floor, the most prestigious. The exhibition was paid for with privately raised funds, including support from the Anthony D'Offay Gallery and the Willis Corroon Group. At the opening, the gallery was packed to bursting with an extraordinary mixture of art world types, both western and Chinese, dressed in everything from vests and cotton trousers to impeccable business suits to the latest clubbing gear who listened to speeches from the British ambassador and the former Chinese vice-minister for culture before getting stuck into the mini-riot that broke out around the catalogue desk. And all fuelled on bottles of pop, drunk through a straw - no alcohol, probably fortunately, was served. And what did the artists think of it all? The opening they found 'very emotional, historic'. Gilbert and George wanted to show in China because 'there are people here, like everybody else. Once we arrived we knew it was the right decision, because we had this feeling of modernity, of hope. We think they will be able to understand our art in a fresh way'. While some of the younger Chinese viewers were disappointed that the pictures had so little 'anger' in them (expressing their rage about past deceits and future uncertainty is a very important theme for Beijing's young painters) all were impressed at the scale of the works, their techniques and vivid colours. The last western artist to show in the gallery was Robert Rauschenberg in 1985, whose work had an enormous effect on the work of local painters, leading directly to the present school of Political Pop now finding favour in the west. Whether there will be a school of Gilbert and George is too early to say. Younger Chinese artists are much more sophisticated now, and firmly committed to finding their own way of expressing their experiences, a view with which Gilbert and George are in perfect sympathy. Standing in their immaculate suits in a tiny shack, both home and studio of a young artist who had just staged a performance in their honour, they told him, 'This is just how we started out. We were the poorest people we knew.' They are far from poor now, and successful internationally in a way few British artists have ever been. That determined individualism and years of hard work can bring the highest rewards is a lesson that the Chinese are more than ready to hear, and one that the presence in their capital of Gilbert and George, their timing as impeccable as their suits, is uniquely able to embody. Gilbert &amp; George China Exhibition, China National Art Gallery, Beijing, 3 September to 3 October, then to The Art Museum, Shanghai, 21 October to 11 November.

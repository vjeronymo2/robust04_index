			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / People: Baxter's family tradition Audrey Baxter has become managing director of Baxters of Speyside, the Scottish company famous for its soups, pates and jams, which her family owns. At 31 she is following two family traditions. First, keeping the management in the family. She takes over the post of managing director from 74-year-old Gordon Baxter, who remains chairman and was responsible for the company's expansion since the second world war. Her brother Andrew is vice-chairman and her brother Michael is general manager of food services. (There have been non-Baxter mds too; Alasdair MacCallum, chairman of the CBI in Scotland, stayed for a year in 1986.) Second, maintaining what she calls 'a strong leaning in the company towards women'. Her great grandmother Margaret made the first jams for the company, founded in Fochabers, Morayshire, in 1868. Audrey's grandmother Ethel invented Baxter's royal game soup and her mother Ena is now creates the recipes. Audrey Baxter, who is married, worked in the business on vacations while studying economics, accountancy and finance at university. She then worked for Kleinwort Benson in merchant banking and equities before joining the company in 1987. She became commercial director in 1990. Although Baxter's turnover rose 26 per cent to Pounds 35m last year, she is proud of the fact that the company takes 'a conservative approach to growth,' is zero geared and has turned down 168 offers for it to be taken over. 'The conservative approach is working well and will continue in the short term,' she says. 'But I suspect that we will become more adventurous if an opportunity that fits our ethics and strategy comes along.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Foreign Affairs Committee </F> Complains of Information Shortage"]    [Excerpts] "Work in our committee could be much more  flexible, and we could achieve better results if we received  more information from persons who construct foreign policy at  the President's Office and the Foreign Ministry," stated Foreign  Affairs Committee Chairman K. Bobelis at yesterday's press  conference in the Seimas [parliament], speaking about the work  of its Foreign Affairs Committee. He regretted the failure to  execute the Seimas resolution, adopted back in December,  authorizing the Foreign Ministry to prepare a foreign policy  concept and cooperate with the Foreign Affairs Committee in the  closest possible manner. There is also a lack of cooperation  with the president's "foreign policy design" office which  provides no information at all. K. Bobelis said that "members  of the committee do not approve of the isolationist policy  conducted by J. Paleckis [presidential foreign policy adviser].  The information deficit evokes unnecessary differences of  opinion in the committee.    K. Bobelis said that the committee was currently considering  a number of international agreements that would be submitted to  the Seimas for ratification. The free trade agreement with the  European Union that is being prepared by four ministries is of  particular importance. The Foreign Affairs Committee has not  yet seen the draft of this document.    According to K. Bobelis, the committee approves of President  A. Brazauskas' initiative to set up a Baltic Council of  Ministers for cooperation between the Baltics and the  Scandinavian countries according to the formula 3 + 5. At the  same time, the speaker expressed his regret that even though  both the Swedes and the Danes with whom he has talked welcome  this idea, they believe that Lithuania is still to immature to  undertake such an endeavor. "Everyone looks at us as an inferior  and underdeveloped state. I do not know why," admitted K.  Bobelis.    The committee chairman reported that Lithuania would shortly  open its embassies in China, Japan, and Egypt, and later in  Canada. Discussions are continuing on whether an embassy or a  consulate should be opened in Turkey. The committee believes  that consulates in Kaliningrad and Seinai [Polish border town]  must be set up immediately.    Asked whether he had a chance to read the Lithuanian-Polish  treaty, K. Bobelis replied that he saw the latest version before  taking it to Warsaw. "This document is beneficial for Lithuania  and it does not inflict any harm." However, the committee  chairman does not approve of the Foreign Ministry's position not  to show the treaty. [passage omitted]    Summing up the work of Lithuanian politicians at  international organizations, K. Bobelis said that they should  participate both in the EC and UN structures more actively.  Moreover, it is necessary to preserve the continuity of  political activities, in other words, to create possibilities  for members of the delegations to work a longer period of time  rather than just one year. In K. Bobelis' opinion, as long as  the current situation continues, casual participations in  international events will be nothing but trips and a waste of  money.</p>

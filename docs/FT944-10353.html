			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Jewish writer hears old echoes in the new Germany's Reichstag As befits his age, Mr Stefan Heym walked slowly up to the podium of the Reichstag in Berlin yesterday. Aged 81, the doyen of east German writers had been given the privilege of delivering the opening speech of the new German parliamentary session, as the oldest of the 672 deputies elected to the Bundestag last month. The walk to begin his address was heavy with the symbolism and bitterness of Germany's division and subsequent reunification. Mr Heym fled Nazi Germany as a Jewish refugee, fought on the side of the Americans against his country during the second world war, and returned to east Germany in 1952, disillusioned with the McCarthy witch-hunts. The communist regime tolerated him as its most truculent writer, but refused to publish his increasingly critical novels. But Mr Heym is an independent MP backed by the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism, and thus an enemy of the conservative government. Not surprisingly, hours before he was due to speak, files made public showed that Mr Heym had contacts with East Germany's security police, the Stasi. But the records, apparently released at Mr Heym's request after accusations, did not prove whether the author knew he was talking to the Stasi when he offered unspecified information about an east German trade unionist who had fled to west Berlin but was subsequently kidnapped by the Stasi in the 1950s. Mr Heym said he had never knowingly given the Stasi information. It was a grim Reichstag that waited for him to begin speaking. He asked for greater understanding and unity between east and west Germans but dwelt, embarrassingly, on the past. 'The people of east Germany freed themselves. But there were people who had weapons to defend the old, unloved system. They did not use these weapons,' he said. 'We should take this into account when we judge them,' making an implicit plea for a partial amnesty for those accused of collaborating with the Stasi. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, and the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister party, refused to applaud. 'It was a hard decision not to applaud him,' said Mr Rolf Kiefer, CDU spokesman. 'Heym went on about the crisis instead of looking at the good things of unification. He never talked about the oppression of the old dictatorship.' But Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the maverick member of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, said 'the speech was more moderate than I had expected. I applauded.' The only ones who applauded en masse were the PDS, and the opposition Social Democrats, who, in 1990, had opposed German unification.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, puppet  prime minister of South Korea, cried for a strict "security  measure" against the struggle of students, branding it as  "illegal violence", according to a radio report from Seoul.    This is a repressive order to strangulate the struggle of  students by frantically wielding the fascist club.    The struggle of the South Korean people and students for  independence, democracy and reunification, an inevitable result  caused by the colonial fascist rule, cannot be "illegal  violence" in any case but it is a just struggle worthy to be  praised.    Yi Yong-tok's cry for ruthless crackdown on this struggle is  an unpardonable criminal act becoming only to the fascist  murderer.    It is all the more ludicrous that Yi blared "violent  demonstration is unjustifiable after the establishment of the  civilian `government'." It is a complete distortion of the  reality.    The fascist repressive order of the puppet clique proceeds  from a desperate attempt to bolster up at any cost the "civilian  government" driven into an extreme crisis by the vigorous  struggle of the South Korean people against the Kim Yong-sam  group.</p>

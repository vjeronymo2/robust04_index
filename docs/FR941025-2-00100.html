This notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on September 23, 1994 (59 FR 48914). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Counsel for the workers claim that the worker group eligibility test is met for the Washington workers because the workers had a reduced demand for their warehousing services from Philips's Fairmont plant which was certified for TAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workers providing a service are certifiable only in very limited circumstances which were explained in the Department's initial negative determination. The certification circumstances are that the worker separations must be caused by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling firm whose workers produce an article and who are currently under a certification for TAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Findings on reconsideration show that Washington is not a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> source distribution center  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that warehouses finished products from a certain plant but is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> field service distribution center  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (emphasis supplied) which warehouses inventory based on forecasted customer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Fairmont certification (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,343) which was based on company imports would not have adversely affected workers at the Washington facility since the products warehoused at Washington were based on forecasted customer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reconsideration findings also show that only a very small amount of Washington's inventory originated from Fairmont. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other findings show that the product previously warehoused in Washington is being stocked at Mountaintop, Pennsylvania; Roselle, Illinois and Atlanta, Georgia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for transitional adjustment assistance to workers and former workers of Philips Lighting Company, Philips, Electronics North American in Washington, Pennsylvania. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, D.C, this 17th day of October, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Victor J.

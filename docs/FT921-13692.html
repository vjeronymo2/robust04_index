			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Lords threat to council tax timing THE GOVERNMENT'S aim of enacting the Council Tax Bill by the end of next month could be at risk unless ministers make concessions to strong cross-party alliances among peers who tomorrow start detailed discussion of the bill. Ensuring the legislation is completed within the next six weeks or so is critical in terms of election timing, especially with renewed emphasis on the possibility of an April poll. The Tories insist that the poll tax will be abolished from April next year, and failing to secure the bill to introduce its replacement would seriously undermine this commitment. Tory backbench peers have already proposed changes to the bill to improve the position of tenants in tied cottages. Changes to get a better deal for the disabled have attracted support from both sides of the Lords. Tory and Labour peers have also privately been voicing concern about the speed with which the bill was dealt with in the Commons. There are signs that peers will want to compensate for the lack of committee discussion among MPs on the interaction of social security benefits with the council tax discount system. There are also peers linked with interested pressure groups and charities who are concerned their organisations did not have enough time to study the proposals and put forward changes in the time the bill could have been amended by the Commons. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'It is vital that the House of Lords is able to provide detailed scrutiny of this legislation because of the government's draconian tactics in the Commons. 'The government's business managers will be desperate to bulldoze this through. In the interests of parliamentary democracy and local taxpayers, the Lords should ensure a full discussion of all these important issues.'</p>

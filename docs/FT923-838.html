			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Swiss Re turns in strong advance SWISS Reinsurance yesterday reported a strong increase in profits for 1991 and announced plans for a SFr300m (Dollars 229m) rights issue and a simplification of share structure. The company, number two in the world reinsurance ratings after Munich Re, said net profits rose by 23 per cent to SFr266m in 1991 and that as a result it would be stepping up its dividend from SFr45 a share to SFr48. Swiss Re had forecast improved results for 1991 following weak earnings in the previous year when its performance had been depressed by a strong Swiss franc and a slump in world stock markets. Unveiling plans for a one-for-10 rights issue, the company said it would accompany the share financing with a simplification of its share structure and an opening of its share register. It gave no additional details. Terms for the rights issue are to be announced on November 20. Prices of around SFr1,500 per registered and bearer share, and SFr300 per participation certificate, are expected. The issue would raise around SFr320m, Swiss Re said. Last year, gross premiums rose by 17.3 per cent to 17.45bn. In non-life insurance, the underwriting loss rose to SFr781m from SFr717m, due to the generally poor climate in business overall. Swiss Re said the growing number of damage claims plus a catastrophe in Japan also hit the result.</p>

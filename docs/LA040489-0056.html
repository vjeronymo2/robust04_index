			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E TO TRY TO PREVENT RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will try to keep O. Morris Sievert, a San Diego  businessman who in December resigned from SDG&amp;E's board of directors, from  discussing the utility's proposed merger with Southern California Edison during  a Wednesday deposition requested by the city of San Diego, according to  documents filed with state regulators.  </P> <P> According to those documents, SDG&amp;E wants to prevent Sievert, who resigned  to protest the proposed utility merger, from making public a long list of  documents that SDG&amp;E's board generated while considering the proposed  merger with Edison. The utility's New York-based law firm last month asked the  state Public Utilities Commission to prohibit Sievert from making the documents  public during Wednesday's deposition.  </P> <P> Sievert last week told the PUC that he has "no personal objection" to making  public dozens of documents that he collected during the past year because full  disclosure of the documents would lead to "a full public hearing on the  proposed merger."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sievert Argument  </P> <P> Public concern in San Diego County over the proposed merger "appears to  outweigh any interest in maintaining the 'confidential' or 'privileged' status  of the documents in question," according to Sievert's filing.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E spokesman Tom Murnane declined Monday to comment on SDG&amp;E's  request for a protective order, saying, "We will not comment on that until the  day of the deposition. During the deposition, we will discuss our objections in  detail."  </P> <P> "SDG&amp;E is doing a fine job of trying to keep the city and the public from  learning anything about this merger," San Diego City Atty. John Witt said  Monday. "We're taking the position that this stuff should be handled publicly .  . . and we're going to get this stuff."  </P> <P> The documents filed last week by Sievert's attorney include an extensive list  of records generated by meetings that SDG&amp;E's board held to consider  Edison's proposed stock-swap merger. The list also includes records that detail  the SDG&amp;E board meetings held to discuss an ill-fated attempt to complete a  merger with Tucson Electric Power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Management Documents  </P> <P> Sievert also hopes to introduce personal documents that SDG&amp;E Chairman  Thomas Page and other SDG&amp;E executives and directors have maintained since  Edison proposed the merger.  </P> <P> The large number of documents that Sievert plans to introduce "is very  telling," according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers  Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "It showed that there are  huge numbers of documents that have not been seen by the interested parties. It  also proves that (the board's) discussion about this merger was contentious and  long-ranging."  </P> <P> The city has subpoenaed Sievert to learn if Edison and SCEcorp, Edison's parent  company, coerced or threatened SDG&amp;E's board members in order to gain  support for the proposed merger. SDG&amp;E's board voted to accept the merger  offer in November, 1988. Shareholders of the two utilities will vote on the  merger later this month.  </P> <P> Similar issues are expected to surface Monday, when the city attempts to gather  testimony from businessman Charles (Red) Scott, who also resigned from the  SDG&amp;E board in protest of the merger.  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Rights-thinking strategies - New applications / Laurie Morse examines novel ideas for contracts Ronald Coase, the Nobel prize-winning economist, once explained that if it were well understood that trading involved the exchange of rights to certain things, rather than the exchange of the underlying things themselves, our universe of tradeable commodities and securities would be far larger than it is. The people who structure derivatives strategies understand this uncoupling very well. Every day they engineer contracts where the rights to certain returns and their associated risks are disassembled and repackaged to suit their customers' needs. Once viewed as exotic, derivative instruments used to manage all sorts of market risks - interest rate, currency, commodity, or equity - have achieved widespread acceptance in the financial world. Their primary route of expansion now is through application in new industries where the concept of risk management remains a novel idea. However, other uses for derivatives are evolving, and these new applications take the craft far beyond managing just market risk. One of these, the evolution of products used to manage credit risk, has had a troubled start, though its supporters say it could become a Dollars 1,000bn industry. Another class of new derivatives focuses on using market forces to allocate scarce resources. These include secondary markets for trading pollution allowances that have been issued as part of the US clean air act. Introduced two years ago as a radical new way to ration pollution while allowing polluters some flexibility when facing regulatory constraints, these products also have not lived up to their early promise. US futures exchanges in some cases are taking the lead in innovation, trying to expand the risk management capacity of industries as diverse as catastrophe insurance and electricity generation. Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust, and Credit Suisse First Boston took the lead in the experiment with credit derivatives. In a logical extension of their success with interest rate and currency swaps, these bankers and brokers saw their customers had a secondary need: a means to manage the credit uncertainties in their portfolio. Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers, and the bread-and-butter of credit rating agencies. Transferring, or trading, credit risk has been nearly impossible without liquidating the cash instrument in question. However, derivative experts say it is possible to keep a high-yielding, high-risk security in portfolio, and manage the credit risk while still enjoying an above-market return. Brokers are now willing to write an option on the difference, or 'spread' on the yield between the high-risk securities and more secure investment like a Treasury security. The options insulate the customer if the credit risk of his securities increases, while the broker who wrote the specialised option neutralises his exposure by performing an offsetting trade from a global selection of corporate credit deals. These highly-structured instruments are efficient only if the broker has access to a global corporate debt network. To date, credit derivatives' volumes have disappointed their backers, who say lack of liquidity and efficient pricing are limiting the market. Making new commodities out of pollution credits, electricity, and even trash have proved equally frustrating. The US Environmental Protection Agency, in writing the Clean Air Act of 1990, surmised that reducing nationwide sulphur dioxide emissions, a key ingredient in acid rain, might be made cheaper and more efficient if polluters had a set of options to choose from. The agency assigned each main sulphur dioxide polluter (mostly coal-burning electricity plants) certificates representing allowable levels of emissions. If the power generating company chooses to abate its sulphur dioxide output by switching to cleaner fuels or installing a costly smokestack scrubber, it is free to sell its excess allowances to another polluter. Over time the allowances expire, with US sulphur dioxide emissions due to fall to half of their present levels by 2,000. Trading experts such as New York-based Cantor, Fitzgerald and the Chicago Board of Trade tumbled over each other to capture this new market-in-the making two years ago. However, time and experience have proven that utilities, quasi-public entities which rarely have to deal with market forces of any kind, do not make carefree traders. Although the Chicago Board of Trade has conducted two annual pollution allowance auctions, and Cantor and other dealers have brokered private allowance trades, the majority of utilities have banked their allowances and pursued more costly abatement solutions. Mike Walsh, senior economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, notes that the emission allowance program, to be a success, does not require active trading. 'In fact, it's working very well - companies are switching fuel, retiring dirty units, and many companies are trading allowances within their own operations, transfers that don't show up publicly,' he says. However, the limited trading has dashed hopes for a derivative market in pollution credits. Mr. Walsh said the Chicago Board of Trade has shelved its plans to trade pollution allowance futures until a viable primary market develops. In fact, the rapid deregulation of the electric power industry in the US may rekindle interest in allowance trading. However, Mr Walsh and others believe that electric utilities will first learn to use futures and options to price and hedge their electricity output as their markets become freer. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's leading energy futures market, has plans to introduce electricity futures within the next year.</p>

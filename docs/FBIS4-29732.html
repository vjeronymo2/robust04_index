			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Natthaya Chetchotirot: "Facing Ally Crisis, </F> Democrats May Have No Way Out But Opt for House Dissolution]    [Text] House Speaker Wan Muhamat Nomatha of the New  Aspiration Party [NAP] pressed the button to signal the  adjournment of the parliamentary meeting Thursday afternoon,  several Phalang Tham Party (PTP) members knew it was the last  straw that they would put up with the Democrats. The  adjournment of the meeting, which was seen as a tactic employed  by the Democrats in collaboration with the NAP, effectively  blocked the attempt by 21 PTP rebel MPs to move forward their  motion for constitutional reform which they had hoped to be  debated in the House on Thursday. Had the motion been passed  which the PTP expected so with the backing of the Opposition and  the Solidarity, another coalition party, Chalat Worachat would  have ended his fast and the protest would be over.    The fact that the PTP rebels were outwitted by the Democrats  could be attributable to their political apprenticeship compared  to the Democrats' mastery in political intrigue and treachery.  Several members of the temple faction in the PTP have also  blamed some senior party members of working "hands in gloves"  with the Democrats to block the rebels' charter motion.    The setback sustained by the PTP rebels and the temple  faction including de facto leader Chamlong Simuang, came one day  after the party managed to enlist unanimous support from the  executive committee for the rebels' motion for constitutional  reform. This was something unusual because the party itself was  earlier widely split over the motion issue. Yet, they did not  discuss about moving forward the charter motion and would ask  for the motion to be moved forward at the parliamentary floor.  The rebels had hoped that this would be discussed on Thursday.    But the golden opportunity was missed out. Government whips  moved quickly by holding a meeting Thursday morning which ended  with a resolution for the PTP not to move forward the motion of  the rebels. Bound by the resolution, the rebels did not ask to  move forward their motion, hoping that this would be done by the  Opposition or the Solidarity Party. Eventually, they realised  that neither the two sides would request the motion to be moved  forward, the PTP rebels tried to initiate the move themselves  and to enlist their support. By the time they regrouped, it was  already too late. The House was adjourned before the move  materialised.    For the time being, there was nothing that the PTP rebels  and  the temple faction could do until next Thursday when the House  reconvenes to consider motions. Badly outmanoeuvred and  outwitted, the only trump card that Chamlong has in his hand and  that he could play is to pull out of the coalition government.  A meeting of the executive committee was tentatively scheduled  this Monday during which an important decision would be made.  And the likelihood is that the party, with the urging of  Chamlong, will opt to withdraw.    The stage has already been set to put pressure on the PTP to  call it quit. Sudarat Keyuraphan yesterday resigned as deputy  government spokeswoman. Ruangwit Dusadisuraphot and Thamrong  Saengsuriyachan also quit as deputy secretary-general of the  prime minister and government whip respectively, citing their  conflicting views with those of the government.    Without any doubt, this whole political episode has driven a  deep wedge within the PTP as never before. The chasm of  division will be further widened if the party decides to pull  out. The temple faction will certainly demand pulling out and  this is most likely to be resisted by the ministers and the  so-called layman faction. Some observers believe that Chamlong  may have to come back to take the rein of the party and to  assert his authority to put his own house in order. The task is  easier said than done because it may involve some sacrifices.  But there seems to be little choice if the PTP wants to restore  its bruised image and also if it intends to stay on in the  political arena.    If the pullout of the PTP is intended to force the hand of  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve the Parliament and call  a new general election, then this is likely to be strongly  resisted by Mr Chuan who has, on various occasions, announced  that he would not dissolve the Parliament. This will be the  last option if other alternatives do not work out.    Behind-the-scenes political manoeuvrings have reportedly  started when news leaked about the PTP threat to withdraw.  Informed political sources said the Democrats through their new  deal-maker, Agriculture Minister and deputy secretary-general  Niphon Phromphan, would approach the opposition Chat Thai or the  Chat Phatthana parties to replace the PTP should the PTP  actually calls it quit.    Both Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana earlier announced openly  that they would not simply replace the PTP. Instead, they want  a major Cabinet reshuffle with the prime minister resigning in  order that a new Cabinet can be formed. This may sound to be  too much for the Democrats because of their mistrust towards the  two opposition parties.    Provided that there is no change of position from either the  Chat Thai or the Chat Phatthana Party and if the Democrats is  unreluctant to part with the New Aspiration, the Democrats may  not be able to find a new partner to replace the PTP and have no  choice but to dissolve the Parliament.    But anything is possible in Thai politics. An ally today may  become an enemy the next day. And today's foe may turn out to  be an ally the following day.    After all, it was the Democrats themselves who have pushed  themselves into the corner. Had they been less stubborn and  more flexible and had they allowed the PTP rebels' motion to be  debated in the Parliament, they would not have plunged  themselves into yet another crisis.</p>

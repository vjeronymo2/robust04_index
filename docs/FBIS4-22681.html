			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ostrosvetov: "The Russian Order of </F> Alexander Barkashov"; the first paragraph is introductory  paragraph; quotation marks as published]    [Text] The Russian National Unity (RNU) movement will hold  its constituent congress in April, at which the founding of a  new political party will most likely be announced. The movement  makes no secret of its intention to come to power in Russia, to  restore the "single and indivisible Russia in the borders of the  Russian empire," and then consider expanding it. One of the RNU  declarations is devoted to the "work for training disciplined  groups who support a strong, indivisible and powerful Russia for  active political and, subsequently, state activity."  <H5>  Leader </H5>   Alexander Barkashov, the leader of the RNU, was born in  1953.  According to information, his grandfather participated in the  repressions of 1940-50, and held responsible posts in the  apparat of the VKP(b)-CPSU Central Committee. Barkashov has no  higher education; his main profession is electrician. He is also  coach-instructor in karate (he owns a brown girdle). He served  in the special units of the army. In 1987-90 Barkashov was a  member of the Central Council of the Pamyat society headed by  Dmitry Vasilyev. At that time they had a falling out.  Withdrawing from Pamyat, Barkashov set up his own organization  in the autumn of 1990 -- "Russian National Unity for a strong,  free and just Russia." Since 1991 it has been called Russian  National Unity.  <H5>  Organization </H5>   There is some structure underlying the RNU (although it is  changing). It is as follows: Leader-Main  Companions-Companions-associates-sympathizers. The leader is  Barkashov. The companions consist of militants, members of a  militarized organization within the RNU. Now they number about  600, much more than during the October events. According to  press reports, 137 Barkashov militants fought near the White  House. It is known for certain that two of them died -- Dmitry  Marchenko and Anatoly Sursky, both officers in the reserve. It  is common knowledge that RNU militants protected the coup  leaders -- Barannikov, Dunayev, Achalov, Makashov. Most of the  RNU members, led by Barkashov, left the White House in advance.    In order to become RNU Companions, one needs absolutely  unstained "racially pure Slav" ancestry (spanning at least four  generations). Any mixture of Jewish, Gypsy, Caucasian or Central  Asian blood is categorically ruled out. In order to join the  ranks of the Companions, a candidate must take an oath. This  happens after the trial period of one year, but "it may be  reduced in special cases." After becoming a RNU militant, a  person loses his individual identity. Although he is not  permanently living in the barracks, he is still obliged to  present himself when his superiors call. No considerations of  personal or family character are taken into account. The  militants train in shooting and in hand-to-hand combat at the  bases where they spend from several days to a month. The  location of the bases is kept secret, but according to some,  they are in the Moscow Region -- one not far from Balashikha,  the other -- near the Perlovka railway station.    The militants are divided into sub-units under the command  of  the Main Companions. A sub-unit consists of 20 people or more.  The main Companions are included in the so-called RNU Commanders  Council.    Apart from Companions, the organization also has Associates.  They do not swear an oath and do not fight in combat formations.  There are several thousand more Associates than Companions. In  order to become an Associate a trial period is also necessary:  for a certain period of time a person will serve as a  Sympathizer, carrying out the assignments of the organization  and recruiting new supporters. Among the RNU Sympathizers there  are "high-ranking" generals, officials from the highest  structures of the Interior Ministry and so on.  <H5>  `The oath of Companion-in-arms' and `Code of Honor' </H5>   The oath which the Companions take has 10 points, among them  the commitment "to be ruthless to the external and internal  enemies of Russia and the Russian nation," "to be always ready,  by order of the Chief Companion, to defend the interests of  Russia and the Russian nation and fight to the last breath  against the external and internal enemies of Russia and the  Russian nation within Russia and beyond its borders." Moreover,  for breaking the oath "Companions must treat its violators as  the Code of Honor of the Companion" prescribes: with capital  punishment. The Code of Honor declares that the Companion is  regarded as "the plenipotentiary of the Russian nation," and  therefore it is his duty to restore justice for the Russian  people" "with the power entrusted to him and with his arms, not  appealing to judicial or other means." For members of the  organization, no laws exist except their own: "The Companion  resolves any questions, guided only by national consciousness,  in keeping with the powers entrusted to him by the Chief  Companion, and obeys no other laws." A very important point: "A  Companion must always remember that Russia has no friends," and  further: "the Companion may cleanse himself of the disgrace only  with blood."  <H5>  Members of the RNU </H5>   There are quite a number of military people in the RNU:  regular officers, servicemen in the reserve, those in active  service. There are militiamen and those serving in the interior  forces. There are also quite a few workers, students and several  clergymen.  <H5>  Program </H5>   The Russian nation must become dominant in Russia. As for  other peoples, a "differentiated" approach to them is advocated.  They are divided into "natives" and "non-natives." The plans  regarding "non-native" peoples are not published, they are  worked out in secret documents of the organization. It is known  that Caucasians, Turks, Central Asians will have the right to  live only on their "historic territories," "a sharp reduction of  birth rate" is expected in their countries," "a reduction of  their number to minimum." As for Jews and Gypsies, "they will be  fully eradicated as soon as possible." Barkashovites maintain  that "Jews should not be deported either to the West or to  Israel, because this will only strengthen the positions of world  Zionism and its subversive work against Russia." It is suggested  that the laws of Hitler's Germany be introduced in Russia. In  other words, mixed marriage or liaisons "causing harm to the  genetic fund of the Russian nation and leading to its dilution  will be persecuted by law."    Russia, being a unitary state, must "as far as its  administrative structure is concerned, follow the historical  tradition, be divided into provinces and these provinces, in  their turn, into districts and then into volosts" (small rural  districts). The "existence of no autonomous territorial  formations, splitting up the Russian people and weakening  Russia" should be allowed on the territory of Russia.    Power must be concentrated in the hands of the "Russian  national leader." Democracy is declared "a naive idea which has  never been carried out anywhere (since power may realistically  be put only in the hands of elite). It was invented by Zionists  and Masons for demoralization of the nation and the seizure of  world supremacy."  <H5>  Propaganda </H5>   The main publication of the RNU, the paper Russky  Poryadok, has been published for about 18 months. After the  October events the circulation of the newspaper rose -- the last  issue claimed a distribution of 150,000 copies. At 100 rubles  per copy it is not expensive. Its Editor-in-Chief is Kochetkov,  Deputy Editor-in-Chief is Kremlev; members of the Editorial  Board: Kokorev and Skirdenko; Marchenko, too, who was killed  during the October events, was a member of the Editorial Board.  The Editorial Board of Russky Poryadok are members of  the Council of the RNU Commanders.    The movement made an attempt to publish one more newspaper  --  Russian Banner but the plan failed, only one issue  was published. In Krasnoyarsk, the RNU publishes the paper  Russian Nation (circulation about 15,000 copies), its  Editor-in-Chief is Yemelyanenko. The paper is registered, just  as the Russian Order (the registration number is  1184). Recently magazine The Attack was established.  Apart from these regular publications, the RNU mimieographs and  distributes leaflets and appeals. In the newspapers and leaflets  of the RNU, reports often appear which do not correspond to  reality. Instead of facts, there is only a confident tone. Thus,  the paper Russky Poryadok (December 1993-January  1994) maintained that the White House was fired at by the  snipers of the 6th NATO Brigade and so on.    The RNU carries on its propaganda purposefully. After  selecting a military unit, an enterprises or an educational  establishment, it begins a "permanent contact," distributes  literature there and sends agitators.  <H5>  Relations with other parties and movements </H5>   The members of the RNU participate in the meetings and  demonstrations of related parties and movements. However, the  relations between them and the RNU are strained and often  hostile. Barkashovites are particularly hostile to Zhirinovsky  and the LDPR. They regard Vladimir Volfovich as "the agent of  Zionism, who has made his way into the ranks of the  national-patriotic movement with the aim of destroying it."  <H5>  Relations with the Church </H5>   In theory the RNU is a supporter of Orthodoxy, but "it  respects and restores Orthodoxy as well as pre-Orthodox Russian  national traditions," using various "symbols of national  self-consciousness" (octagonal star, crosses, swastika and  rotating cross), and the use of "masonic, anti-Russian symbols."  The RNU does not lay stress on questions of religion and the  church. The main thing for a person is to be a fanatic  nationalist, an advocate of "racial purity," since he will be  ready for Orthodoxy any way. The Barkashovites regard the  present leaders of the Russian Orthodox church "mostly as  Zionist-masonic" and insist on their being removed from the  posts they hold. "The time has come to decide whom you side  with. And if you do not decide, we shall decide for you and give  everyone his due." This is the appeal of the newspaper  Russky Poryadok to the leadership of the Russian  Orthodox Church.  <H5>  Sources of financing </H5>   The members of the organization pay no dues. Despite this,  the movement does not have financial problems. According to  information at the disposal of MN, the movement and  some of its members have shares in commercial structures. Many  of the RNU members are employed as guards at trade and  commercial institutions. Barkashovites "maintain order" when  functions of national-patriotic orientation are held and, of  course, their services are not free of charge.</p>

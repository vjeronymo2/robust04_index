			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New International Trade  and Industry (MITI) Minister Eijiro Hata served an event-filled  term as agriculture, fishery and forests minister in the  previous administration of Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa.    Hata, 65, who broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) last June, is one of the founding members of Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party). He succeeded Hiroshi Kumagai of  Shinseito, who was appointed to chief cabinet secretary.    During his previous trial-by-fire term, he was confronted  with such knotty problems as a severe cold spell that damaged  the country's rice crop and paved the way for the government's  decision to partially open the country's rice market. He was  also at the helm of the ministry when Japan joined the United  States and the European Union in concluding a long-in-coming  Uruguay Round agreement covering agriculture.    One time during his term, amid coalition party wrangling,  Hata is said to have resolved to resign and to have packed up  his belongings for departure from his ministry office.    When an LDP censure motion was presented in the House of  Councillors, Hata demonstrated great composure. The motion was  rejected.    Hata subsequently threw himself into the promotion of  emergency measures to improve the agricultural situation. He is  highly-regarded within the ministry for his forward-looking  attitude and tactfulness.    As the head of MITI, he is expected to steer Japan's trade  policy, which faces difficult problems such as trade relations  with the United States.    Elected to the House of Representatives six times from Oita  Prefecture on Kyushu Island, where he was mayor of a small town,  Hata is particularly known for his work in the field of posts  and telecommunications. He was instrumental in the  privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in  1985.</p>

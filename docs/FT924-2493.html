			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Greece blocks Macedonia deal EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday failed to agree on the recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, after Greece had refused to accept such a move as long as the country used the name Macedonia. Following what the Greek foreign minister, Mr Mihalis Papaconstantinou, described as 'very long and very cruel' discussions, the ministers decided to refer the problem to their heads of government, meeting in Edinburgh for a two-day European summit which is due to end tonight. Greece has long argued that, if the former Yugoslav republic wins international recognition under the name Macedonia, it is likely to provoke territorial claims by militant nationalists in that ethnically diverse country on the northern Greek province of the same name. Compromise proposals by a special EC presidency envoy, Mr Robin O'Neill, a former British ambassador to Belgium, which would incorporate the name Macedonia in a distinctive designation such as the Macedonian republic of Skopje (its capital) or the Republic of Northern Macedonia have also been rejected by the Greeks. In a letter to Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current EC president, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek premier, reminded Community leaders that, in their Lisbon declaration of June this year, they had specifically undertaken to recognise the former Yugoslav republic only under a name which did not include the term Macedonia. On the basis of that declaration, Mr Mitsotakis added, the Greek government had undertaken 'a series of positive initiatives' towards Skopje, 'in order to help lessen tensions and build confidence between us'. These included not only offers of economic assistance but a clear guarantee of its territorial integrity. 'It is crucial, therefore, that we demonstrate that we mean what we say by reaffirming the Lisbon decision here in Edinburgh,' Mr Mitsotakis said, adding that this was all the more important since Mr Bill Clinton, the US president-elect had 'unequivocally declared' support for the Lisbon declaration. Greek opposition to the recognition of Macedonia has caused increasing irritation among governments of other member countries, particularly since Greece has been contributing to the economic difficulties of the republic by holding back oil deliveries for which Macedonia has already paid. That irritation has been compounded by evidence made public by the Spanish European commissioner for Mediterranean affairs, Mr Abel Matutes, that Greek companies were systematically breaking the United Nations trade embargo against Serbia. While withholding deliveries to Macedonia, they were sending thousands of tonnes of oil to other parts of the former Yugoslavia. Even if the EC leaders fail to find a solution to the problem of recognition, the UK presidency hopes it can persuade its partners to accept an interim solution under which Macedonia would become a member of the International Monetary Fund and thus be able to benefit from international financial aid.</p>

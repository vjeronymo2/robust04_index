			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'TRACY' IS GREAT; DISNEY CAN FORGET ABOUT JITTERS  </P> <P> BEFORE Warner Bros. released "Batman" last year, I thought we'd seen the height  of studio public relations jitters. Everybody connected was one big basket  case. But Warner Bros. relaxed after "Batman" pulled in its first $100 million.  </P> <P> This behavior, however, is nothing compared to the nail-biting, hair-pulling  and hand-wringing that has occupied the executives at Disney over the last  month as their star-director-producer Warren Beatty and his "Dick Tracy" stood  champing at the starting gate.  </P> <P> You'd think, observing all this, that Disney was "up the creek," that the movie  had come in millions over budget and that its creator-protagonist had sunk  every last cent of his own into the film and would be run out of Hollywood on a  rail if "Dick Tracy" weren't an unqualified hit. Not so. Disney is doing great,  the movie came in within the $30-million budget, and Warren is rich, rich, rich  and will remain a big power in the movie biz no matter how "Dick Tracy" fares  at the box office.  </P> <P> SO, WITH that out of the way, how is the movie? It's absolutely dazzling! A few  people here and there don't care for it, but believe me, they are not the norm.  Here is a movie so visually stunning and so unique in concept that dialogue and  story can be and are minimal. The real stars of "Dick Tracy" are not Beatty and  Madonna but cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, production designer Richard  Sylbert, costumer Milena Canonero, makeup men John Caglione Jr. and Doug  Drexler. (The latter have created the fantastically grotesque faces of the  immortal Chester Gould characters: Flat Top, Lips Manliss, The Brow, Little  Face, Pruneface, Spaldoni.)  </P> <P> Then there is Big Boy Caprice, played with manic, comic vulgarity by Al Pacino.  Also, there is Mumbles, with Dustin Hoffman doing the mumbling in what has to  be a little inside joke between Hoffman and Beatty. It is a real measure of  Beatty's power that he managed to assemble a truly great cast in these  character roles -- William Forsythe, Paul Sorvino, Chuck Hicks, R. J.  Armstrong, James Caan, as well as Dick Van Dyke as the D.A., Charles Durning as  the Chief, etc.  </P> <P> GLENNE HEADLY, as Tracy's true blue girlfriend, Tess Trueheart, is simply  marvelous -- wry and sexy.  </P> <P> And "The Kid," Charlie Korsmo, is the best acting find after years of our  wallowing in "kid stuff."  </P></p>

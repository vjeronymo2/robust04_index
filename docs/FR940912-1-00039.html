			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the absence of implementing any of the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives (baseline), nationwide, fifth-year wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process units are estimated to be approximately 37.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thousand Mg/yr. Assuming implementation of the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives, the emissions are 24.1 thousand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, an emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from baseline of 13.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual cost of about $4.3 million; 23.1 thousand Mg/yr for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 2, an emission reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline of 14.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of about $5.2 million; 21.0 thousand Mg/yr for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 3, an emission reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline of 16.2 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of about $8.8 million; 18.6 thousand Mg/yr for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 4, an emission reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline of 18.6 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of about $15.6 million; and 14.2 thousand Mg/yr for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 5, an emission reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline of 22.9 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of about $41.1 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control costs reflect the fact that most plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the NSPS will also be affected by the HON, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are expected to install a steam stripper for treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams regulated by the HON. The proposed NSPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will require these SOCMI plants to control additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams that do not require control under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HON. In estimating cost impacts of the NSPS, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that those plants affected by both regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the capacity of the steam stripper required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HON rule to provide sufficient capacity to handle the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional wastewater streams that would require control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the NSPS. The costs associated with the NSPS is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference in costs for the two steam strippers, one with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capacity to handle wastewater streams regulated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HON and the other with the capacity to handle wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams regulated by both the HON and the NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the alternatives and the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions achieved, the resulting control costs, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated impacts, the EPA concluded that the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in Regulatory Alternative 3 reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the best system of emission reduction that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been adequately demonstrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more stringent level of emissions limitation was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected because control beyond Regulatory Alternative 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in costs that are disproportionately large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to the additional emission reduction achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were estimated to achieve an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional emission reduction of about 2.4 thousand and 6.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thousand Mg/yr, respectively, at an additional cost of about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $6.8 million or $32.3 million for the two alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, the control requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to two sets of wastewater streams: streams with flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates of 1 Lpm or greater and a volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of 500 ppmw or greater; and any stream with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration of 10,000 ppmw or greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (regardless of flow rate).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Process Wastewater Collection System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed previously, effective control of SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process unit wastewater emissions requires control from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point of generation until treated to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards, or until recycled to a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process unit that is in compliance with the standards. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards require that emissions be controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during wastewater collection and transport in piping or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual drain systems and during handling and treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in wastewater tanks, containers, surface impoundments, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment devices by using covers, lids, water seals, roofs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enclosures designed to reduce emissions. Proper work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices, including periodic monitoring, inspection, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair, are also required to ensure that the equipment will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control emissions. Emissions from these wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection, transport, and handling systems are believed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be significant, thereby requiring the use of controls to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively reduce air emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Process Wastewater Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation provides four options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating compliance with the SOCMI process unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment standards: three treatment options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on numerical emission limitations and an equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design specification. Of the options based on numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limitations, the first option may be adopted by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources. The remaining options based on numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limitations may only be used by certain classes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, as discussed below. Any facility may choose to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equipment and design specification as an alternative to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission limitation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first treatment process compliance option is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of VOC from the wastewater based on the removal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of the BDT, which is a design steam stripper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., a steam stripper meeting specific design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational criteria). Under this equipment and design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard option for demonstrating compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process wastewater treatment standard, if the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator installs and operates a steam stripper that meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements, listed below, the treatment unit is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the treatment process standard of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These design and operating parameters include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Minimum active column height of 5 meters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Countercurrent flow configuration with a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 10 actual trays;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Minimum steam flow rate of 0.04 kilograms of steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per liter of wastewater feed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Minimum wastewater feed temperature to the steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stripper of 95 degrees Centigrade;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Maximum liquid loading of 67,100 liters per hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per square meter; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

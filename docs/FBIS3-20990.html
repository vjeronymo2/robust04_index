How can  it be done under conditions acceptable to all? The issue is so  sensitive and the public is now so watchful and cautious that  the governments of nuclear energy producing countries think  twice before presenting their proposals. Ten years ago, who  would have predicted the proliferation of mediators, sent to the  front lines by public administrations, nuclear industry  manufacturers, and brand-new agencies in charge of managing this  waste, to inform, reassure, answer questions, and consider  everyone's probing and apprehension before reaching any  decisions?    Nuclear power can no longer be forcefully imposed; public  administrations have understood this and have learned their  lessons from the past. In February 1990 the Rocard government,  aware of difficulties it would encounter if it imposed this or  that site for storage of highly active waste from the nuclear  industry, chose to halt hostilities with the determined  population on 9 February 1990 and to let time do its work. Of  course this decision was not completely devoid of electoral  considerations, but excessive coercion eventually creates a trap  which Rocard wanted to avoid by declaring a one year moratorium  on the management of these awkward waste products.    The 30 December 1991 law on this issue has formed a  legislative framework for any new steps in this regard and given  mediator Christian Bataille the heavy responsibility of  consulting constituencies and collecting voluntary proposals  from communities interested in the installation of an  underground laboratory for research on nuclear waste. This was a  good initiative and about 30 such proposals came quickly to  light.    Today, four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Neuse, and  Vienne  have been tentatively selected by Bataille (see LE MONDE of 6  January) and the government has just authorized the Radioactive  Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) to begin geophysical surveys of  the sites. Here again, cautiously, the authorities will take  their time for one to two years before reaching any decision.    Groundbreaking for the laboratories, which will cost 1.5  billion francs each, cannot begin before the end of 1997 at the  earliest, which means that operations would begin in 2002. This  would be followed by eight years of research on site quality  (nature of bedrock, water flow study, deeply-imbedded materials  performance, and so on); this is because ANDRA is not scheduling  materials storage before 2020 at sites that have yet to be  determined assuming the program is authorized to continue after  Parliament deliberations around 2010.    This surfeit of caution is not unique to the French  authorities: all nuclear energy producing countries are facing  the same type of problems. As a matter of fact, France is  managing fairly well at present with its surface storage for low  radioactivity waste at the Hague (Manche) which is filled, and  at Soulaines (Aube) which has just opened. The only remaining  problem is to, so to speak, settle the delicate issue of  permanent storage of highly active waste. One step has just been  taken with Bataille's report. Many other countries wish that  they were that far along.  <H5>  Strong Local Opposition </H5>   In Europe the situation has more facets as a few examples  will illustrate. In Germany where disagreement is sharp, it is  clear that all nuclear industry waste will be stored underground  regardless of its radioactive level. Storage has already been  established at two locations for low and medium-activity  radioactive waste: at the former salt mines in Morsleben near  the old East German border, and at Asse (Lower Saxony). The  latter has in fact been for some years, the site of  international experiments for storage of high radioactivity  waste.    Two other sites also in Lower Saxony are currently being  discussed as possible storage centers. The first is in Gorleben  where two wells are being drilled in a salt dome for high  radioactivity waste, the first shipments of which may come in  1994 and 1999 from France and Great-Britain. But work on this  project has been stopped. The second is at the Konrad iron mine  for less radioactive material. But its placement into service is  being hotly contested between the federal government and the  Lower Saxony authorities.    In Switzerland where there a research laboratory in granite  already exists at Grimsel, nuclear industry waste is housed  on-site at plants and research facilities, while waste resulting  from other industry activity has been temporarily stored since  25 November 1992 at a 9.3 million Swiss franc installation in  Wurenlingen in the Argovie canton. For permanent storage, the  Cooperative for Radioactive Waste Storage (CEDRA) approved in  June of last year a center whose cost is estimated at 500  million francs and which would be built in Wellenberg in the  semi-canton of Nidwald.  <H5>  Swedish Example </H5>   But canton authorities are blocking current construction  based on their recently acquired legal power to grant licenses  for underground utilization. Many discussions must yet take  place before Parliament issues a decision (in 1997?) on this  proposed center whose operation could begin in 2005. As for high  radioactivity waste, this is only the beginning.    Preliminary drilling intended to analyze the nature of the  soil (granite and gneiss) has already been conducted in the  northern part of the country in Bottstein, Leuggern, Weiach,  Kaisten, Schaffisheim and Siblingen. Other drilling operations  have been requested by federal authorities to prospect clay  deposits in the Aar Valley and in the area between Baden and  Schaffhouse. But as the JOURNAL DE GENEVE pointed out last  summer, in Siblingen, the canton authorization procedure for  drilling took six years while at the federal level it took one  year and eight months. "All that time to come to the realization  that the site was not suitable..."    Clearly waste management is not an easy matter and according  to nuclear energy promoters it is hampered less by technical  difficulties than by social and political problems. The country  currently having the most success in resolving them is Sweden,  whose early decision against reprocessing irradiated fuels at  its plants has made the choices easier.    Sweden has an underground facility, the SFR, carved out of  granite on the Baltic coast not far from the Forstmark plant,  which since April 1988 has been used for permanent storage of  low and medium radioactivity waste. At the same time the  Stockholm government in the early 1980's commissioned an  enormous underground storage center in Oskarshamm, the CLAB,  intended for storing irradiated fuels from Swedish plants for 40  years before they are permanently buried in the substrata of the  country's two northern communes situated right in Lappland near  Arjeplog and Overkalix (see LE MONDE 17 September 1992).    Discussions are underway to determine which of these two  locations may receive these vexatious ashes. There is no hurry,  even if it takes time to win over a very skeptical public  opinion. This is why, in spite of CLAB's intermediate storage  (CLAB received its first highly radioactive shipments in July  1985), the Swedes want proof "through a dress rehearsal" that  their permanent storage plan in granite is efficient.    The Swedish Fuel and Radioactive Waste Processing Company  (SKB) has thus begun drilling a deep tunnel in granite at  Orskarshamm near CLAB; this is the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory  (HRL) which is intended to serve as proving grounds for the  engineers. The whole facility should be completed at the end of  1994 or the beginning of 1995. But unlike its Canadian  counterpart, URL at Pinawa in Manitoba, this underground  laboratory will not be converted to a storage site.</p>

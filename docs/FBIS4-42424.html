			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marie-France Cros: "Rwanda: `Respectable' </F> Racism"]    [Text] The savagery of the extermination of opponents,  Tutsis, and intellectuals in Rwanda is appalling. For this  situation to explode, however, it was helped along by complicity  which was all the more fearsome since it was "innocent."    President Habyarimana's regime was nothing other than  fascism. It had the same qualities: It concentrated on  development just like Mussolini's draining the Pontine Marshes  and Hitler's building freeways. It clearly had the same faults:  A single-party dictatorship, a frenzied cult of personality,  and nationalist exaltation, since it was understood that only  Hutus are true Rwandans, because the Tutsis were supposed to  have come from Egypt; and moreover, only Hutus from the north  were real Hutus, since those from the south were too associated  with Tutsi blood and culture.    During those years, the Europeans, Belgians in particular,  but also the French, could find nothing to complain about. Yet,  the missionaries, volunteer workers, and politicians had either  experienced World War II, or else learned at school that fascism  and systematic exclusion led straight to the "catastrophe" that  was the Jews' Holocaust.    They know this so well that none of them today would dare  describe Jews as being miserly, dirty people with hooked noses,  which was the typical caricature before the war. Nevertheless,  we often heard our compatriots, not all of them (!), involved in  Rwanda blandly explain that "the Tutsis are intelligent and  treacherous while the Hutus are dolts but nice," meaning that it  made sense for the former, who were dangerous, to be subjected  to discrimination, so that the latter, semi-innocent group could  flourish.    The truth is that you come across imbeciles in power when  they find themselves in power for no other reason than their  ethnic, regional, or political origin, whether we are talking  about the Tutsis in yesterday's Burundi, or Hutus in Rwanda.  Not only do they not need to be competent to take power but if  they are intelligent, are they not being "ridiculous" if they  study, since their future is guaranteed.    The majority of our missionaries, our many volunteer  workers,  and our politicians has long turned a blind eye to Rwandan  fascism, thus adopting a "respectable" racism and preferring to  believe that General Habyarimana ran "the Switzerland of Africa."    In the fall of 1993, the extremist Hutu radio station, Radio  Mille Collines, began broadcasting. They teach us at schools  that fascism plus radio equals a dangerously explosive cocktail.  However, the gentleness of the Rwandan hills must blur school  memories. We had to wait until December 1993 and the arrival of  the first Belgian blue helmets, who were immediately targeted by  Hutu extremists because they had come to help enforce the Arusha  peace agreements, before many Europeans opened their eyes and  realized that the anti-Tutsi and antiopposition campaign was no  more tolerable than the anti-Belgian campaigns of the  extremists. Too late.</p>

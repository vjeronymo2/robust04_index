			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Westminster official lied, court told A former chief executive of Westminster city council was accused of lying yesterday at the public hearings into alleged vote-rigging. Mr Andrew Arden QC, representing the group of residents who have been levelling the accusations, described prolonged correspondence between Mr Bill Phillips, the council's managing director between 1987 and 1991, and Mr Paul Dimoldenberg, then leader of the Labour group on the council. Mr Arden said Mr Dimoldenberg was trying to find out why council money appeared to be targeted at marginal wards at the expense of other areas. But Mr Phillips denied that this was the case in a letter on May 24 1988. He wrote: 'In short I have seen no evidence to support your assertions and I will take this opportunity to tell you that I do not purvey 'clear untruths' to anybody.' Mr Arden said Mr Phillips was the council official who knew most about secret vote-rigging plans. He added that Mr Phillips' epitaph 'might be that he was a purveyor of fine lies'. Mr Phillips is one of 10 council officials and councillors named in the district auditor's provisional report for wasting Pounds 21m on selling off council homes in marginal wards before the 1990 local elections. In a legal dispute yesterday Mr Anthony Scrivener, the QC retained by former council leader Dame Shirley Porter, applied to call Mr Neale Coleman, one of the objectors and former Labour housing spokesman on the council, as a witness. But Mr Arden said that Mr Coleman would not be able to shed any useful light on the allegations since they concerned decisions taken in secret by Conservative councillors. He added that if Mr Coleman was called he might consider challenging a previous ruling by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, that none of the 10 accused should be forced to give evidence at the hearing. The hearing will not sit today.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: David Brown rises 12% DAVID BROWN Group, the gear and pump manufacturer which is shortly to be floated, increased pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 9.3m in the year to January 29. Sales were static at Pounds 81m (Pounds 80.9m), writes Andrew Bolger. The directors of this Huddersfield-based company, which was the subject of a Pounds 46m management buy-in in 1990, said that strong cash flow had led to a Pounds 3.2m fall in net borrowings, in spite of investment of Pounds 3.8m in new businesses. Gearing, which was 300 per cent after the buy-in, now stands at 28 per cent and will be reduced further by proceeds from the flotation, which is expected to give the group a market value of more than Pounds 70m.</p>

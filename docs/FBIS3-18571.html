G.: "The DREE Wants To Favor Strategic </F> Analysis"]    [Text] After having been criticized by  companies, the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE),  under the leadership of its new director, Jean-Pierre Landau,  intends to intensify its warning role by multiplying its  strategic analysis of information furnished by foreign posts.    Brand new as the head of DREE in July 1993, Landau had  already decided on his priorities: the development of large  macroeconomic analyses while favoring forecast and assessments  of each country. Nearly seven months after taking over his  duties, three of which were devoted to GATT, Landau has kept his  word if one can judge by the rare confidences of bureaucrats,  many of whom have reverted to the former pratice of refusing  comment. Foreign posts have received orders to "massively"  increase the information they gather, whether macroeconomic or  microeconomic -- "We have been inundated with requests from  Paris," an adviser explained -- for top officials to digest in  the Finance Minister.    The idea is to make of DREE "an action tool, of reflection,  of warning and forecasting analyses." We have been assigned a  mission, another adviser affirms, "to capture all international  signals in order that they can be then translated into strategic  analyses." In sum, the DREE would become an immense watch and  warning network.    This reorientation begs a certain number of questions on the  future of the directorate, currently under the supervision of  two ministries: The questions are fed by the recurrent rumor  that the DREE will merge with Treasury. The plan seems all the  more plausible this time since many experts, one of which is the  director of the DREE, believes that there is no difference  between currency, trade, and investment; between the national  and international economy; and that France's foreign  interactions goes well beyond the trade balance.    Moreover, in a context of restricted budgets and layoffs and  while the need for a greater professionalism is clearly evident,  the search for synergies would justify such an approach. For  certain, this could even take place as soon as 1995. Some  believe that this is the mission which Jean-Pierre Landau had  set for himself when he was nominated. In this event, what  would become of the other mission of the DREE, namely the  support it gives to companies?    In the near term, such support is not threatened, no more so  than is the billing office for ad hoc services rendered to  exporters. In the medium term, however, this role could be  assumed by the parastatal support organizations for foreign  trade (CFCE, Council of European Trade Federations; CFME  [expansion unknown]; ACTlM [expansion unknown]). Among  employers, the Desgeorges report (not yet published) foretells  the privatization of this function.  <H3>  Ouestions and  Innovations </H3>   Parallel to these strategic questions, some innovations in  the management of personnel, and more precisely in career  tracks, augment the conversations in the corridors of the DREE.  Competition for assignments as foreign post commercial  counselors is open: As a rule, slots for these jobs will have  the largest pool of candidates in the future. The network will  be reinvigorated: Reinforcing the inspector general's office  will allow it to inspect not only all the posts in three years  but also to counsel them more effectively.    This policy is going to lead to renewing, in the long term,  10 percent to 15 percent of the work force in these expanding  careers. Top management in the central administration will also  be shaken up. Merit promotion initiated by the former director,  Jacques Desponts, will continue and be reinforced. Better  still, it is no longer obligatory to have been bureau chief to  become deputy director. A small cultural revolution.</p>

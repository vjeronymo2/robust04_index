			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW SPRAYING PLAN IS UNVEILED;  </P> <P> INFESTATION: REVISED STRATEGY AGAINST MEDFLY CALLS FOR THREE MORE MALATHION  TREATMENTS AROUND GARDEN GROVE.  </P> <P> State agriculture officials, offering the first details of their stepped-up  attack on the Mediterranean fruit fly, on Monday ordered three more malathion  treatments around Garden Grove as part of a plan to respray about half of  Southern California's infested areas.  </P> <P> Under a new schedule that tones down overly optimistic predictions about the  Medfly battle, about 250 square miles of existing spray zones around Southern  California will be hit at least once more from the air during May, officials  announced.  </P> <P> A 36-square-mile area that includes virtually all of Garden Grove, half of  Westminster, and parts of seven other neighboring cities and is home to about  400,000 residents is scheduled to be sprayed three more times this month --  more additional treatments than any other area.  </P> <P> The frequency of the sprayings will also be stepped up to once a week.  Sprayings for the Garden Grove region are set for May 16, May 23 and May 30.  </P> <P> With fewer sterile flies available from Hawaii production facilities than  anticipated, agricultural officials looked for ways of conserving them. The  Garden Grove region offered that opportunity, officials said, because it  appears that its treatment may be completed with just a few more sprayings --  and without using the sterile flies at all.  </P> <P> "Our hope," said Pat Minyard, deputy director of the Medfly Project in El  Monte, "is that we can make three treatments (in the Garden Grove area), keep  trapping and find no more flies, and be able to declare the fly eradicated  there by December."  </P> <P> Until last week, state agriculture officials had promised to end the  10-month-old malathion campaign in most parts of Southern California by  Wednesday. But a series of widespread Medfly finds and a potential shortage of  sterile Medflies prompted officials to retreat from that plan.  </P> <P> The war, they conceded, had not been won.  </P> <P> An eight-square-mile spray zone around Brea, which last November became the  first area in Orange County to receive aerial malathion treatments, will not  get any more applications under the new schedule.  </P> <P> Instead, crews of agricultural workers will release millions of sterile  Medflies in the North County area to try to breed the crop-attacking pest out  of existence. That process will likely start around Brea on Thursday, officials  said.  </P> <P> In all, spraying will be ended by Wednesday in about 225 square miles around  Southern California, officials said.  </P> <P> However, new finds anywhere in the Southland could prompt more sprayings, they  said.  </P> <P> Barring any more discoveries, the end of May "should be the end of it" for all  Southern California spray zones outside of the new treatment areas in Riverside  and San Bernardino counties, where flies have been discovered in recent weeks,  Minyard said.  </P> <P> But critics of the state's controversial, $30-million battle against the Medfly  were, at the least, skeptical.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're not happy with this at all," said Bob Taylor, a Garden Grove  resident who has helped organize anti-malathion protests in the area and is now  trying to gather signatures for a statewide ballot initiative to ban such  sprayings.  </P> <P> "No one's going to have any confidence in whatever date (state officials) say  is going to be the end because they just don't seem to know what they're doing.  Things are out of control," Taylor said. "It's becoming increasingly evident  that they're really beating a dead horse -- that the process just doesn't  work."  </P> <P> David Moore, president of the Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., said the new  strategy put in place Monday has his "100%" backing. But he conceded that the  announcement will do little to help the already-damaged image of the  agriculture industry, seen by some as having a stranglehold on state decisions  through its powerful financial interests.  </P> <P> "I'd like to think that we in agriculture wear the white hats, the good guys,"  said Moore, whose group represents 1,300 fresh produce growers and shippers in  California and Arizona. "But I just hate to see what's happening to us in the  public eye because it just seems like we're getting pounded."  </P> <P> However, pointing to the threat posed by the Medfly's spread to the Riverside  area and the prospect of export quarantines, Moore added that malathion  spraying "is the only proven thing that will work, and I still say we're going  to win this battle. . . ."  </P> <P> Isi Siddiqui, the assistant director of the state Department of Food and  Agriculture, who two months ago predicted an end to the infestation by June,  said the situation is now too unpredictable to say when the state will be able  to eradicate the pest.  </P> <P> In addition to the extra sprayings announced Monday for some areas, 34 square  miles in the City of San Bernardino will have to be repeatedly sprayed with  malathion through at least June because of the limited supply of sterile flies.  </P> <P> The Riverside County community of Woodcrest will be sprayed during the summer,  but only because of the commercial citrus groves in the area.  </P> <P> But with the hot summer months approaching, offering ideal breeding conditions  for the Medfly, the infestation could grow dramatically in the next few months,  experts said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ashley Dunn contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MEDFLY INFESTATION  </P> <P> More treatments have been scheduled in some Southern California areas in the  battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. Map shows the numbered zones that  have received malathion spraying to date, the area that has been treated with  the release of sterile flies only, and the Medfly quarantine areas.  </P> <P> Text below details the status of each area, including plans announced Monday  for future spraying and release of sterile flies.  </P> <P> 1.

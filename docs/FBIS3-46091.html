They carefully  listened to the deputies' views.    In a group discussion held by the Aba autonomous prefectural  delegation, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie said that the  province must never miss opportunities in the 1990's, otherwise  Sichuan will suffer serious losses. After listening to some  deputies' remarks, Xie Shijie said: The difficulties of the  three minority autonomous prefectures and remote areas have  received the close attention of the provincial party committee  and government, and we are now discussing methods and measures  with every one of you to resolve them. But the efforts of the  central and provincial authorities alone cannot help completely  resolve problems. I would like to quote Deng Xiaoping:  Development is a fixed principle. In time of financial  difficulties, you should not compete with other prefectures but  should find ways suitable for yourselves. You can encourage  individual and private economic sectors to development township  and town enterprises with a free mind. The three autonomous  prefectures have strong points in resources and should pay  attention to the commodity economy.    On economic development in ethnic prefectures, Xiao Yang  said  in a group discussion of the Ganzi autonomous prefectural  delegation: Let us develop methods together, but to develop the  economy is a fixed principle. In economic development, the  three autonomous prefectures can rely on Chengdu and Chongqing.  The provincial authorities are seeking ways for this to help  ethnic prefectures with their development.    Vice Governor Xu Shiqun attended a group discussion on  education held by the Nanchong delegation. He listened to the  deputies' views on government educational work. Xu Shiqun  said: In making an economic leap, Sichuan must hold firm to the  orientation of socialist education, give prominence to primary  education, and make a success of the nine-year compulsory  education. But some localities have not put this into effect.  I hope every one of you will supervise this. There are still  some problems to resolve in education, such as inadequate  investment in education and low salaries for teachers. Now  detailed regulations are being worked out for the implementation  of the Teachers Law. In the future, the improvement of the  teachers ranks will proceed under the legal system.    While holding a group discussion with the Deyang delegation  yesterday afternoon, Provincial People's Congress Chairman Yang  Xizong and Governor Xiao Yang pointed out the need to resolve  new problems emerging in the course of development. After  listening to the remarks of some People's Congress deputies on  the peasants' difficulties in selling their products due to an  imperfect market mechanism, Yang Xizong expressed his full  concern by saying: How to guide the peasants into the market is  a new issue in the course of development and is also a problem  we should work hard to resolve in our future rural economic  development. First, we should do a good job in providing market  forecasts and guide the peasants in arranging their production  according to market information. Second, we should form an  entity of trade, industry, and agriculture and improve all kinds  of service in coordination with this. Third, we should  establish a reserve system and a risk-bearing fund.    A deputy named Li Yongshou said that because tax evasions  are  serious, Deyang City is ready to form a local taxation bureau.  After hearing this, Xiao Yang remarked: This is very good, tax  evasions must be resolved. You can work out a plan to form the  bureau as soon as possible.</p>

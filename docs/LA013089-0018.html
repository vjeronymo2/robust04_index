			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PAKISTAN SAYS IT WILL REASSURE U.S. ON NUCLEAR PROGRAM  </P> <P> The government said Sunday that it will seek to reassure the United States that  its controversial nuclear program is peaceful.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official APP news agency, said,  "Pakistan never tried to manufacture a nuclear bomb, nor would it ever do so in  the future."  </P> <P> The statement followed American newspaper reports that U.S. aid to Pakistan  might be cut off because Washington may no longer be able to certify that  Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb.  </P> <P> Without such certification, required annually by law, Pakistan would not be  eligible to receive U.S. economic and military aid beyond the financial year  ending on Sept. 30.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: Where is the call for action? Sir, I refer to your article 'Perspectives: Wasted lives in the UK's packed jails - A City group on a moving morning in prison' (February 22). I wonder what the point of such an article is, unless it calls for action. Any suggestions? John Ottensooser, John Ottensooser &amp; Co, Parliament House, North Row, London W1</p>

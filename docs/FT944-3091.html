			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan eyes Chinese market Taiwan's motorcycle manufacturers, the world's second biggest, expect to export more motorcycles to China to meet surging demand there. 'We plan to export half of our annual production next year, and most of this to mainland China,' said Mr Wang Shuang-ching, president of Kwang Yang Motor, Taiwan's leading motorcycle maker, which expects sales of 700,000 motorcycles in 1995, up from 500,000 this year. Taiwan's motorcycle sales reached 1.49m in 1993, ranking second only to Japan. Of these 1993 sales, 20.9 per cent were exported, considerably higher than the 3.9 per cent of the 1.1m sold in 1989. Motorcycle exports to China accounted for 69 per cent of motor cycle exports last year. The rest were to south-east Asian and some European countries.</p>

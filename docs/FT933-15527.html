			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Deutsche Bank may cut Daimler stake DEUTSCHE Bank may reduce its 28 per cent holding in Daimler-Benz in the medium-term, Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler has said . In Nuremberg this week Mr Reuter said it was possible that Deutsche Bank would reduce its stake, although there were no immediate plans to do so. Even after a reduction, Deutsche 'would remain a highly-valued large shareholder in the house of Daimler-Benz', Mr Reuter said. The holding by Germany's biggest bank in Germany's biggest industrial company, worth more than DM8bn (Pounds 3.13bn), dates back to the late 1920s and is one of the most enduring features on the German corporate landscape. Mr Reuter's statement follows comments by a Deutsche Bank board member earlier this year that both sides had agreed that the stake should be reduced over the medium term. These remarks prompted fierce denials from both companies. Both Deutsche and Daimler insisted again yesterday that there were no plans for a reduction. But Mr Reuter's willingness to address the issue adds weight to speculation that the two have had behind-the-scenes talks. This is thought to be in connection with Daimler's decision to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Daimler, which derived two-thirds of last year's DM98.6bn turnover from its Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary, has said that it is planning a DM2bn to DM3bn rights issue next year following the US listing. It is possible that Deutsche would not take up its entitlement to new shares, which would dilute its holding. Lex, Page 26</p>

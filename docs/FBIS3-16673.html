An armed Russian convoy escorting governmental mail was  taken-off a Moscow-Kaliningrad train because the Russians did  not have permission to carry weapons on Lithuanian territory.  Lithuanian border guards disarmed the Russian soldiers and  handed them over to the police.    The convoys explained that they were supposed to deliver the  mail by plane, but their flight was canceled and they had to  take a train. The Russians were given back their weapons and  were allowed to board another train.    Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the Lithuanian Border  Defense Service, discussed the incident with representatives of  the Russian troops stationed in the Kaliningrad region.  Dragunaitis emphasized the need to put a stop to violations of  armed servicemen transit regulations.    The Lithuanian official said the rules of transporting  weapons through Lithuanian territory must be strictly observed.  He noted that Lithuanian border guards will never make any  concessions to anybody and will always act in accordance with  the law.</p>

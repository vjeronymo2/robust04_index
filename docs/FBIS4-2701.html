			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (CNS) -- The maximum punishment  for presons found guilty of infringing trademarks has been  increased to a seven years' jail term up from the original three  years and the rise of 300 percent in the fine imposed.    Director of the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce Mr Liu Minxue said in a news briefing today that the  punishment for breaches of trademark and false registration of  trademarks was harsh. He said he was convinced that with the  growing development of the commodity economy and international  trade, infringements of trademarks and counterfeit registration  of trademarks had tended to increase, becoming a public hazard  in the international community. Light punishment according to  law against such crimes was to blame for rampancy of the offence.    Following the learning of experience acquired by foreign  countries in this sector, Mr Liu said that the Chinese  authorities had revised the trademark law in accordance with its  own situation while at the same time the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress had approved supplementary  regulations on the punishment for counterfeit registration of  trademarks and the State Council had endorsed the revision of  the detailed regulations on the implementation of the trademark  law. Legislation meanwhile had strengthened protection for the  exclusive use of trademarks and the revised law had boosted the  administrative enforcement of the law to deal with trademark  infringement. The law stated that the industrial and commercial  administration could increase administrative punishment for  violation of trademark to a fine of not more than 50 percent of  the turnover or not more than five times the profits obtained  from the illegal practice of committing breach of trademark, an  increase from the original imposition of a fine equivalent to  not more than 20 percent of the illegal turnover or to a sum not  more than twice the illegal profit. Persons found guilty of  committing false registration of trademarks would receive the  maximum jail term from the original three years to seven years.</p>

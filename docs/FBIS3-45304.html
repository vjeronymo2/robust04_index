			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 17 KYODO -- U.S. and Chinese  negotiators agreed to up to 13 percent cuts in textile imports  to the United States in a last-ditch effort to avoid a trade war  which could have gravely effected all levels of bilateral  relations.    "This agreement does provide over the life of three years,  an  overall reduction from what the 1993 agreement had been of  approximately 700 million dollars," chief U.S. textile  negotiator Jennifer Hillman told KYODO NEWS SERVICE after the  signing of the agreement.    This represents, "a 13 percent reduction over the time of  the  agreement from what the levels had been in 1993," she said.    "The agreement is the product of the joint effort made by  both sides, both sides have started from the principles of  consultation and equality," Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi said before the signing  ceremony.    According to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, China  exported 7.3 billion dollars of textiles to the U.S. in 1993  and was in jeopardy of facing 25-35 percent reductions in import  quotas if the agreement was not reached.    Such reductions, which would have cost China up to 1.2  billion dollars, were the result of alleged illegal textile  transshipments to the U.S. which circumvented 1993's existing  quota by some 2 billion dollars, Kantor said.    "Overall we reached an agreement that did include the  language we had been seeking regarding what action we could take  when we find repeated instances of transshipment," Hillman said.    "The language would permit us to make a deduction of up to  three times the actual amount of goods shipped. If China is a  repeat offender in terms of transshipment, we felt that it was  very important to have strong measures to address the problem of  transshipment," she said.    According to the present agreement, if in 1994 the U.S. can  prove China is guilty of illegal transshipments worth 2 billion  dollars, which the U.S. alleges took place in 1993, then they  could effectively reduce China's import quota by up to 6 billion  dollars.    A high-level MOFTEC official who participated in the talks  felt there was "too much pressure" in the talks, saying, "the  Chinese-side gave in too much."    The agreement, however, bodes well for the upcoming visit  Wednesday of U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen to  Beijing, the highest level visit by a U.S. official since the  1989 crackdown on Tiananmen prodemocracy demonstrations, which  soured relations between the two countries.    In June, China also faces the loss of its  most-favored-nation  (MFN) trade status, with the U.S. demanding "significant  overall progress" in human rights, before it can renew MFN.</p>

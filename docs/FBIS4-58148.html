			<p>Allegations   of IRA Links   <F P=102> LD3004092994 Tehran IRNA in English 0627 GMT 30 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> LD3004092994 </F> <F P=104>  Tehran IRNA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Two morning dailies Saturday  severely criticized the British Government for accusing Iran of  having established contacts with the Irish Republican Army (IRA).    The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' argued whether Britain or  any other Western country had the right to question Iran's  actions regarding adherence to internationally accepted  conventions.    "From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have  repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which  regulate relations between individual countries," said the paper.    The editorial said the 1961 and 1963 Vienna Conventions  requiring the observance of mutual diplomatic rules among  nations have been openly ignored by the West through their overt  and covert support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in  their countries.    "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead ignorance  when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups  they harbor in the West."    The paper noted that the Iranian Government has been under  increasing domestic public opinion pressure for not allowing  Bader-Meinhof, Direct Action or the IRA to have offices in  Tehran while anti-Iranian terrorist groups enjoy almost full  diplomatic rights in Bonn, Paris and London.    "The Iranian public opinion is consistently questioning the  government why it adheres to international conventions regarding  aiding and abetting terrorists when Western countries so openly  and flagrantly ignore the same conventions."    The daily termed the latest baseless British protest over  the Iran-IRA contact as a "smoke-screen to hide the fact that  Western based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing material and  personnel to the Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside  the Islamic republic."    Commenting on the same subject the Persian daily  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that apparently Tehran-London ties  would never be stable because evidence shows that the Britons  have constantly tried to mar mutual ties by taking advantage of  the status quo.    It added that a review of Tehran-London political ties over  the past 15 years reveals that not only such relations could  never be relied on, the London government would occasionally  misuse the ties under various pretexts.    The paper called on the Iranian authorities to bring the  ties  with London to the lowest possible level, especially in economic  field.    It also recommended the decision-making bodies in the  country  to look into the new British game and not allow London to take  advantage of such a political-propaganda ploy.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca sells subsidiary for Dollars 65m ZENECA, Imperial Chemical Industries' former bioscience group, yesterday announced it had sold its Thoro System Products business to a new company formed by D George Harris &amp; Associates, the fast-expanding New York chemicals holding group. The Zeneca subsidiary, which makes speciality building products, had a turnover last year of more than Dollars 62m. It is understood to be profitable and to have been sold for about Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.6m). Zeneca said the sale was consistent with its strategy of shedding non-core businesses and concentrating resources on those businesses that share common technologies and skills. The Miami-based subsidiary became part of ICI in 1985 as part of the Beatrice Chemical acquisition. Mr D George Harris, chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition would be called Thorchem International and would form the basis of a new building materials and chemicals company with sales of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m over the next few years. He had identified two possible further acquisition targets, one based in the US, another in Europe, although they both had businesses in the two regions.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investors wary of US under Clinton - But fund chiefs see opportunities continuing INVESTORS in the United States are a cautious lot these days. Many believe the economy is just bumping along the bottom and that signs of recovery are mirages. And although stock prices are at all-time highs, worries are widespread about the country's direction under President-elect Bill Clinton. But the managers of three top-performing offshore funds that invest in US securities are mostly unconcerned about a Clinton presidency and believe they will continue to find market opportunities. James Reynolds, the manager of Global Asset Management's US fund, thinks Clinton will not tinker with the economy as much as he promised and will try to maintain the US on its present economic course. That, he feels, should lead to slow, steady growth, low inflation - and Clinton's re-election in 1996. 'Clinton has learned from (former President) Carter,' said Reynolds, a principal with Fayez Sarofim &amp; Co. in Houston, Texas. 'The most important thing for him to do is get re-elected.' Even if Clinton proves a disaster for the economy, Reynolds says the companies in which he invests - large, US-based multi-nationals - ought to remain unaffected. They generate most of their profits and earnings growth from outside the US. So far, that investment strategy - based on the belief that the global economy will be dominated by 1,500 companies in the year 2000 - has served Reynolds well. Indeed, GAM US, with a gain of 72.49 per cent, was the eighth best-performing offshore fund over the five years to September 1992, according to Lipper Analytical Services of New York. Reynolds says the secret is to ferret out those US companies likely to survive and thrive in the global arena. He will continue to look for companies with above-average earnings growth over extended cycles, and which sell at reasonable valuations. He also aims for companies with strong balance sheets, low debt-to-equity ratios, and higher-than-average returns on equity. He admits readily that his criteria leave only a handful of companies and most are household names: his favourites include Coca-Cola, Gillette and Proctor &amp; Gamble. 'Clinton won't be disastrous for these companies,' he says. 'People will still shave, wash their hair and eat food.' Bradford Lewis, manager of Fidelity Investments' Dollars 108m American Assets fund and the Dollars 17m Sterling America Fund (the two were in mid-December), disagrees with Reynolds and thinks inflation could double from its present 3 per cent over Clinton's first four years. But he does not believe the cost of living will rise out of control, as it did when both Congress and White House were controlled by Democrats late in the 1970s. He hopes the bond market will act to control government spending. But just in case inflation does rise sharply, Lewis has taken steps to protect his portfolio by buying shares of gold mining companies. Despite his outlook for inflation, Lewis is not making wholesale changes to the fund because of Clinton's election. Rather, he is more occupied with re-making American Assets into the mirror image of the highly regarded fund  -Disciplined Equity - that he manages for US investors. Lewis will use an investment strategy called quantitative analysis, which relies in part on intensive statistical analysis of stocks, to build a portfolio. He has created a computer software programme that attempts to mimic the structure of the human brain. The programme will not only identify which stocks are cheap, based on value or earnings, but also evaluate how the market is pricing stocks generally. This investment strategy has served the Disciplined Equity fund well. It has gained 14.53 per cent over the three years to October while the average growth fund gained only 9.72 per cent over the same period. Daniel Miller, manager of the second best-performing offshore fund over the past five years, the Putnam Emerging Health Sciences trust, is unsure what to expect from Clinton's policies, especially those concerned with health care. He notes that the president-elect spoke during the campaign of putting in place a system that would provide health care for all, while containing growing costs. But few people know exactly how Clinton will pursue his goals; thus, Miller has not yet been able to divine which specific stocks will benefit from, or be hurt by, his proposals. Like Reynolds and Lewis, he hopes to invest in companies that will prosper irrespective of Clinton's policies. For instance, he is backing equipment groups such as Zoll Medical, maker of the next generation of defibrilators, and service firms like NovaCare, which specialises in speech and physical therapy. The past year has been difficult for Miller. First, health-care stocks fell from grace. Clinton's promises to reform the health-care system delivered the final insult later in the year. The upshot was that Miller's fund fell 22.4 per cent during the first nine months of 1992, while the average fund rose 0.6 per cent. Still, it has a respectable long-term record. It rose 105 per cent over the five years to end-September and 76 per cent over two years. Miller believes the worst is now over for his sector. He is confident a rally could begin within six months - or at least as soon as Wall Street learns it can live with whichever campaign promises on health-care reform become law.</p>

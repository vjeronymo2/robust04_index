			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / IMF directors to review Vietnam debts DIRECTORS of the International Monetary Fund will review Vietnam's arrears today in a move that will start the process of bringing the country back into the international financial community. The meeting will be the IMF's first discussion of Vietnam since President Bill Clinton announced that the US would no longer oppose efforts to pay off the country's arrears and bring it back into good standing with the international financial institutions. The US representative on the IMF board is expected today to give a formal signal on Vietnam to his colleagues, who say they have so far read of Mr Clinton's intentions only in the press. This could trigger the formation of a support group headed by France and possibly Japan to provide bridging finance that would enable Vietnam to clear its arrears with the IMF, which total around 100m special drawing rights, the Fund's internal accounting unit. IMF officials have already established close links with Vietnam and agreement on an economic policy programme could follow quickly once the country has paid off its arrears. This in turn would allow Vietnam to draw up to SDR120m (Pounds 112.15m) from the IMF under a standby financing agreement. Once money has started to flow into Vietnam from the IMF and the multilateral development banks, the US government will find it difficult to resist pressures from US businesses to lift its trade embargo. Although most members of Congress supported the Clinton administration's move to drop US opposition to the clearing of Vietnam's IMF arrears, Mr Robert Smith, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, returned from Hanoi last weekend still convinced by reports that US prisoners of war had been sighted after 1973, when Vietnam said it handed over all prisoners.</p>

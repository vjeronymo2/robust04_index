			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Deficit at Woolworth drives down share price Shares in Woolworth, the US retailer, tumbled Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 21 in early trading yesterday - a fall of 9 per cent - on news of a sharp reversal into losses in the fourth quarter to January 29. But they rallied to close at Dollars 22 1/2 for a net loss of  3/8 on the day. Net income of Dollars 165m the previous year turned into net losses of Dollars 46m, on revenues down from Dollars 3.13bn to Dollars 2.82bn. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.26 turned into losses per share of 35 cents. Woolworth, which has been shedding its general merchandise stores and building up its specialty retailing businesses, stressed the results included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 168m. This was associated with the sale of its chain of 120 Woolco superstores in Canada to Wal-Mart, the US stores group, announced last month. The original announcement forecast that the charge would be just Dollars 45m, mainly resulting from the recognition of currency exchange losses. Yesterday, Woolworth said additional costs had arisen from inventory markdowns, the sale of some stores not included in the Wal-Mart deal, and an unexpected delay in completing the transaction. However, it said it benefited from a pre-tax credit of Dollars 145m relating to the reversal of some charges taken last quarter - biggest component of the overall downturn, therefore, came from its trading activities. Operating profits of Dollars 286m last time turned into operating losses of Dollars 21m. Woolworth said its operations in the fourth quarter were hit by disappointing sales and heavy promotional activity. Full-year turnover fell to Dollars 9.62bn from Dollars 9.96bn. Net income of Dollars 280m slid into net losses of Dollars 495m, and earnings per share of Dollars 2.14 turned into losses per share of Dollars 3.76.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Serbs and Croats outline Bosnia plan: Call for three ethnic states to be linked by confederal government THE LEADERS of Serbia and Croatia yesterday submitted to members of Bosnia's collective presidency their new plan to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states linked by a weak confederal government. But Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croatian counterpart, were disappointingly vague about territorial boundaries. 'They rather disappointed us in terms of not coming up with anything very specific on the map,' Lord Owen said, adding: 'But maybe that's a good idea because some of the things we heard, we didn't like.' In Paris, meanwhile, France said it would send 1,200-1,300 more troops to the Sarajevo region to back up the EC pledge at the Copenhagen summit to protect Bosnian Moslems. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said in Geneva that the Serbs were ready to give up their stranglehold on Sarajevo in return for Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. 'We are ready to hand over the city proper to the Moslems in return for very small towns like Srebrenica and Zepa,' he told reporters. But this seemed to contradict Mr Karadzic's earlier statement that Serbs would keep part of Sarajevo. It also contradicted reports that Lord Owen and his fellow international mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, were pressing for Moslem enclaves such as Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa to be guaranteed access to a river. Sketchy details from the talks indicate Serbia and Croatia want to divide Bosnia into five regions, with the Serbs having one contiguous area, and Croats and Moslems two each. Moslems would have control of the Bihac pocket in north-west Bosnia and an undefined area stretching north from Sarajevo. The Croats are claiming much of the south-west and possibly an area in northern Bosnia next to Croatia. Further talks are expected to continue today. Yesterday's talks involved seven of the nine-member Bosnian collective presidency. They amounted to a rebuff for Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the intransigent Bosnian president, and his deputy Mr Ejup Ganic, who both refused to go to Geneva. Mr Izetbegovic argues that the presidency, which includes moderate Serbs and Croats as well as Moslems, has no mandate to negotiate the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines. Mr Fikret Abdic, an emerging rival to Mr Izetbegovic, was the only Moslem at yesterday's talks. In Sarajevo, Mr Izetbegovic said he believed force was the best way to resolve the Bosnian crisis. 'Of course political solutions should be sought, but after nearly 15 months of aggression we do think that force can only be met by force,' he said.

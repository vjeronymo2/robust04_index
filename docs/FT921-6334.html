			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / India's economic growth rate slips to 10-year low INDIA suffered its lowest rate of economic growth in a decade in the financial year now ending, according to the government's economic survey published yesterday. The estimated 2.5 per cent growth in real gross domestic product - or a little more than the growth in population - was the result of stagnant agricultural output. Growth in all industries turned negative after rising 10 per cent the previous year (based on six-month figures), while manufacturing output dropped by 2.5 per cent after climbing 11.4 per cent the year before. The industrial recession - which is likely to continue into the new financial year - was caused by the impact of high interest rates, curbs on imports because of balance of payments pressures, and the sluggishness of world markets. The survey shows that imports in dollar terms fell by 17 per cent in 1991-1992 while exports fell by 6 per cent. As a result the trade deficit narrowed to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 5.9bn in 1990-91. One of the most encouraging signs in the survey is a build-up in foreign exchange reserves which have climbed to Dollars 4.4bn from a low point of Dollars 1.1bn (equivalent to two week's imports) at the end of June. Most of the increase comes from fresh lending by multilateral institutions. The survey shows how close India came to default on its external debt last year. Unable to obtain fresh commercial borrowings abroad, it suffered a net outflow of Dollars 952m between April and June from expatriate Indians taking out their non-resident deposits. The survey says that the net outflow of non-resident deposits only came to a stop in January. The Finance Ministry's survey of the economy tracks its failure so far to achieve a substantial reduction in the inflation rate which touched a peak of 16.7 per cent in August but has fallen since then to 12 per cent. Money supply growth (M3) for the year is likely to end up at 15 per cent above the previous year, and two percentage points above target. This reflects both continuingly high net government borrowing from the Central Bank and the build-up of the foreign exchange reserves.</p>

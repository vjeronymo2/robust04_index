In connection with overnight repurchase agreement transactions pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement, FNBC will maintain at all times during operation of the ``sweep'' program in a segregated sub-custodian account in the name of each Fund collateral comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds valued at least equal to the Required Collateral Amount. In addition, FNBC or its affiliates will transfer such collateral through the book entry system of the Federal Reserve and, in connection therewith, the Fund's sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department will be designated by Fedwire as the recipient of such securities and FNBC's internal records and written confirmations will indicate that the collateral is being held on behalf and in such Fund's name. The relevant Fund thereby will acquire a security interest in the collateral. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Before any transaction may be conducted pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain such information as it deems necessary to determine that the price test set forth below has been satisfied. Before any repurchase agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements comparable to the type of repurchase agreement involved (including size, which would be at least equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount, maturity and collateral), except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required. In addition, the transactions for which quotations are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements in which the funds would be transferred by the participating Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into, and then returned by the counterparty on the following day. Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption, a determination will be required in each instance, based upon the information available to the participating Fund and FNBC, that the income to be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other dealers from which quotes were obtained. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

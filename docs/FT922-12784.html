			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: Musical life in Prague What used to be forbidden is now de rigueur. What was available before has lost much of its value. It has been a classic case of over-reaction. Never mind the quality, Prague is gorging itself on musical freedom after 40 years of rigid Communist control. Money and experience may be lacking in the new era of market-led culture, but there is no shortage of activity and enthusiasm. Before the revolution, there were two concert agencies. Now there are 65. Three years ago, Prague had an average monthly total of 90 concerts. Now there are 240. Five societies for contemporary music have sprung up. Just like the stall-owners hawking their wares on Wenceslas Square, the music market has become overcrowded. Sooner or later the market will decide who survives. But for the time being, now the initial shock of freedom has passed, everyone is joining in the free-for-all, an indiscriminate scramble for audiences, publicity, money, kudos, status. The old imposed rules are gone, along with huge state subsidies. Self-help is the order of the day. Particularly striking is the way western Europe has become the unchallenged role-model. The Prague Spring Festival, formerly a showcase for East European state culture, is this year dominated by high-earning western artists. The Smetana Theatre, newly divorced from the monolithic National Theatre, has virtually wiped Czech works from the repertory and renamed itself the Prague State Opera. It has held its first opera ball, now advertises performances with a yellow airship-balloon, and has ventured into the high-risk business of gala performances. The assumption is that it can sell out Tosca with Mara Zampieri and Neil Shicoff at some 15 times normal seat prices  - all a far cry from the days when the red star hung above the proscenium. In an atmosphere of public acrimony, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra has removed Jiri Belohlavek as chief conductor and elected a German, Gerd Albrecht, in his place  - the first non-Czech to hold the post. It could turn out to be an expensive mistake, for the orchestra's home-grown Czech tradition was always its unique selling-point for foreign tour promoters and record companies. Even in Prague, the orchestra has discovered the downside to its new autonomy: the renovation of its historic home, the Rudolfinum (due to be re-opened on May 14), has cost three times more than estimated. What no-one expected was that Prague should prove so immediately attractive for foreign musicians. Little-known western conductors and stage directors are accepting low pay in return for valuable experience. Several Georgian and Ukrainian artists fleeing from poverty and instability in the former Soviet empire have also picked up contracts, often with higher salaries but no greater talent than their Czech colleagues. There are plenty of other anomalies. Supraphon, the state recording company, has produced 20 CD issues in the past three years  - but they have made little or no impact in Prague shops, because Supraphon's local distribution network has disappeared. The Prague Symphony Orchestra, overshadowed by the Czech Philharmonic for most of its 60-year history, has begun to cut a more confident profile at home and abroad  - but salaries are still only two-thirds of the senior orchestra. 'People here don't earn a lot, but they have faith in the future,' says the orchestra manager, Roman Belor. 'We believe Prague is the hidden treasure of Europe.' So, despite inflationary pressures and uncertainty over privatisation, the underlying atmosphere is positive. Czech emigres such as the conductor Martin Turnovsky have found a new lease of life, using hard-won experience from 20 years' exile for the benefit of Prague's music institutions. The main orchestras have given overdue recognition to composers such as Jan Klusak and Petr Eben, whose careers had fallen foul of Communism. The two leading opera companies have proved adept at tapping the pockets of foreign visitors, thanks to improved marketing and a conversion to original-language performance. The quality of singing and staging still leaves much to be desired  - but after a period of administrative chaos, operatic life is booming. The latest crop of productions offers a mirror of Prague's current artistic health. The particular attraction of the Zemlinsky double-bill at the State Opera is its link with the past: it was performed in the same building (Prague's former German theatre) where Zemlinsky spent 16 fruitful years as music director before and after the First World War. His one-act operas Eine florentinische Tragodie and Der Geburtstag der Infantin are typical of the exotic repertory preferred by the State Opera's dynamic young director, Karel Drgac, whose staging was both honest and unpretentious. In the first work, a tale of medieval blood-lust, the claustrophobia of the Mediterranean night air was particularly well realised. The conductor Hilary Griffiths ensured that the rich Straussian orchestra was heard to stupendous effect  - so much so that it drowned the three singers. The other work  - Zemlinsky's portrait of a heartless princess and a heart-broken dwarf  - packs a much stronger punch, and offers plum parts to its principal soprano and tenor, impressively sung by Zora Jehlickova and Peter Svensson. Otello was an equally ambitious undertaking but much less successful. The staging by the Swiss director Dominik Neuner was arty and artificial, and the cast (including the black American tenor Moises Parker and a Ukrainian soprano, Tereza Slupska) were left in a dramatic vacuum. Only the Iago  - the Czech baritone Ivan Kusnjer  - was a proper match for his part. The performance was saved by the conducting of Martin Turnovsky, who inspired the orchestra to rare heights of flexibility, precision and dynamic shading. Orchestra and conductor were also the saving grace of the National Theatre's new production of La boheme. Oliver von Dohnanyi, who has recently made some well-noticed visits to Britain, supervised a brisk, shapely account, full of verve, catching all the climaxes on the cusp. The cast worked like an ensemble, their well-characterised spontaneity partly compensating for a crass production by the German stage director Franz Winter. Helena Kaupova's matronly Mimi had the best voice of the evening. The most exciting stage personality was Natalja Melnik, who turned Musetta into a sexy man-eater in black suspenders.</p>

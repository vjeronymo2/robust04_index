			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: The truth behind Wonderland - Jackie Wullschlager explores the dark side of Lewis Carroll as a new play opens in London A hundred years ago, an Oxford don asked a mother if he might photograph her three daughters. 'What I like best of all,' he wrote, 'is to have two hours of leisure time before me, one child to photograph and no restrictions as to costume . . . I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked (but, if the worst comes to the worst, and you won't concede any nudities, I think you ought to allow all three to be done in bathing drawers, to make up for my disappointment).' This was Lewis Carroll, a respected academic, addressing the prim wife of another Oxford fellow. Was the famous children's writer a Victorian innocent, or was he a 19th-century Humbert Humbert, driven by forbidden desires, drawing the guileless into his web? Tomorrow, Alice's Adventures Under Ground, a new play about the darker side of the great storyteller, opens at the National Theatre. Written by Christopher Hampton, author of the successful 1980s drama Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and directed by the radical choreographer Martha Clarke, it is based on intimate letters and diaries and fixes on Carroll's own dangerous liaisons with little girls. This is the most sensational aspect of Carroll's life. Biographers have always fought shy of it, while passages in Carroll's diary casting light on the troubled side of such friendships were altered or torn out after his death. But it is an issue which not only lies at the heart of the creation of the Alice books. It also raises topical questions about what makes adults write children's books at all, and about how adult fantasies mould a society's vision of childhood, and so condition children's rights and lives. Carroll grew up in the 1830s, when the Victorian cult of childhood was beginning to grip the nation. It was an English phenomenon - compare the simpering innocence of Dickens's girl heroines, or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, or Little Buttercup with their worldly European counterparts like Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, Carmen - and it was rooted in Victorian repression of sex. This made pre-sexual girls an obvious focus. Many famous Victorians fell for them - Ruskin wrote love letters to a nine-year-old, the vicar-diarist Francis Kilvert rhapsodised about girlish thighs and buttocks, and Lewis Carroll was fixated with little Alice Liddell. In our post-Freudian age, the sexual undercurrents seem blatant and these friendships unhealthy. The truth was more ambiguous. A man like Carroll loved children instead of women because they were safely pure and thus sexually undemanding. He found in them a focus for emotional satisfaction which never threatened his ideal of chastity. His love probably had something of the sexual frisson of a schoolgirl crush; it fuelled the imagination but was never meant to be realised. Carroll turned his obsession into a new form of literature. For Alice Liddell, he wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and gave it to her for Christmas 1865. It was a hit in the nursery because it was funny, amoral and dismissive of adults. It was a hit with parents because it recreated the lost imagination of childhood. These two features made it the first children's classic. Its mix of subversion and nostalgia has shaped every children's book written since. Carroll was a stuttering bachelor mathematician whom a buttoned-up society pushed into real eccentricity. He was thin as a stick and stiff as a poker, he said and ate little, and listed his faults as 'indulging in sleep in the evening'. He fled instantly from any gathering where his children's books were mentioned, yet spent several weeks a year on the beach at Eastbourne, carrying a supply of safety pins with which to persuade pre-pubescent girls to hitch up their skirts and paddle in the sea. Carroll disciplined his emotional self into non-existence, then poured his vengeful frustration into fantasy. The Alice books, where an untouchable little girl keeps aloof from the threats of sensuous, violent, uncontrollable figures like the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, depend on a distaste for sexuality. The dream of the Wonderland garden suggests a guilt-free Eden before the Fall. After Carroll, these echoes began to sound through children's books and give the genre its mythic, lasting appeal. By the 1900s Freudian undertones came close to the surface. Peter Pan is about the triumph of a sexless boy over the masculine, virile Captain Hook, marked by the phallic symbols of twitching iron hook and fat cigar. Barrie, too, liked children, not women; his marriage was unconsumated and his Neverland, where no one grows up, is another prelapsarian wonderland. So is the riverbank of The Wind in the Willows: Kenneth Grahame told president Roosevelt that the book was 'clean of the clash of sex'. By the 1950s, the cult of children was being replaced by the cult of adolescence, but Carroll's Victorian idealisation of childhood still held sway. A novel like Lolita is a teenage descendant of Alice in the aura of innocence surrounding the abused heroine, in the surreal wonderland of American highways and motels, in Nabokov's wordplay. After the Bible and Shakespeare, Carroll is the most quoted author in English. His letters to little girls are little-known, but their liquid flow of emotion and badgering sentiment - 'I send you seven kisses, to last a week'; 'Haven't I a right to be affectionate if I like?' - complement the rigour of Alice. They suggest the link between adult fantasies and fears, and great children's writing. Martha Clarke has long specialised in evoking the world of fantasy, and theatre, which can more effectively win sympathy for different perspectives, is perhaps a better place than biography to explore this touchy side to Carroll's story. In Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Hampton staged a historical reconstruction which also reflected the pleasure-seeking, 1980s me-generation. Alice's Adventures Under Ground - Carroll's original title, rejected because it sounded like 'a lesson book about mines' - is just right for the self-doubting, child-obsessed politically correct 1990s. It should provoke, as Liaisons did, literary, historical and social debate. *Jackie Wullschlager's book 'Inventing Wonderland', about the lives of Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, will be published by Methuen next spring.</p>

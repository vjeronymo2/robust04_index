			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRESIDENT'S DRUG PLAN;  </P> <P> 'TAKE DOWN' SECURITY GUARD;  </P> <P> L.A. OFFICERS FORGO SPEECH FOR THE STREETS  </P> <P> Half an hour before President Bush began his speech, a Los Angeles Police  undercover team arrested two crack dealers at a mini-mall a mile north of  downtown, along with a third suspect, who surprised even veteran officers.  </P> <P> "We took down a security guard," detective J. R. Thomas said. "The guy was  watching the dope" -- serving as a lookout for the dealers.  </P> <P> The police radio squawked. Two plainclothes policewomen had made a buy at  another mini-mall at 6th and Bonnie Brae streets. Thomas rushed off to check it  out.  </P> <P> By the time Bush started talking about "the greatest domestic threat facing our  nation," a black woman in a straw hat was handcuffed and sprawled against a  detectives' car at the second mini-mall and a Latino man about 30 was being led  out of a pool hall by officers in blue L.A.P.D. Windbreakers.  </P> <P> Soon two young white men would be under arrest as well -- for trying to buy $8  worth of crack.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Reason for Optimism  </P> <P> While President Bush was outlining his $7.9-billion "National Drug Control  Strategy," the team of about two dozen police officers was at work among the  realities of the crack problem in one of the nation's hardest hit cities. The  evening on the streets would provide ample evidence of a problem cutting across  racial and ethnic lines and give them little reason for optimism in any  "comprehensive strategy" from the highest levels of government.  </P> <P> "I don't know that we can do anything with these people -- the adults," Thomas  said as his officers drove off with three carloads of accused dealers and  users. "Maybe if we start with the young ones. But it will take a considerable  amount of time. Years."  </P> <P> Indeed, throughout the Los Angeles area, it had been a busy day in the drug  wars.  </P> <P> In the morning, Glendale police announced the arrests of eight suspected  Colombian traffickers, including a 71-year-old woman, and the seizure of more  than 1,200 pounds of cocaine, most of it hidden in vaults under a false living  room floor in a Monterey Park house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyer's Car Seized  </P> <P> And in a news conference on the roof of Parker Center police headquarters  downtown, Mayor Tom Bradley showed off a late-model Mercedes-Benz that was  seized from a lawyer who allegedly tried to buy $50 in rock cocaine.  </P> <P> Later, Bradley had both praise and criticism for the Bush speech.  </P> <P> "We'll take anything we can get," he said. "The fact that the President has  offered what appears to be a comprehensive attack is heartwarming."  </P> <P> But, "clearly, it is not enough," the mayor said.  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp similarly credited Bush with being "right  on target," but he added that the President's strategy "doesn't go far enough  to help us in California."  </P> <P> He likened California to a man whose house is burning down and Bush to the  neighbor who offers help with a garden hose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lobby for More U.S. Aid  </P> <P> Since the start of the year, Los Angeles area officials have lobbied for more  federal aid, chiefly by spotlighting the city's growing role as a  drug-trafficking center.  </P> <P> In January, federal and local narcotics agents in Los Angeles announced that  they had seized more than $100 million in cash in 1988. It was the first time  more cash was seized here than in Miami, although police in Miami had  confiscated a greater quantity of cocaine.  </P> <P> In April, the heads of the Los Angeles offices of the FBI, Drug Enforcement  Administration, U.S. Customs Service and other agencies joined county officials  in complaining of an East Coast bias in allocation of federal drug-fighting  funds. They said that it was the creation of a federally sponsored South  Florida task force in 1982 that had prompted Colombian drug kingpins to bring  much of their cocaine directly into California.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles campaign got a boost early last month, when a report by U.S.  Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh described an alliance between the Colombian drug  cartels and Los Angeles street gangs, which were said to be distributing crack  cocaine to every corner of the nation. Southern California was also portrayed  as home to clandestine labs producing 80% of the country's PCP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call Bush Plan Inadequate  </P> <P> Even before Bush's speech, local officials were calling the federal plan  inadequate.  </P> <P> Twice in recent weeks, Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate in the 1990  gubernatorial race, has promoted his own operation CrackDown to add more than  200 state drug agents and analysts, saying that "we can no longer wait for  federal action."  </P> <P> He said he was told that California will receive $40 million to $60 million  through the Bush program, which he called "a drop in the bucket." No  allocations of funds for local jurisdictions were announced.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp and Bradley came in for criticism themselves from Los Angeles  County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who was among a group of officials briefed  in the White House by Bush and William J. Bennett, the director of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.  </P> <P> "One is running for governor," Antonovich noted, adding that Bradley and the  Los Angeles City Council have shown "a lack of leadership in addressing the  crime needs of the citizens" by failing to increase the size of the Los Angeles  police force since 1974.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Praises President  </P> <P> Antonovich lauded Bush, however, for recognizing that "police can't do  everything" and for indicating that the drug fight "is going to require in our  schools that values are taught and that our families and religious communities  have a responsibility."  </P> <P> Detective Thomas' crew on the streets missed the speech.  </P> <P> They had made 14 arrests on the shift, starting at MacArthur Park, then moving  to surrounding areas when word spread of the police presence. First they would  arrest the crack dealers at a spot, then station undercover officers there to  wait for customers to approach them to buy drugs.  </P> <P> As Bush was saying, "if you're a parent, talk to your kids," the officers were  questioning the two final suspects of the shift, the two young white men, one  23, the other 20.  </P> <P> "How did you know to come here?" one of the officers asked the 23-year-old, a  construction worker from Canyon Country.  </P> <P> "A friend in Echo Park showed us this place, sir," he said. "We were going to  get just $8 worth, sir."  </P> <P> "How long you been smoking?"  </P> <P> "Half a dozen times."  </P> <P> "Half a dozen times too many," said a policewoman as the men were led off.  </P> <P> Said detective Bob Freet: "Now that we've totally eliminated narcotics from the  Free World, let's go home."  </P></p>

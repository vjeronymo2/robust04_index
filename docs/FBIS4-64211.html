			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Beaumont and Paul Beaver: "RAF Set To Quit </F> Germany"]    [Text] Senior officers and planners in the RAF [Royal Air  Force] have given their support to a money-saving plan to pull  all British combat aircraft and helicopters out of Germany,  ending a presence stretching back almost half a century.    The proposal -- contained in confidential six-page document  seen by THE OBSERVER -- is the most radical to emerge from a  series of 33 defence studies aimed at reducing the 24 billion  pounds sterling defence expenditure by 1 billion pounds sterling  over the next three years.    THE OBSERVER understands that if the plan wins ministerial  and Cabinet approval the squadrons would pull out of Germany by  April 1996, the deadline for the latest round of defence cuts  known as `Front Line First'.    Sources say the proposal has already cleared its first  hurdle, gaining the reluctant acceptance of senior members of  the Air Staff as the least painful option in the face of the  threat of `acute cuts'.    One source said: `Senior officers I have spoken to have  given  their support to this plan. The feeling is that there is no  downside to this proposal except in conditions of service for  RAF personnel.'    NATO would have no power of veto, although it would probably  insist that the withdrawn squadrons remain earmarked for NATO  operations. RAF sources emphasised that fighters could defend  NATO's eastern borders just as effectively from bases in Britain  as from bases in Germany.    Disclosure of the plan to leave Germany -- which would see  the withdrawal of almost 80 fighter aircraft and 6,000 personnel  -- is the latest in a series of leaks on deliberations over the  shape of Britain's armed forces, despite efforts to prevent word  getting out about possible cuts under consideration.    A wholesale RAF withdrawal would come after the United  States's decisions to scale back its military commitments in  Germany. It would also allow the closure of a number of British  airbases in Germany under the last round of cuts, Options for  Chance, particularly Laarbruch and Wildenrath.    Detailed discussions about the future of the RAF squadrons  in  Germany first emerged two years ago in the aftermath of the  collapse of communism.    According to one senior RAF source: ``It was a plan that  gained quite a head of steam when Germany was threatening to  pull out of the Eurofighter programme and there was a feeling we  sould be beastly to them. Then when relations with Chancellor  (Helmut) Kohl warmed it was quietly dropped.    ``Now it has been picked up again. The Treasury is keen  because of the money it will save. It is an expensive business  keeping the RAF overseas, and bringing them back to Britain  would help with foreign currency and the costs of keeping the  bases running and the families abroad.    ``As far as the RAF is concerned it would make sense as it  is  becoming more and more difficult to carry out low-flying  exercises in Germany because of local protests, and it would  take the pressure off other areas of spending.    ``In terms of the international situation, things have come  on a long way since the reunification of Germany and there is a  feeling that if we did need to go back it would not be that  difficult.''    The biggest problem facing the RAF would be where to put the  returning aircraft and personnel, with British bases already  overstretched.    The review of the RAF's overseas commitments follows  pressure  to reduce the overall number of front-line squadrons by 15 per  cent to around 22 squadrons.    Under the proposal, the remaining squadrons would be  increased from 12 to 18 aircraft -- the NATO standard size for a  squadron.    There is a widespread belief in both the Treasury and in the  other services that the RAF -- which escaped the worst of the  cuts suffered by the Army and the Navy in Options for Change --  is vulnerable.</p>

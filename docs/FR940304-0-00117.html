			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters (mainly the primary petroleum refining industry) stated that if EPA chose to list used oil as hazardous waste, the Agency should exempt used oil that is reintroduced into the refinery process from hazardous waste or used oil management standards requirements. Commenters further stated that if EPA did not adopt this exemption, the entire refinery process could be subject to hazardous waste management requirements, including permits. Commenters stated that this would be unwarranted because the reintroduction of used oil into the refining process contributes only insignificant concentrations of metals to the crude oil or finished petroleum product. Other commenters stated that refiners that handle used oil should be subject to the same requirements for used oil management as are used oil re-refiners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters from the primary petroleum refining industry also stated that EPA should not limit the exemption to those instances where used oil is inserted before fluid catalytic cracking or distillation, since other conversion and distillation processes in the refinery would also remove, alter or immobilize impurities in the oil. They asserted that limiting the point of insertion could foreclose the future development of used oil recycling activities. These commenters also stated that limiting the insertion point could preclude refineries from accepting DIY oil. Commenters asserted that DIY oil might have to undergo certain pre-processing at refineries prior to its insertion into the refining process. They also asserted that under the proposed exemption, this pre-processing would not be exempt and would be a hazardous waste activity. Commenters stated that these activities are part of the refining process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters from the primary petroleum industry further stated that EPA should extend the exemption to apply to used oil inserted into the pipeline at marketing, E&amp;P and pipeline facilities for use in the refinery process. They asserted that used oil recovered from oil and gas exploration and production is placed in pipelines and trucks and returned to the refinery from other petroleum facilities. Commenters stated that the recovered oils are useful, valuable raw materials that are reintroduced into the crude stream for their economic value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analysis of New Part 279 Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 10, 1992, EPA promulgated a final listing decision for used oils that are recycled and simultaneously promulgated standards in 40 CFR part 279 for the management of used oil under RCRA section 3014. Under &sect;279.10(g) of part 279, EPA granted an exemption for used oils introduced directly into crude oil pipelines from part 279 standards at the point at which they are introduced. EPA did not address the proposed exemptions for used oil inserted into the petroleum refining facility process either prior to or after crude distillation or catalytic cracking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Brussels holds up state aid to Bull The European Commission yesterday called on the French government to freeze a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) capital injection for Bull, the loss-making computer group, or face action in the European Court of Justice. The French government and Bull's management expressed their determination to restructure and privatise the computer group. Bull said that a rationalisation plan, aimed at returning the group to 'financial health' was being finalised and would be presented to the Commission. Once it has received official notice of the Commission's decision, the French government will have 30 days to present the plan. The Commission's inquiry into Bull was triggered by a payment of FFr2.5bn to the company in February last year by the previous French government. But Brussels yesterday extended the inquiry to include pledges of capital totalling FFr8.6bn from the government and France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group, made at the end of last year. It is the final FFr2.5bn tranche of that capital injection which the Commission wants suspended. The Commission said that information received last December from the French government, following the announcement of the new capital increase, was 'composed of a series of declarations of intent and of goals which do not constitute a restructuring plan'. French officials argue that Bull needs time and the capital injections to restructure. 'My feeling is that the blocking of the FFr2.5bn would prevent progress at the company and I ask for the same treatment as obtained by Ekostahl in Germany and the Italian steel industry,' said Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French business daily. 'Bull is like a liner, not a bicycle and therefore the negotiation of bends takes a bit longer than one would hope,' said Mr Longuet. Bull said that its recovery plan, which involves cost cutting and a reorganisation of management is already bringing improvement and that sales are also stabilising. Separately, the Commission has opened an investigation into subsidies granted by the city-state of Bremen in Germany to the Klockner steel-mill. The Commission says most of a DM250m cash injection to the company will come from public funds, because state holding companies are part of a consortium planning to buy the mill.</p>

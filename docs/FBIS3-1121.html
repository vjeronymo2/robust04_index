Roderick] </F>   [Text] Vryheid March 19 SAPA -- The government has rejected  the idea of a sovereign Zulu Kingdom, SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported on Saturday [19  March]. Speaking in Vryheid, Constitutional Development Minister  Roelf Meyer said there had to be a role for the Zulu king and  his kingdom in a new dispensation, but not specifically as a  monarchy.    Mr Meyer said the new constitution provided for  Natal/kwaZulu  to govern itself but warned that the government would not  tolerate intimidation against voting in kwaZulu/Natal.</p>

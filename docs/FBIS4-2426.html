			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced  plans to bar ROC [Republic of China] investors, for the time  being, from sinking further amounts of capital into the  development of industrial parks in the mainland. The general  disgust with conditions on the mainland enlisted by the boat  tragedy may furnish the harsh warning ROC economic planners have  been looking for to cool mainland investment fever.</p>

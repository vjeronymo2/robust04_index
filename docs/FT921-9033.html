			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: The Creation - Royal Festival Hall The heading above is not accidental. Although the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Chorus and Orchestra have recently returned from giving performances of Haydn's oratorio in Germany, they performed it there in English, which may have surprised audiences accustomed to hearing the piece as Die Schopfung. There are no great claims for authenticity to be made on this matter. A text in English was the spur for the oratorio's composition, but it was the German version, adapted and translated by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, that Haydn set to music. Performances in English (a re-translation back from van Swieten's German) are an inessential by-product of the work's history. Unless the singers' use of the language gives new insights. At Tuesday's performance we had the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson, an artist one is always glad to see on stage, but not often as welcome as he was here. For not only did the make the English text come alive; he was the only participant who really wanted to put across the character of Haydn's score. Every phrase added something, down to the little aside 'He made the stars also', sung with a twinkle in the eye that was delicious humour and wonderment, all in one. The other two soloists were Amanda Roocroft and Michael George, a mostly appealing duo in this music, especially Miss Roocroft, whose youthfully radiant voice makes her one of the brightest hopes among British singers of the younger generation. But they did not take the opportunity to impart any new or deeper meaning through the words. Unfortunately it was not that kind of evening. Neville Marriner has long ago settled what the classical style generally means to him and draws from his ASMF Chorus and Orchestra performances of high technical quality according to those precepts. Put in front of him a score which goes beyond the basic classical gestures, as The Creation does with its musical pictures, its humour, its reaching-out towards real profundity, and almost everything that matters about the work passes him by. The warning signs came early on. When the choir intoned those magical words 'And there was light', the effect was neat, clipped - and absolutely trite. Haydn's unique masterpiece was about to be despatched, with verve and marvellous accuracy and unfailing tonal beauty. But despatched it was all the same.</p>

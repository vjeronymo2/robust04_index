			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>   [Text] Brazilian foreign policy is bound by the permanent  doctrines and principles specified in the Constitution. The  central characteristics of our foreign affairs activities can be  summarized in the following basic objectives: to pursue national  development, establish democratic values, defend international  peace and security, and struggle for a politically fairer  international economic order.    The illusion that a new order has been created following the  end of the Cold War, fortunately, is already been discarded. We  are living a period of transition between two structures -- like  so many other times in history -- and it is difficult to  forecast how long it will last. The most marked characteristics  of this period can be concocted into unsteadiness between  political hegemony -- which is currently concentrated in a  single center -- and economic hegemony which is concentrated  into at least three centers. Another characteristic is the  revival of conflicts based on cultural and ethnical differences,  although this sort of conflict seems to have already been  forgotten.    As it is well known, changes in the international order  present risks and opportunities. Brazil's role in the new  international order is still in the "pending" tray. In face of  the frequently mentioned dichotomies between globalism and  regionalism, we must consider a basic surmise: As a result of  its size, its complexity, its social fabric, the ethnical and  cultural composition of its population, and the diversification  of its trade partners, Brazil must have a foreign policy with  universalist characteristics and discard the possibility of  making exclusivist options. This, however, does not prevent our  policy from having priorities and different emphases. I will  refer to some of them.    The first priority that comes to our minds is South America  where we have been intensifying contact with our neighbor  countries. The consolidation of democracy in the continent has  facilitated the materialization of informal mechanisms of  political consultation -- such as the Rio Group -- and  stimulated the adoption of measures to overcome old suspicions  and antagonisms.    In the regional sphere, we are decisively engaged in an  ambitious project to consolidate integration within the  framework of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur], with any  corrections that may prove necessary. The implementation of the  zero-customs tax within Mercosur continues to advance as  foreseen, with a strong positive impact on trade among the four  countries. Trade among these countries has increased virtually  300 percent since the Asuncion Treaty was signed in 1991.    The Mercosur priority is complemented with two initiatives  launched during Itamar Franco's administration: First, to  negotiate a series of accords for economic complementation with  the countries of the Amazon region and, second, a proposal for  the establishment of a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA),  which will comprise the countries that make up Mercosur, the  Andean Group, and the Amazon Initiative, plus Chile. This way,  a free trade zone will be established in South America before  the year 2005. These initiatives, to which our main regional  partners have reacted positively, encompass realistic  alternatives to improve the competitiveness of our industries in  a way that will not contradict the goal of implementing a  zero-customs tax system internationally. This does not preclude  the possibility of uniting, at the right moment, all other South  American integration processes.    It is especially important for Brazil, with its diversified  trade profile, to strengthen the multilateral trade system in  open and flexible patterns. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round  of the GATT, the final act on which will be signed in a few  weeks, has opened to Brazil auspicious prospects, although some  results, not specially satisfactory, have been registered in  certain areas. These prospects are particularly auspicious  because the decisions made in relation to regulations -- such as  safeguards, the solution of controversial matters, and  antidumping [preceding word in English] measures -- will  noticeably reduce the chances of establishing protectionist and  unilateral measures.    In the multilateral plan, we will continue to energetically  defend the need to reform the UN Charter and increase the number  of permanent seats at its Security Council, on which Brazil is  again occupying a non-permanent seat, to grant it more  representativity and legitimacy without harming its efficiency.  Thus the imbalance between developing and developed countries  that currently exists in the United Nations will be reduced. In  view of its size and influence in the regional and international  scenarios, Brazil has often been considered a natural candidate  for an additional seat on the Security Council. Brazil has  actively participated in debates and discussions about this  issue within the specific framework of the United Nations, as  well as in bilateral political contacts with our main partners.    The foreign policy implemented by Itamar Franco's  administration obviously cannot overlook our relations with  developed countries. It is of extreme importance to intensify  and diversify our relations with these countries -- the United  States, the European Union, and Japan -- because they represent  invaluable sources of investment and technological know-how, as  well as impressive markets for our products. The key word in  this context is negotiation. For a country such as ours, the  possibility of signing "compulsory support contracts [contratos  de adesao]" is "initially" excluded. The progress made in our  relations with the United States (over intellectual property)  and with Germany (nuclear area) illustrates the determination  with which this priority is being pursued.    In addition to confirming the importance of our relations  with Portugal, the initiative to institutionalize the Community  of Portuguese Speaking Countries is a natural result of the  priority we have always given to relations with the African  Continent. Based on this and the geographic link -- the South  Atlantic -- which connects us to Portuguese-speaking African  countries, Brazilian diplomacy plans to dedicate special  attention to the other countries in southern Africa, where a  large part of the continent's economic, trade, and financial  resources are concentrated.    Now that opportunities have been opened by this series of  profound changes, we must be attentive and actively participate  in everything relevant to the formulation of a new international  order. Brazil certainly has a role to play in the construction  of this new order, through the defense of an effective  democratization of international relations, the prevalence of  multilateralism in the political and economic spheres, the  legitimate right of the developing countries to have access to  the so-called "sensitive" high technology as long as it is used  for peaceful objectives, and the inclusion of the right to  development among the priority topics of the international  agenda. We must not limit ourselves to adopting attitudes that  are merely a reaction to agendas drafted abroad, but to be in a  position to define our own foreign affairs agenda.</p>

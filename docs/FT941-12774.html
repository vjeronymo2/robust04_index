			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Public business Inadequate financial controls, failure to comply with rules, poor management of projects and an absence of clear lines of accountability. These would be damaging criticisms if made about the conduct of business in the private sector. When made of the UK public service, they are devastating. Yet these criticisms - and many others - were made yesterday by the Commons Public Accounts Committee in a report on the conduct of organisations which consume public funds. The report draws on 17 studies over the past four years into serious failures in the stewardship of public money. These range from the provision of official cars to executives without requiring them to pay for private motoring to the loss of at least Pounds 20m on a computer project for the Wessex regional health authority. It would be tempting to blame such failures on the management changes in the public services introduced by the present government. Much of the work of delivering public services has been handed over to executive agencies and quangos, under looser Whitehall control. Private contractors have been brought in to do large parts of the work of the health service, central government and local authorities. Public sector managers are being encouraged to break away from bureaucratic administration and manage their services more entrepreneurially. By moving away from top-down administration, such reforms open up opportunities for weakening control over public money. The standards of equity and probity required in handling taxpayers' money can be easily forgotten - especially when managers are brought in from outside the public service. Conflicts of interest, inadequate oversight and ineffective monitoring can all result when bureaucracy is swept away. Yet none of these outcomes is inevitable with public service reform, as the committee's report notes. The many successful examples of public sector reform demonstrate that traditional standards of public business do not need to be sacrificed to pursue efficiency and effectiveness. According to the report, no new rules are needed: the problems arise when existing rules are breached. Such breaches are more likely when management change is driven through with excessive haste. This leads to neglect of proper controls and accountability. And it puts responsibility into the hands of staff who have not acquired the necessary financial training and experience. A more measured approach will in the end achieve better results and avoid discrediting reform. But the importance of scrutiny and oversight is also a clear message of the report. The Public Accounts Committee's writ should be extended to all bodies which largely depend on public money for their income, including the growing numbers of quangos which have assumed much of the responsibility for spending public money.</p>

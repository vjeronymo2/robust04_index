			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent a letter to U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and Jacques Delors,  chairman of the EU Ministerial Council. In it Izetbegovic  demands that the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] be  included in the liaison group for Bosnia as an equal partner.    Turkish President Demirel called President Izetbegovic over  the phone, congratulating him on reaching an accord to establish  the Bosniak-Croatian federation. Turkey believes that this is a  very important step toward peace which should in the future  engage the Serbian side also, said President Demirel, promising  that his country would continue to mediate in all initiatives  and actions that lead toward the end of bloodshed and  destruction of this country's economic base.</p>

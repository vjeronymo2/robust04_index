			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Theatre The posters are obscurely proclaiming Juliet 4 Romeo, and there are some ominous programme notes about the role of women. Do not be perturbed, however; the English Shakespeare Company's Romeo and Juliet, sponsored by IBM, turns out to be full of fun, not at all distorted and owes nothing to West Side Story. It is one of the most enjoyable that I have seen. Freshness abounds. Michael Bognadov's direction works by an accumulation of small touches. For examples, Julia Dearden's Nurse is young, attractive and very noticeably Irish, which adds a playful element to a part sometimes played by a woman too old. John Dougall's Mercutio is slightly Scottish with a fondness for the national drink as well as the Italian wine. Friar John, who has barely a couple of lines, seems to be Welsh. Christopher Saul's Friar Lawrence is firmly Oxford English, but also young. He rides an old-fashioned black lady's bicycle with a carrier basket in front and oils the chain himself. The only villain in the piece is Colin Farrell's Capulet whose English is pronouncedly north country and who thinks he can tell his daughter what to do. Peter Theiss's Tybalt is a tall, swaggering figure in purple trousers; the novelty is that he has a blonde at his side to show off to - she smokes his cheroot while he is handling his sword. Such innovations continue. The fight scene is a wonderful mixture of umbrellas, swords, punches and kicks, with a pause for a drink, but nothing shocking. When Juliet wants to prevent Romeo from leaving at dawn, she hides one of his boots under the pillow so that he has to touch her to retrieve it. There is an unobtrusive media presence on the morning that Paris is supposed to claim his bride. And when the Montagues and the Capulets are finally reconciled, a press photographer quietly takes pictures. The production is very simple. The ball scene is not spectacular, nor the tomb scene at the end. Bognadov dispenses with the traditional balcony and merely has Romeo on a perfectly safe pair of ladders while Juliet stands on a table. Unusually for our times, the sexual attraction between the lovers is not explicitly played up. They embrace, of course, but their rapport could be just as much cerebral as physical. Capulet is the odd man out. Not only does he sound as if he made money out of the industrial revolution; he is a bully and is none too gracious to his wife, let alone Juliet. Yet even he joins in the remorse at the end. For this is a production about basically nice people. There is not much passion, but there is a lot of entertainment. The use of the torches in a darkened theatre at the finish as the families of descend into the tomb is a flash of theatrical brilliance. Equally clever is is the dropping of much of the final scene where Friar Lawrence explains what has happened to an audience that already knows. Joe Dixon's Romeo and Joanna Roth's Juliet will go down as quiet lovers. They have the compensation of knowing that they are part of a production that provides great pleasure and does not overdo the melodrama. Maybe playing up the fun is the right way to do it. Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith until June 19. (081) 741 2311</p>

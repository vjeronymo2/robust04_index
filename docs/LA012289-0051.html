			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE SAVINGS SCANDAL'  </P> <P> The editorial "The Savings Scandal" (Jan. 12) is a well-intended analysis of  the crisis facing the federal deposit insurance system. However, the editorial  leaves the misguided impression that the nation's surviving, well-run savings  institutions have not paid their fair share in trying to resolve the funding  shortfall of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and that they can  afford to increase their support of the FSLIC. In fact, quite the opposite is  true.  </P> <P> Over the past two years, savings and loans have paid more than $4 billion in  special assessments to the FSLIC and had their investment of $823 million in  the FSLIC secondary reserve taken away by fiat. And through their ongoing  contributions to the FSLIC, the savings and loans are responsible for covering  FSLIC's recent outlay to resolve the worst problem cases.  </P> <P> The special assessment you suggest enlarging already causes thrifts to pay 2  1/2 times more for deposit insurance than commercial banks. This very special  assessment was responsible for pushing more than 100 otherwise healthy  institutions into insolvency in 1987.  </P> <P> Moreover, why should Great Western or Home Savings of America, two of the  strongest financial institutions in the nation, pay more for deposit insurance  than Bank of America or Continental Illinois? These and 2,000 other healthy  savings institutions in America continue to focus their lending activity on  residential mortgages, among the safest of all investments -- not loans to  foreign governments or to corporate raiders cashing in on the leveraged-buyout  craze.  </P> <P> Your conclusions, regrettably, are based on false assumptions. The broad  diversification of savings and loans away from their historic mortgage  financing function simply did not happen as you suggest. In fact, today only 2%  of savings and loan assets are in non-real estate commercial loans, while 62%  of assets are in residential mortgages -- a number that has not changed in  several years.  </P> <P> We also agree with you that there is no obligation to bail out investors,  stockholders or failed managers. The public obligation is to protect the  depositor, as the Congress has guaranteed.  </P> <P> The California League of Savings Institutions agrees with The Times that every  effort should be made to ensure that the crisis facing the federal deposit  insurance system is not allowed to occur again, and we are actively pursuing  every avenue to help resolve this crisis. We fundamentally believe, however,  that it is poor public policy -- and not in the public interest -- to break the  backs of healthy, profitable savings institutions to achieve this resolution.  </P> <P> PATRICK H. PRICE  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> California League of  </P> <P> Savings Institutions  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

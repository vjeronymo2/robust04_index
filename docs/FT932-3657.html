			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Fishing Property: Angling for a piece of river - Tom Fort muses on the possibilities of actually owning his own stretch of water I occasionally run through the following conversation. Fisherman One (myself); 'Oh, by the way, you must pop down to my water some time.' Fisherman Two (impressed.; 'Your water?' F1; 'Yes, it's quite a nice stretch. Nothing grand, of course, but there's usually a fair chance of a fish or two'. F2: 'Well, that's jolly kind of you. Any particular time?' F1: 'Any time you like, my dear fellow. That's the advantage of having your own water.' My tone of voice in this - sadly imaginary - exchange is modest and deprecating. But I would, perhaps, permit myself a certain emphasis on the words 'my water.' They do have a pleasing ring to them; or rather, I'm sure they would. However, in common with the great majority of anglers, l do not have 'my water'. Nor am l ever likely to. Nor, in my more rational moments, am I entirely sure I would like it so much. Yes, it could be satisfying to lord it over the less fortunate. But imagine if Fisherman Two, instead of gratefully accepting the offer, replied:'Awfully decent of you, but to be frank, nothing on earth would induce me to come to your water. It was never much good in the first place, what salmon do make it end up in poachers' larders, and - I know this hurts - you were done'. But it is a fact that plenty of anglers with money do like the idea. And what, above all, they want to spend their money is that diminishing, threatened miracle of salt and fresh water, the Atlantic salmon. Six years ago, I wrote an article for the FT about the value of Scottish salmon fishing. Then it was shooting upwards towards heights which were to be greeted with rage and disbelief by ordinary fishermen who found themselves increasingly excluded, and with hand-rubbing delight by owners and their agents. The value of a given stretch of salmon river is computed according to the number of fish caught on it, averaged over a five or ten-year period. In 1932, the value per fish was around Pounds 1500. So a beat with an average catch of 100 salmon could be expected to change hands for Pounds 150,000. By 1987, when I did my survey, it had reached Pounds 5000 per fish. 1989 saw it rocket above Pounds 8000. And by 1990 it had peaked in the region of Pounds 12,000 per fish (although there were instances on the Brora and the Beauly when it went higher). This dizzying appreciation transformed the traditional way in which salmon fishing was organised, which by and large had been through decorous and gentlemanly relationships between ancient families and long-established tenants. if you wished to fish the Spey, the Tweed or the Tay, you had to be the right sort and know the right sort, and be prepared to wait until a pair of dead man's shoes became empty. Then the money arrived. The owners of the estates through which the great rivers ran - always hard-pressed for cash - found themselves sitting on assets which were soaring in value. The old ways were abandoned as time share invaded; a system of financial exploitation which made it possible for the worth of those silver fish to be maximised to the last penny. Cash replaced social connections as the key to this promised land. It could not go one, of course. The recession came, then the Lloyds insurance market disaster. Leisure spending was an early casualty, and the decline in values and volume of business set in fast. Now a calm has settled on the Scottish market. The big deals are no longer being done. Take as an example the Ballathie Estate, north of Perth; 1500 acres, with a hotel, two country houses, a score of farms and 1 1/4 miles of prime double bank fishing on the Tay with a 650 fish annual average. Two years ago Strutt and Parker offered it at Pounds 10.5 m. Now it is down to Pounds 8m, and still there is no buyer. The problem is that salmon fishing no longer seems to have obvious business potential. The timeshare market is dead; unmourned by many, as its associations of frenzied sales techniques and faulty Spanish wiring hardly corresponded wIth the world of crusty lairds, monosyllabic gillies, and effortless Spey casting. With the absence of any prospect of swift and substantial return on investment, it means that likely buyers are restricted to those doubly blessed with a true enthusiasm for the fishing, and a great deal of money. Roving south, to the trout of the chalkstreams of England, things are also pretty quiet. Timeshare never established a grip on rivers like the Test, the Itchen and the Kennet, and the fishing tends to be in the hands of clubs or syndicates, or organised on a day ticket basis, with a few privileged private owners dotted about. The Test was once the finest of them all, and its fishing still commands prime prices, even though gross and careless exploitation has ruined much of it. The Itchen is a different matter, more cherished, more difficult, much nearer to the true chalkstream ideal. It is rare for any of it to come on the market, but Knight, Frank and Rutley is offering a gorgeous-looking 1 1/2 mile stretch of double bank fishing below Winchester. If I had somewhere near Pounds 500,000 I would be round there like a shot. A little way down the scale is Lambourn in Berkshire, a lovely stream much afflicted by abstraction. Strutt and Parker has two tempting stretches available, one of a little under half a mile at about Pounds 135,000 and another, somewhat shorter, which goes with a large, luxurious millhouse and 15 acres at Pounds 650,000. What I think I would like best of all - were my circumstances to undergo a considerable change - would be some fishing in Ireland. It has salmon rivers as good as Scotland's, and trout rivers better than England's. It was hardly touched by the salmon boom, the value per fish never rising beyond Pounds 2000. The problem with Ireland is that decent fishing almost never changes hands and when it does, it is by word of mouth. But it can be done. Finally, a cautionary tale, also from Ireland. A friend has a nice trout river across the fields from his house. One year, when I was there, he told me he had rented a mile or so at Pounds 50 a year. All for himself. I quivered with envy as he rolled the words 'my water' around his mouth. A while later, he told me that the woman with whom he had concluded his agreement, and to whom he had handed his Pounds 50, had no more title to the water than the Bishop of Galway. Such are the pitfalls.</p>

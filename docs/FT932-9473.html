			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: S African Breweries boosts income 6% SOUTH African Breweries, the country's largest consumer industrial company, increased attributable income by 6 per cent, from R779m to R825m (Dollars 260m) in the year to March. A good performance from the group's core beer interests - SAB is the seventh-largest brewer in the world - with attributable earnings rising by 16 per cent to R541m, was offset by a 10 per cent fall in earnings from non-beer activities to R284m. The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Most of the non-beer interests, including clothes retailing, textiles, furniture, electrical appliances, and non-alcoholic beverages, performed better than expected. OK Bazaars, however, the supermarket chain, made a R45m attributable loss of which about R31m was attributable to SAB. Mr Meyer Kahn, executive chairman, said the prolonged recession - a fall in GDP for 14 quarters - 'had devastated consumer spending and placed unprecedented pressure on SAB's widespread consumer goods interests'. Mr Kahn said the damage to the economy would take a considerable time to repair, with no real growth in consumer spending until well into 1994. But he predicted increased earnings and operating cash flows for the year ahead. Group turnover rose by 24 per cent to R21.8bn with 16 per cent coming from inclusion of the Plate Glass group for the first time. Trading profit rose by 21 per cent to R2.3bn, but higher tax held growth in after-tax profits to 15 per cent. With a higher number of shares in issue following the Plate Glass acquisition, earnings per share rose to 304 cents from 290 cents. The dividend was increased to 137 cents from 130 cents.</p>

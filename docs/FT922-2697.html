			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: Slovak Republic needs foreign investment to halt Czech split Sir, Your leader 'A state well worth saving' (June 9) highlighting the present instability in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) presented the case for EC intervention. It is important to assess carefully what form the assistance should take. Economic data reveal that encouraging more foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Slovak Republic (SR) should redress the imbalance in economic development since 1991 and arrest the Slovaks' desire for separation. The most striking difference in the economic data between the republics is in unemployment. In May the rate was 11.3 per cent in the SR and only 2.8 per cent in the Czech Republic (CR). In 1991 investment in the CSFR fell by 33.8 per cent, and the output of the primary and secondary sectors declined. The tertiary sector (banking, insurance, etc), however, grew significantly. The CR has suffered far less unemployment owing to the expanding tertiary sector, the reduction in transfers from the CR to the SR and to the bias in FDI to the CR, which receives at least 80 per cent of the total. A study on the relationship between the two republics by Ales Capek of the Institute of Economics, Prague, shows that economic conditions for the two republics in 1991 had no marked differences, except that the CR transferred large sums to the SR. The closeness of the CR to west European markets gives it an advantage in attracting FDI and cushioning transition costs. If the EC wishes to encourage stability and preserve the CSFR, then it should act very quickly to provide strong incentives for European companies to invest in the SR.

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Future of Digital's Irish and Scottish plants in the balance DIGITAL, the US computer maker, is thought likely to decide in the next few days whether a plant in Ireland or one in Scotland is to be the victim of retrenchment in its European computer manufacturing operations. The Massachusetts-based company is poised to decide between concentrating production of its new Alpha computers at its plant at Ayr in south-west Scotland or at Galway in western Ireland. It is likely that the plant which loses will be closed, and the winning plant might gain several hundred new jobs as work was transferred from one facility to the other. The company plans to reduce its worldwide payroll to about 90,000 from 108,500 at the end of last September. Both plants make mini-computers and personal computers. The Ayr facility employs 980 people and that in Galway some 1,200. Officials from Locate in Scotland, the inward-investment division of Scottish Enterprise, and from the Industrial Development Authority in Ireland have been in constant touch with Digital in the hope of swinging the decision in their favour. But there was no indication last night from Locate in Scotland that a decision in favour of Ayr was expected. The Irish authority said it would be 'a disaster' if Digital decided to pull out of Ireland. Digital is refusing to comment beyond repeating a statement issued in December that a review of European manufacturing which would involve redundancies was under way. The company said no decision would be announced this week. Other sources say that a decision will be made today and announced next Tuesday. Digital's plant at Ayr is regarded as one of the most successful and productive electronics factories operated by multinational companies in Scotland. Last year Digital opened a plant at South Queensferry near Edinburgh to make semiconductors. Both these factors make some industry observers believe that the decision between Galway and Ayr will go in Ayr's favour. The company was one of the first electronics companies to be established in Ireland. In the past two years, however, it has closed one plant and shed 300 jobs, and it is thought that its older VAX computer production line at Galway is the most likely to be axed.</p>

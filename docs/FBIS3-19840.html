			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Katarina Koivisto report: "Bright Future -- But Only Within </F> the EU"]    [Text] Joining the European Union [EU] is, from all points  of view, more advantageous for Finland than staying outside, if  one is to believe the studies presented yesterday.    These studies were commissioned by the government from  various research institutes, but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti  Salolainen (Conservative) was anxious to point out yesterday  that the conclusions are those of the institutions, not the  government.    EU membership will give new thrust to our economy and also  boost employment. The study, carried out by the Industrial  Research Institute [ETLA] on the economic effects of membership,  indicates that, outside the EU, Finland would become a marginal  region failing to attract many investors. Agriculture is  recognized as a problem sector, but the same would be true if  the country were to stay outside the EU. Integration is not a  decisive factor in regional policy. The proper efforts of  enterprises and the activities of the regions are more important.    The Foreign Policy Institute survey states that EU  membership  will not entail problems if Europe becomes integrated and a new  split into two parts can be avoided. But a new two-way split  could cause Finland problems if it is in the EU, but militarily  uncommitted.    Minister Salolainen denies that the government has attempted  to keep these studies secret or delay their publication. The  idea was only to obtain a sufficient amount of information about  the negotiation results to have a basis for the evaluation of  the studies.    Finnish membership in the EU will give a positive new thrust  to the country's economy. There will also be beneficial effects  on employment after a transitional period. Outside the EU,  Finland would become an economic fringe area in the far north,  from which foreign investors will shy away.    Those are the views that Industrial Research Institute  [ETLA]  Director Pentti Vartia outlined to the parliament on Monday [14  March] when he presented his researchers' reports on the subject  of Finland and the EU. Vartia points out that there are certain  economic differences between EEA [European Economic Area] and EU  membership. One of the main differences is that, as an EU  member, Finland must adapt to the EMU [European Monetary Union].  The consequences of this are currently being analyzed in detail  in a separate study. But the decision to opt for the EU has a  direct influence on businesses' inclination to invest; foreign  investments here began to pick up the moment Finland decided to  submit its application for membership. There are also direct  effects on trade policy. The EU is a customs union focusing on  a common trade policy, Vartia added.    He thinks that outside the EU, Finland would go back to its  old patterns, the current structural changes would come to a  halt, production and trade would focus on concentration more  than competition, and the agricultural sector would return to  its traditional forms of subsidy. ETLA's researchers point out  that, outside the Union, we would not have the same opportunity  to exert our influence as within. Trade and agriculture issues  would affect Finland even if we were to stay outside the Union.  As a member, at least we can make our voice heard and influence  decisions: "Finland's influence within the EU is much greater  than our size actually warrants," Vartia said. Membership is  more likely to strengthen than weaken our sovereignty. Vartia  stated that membership will actually cause only marginal changes  to economic policy. There will be costs due to our share of the  EU budget, but national and local budgets will remain the same.    Another consequence, if Finland were to stay outside the EU,  would be that we could not participate in the EMU which, Vartia  said, is a good anchor for economic policy. Within the EMU,  there are fixed currency exchange rates, which is of special  importance for smaller enterprises. EMU and a common currency  can however cause problems for Finland, Vartia said. Our  economy and the occasional disorders resulting from differences  between exports and the domestic cost level have hitherto  required measures such as currency rate adjustments.  <H5>  Shared interests </H5>   Only as a member of the Union can we ensure that Finnish  products have free access to the European market, ETLA's  researchers pointed out. Finland and the EU share the same  interests in the main areas of trade policy. The EU as a region  is far more protection-oriented than any of the individual  member countries, Vartia added. "Only membership can offer  Finland the opportunity of taking advantage of the Union's  support program for countries like Russia, for example. As a  member, we can get assistance with environmental projects in  neighboring regions and benefit from our position as a gateway  to the East," Vartia said.    Finnish taxation does not have to be changed if the country  becomes a member of the EU. The EU has no right to collect  taxes in individual member countries but it can propose measures  of harmonization. The decisions must, however, be unanimous and  Vartia gives greater credit to the prospect of fiscal  competition where member countries, rather than increasing  taxation, will vie for industries and manpower through lower  taxes.    ETLA also sees an improvement in the employment situation if  Finland joins the EU, rather than being content with EEA  membership. Lower prices and costs will boost employment and  improve our competitiveness, the reseach institute predicts.  The Union will not, however, influence Finnish social security.  What is true is that a country with a strong economy is in a  better position to ensure the social welfare of its population  than a poor one.</p>

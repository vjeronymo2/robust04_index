			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: The ethics of being an ethical investor - Serious Money A friend, revolted by the thought of eating meat, used to recount the drawbacks of being vegetarian. It was not so bad being challenged continually about his ethics, he used to say, but what he could not abide was being deliberately deceived. On a visit to a restaurant he often frequented, he asked if the mushroom quiche was vegetarian, and was reassured. But, after the first mouthful, he became suspicious; closer examination revealed it contained little cubes of ham. Investors in ethical companies and funds probably know the feeling. They may face opposition for bringing morality into the business of making money - attempts to launch an ethical unit trust early in the 1980s were refused at first by the Department of Trade and Industry on the ground that capital and conscience conflict - but if they invest in good faith, only to be let down, there is not much they can do other than to withdraw their money. To a great extent, they will always be investing on trust. The rights and wrongs of ethical investment were underlined recently after the Franklin Research Development, a US ethical investment fund, advised its clients to sell Body Shop shares. One reason was that allegations due to be published about the company in the US press could, it believed, lower its stock price in the short term. For many people, ethical investment will remain little more than a marketing gimmick to help the image of a company or an investment house. After all, the Pounds 800m or so invested in UK ethical unit and investment trusts is tiny as a proportion of total funds under management - more than Pounds 97bn in the case of unit trusts alone. Yet, ethical and environmental funds are relatively high profile. On the other hand, investment has been growing steadily, increasing more than fourfold over the past five years - a far higher growth rate than that of the average fund over the same period. Holder Meehan, a London and Bristol-based independent financial adviser specialising in ethical investment, estimates that 'screened' investment - when companies are analysed according to the ethical concerns of the investor - amount to a rather more substantial Pounds 20bn. The figure includes local authority money, plus charity and church funds. The inclusion of the last two is ironic. Nearly four years ago, the Bishop of Oxford lost a court case against church commissioners in which he argued that they should give more weight to ethical investment than to financial considerations. If you are an ethical investor, how can you be sure your criteria are being met? You could always build up your own portfolio using the services of a company such as Eiris, which screens stocks to see if they meet about 300 ethical criteria, but it would be relatively expensive and risky compared with a pooled fund. Still, the choice of funds has become much wider over the past few years. Initially, the only ethical funds were unit trusts - Friends Provident established the first in 1984 - but now there are ethical investment trusts, pension funds and packaged ethical products such as personal equity plans and endowment mortgages. You will want to choose a fund which matches your ethical criteria most closely, perhaps with the help of one of a number of IFAs who specialise in ethical funds. But choices need to be based on relative, rather than absolute, criteria. One of the criticisms of Body Shop was that its high-profile trade-not-aid policy, which involves buying from developing countries, forms only a small proportion of its business although the company says it spends a disproportionate amount of time and money on the policy. But, for the interested investor, the question is whether another company can better the Body Shop record. If not, then the choice is between Body Shop and others which do not operate such a policy. Another way of avoiding disappointment is to ask the fund manager to be specific about investment criteria and the way the fund's monitoring processes operate. Allchurches Amity Fund says it avoids 'companies materially involved in the alcohol, tobacco and gambling industries'. Scottish Equitable is more specific: its literature states it avoids companies 'for which the growing, processing or sale of tobacco products account for more than 10 per cent of its total business'. Allchurches says, however, that it regards 'materially involved' as having more than about 3-5 per cent of profits and turnover in those activities. It does not like being specific because it might invest in a company exceeding this proportion if it is outweighed by other factors. Some funds apply stricter ethical criteria than others, but this is likely to restrict their investment choice. The most common negative criteria - avoiding companies dealing in arms, tobacco and gambling - exclude about 60 per cent of companies in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. This restricted investment choice can lead to underperformance but, given the variety of ethical funds available, it is hard to be certain how their performance measures against a benchmark. First select the most suitable ethical fund and then look at its performance record before making a final decision.</p>

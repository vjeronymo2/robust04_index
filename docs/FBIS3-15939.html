			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Mar -- One of the conditions for a  settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the  liberation of the Azerbaijani territory seized by the Armenians.  This was stated at a news conference today in Moscow by Ramiz  Rizayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Russia. He noted that the  main difference between the warring sides over implementation of  the protocol on a cessation of military actions and the  withdrawal of troops from l March this year, which was signed on  18 February by the Azerbaijani and Armenian defense ministers  and a representative of the armed formations of Nagorno-Karabakh  under the mediation of the Russian defense minister, is  disagreement over the starting points for the withdrawal of  troops.    According to the ambassador, the Armenian side believes that  the troops should be withdrawn from the positions they now  occupy. Azerbaijan is insisting that the administrative boundary  of Nagorno- Karabakh be accepted as the starting point for the  withdrawal of troops.    To achieve peace, it is, first of all, necessary to have a  cease-fire and for Armenian troops to withdraw from the  Azerbaijani territory they have seized, and then for the troops  to be separated and a mutual security zone created under the  strict supervision of mediators and observers, the ambassador  said. Only after these conditions have been fulfilled, will it  be possible to get down to a political dialogue and to seek ways  to reach a comprehensive settlement of problems, Rizayev noted.  He denied reports that mercenaries from Russia are fighting on  Azerbaijan's side. "We have sufficient manpower of our own. If  there are Russians fighting, they are inhabitants of Azerbaijan  or those who remained there after the reorganization of the USSR  army," Rizayev said. He also rejected reports about the  involvement in Azerbaijan's army of mercenaries and advisers  from Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan.    Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about the possibility  of  Russian peacekeeping forces being introduced into the conflict  zone, the ambassador noted that "we have nothing against this in  principle, but it would be desirable to involve the peacekeeping  forces of other states so that it is not only Russian  peacekeepers that are put at risk."</p>

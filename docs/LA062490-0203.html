			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> 14 RITUALS;  </P> <P> WAKE UP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS  </P> <P> PURPLISH PINK hydrangeas. Burgundy snapdragons. Sky-blue irises. A Saturday  morning visit to the wholesale flower market in downtown Los Angeles ensures a  colorful start to a weekend.  </P> <P> Bunches of blooms are sold at bargain prices, but you have to get an early  start -- the market is open only from 6 a.m. to noon (vendors remain open a  little later on Saturday, until 1 p.m.), though the action actually starts to  wind down by about 8:30 a.m. If picking flowers makes you hungry, the Flower  Market Coffee Shop is open from 5:30 to 9:45 a.m. on Saturdays for breakfast.  </P> <P> On a recent Saturday morning at the Southern California Flower Market building  on the west side of the street, Miwa Floral was selling long pussy willow  branches, irises and daffodils. At San Lorenzo, which always has a large  selection and a friendly staff, there were large and small tulips, snapdragons  and a wide variety of cacti and potted plants. In the same building, Tayama  Wholesale Florist is the stop for orchids, anthuriums, gingers and other  exotics.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Flower Market of American Florists Exchange Ltd. across the  street (where most vendors post prices for easy self-service), nearly  everywhere you look, you'll see a rainbow of statice, mums and stock. Try  Petals of Paradise Tropical Wholesale Specialist for tropicals and exotics,  and, in season, ask at Groen Rose Co. for pots of those purplish pink  hydrangeas.

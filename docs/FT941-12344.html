			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): California Flights to Los Angeles were not affected by one of the strongest aftershocks the city has suffered since the massive earthquake ten days ago. The Saturday morning aftershock measured 5.0 on the Richter scale. For many families it was the first night that they had ventured back in to their damaged apartments. California's reputation with the Japanese took a further blow last week after state governor Pete Wilson was forced to apologise to 22 Japanese executives who were robbed at gunpoint on a tour bus hijacked by two men after a visit to a factory.</p>

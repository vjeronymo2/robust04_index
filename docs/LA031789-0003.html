			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to  the arrest of Constabile (Gus) Farace, sought in connection with the murder of  an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Thornburgh joined  FBI Director William S. Sessions and DEA Administrator John Lawn in pledging  that "all the resources of the DEA, FBI and Justice Department are committed to  apprehending" Farace. Law enforcement agents fanned out across New York City in  a hunt for Farace after agent Everett Hatcher, 46, who was married and had two  children, was found slumped in his car Feb. 28. He had been shot at close  range. Shortly before he was found on Staten Island, Hatcher had been scheduled  to meet for a fourth time with Farace, who earlier had sold him an eighth of a  kilogram of cocaine, valued at $4,000.  </P></p>

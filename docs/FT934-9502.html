			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Veba declines despite growth in core area VEBA, the German cong-lomerate, yesterday reported a near 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of this year, in spite of growth in the group's core energy activities. The group said pre-tax profits dropped by 11.6 per cent to DM1.064bn (Dollars 665m) on turnover up 0.7 per cent to DM49.59bn in the nine months. Net profits after tax dropped by 14 per cent to DM453m from DM527m. Veba saw no improvement in the economic environment in the last quarter of the year, and no improvement in earnings. Earnings from electricity grew because of an increase in sales combined with good capacity utilisation at its power stations. But in chemicals the earnings position continued to be unsatisfactory, with large losses coming in particular from the synthetic materials and rubber divisions, the group said. The losses reflected the costs of restructuring in the chemicals sector. Veba said it was cutting 10,000 jobs this year and next, with the bulk of the cuts falling in its chemicals businesses, with the aim of trimming DM1.2bn off its cost base. Earnings from trade and services matched the comparable figure for last year while the oil sector posted a sharp decline.</p>

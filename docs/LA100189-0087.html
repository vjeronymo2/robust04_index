			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF THE PACIFIC COAST CLUB: 'CRUEL LESSON';  </P> <P> CRITICS SAY ITS LOSS MAY HAVE CHANGED RENEWAL PRIORITIES FOREVER  </P> <P> There is a wound that won't heal along Ocean Boulevard.  </P> <P> It has been nearly 18 months since the wrecking ball took the Pacific Coast  Club, one of this city's most elegant landmarks, to make way for a $40-million  condominium tower. But not a stone has been laid in the foundation of the  trendy high-rise that was supposed to ease the loss of the 62-year-old castle  by the sea.  </P> <P> Indeed, the nonprofit Minnesota-based corporation that had posted the money for  the project pulled out months ago and the real estate is about to be sold to a  group of Japanese investors, developer Rob Bellevue said.  </P> <P> And the vacant land that has sat idle for so many months is less a testament to  sensible modernization than a reminder of the "cruel lesson" preservationists  and city officials say they learned when the city lost a piece of its stately  past.  </P> <P> "I think it's a disgrace," preservationist Renee Simon fumed.  </P> <P> "It just makes me want to weep," Planning Commissioner Nancy Latimer said.  </P> <P> There are at least a dozen accounts of what went wrong in the long fight to  save a club that virtually no one wanted destroyed, the once-private enclave  featuring oak beams and chandeliers where the city's elite gathered to swim and  dine.  </P> <P> Some blame the preservationists who bickered over pulling down part of the  building to save the rest. Some blame the developer who secured the demolition  permit when the city denied his plans to turn part of the club into a seaside  hotel. Some blame the nearby Villa Riviera residents who groused that the hotel  would have ruined their view. And some blame city officials who quibbled over  legalities when time was running out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Slap in the Face for City  </P> <P> All sides agree, however, that the loss of the Pacific Coast Club and the  similar demise of the historic Jergin's Trust Building was a slap in the face  for the city of Long Beach and may have changed its redevelopment priorities  forever.  </P> <P> "It took the demolition of those two buildings to wake the citizens of Long  Beach up," said Douglas W. Otto, chairman of the Coalition to Preserve Historic  Long Beach. "We learned through the Pacific Coast Club that the community cares  about its past and is willing to go to some lengths to preserve it."  </P> <P> The old club's future looked grim almost from the day it was abandoned in 1970.  A teen-aged boy plunged to his death exploring its decaying insides and its  owner went bankrupt.  </P> <P> Then John Chenoweth took his first look at the towering old building and "fell  in love." Chenoweth, the executive director of the Minneapolis Employees  Retirement Fund, said the nonprofit corporation had a social conscience, a  billion dollars to invest and an urge to restore a landmark.  </P> <P> When it became economically impossible to save the entire club, developers  created plans for a bluff-side hotel and condominium complex that would have  saved some of the most elegant rooms from the bulldozer, he said.  </P> <P> Chenoweth flew to Long Beach in the spring of 1987 to present to the city his  group's plan to salvage a once-stunning piece of architecture. What he said he  found, however, was a frenzy of politicking over the building's fate, a City  Council meeting that ran "like a kangaroo court" and city officials who behaved  "like a bunch of Neanderthals."  </P> <P> "We weren't just some out-of-towners out to make some fast money and move on.  We were out to make a commitment to that community," Chenoweth, still miffed,  said. "But the city of Long Beach did nothing to preserve and protect the  historic old building it had there. Not only did they do nothing, they made  life very difficult for those of us trying to do something. We were between a  rock and a hard place."  </P> <P> At an all-night meeting in May, 1987, city officials rejected the plan to build  a 200-suite hotel, 100 condominiums and several restaurants around the the  low-rise portion of the Pacific Coast Club.  </P> <P> "If anyone should be hung on the tree for a lack of regard for historic  preservation, it's Mayor Ernie (Kell)," said Chenoweth, a former state senator  from Minnesota. "He was biased, he lacked basic courtesies and quite frankly,  he exhibited the lowest standards of democratic procedures."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Claim No Choice  </P> <P> Kell could not be reached for his response. But other city officials say there  was no choice but to reject the hotel proposal that would have spilled onto  coastal land controlled by the state, obstructed views and set a bad precedent  for beach development.  </P> <P> "You can't put a private hotel on the beach. You just can't do that," said  Robert Paternoster, director of planning and building. "We told them all along  that even if the City Council approved it, it would get turned down by the  (state) Coastal Commission."  </P> <P> When the hotel plan died at the council meeting that night, the Minneapolis  Employees Retirement Fund's enthusiasm died with it. "We just want to close the  book on Long Beach and on that mayor," Chenoweth said bitterly in a recent  interview.  </P> <P> Developer Rob Bellevue said he worked for nearly another year with the city and  local preservationists to find a way to save the club. Every month it cost  $130,000 to maintain and guard the abandoned building around the clock.  </P> <P> "You're forcing me to be the executioner of the Pacific Coast Club, and it is  something I do not want to be," Bellevue then warned the city.  </P> <P> It seemed everyone wanted to save the building, but no one could agree on the  way to do it. On April 26, 1988, the wrecking ball swung. It took a full month  to bring the building down. A few chandeliers and column heads in the city's  storage yard are all that remain today.  </P> <P> It wasn't until several months after the club was gone that Bellevue discovered  the Minnesota investors had no interest in funding a modern high-rise built at  the expense of history, the developer said.  </P> <P> All plans stood still while Bellevue searched for new backers. He said he has  been negotiating for several months with a Japanese corporation he will not  identify  </P> <P> and a sale is about 60 days from closing.  </P> <P> If all goes well, Bellevue said, construction is set to begin within six months  on a 16-story, Spanish-style condominium with a tile roof. The new investors  are talking about marketing the units in Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tougher Law Discussed  </P> <P> In the days since the club was razed, the city has taken up the cause of  historic preservation. Ruthann Lehrer was named Neighborhood and Historic  Preservation Officer. City officials and preservationists are discussing a  tougher law requiring developers to demonstrate that they have the financing  and permits before a historic building can be demolished.  </P> <P> "We've learned to preserve a landmark while it's hot, to work together or lose  it. We must be careful never to let this happen again," Lehrer said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the scarred land glares from Ocean Boulevard, a grim reminder of  what might have been avoided. City leaders can only wonder whether a solution  would have presented itself had the club been left standing these past 18  months.  </P> <P> "Any development project exists in a moment in time. Markets change, public  perceptions change," preservationist Otto said. "Who is to say if the Pacific  Coast Club were still there in a more mature market that someone couldn't find  a way to save it? But it's not there anymore. In the moment in time that  existed, we did the best we could."  </P></p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Action against Bond Corp dropped A THREAT to the completion of a scheme of arrangement for Bond Corporation Holdings was lifted yesterday when the liquidator of a creditor dropped legal action against a Bond Corp subsidiary. Mr Richard England, the liquidator to JN Taylor Holdings, said he had decided to withdraw an action for the winding up of Bond Corp Finance, which could have blocked progress on the scheme of arrangement. Mr England agreed earlier this month to suspend the action in return for access to the books of Bond Corp, but had retained the option of winding up Bond Corp Finance in pursuit of debts of around ADollars 180m (USDollars 138.4m). The withdrawal of the winding-up action means Bond Corp officials can go ahead with final details of the scheme of arrangement, which is intended to provide a partial return to creditors through a debt-for-equity swap. Mr Kim McGrath, Bond Corp's executive director, said he was 'very pleased' by Mr England's decision, and urged other creditors to support the scheme of arrangement. 'It is certainly in their best interests. While there is still a highly-charged emotional context in relation to Bond Corp, it is the sensible thing to do,' he said. Bond Corporation's European bondholders are due to meet in London and Geneva next month to discuss the scheme of arrangement.</p>

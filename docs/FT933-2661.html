			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: RMC Price rises in UK building materials are finally sticking. True, the modest increases achieved by RMC stem from attrition among producers rather than higher volume. With cement prices rising as well, not all of the increases in concrete and aggregates flow through into profits. Still, the company is taking the opportunity to rebuild margins. Having seen UK operating profits hit a trough in the previous six months - at Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 400m - that is not before time. While construction activity remains depressed, further margin gains will be hard-won. Since RMC is shy about the breakdown of profits in its UK business  -which includes the Great Mills DIY chain - the benefits of a housing market revival are also difficult to predict. With more than half of turnover and profits coming from Germany, though, the bigger risks and rewards might lie elsewhere. The hope is that profits from RMC's Pounds 500m investment in eastern Germany will rise faster than western Germany declines. So far the picture is encouraging. Cheap Polish imports have not affected prices much. Despite falling back in the first half, construction activity in the west is holding up. Meanwhile RMC benefits from tax breaks for investing in the east which are not fully reflected in its reported 26 per cent tax charge. Even at this stage of the cycle and with its Berlin investment in progress, RMC has room to buy growth. The aggregates business earmarked for demerger by English China Clays springs immediately to mind.</p>

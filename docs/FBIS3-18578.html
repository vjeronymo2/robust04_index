			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  sees the U.S. decision to reinstate its Super 301 trade sanction  law as a warning to both Europe and Japan, a senior EU  negotiator said here Friday [4 March].    He was reacting to the decision by President Bill Clinton to  reactivate Super 301, which allows him to order punitive tariffs  of up to 100 percent on a country that continues to obstruct  imports of U.S. products.    The move was aimed at Japan's trade surplus with the United  States following Tokyo's refusal to accept numerical targets for  opening its market to American goods.    The EU negotiator, who asked not to be named, quoted the  U.S.  Administration as saying the move would be limited to areas of  trade not dealt with in the Uruguay Round of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    This could mean that the United States could use Super 301  as  a threat in current negotiations with the European Union to open  up public contracts to full competition by 1996, he said.    The two sides are negotiating certain areas in public  procurement omitted from a deal struck among the European Union,  the United States and 10 other countries last December to open  up the sector. They are trying to reach agreement by April 15.    The European Union has said it will exclude U.S. tenderers  from telecommunications contracts until European firms have full  access to American public contracts offered below Federal  Government level.    The EU negotiator said Washington could use Super 301 to  force open the European telecommunications market if the dispute  was not settled by the time the Uruguay Round is formally signed  in Marrakesh on April 15.    "That is why the U.S. decision (to reactivate Super 301)  must  be considered as a serious warning," he said.    But the official added that the United States was not  expected to use its trade weapon in another area excluded from  the Uruguay Round -- the audiovisual sector where the European  Union is officially discriminating against U.S. films and  television programmes.    The issue is on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign  ministers here on Monday and Tuesday. The ministers are due to  discuss the European Union's possibilities of trade reprisals.    Earlier Friday, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the  U.S. decision to resurrenct Super 301 was disappointing.  Officials said he had telephoned U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor to express European concern. Brittan said the  European Union would be studying the move carefully to see if it  violated U.S. trade commitments, particularly in the Uruguay  Round, despite Kantor's assurances to the contrary.    In London on Thursday, former British premier Margaret  Thatcher said U.S. pressure on Japan was "a step backwards."  She said: "Only by freeing the Japanese market from regulation  and interference will you make it more open."    A similar approach has been taken by Brittan. Last month he  announced a twin programme to make European goods more  attractive to the Japanese, while at the same time using  diplomatic pressure to overcome market access difficulties.    But he came out in opposition to numerical targets and trade  quotas.    And in a bid to help defuse the trade tension between Tokyo  and Washington, Brittan suggested a "trilateral approach" in  which the three sides would work together to overcome Japanese  trade barriers.    EU officials said his offer had not received an enthusiastic  response from Washington.    [In Paris, French Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard  Longuet said Friday afternoon that "France condemns any recourse  to a unilateral instrument" in the trade field, referring to the  reinstatement of "Super 301."    [He said in a communique that "the idea we have of the U.S.  role in the world is hard to reconcile with a method that can  hit any country at any time, if a country enjoys strong  competitiveness to the detriment of American interests."    [The minister added that the retaliatory device, "applied to  offset a structural deficit, the U.S. deficit with Japan, is not  of such nature as to resolve the problem."] [passage omitted]</p>

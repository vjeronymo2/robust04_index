			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: FASHION VICTIM TAKES A VOW  </P> <P> THE MOVIE: "Betsy's Wedding."  </P> <P> THE SCENE: Molly Ringwald (Betsy) plays a betrothed fashion design student. Her  father (Alan Alda), mother (Madeline Kahn), sister (Ally Sheedy) and fiance  (Dylan Walsh) are stultifying characters who distract from the two best parts  of the film -- the sartorially splendid, cartoon-gangster Tony Dee, played by  Anthony La Paglia and Betsy's wardrobe.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Costume designer Mary Malin created Ringwald's wannabe designer  wardrobe by cleaning out her own closet and jewelry stash. She asked for  contributions from her staff and even used some of Ringwald's own clothes.  </P> <P> The eclectic style does not work to Ringwald's advantage. She looks awkward in  a '50s leopard fur toque with a short-sleeve red dress and red wrist-length  gloves. Over-the-top fashion statements worked for Bernadette Peters in "Slaves  of New York" but on Ringwald they look ridiculous, especially with a pillbox  hat perched on her forehead, as if she were a carhop. The only clothes that she  wears with any sort of conviction are the frilly dress for an opera scene and  her wedding gown.  </P> <P> Anthony La Paglia, on the other hand, doesn't have a bit of trouble wearing the  double-breasted, washed silk suits with peak lapels that look like a mountain  range across his chest, and ties that are so loud they're deafening. He wears  this grotesque wardrobe with a Cary Grant-like panache.  </P> <P> THE STORES: Malin swears Ringwald's wardrobe has no certain store lineage. It  was begged, borrowed or uncovered in the back rooms and sale racks of  department stores. The wedding dress goes through such a transformation, from  traditional to funky neo-nuptial, Malin feels it would be cruel to name the  original designer. Customizing yields a Marie Antoinette-style frock with a  decollete bodice and a swagged overskirt with a multicolored, multitiered  underskirt of lace ruffles. Malin confessed the actual transformation took  weeks of stitching in the workroom.  </P> <P> La Paglia's suits came from Italy and from designers Hugo Boss and Bill  Kaiserman. To find these eye-popping pieces, Malin said, "Well, let's just say  I did very well in the (San Fernando) Valley."  </P> <P> THE PAYOFF: Ringwald's converted wedding dress (pictured), worn with a white  top hat and mid-calf length white boots, is surprisingly appealing. The white  satin top hat is an especially nice touch. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

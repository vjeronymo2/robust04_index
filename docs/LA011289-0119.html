			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The U.S.-backed Contras announced a new peace proposal and again called for new  talks, despite last month's refusal by Nicaragua's Sandinista government to  resume direct peace negotiations. The new plan, announced in Miami, sets a  six-month deadline for the completion of democratic reforms in Nicaragua  instead of a 70-day deadline and also drops a longstanding demand for the  removal of Nicaragua's Supreme Court justices. Contra leader Adolfo Calero  called the new plan more flexible and said it will be delivered to Managua  after first being presented to the presidents of other Central American  countries.  </P></p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Bombay scandal claims another senior figure INDIA'S Rs35bn (Pounds 625m) financial scandal deepened at the weekend with the arrest of Mr V. Krishnamurthy, a former leading public-sector industrialist and member of the government's Planning Commission. Mr Krishnamurthy was charged with offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act following raids on his home and offices. The Central Bureau of Investigation alleged he had received a cheque for Rs3.2m from Mr Harshad Mehta, the former stockbroker who is also under arrest. They said the cheque was paid to KJ Investments, a company controlled by Mr Krishnamurthy's two sons, one of whom was also charged on Saturday. Separately, the bureau alleged Mr Krishnamurthy senior had stood personal guarantee for a loan to KJ Investments from the Delhi branch of Sanwa Bank of Japan, while he was a member of the Planning Commission and chairman of the committee overseeing disinvestment from public-sector industry. Mr Krishnamurthy, a former head of public-sector concerns in the electrical, steel and motor industries, resigned from the commission last month when it was revealed he was associated with Mr Mehta and had introduced him to key politicians and bureaucrats, including Mr KP Geethakrishnan, the top civil servant at the Finance Ministry. In an interview with the Economic Times newspaper given before his arrest and published yesterday, Mr Krishnamurthy said his business involvement was well known when he was appointed to the commission, and that he should not be held responsible for the actions of his sons. The arrest of such a senior establishment figure with important political connections has raised expectations that the scandal's net will widen further when a joint parliamentary committee begins its investigations this week. A report by Mr R. Janakiraman, head of a central bank committee investigating banks' securities activities, is expected shortly and a special audit of four foreign banks - Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays, Citibank and Bank of America - is under way. However, the head of the Central Bureau of Investigation's inquiries into the scandal, Mr K. Madhavan, has had his request for early retirement accepted following suggestions of government interference in the probe. Meanwhile, the authorities are continuing to tighten regulation of banks' activities following the scandal. The Reserve Bank has issued guidelines on discounting of bills, one of the means used to divert funds from banks to brokers in the scandal. It has barred banks from re-discounting bills already discounted by non-banking financial companies. A Reserve Bank committee recommended on Saturday restrictions on the money market activities of public-sector banks and rules for trading bonds.</p>

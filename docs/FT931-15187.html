			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Heady experience on the bottom rung of audit ladder / A look at a training course that mixes hard work and play - and instils 'firm values' THEY came from all over Europe, the Middle East and Africa. They flocked to an obscure Dutch village in their hundreds, fresh-faced graduates with little experience of the world of business. By next Monday, most will be out on their first audit assignment. Over two weeks, they have endured more than 12 hours a day of training, each one accompanied by less sleep and more powerful hangovers. They have been mixed by gender, colour and nationality. They have been hard at work and at play in the classrooms, the bars and the sports facilities. This is basic training for auditors; boot camp for the recruits of Arthur Andersen. Mention Fast - short for firm-wide audit staff training - to a current or former Andersen professional and eyes will mist over with nostalgia. About 4,000 of this year's intake of 5,000 recruits worldwide will attend. That explains the long list of accountants with the firm who are eager to go back and teach their more junior colleagues, while re-living their past. The considerable delegation within the firm to those in junior positions means that many have the chance before memories of the original fade too far. This year, things are slightly different. The 250 students and 30 tutors now coming to the end of a residential conference centre near Eindhoven in the Netherlands have become guinea pigs for a new, improved course. Their sessions are being observed, questionnaires are being circulated, focus groups held every day. Simultaneously, a session is just finishing in Andersen's other principal training centre, St Charles outside Chicago. It is the course with no name, or at least no digestible abbreviation. It is called ABA WST - audit and business advisory worldwide staff training - or Aberystwyth, as some of its instructors have started to dub it. It represents 18 months of development, tens of thousands of hours of professionals' time in planning and some Dollars 1.7m in preparation costs to date. The offices sending participants are spending more than Dollars 3,000 a head for the privilege. ABA WST is arguably the single most important element of the Dollars 350m which Andersen says it spent on training last year, out of fee income totalling Dollars 5.6bn. The content of the syllabus has changed substantially from Fast. The gruelling regime - just as important as the learning in the classroom - remains virtually unchanged, although each class of former trainees claims its own was the toughest. By the end of the second week, most of participants' energy has been long drained, and only momentum drives them on - giving them a taste of the stamina they may well need for the rest of their career with the firm. How much knowledge they retain is debatable. One of the most common concerns among the trainees is whether they have sufficient skills to go out on their first audit. Their instructors constantly allay these fears. They argue that a tight supervision structure, well-established firm procedures and the impressive ability of the recruits will get them through. What is certain is that those taking part make friends for life, forming a common bond against the pressures of the course. Critics say the course moulds them into the raw material for a career at 'Arthur Android'. The more diplomatic call the experience a culture bath. Everything is geared around getting the participants to mix continually. The Koningshof conference centre is nearly two hours' journey from Amsterdam, and 20 minutes walk from the nearest off-site bar. It was purposely chosen to be distant from distractions which might lure students off the campus. That does not deter the hardy. Each evening, large groups - led by the South Africans, the British and the Irish - seek out the nearest bar once the hotel's own facilities shut down at 1am. Others collapse into bed ready for the early start. Koningshof is designed around groups. The bedrooms are clean and functional. They are very small and have no distractions such as television. The one item of equipment is an alarm clock for early wake-ups. The centre is self-contained, and focused around communal areas, with several restaurants and bars as well as many classrooms. There are elaborate sports facilities, and the ABA WST timetable schedules an hour before dinner each day specifically for sports. It also slots in an athletics competition on the first Wednesday. Most people take part. In a typically canny accountant's move, Andersen drew up a complex contract with the centre's management four years ago. It uses the facilities at a substantial discount and has its own wing which is now being expanded. But it does not assume the risks of the entire hotel, which takes clients from other corporate customers. It expects to break even each year, charging all costs to the national Andersen firms. Most hours each day are spent in classes. They start promptly at 8am, and rarely finish before 10pm, with short breaks for coffee, lunch and dinner. Anyone who is late faces a forfeit. Tardy trainees had to stand on a chair and sing their national anthem, stand on one leg and recite a nursery rhyme, or crawl around the floor impersonating an elephant. Classes are also smartly turned out. Andersen people dress down for dinner, quickly changing into jeans during the evening break. That is a habit which tends to persist during their careers. But during the day, they are in smart outfits. Many of the men are already adorned in the dark grey suits that are almost ubiquitous among partners. Aspects of the Andersen culture occupy the first three days - the 'core course'. Trainees learn communication, teamwork, time management and research skills. They are told about business protocol and building internal relationships in the firm. Resumes listing each others' backgrounds and interests are circulated to everyone. Years later, accountants in the firm use these connections to help ease international assignments. But the emphasis on firm values continues for the rest of the fortnight. Everyone is allocated to new classes after the first three days, with the exception of the French who have instruction in their own language. Trainees within each class are regularly rotated, ensuring that the genders and nationalities mix. Much of the training is in groups and teams, and requires presentations. Learning is based around a simulated audit of a fictitious US hair products company called 'Style by Castan'. Trainees watch videos, read press clippings and gain an understanding of the business and its accounting systems. They learn about risk assessment and planning the audit. Then they prepare work papers, and get going on topics such as the expenditure cycle, inventory observation, the revenue cycle, receivables, property, plant and equipment, profit and loss, contingencies and the financial reporting cycle. In between, they are periodically referred back to the firm's audit manuals, and instructors throw in examples from their own experiences. Audit standards are emphasised alongside client value. The importance of fees - including identifying additional functions which the firm can sell - are not neglected. Mr Marco Castino, a partner from Andersen's Italian practice, says there have been substantial changes to the syllabus since Fast. The course provides less detail but more overview, emphasising the business reasons rather than simply the procedures. It has also been made less US-based to reflect the firm's worldwide nature. By the start of next week, those who took part may not have grasped every fine point of auditing, but they have laid the foundations for a long-standing career in the world's most unified accountancy firm.</p>

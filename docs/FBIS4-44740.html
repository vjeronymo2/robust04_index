A general mobilization is under way at Sextant Avionique,  Thomson's and Aerospatiale's specialized subsidiary. The  just-in-time method of production, launched around the beginning  of 1992 in a pilot workshop at its Bordeaux plant, will be  generalized this year at the group's five main sites: Bourdeaux,  Chatellerault, Valence, Velizy, and Vendome. With the  aeronautics industry currently in a slump, the change will not  be all that easy to manage. Sextant's revenue dropped 10 percent  in 1993, to 4.9 billion French francs [Fr], versus Fr5.4 billion  in 1992.    After getting off to a late start and trailing behind its  American competitors, Sextant is bent on recovering lost time.  For, looking beyond the current crisis, the pressure being  exerted by clients, aircraft manufacturers, and airline  companies, is mounting. Boeing and Airbus have both placed  priorities on reducing production cycles. "Until now," says  Francis Lefebvre, the company's industrial manager, "these  cycles have been running on the order of around one year at  Sextant. Today, our clients are demanding a normal turnaround  time of one month. In other words, they are demanding that in  the normal course of activity we be capable of modulating our  production cycle within a maximum delivery time of one month."    During 1993, these external constraints were compounded by  the instituting of a new organization. Five market-oriented  divisions (civil avionics, military avionics, helicopter  avionics and instruments, space, and automatic testing) have  replaced the former product-oriented divisions. The company's  industrial sites, which until then had been managed by a central  industrial head office, have been placed under the new  divisions. Velizy, for example, which manufactures all the  flight computers, has taken over the civil avionics division.  Bordeaux, which specializes in displays, has become the seat of  the military avionics division. At the same time, each plant can  become the supplier (or the client) of the others.    The introduction of the just-in-time method has followed a  classic format. The first stage is the creation of individual  product lines. At Velizy, the Airbus A 320 computer line began  operating in February. Three others will follow: A 300-A 310  computers, A 330-A 340 computers, and military computers.  Heretofore, these different products have been processed in a  single workshop. The operation was made all the more complex by  the existence of several types of computers for each model of  Airbus (eight for the A 320), with a few hundred of each being  produced each year (Sextant manufactures a total of 22,000  pieces of equipment and sensors per year). The system was  identical at Bordeaux, with four lines of displays (the monitor  screens that equip the cockpits), three for the Airbus, one for  military planes. The second stage is the putting in place of the  kanban system in the workshops. Sextant has contracted for the  services of a specialist, Yves Milles, manager of the Gopal  company, who for 10 years exercised his talents in the workshops  of the PSA [Peugeot Corporation]. His credo: There is no need to  upset the manufacturing process in order for kanban to yield its  results. The important thing is to not halt production because  of a contingency. Hence the need to make the process fail-safe,  whether that process be related to supplies, staff, or  production capacity. Thus, Yves Milles has developed circular  kanban panels that provide maximum visibility and display the  status of manufacturing orders. "The more contingencies you  have, the more interested you are in tying the flow of  information to the physical flow of the process. That interest  is what kanban is all about," he sums up.    The method was first tested at Bordeaux in a pilot plant  that  manufactures electric power supplies. The results speak for  themselves with, among other things, a production cycle divided  by eight. Kanban is now taking over at Sextant's other plants.  At Velizy, on the A 320 computers line, the objective is to  reduce the production cycle from nine months to three or four.  "The books will reflect the economies beginning in 1995," says  Francis Lefebvre. Something to look forward to while awaiting  the recovery of the aeronautics market.</p>

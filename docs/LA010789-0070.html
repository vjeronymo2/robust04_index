			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HANDS-ON CYCLE FAIR IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> The World Cycle Fair, long the bastion of bicycle dealers and exhibitors, will  go public Sunday when the Long Beach Convention Center welcomes cyclists and  enthusiasts anxious to know more about the latest industry trends.  </P> <P> The trade show is expected to lure many of the Southland's recreational riders,  estimated by the Colorado-based United States Cycling Federation at more than  50,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Learn-How' Show  </P> <P> "It's a real hands-on and learn-how type of show," says Carla Rose of Edgell  Expositions, the show's organizer, adding that while consumers can look, they  will not be able to buy products at the show.  </P> <P> More than 325 exhibitors will show bicycles, components, accessories, clothing  and other cycling-related merchandise. Videos of races will be screened and  advice offered on bicycle maintenance, riding technique, safety, correct  bicycle fit and apparel selection.  </P> <P> Several top endurance cyclists, including 1988 Race Across America winner Cindi  Staiger, are expected at the RAAM booth and will offer a two-hour seminar on  endurance performance. Greg LeMond, the first American male to win the Tour de  France (in 1986), as well as members of the 7-Eleven professional cycling team  will attend. Outside the convention center, skilled riders will give displays  in BMX (bicycle motocross), freestyle and mountain-bike riding at various times  throughout the day.  </P> <P> A 25-mile rally will be staged in conjunction with the fair, beginning from the  Promenade (one block east of the center) at 7 a.m. and following a route  through Long Beach. Registration begins at 6 a.m. The $12 charge includes entry  to the cycle fair.  </P> <P> Since 1984, when American cyclists garnered nine medals at the Los Angeles  Olympics, there has been a burgeoning interest in the sport in Southern  California. With more than 4,500 racers licensed by the federation (the largest  number in the country, according to district representative Steve Ball), more  than 100 bicycle clubs have sprung up in the Southland, offering such special  services to cyclists as breakfast rides and rehabilitation for cardiac  patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 17 Million Riders  </P> <P> The Washington-based Bicycle Promotion Organization puts the number of regular  riders nationwide at 17 million. Although bicycling is second only to swimming  in popularity, bicycle sales have been dwindling in recent years, falling from  12.6 million in 1987 to an 11.2-million figure estimated by the organization.  </P> <P> Several exhibitors are expected to unveil new products at the cycle fair, most  reflecting the high-tech route bicycling has taken during the last few years.  </P> <P> Apparel manufacturers, catering to the increasingly fashion-conscious cyclist,  will display their wares, which include helmets with multicolor stretch covers  that are becoming part of cycling fashion. Then there are the slinky riding  tights in shocking colors.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, a lot of apparel was very plain," show director Luann Alesio  said. "We have a lot of manufacturers introducing not only new materials but  new colors and whole new lines."  </P> <P> New materials used in bike construction also will be in evidence at the show.  </P> <P> Carbon fiber, more commonly used in construction, is challenging various metals  as the first choice of frame builders. Two years ago the Kestrel, a one-piece  frame, set a new tone for bicycle design. Other examples of this design will go  on display this weekend.  </P> <P> "I think that the carbon-composite frame is taking hold. Here in California, we  are seeing other engineers aside from Kestrel who are working with those  materials," said Rachelle Berlatsky-Kaplan, editor of Southwest Cycling, a  monthly magazine with a circulation of 60,000 published in Glendale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Breakthrough Frame  </P> <P> James Linck, consultant to an Irvine defense contractor, has used his knowledge  of composites to produce a one-piece frame called the AeroLinck. Linck claims  that the frame, which has internal storage space, is a breakthrough in frame  design. "I expect that by the end of the century the old tube-frame bike will  be obsolete," he said.  </P> <P> The AeroLinck on display at Long Beach is expected to sell for $995, but Linck  hopes to reduce that to "under $500" once production is fully under way.  </P> <P> Ray Kenner, a longtime cyclist who works for a Boulder, Colo.-based marketing  services company, says that while the Kestrel concept generated much  excitement, the product was not very affordable to many. "Now it's going to be  brought down into a popular price range," he said.  </P> <P> In fact, Kenner foresees a trend this year toward lower prices -- and minor  refinements. "Consumers are going to have to look closely to see the  innovations," he said. "There's nothing really of the magnitude that we've seen  in the past, such as index-shifting and quick-release pedals."  </P> <P> A distinctive bicycle likely to attract attention in Long Beach is the  Hamilton-Sattui, which triathlete Paula Newby-Fraser rode to victory and a new  course record last year in the women's division of Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon.  </P> <P> It will sit alongside four other bikes designed by South African-born  consulting engineer Ralph Lewis, who, like other new designers, used a computer  to aid in the frame's design. Unlike other new designs, the Hamilton-Sattui  frames are built from steel-alloy tubing. By radically altering frame design  and using smaller wheels, Lewis claims to have produced a lighter yet stronger  bicycle. With the three-spoke carbon-fiber wheels he has designed, a  Hamilton-Sattui can weigh as little as 14 1/2 pounds, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Pricey Custom  </P> <P> For now, custom-built versions produced in Martinez, Calif., will cost from  $2,400 to $3,400, but when mass-scale production of the Hamilton-Sattui begins  this year in Taiwan, the price will drop to around $1,600-$2,000, according to  Lewis, who also has designed military vehicles and heavy trucks.  </P> <P> Durability is the main attraction of a frame designed by Frank Kirk, a British  specialist in high-pressure die-casting, whose company, Kirk Bicycles U.S.A.,  will launch the Road Ranger in Long Beach, a $950 bicycle featuring a one-piece  cast magnesium frame.  </P> <P> There will be bicycles in all price ranges at the show. Making a notable debut  is the Hyundai bicycle, marketed by Electronics of North America Inc. According  to marketing director Ralph Crance, eight Hyundai-brand bicycles will be  available this year, from an entry-level bike around $199 to an aluminum model  priced under $1,000.  </P> <P> For cyclists who never want to be far away from their bicycles, Washington  architect Harry Montague has invented a full-size folding mountain bike. His  son, David, has joined with partner John Nelson to manufacture and market the  Montague Biframe, which will be on display at Long Beach. The Biframe, folding  easily to 36x36x15 inches, retails for about $460.  </P> <P> But, whatever the preference, there's no need to be intimidated by the new  technologies. At least that's the way Bicycle Promotion Organization's  Wilkinson tells it. "You can go to the show and have fun," he said. "You don't  have to look upon it as an educational experience. You can window-shop."  </P> <P>  The World Cycle Fair at the Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd.,  in downtown Long Beach, Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; children  12 and younger, $5. Secure bike parking provided at the convention center.

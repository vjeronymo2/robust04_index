			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Good institutional response to Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction THE Bank of England comfortably sold Pounds 2.5bn long-dated government bonds yesterday, drawing a good response from UK institutions to the first auction in the Pounds 33bn funding programme expected this fiscal year. The market reacted positively to the results of the auction, with dealers relieved the heavy funding programme had started well. Bids for the 8 3/4 per cent bonds maturing 2017 covered the stock available by 1.82 times. The results showed a consensus among investors on the correct pricing for the new issue. The lowest price accepted by the Bank of England was 97 3/8 , where the yield is 9.02 per cent. Around 19 per cent of the issue was sold at this low level. The highest bid was 97 15/32 , for a yield of 9.01 per cent. The difference between the yield on the highest bid and the average yield was zero, indicating that the Bank did not have to accept low-price bids to sell all the bonds. Following the announcement of the auction results, the gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, rose sharply from an opening level of 98.17 to 99.04. Traders said the rally was exaggerated by dealers covering positions taken ahead of the auction. However, in the afternoon prices settled. By the close the contract stood at 98.20. Trading volume was a heavy 58,000 contracts. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed unchanged on the day at 99 23/32 , for a yield of 9.02 per cent. Most of the new stock was taken by UK institutional investors, such as pension funds and life insurance companies, with very long dated liabilities. The issue creates a liquid benchmark at the long end of the gilts market, where liquidity was relatively poor. Market-makers also reported some buying from overseas investors, unusual for such a long-dated issue. Coupon payments on the bonds are exempt from withholding tax for overseas residents, a feature designed to attract international investors into the bonds. Analysts said the government has now raised Pounds 7bn since the Conservative election victory. GERMAN government bonds traded lower yesterday in a lack-lustre day which saw low trading volume and little hard data to lead the market. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond closed on a yield of 7.99 per cent, having finished on Tuesday 7.98 per cent. On Liffe, the London futures exchange, the June bund futures contract closed at 87.21 from an opening level of 87.40 and a close of 87.35 on Tuesday. The contract moved within a narrow range, in listless trading. Volume was a sluggish 30,000 contracts - around half the trading activity seen on Monday and Tuesday. The state of Hesse released consumer price inflation data which showed a 0.3 per cent increase in prices in the month to mid-April, for a year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent. The figure was in line with expectations and, following similar data from the states of Baden Wuertemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, suggests consumer prices in western Germany rose by 0.3 per cent in the period, for an annual rate of 4.5 per cent. THE Italian government bond market easily absorbed L5,000bn 10-year fixed rate government bonds yesterday, although demand from international investors was tempered by the political uncertainties facing the country. Bond prices were buoyant on the day, with the benchmark 10-year fixed rate bond (BTP) maturing January 2002 traded at 98.35 in late afternoon, up from 98.27 at Tuesday's close. The new paper was sold at an average price of 99.25, for a yield net of withholding tax of 10.86 per cent. At the January auction, new 10-year paper was sold at an average price of 98.60, for a net yield of 10.97 per cent. The new bonds are immediately deliverable into the Liffe bond futures contract, which makes them attractive for international portfolio investors. However, dealers in London said international buying was less than expected following the resignation of Mr Francesco Cossiga, president. US Treasuries prices briefly bounced higher yesterday afternoon following news of a smaller-than-expected quarterly refunding package, but bonds were unable to hang onto their gains and ended the day broadly lower. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was off  7/32 at 99 7/32 , yielding 8.06 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/8 to yield 5.43 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market yesterday morning. The lack of intervention was expected, with Fed Funds trading at 3 per cent, slightly below the Fed's perceived target of 3 3/4 per cent. The market was surprised by the size of the refunding package, which at Dollars 36bn was at the low end of expectations and triggered some short-covering. The package is made up of Dollars 15bn in 3-year notes, Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes and Dollars 10bn in 29 1/2 year bonds. The Treasury also decided to re-open the 8 per cent long bond. There was little reaction to the morning's release of personal income and spending figures for March. Personal income rose 0.6 per cent in the month on a seasonally adjusted basis, while February's increase was revised to 1 per cent from a previous estimate of 1.1 per cent.</p>

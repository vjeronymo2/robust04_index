			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Developing countries look for better deal on trade - Why the Generalised System of Preferences is regarded as only a qualified success RICH and poor countries are meeting in Geneva this week to look at ways of strengthening the preferential trading arrangements for developing nations under the so-called Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP, first introduced in 1971 under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), provides for countries to reduce or waive normal customs duties for Third World imports. As Unctad shows in its latest review of the system, the GSP has been a qualified success. On the plus side, there are now some 15 schemes in operation, giving preferential trade treatment to more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33bn) worth of exports a year from over 100 developing countries. Preferential imports into the OECD countries grew roughly twice as fast as total imports between 1976 (when the US introduced its scheme) and 1989 (the most recent available year). Product coverage has been expanded, and an increasing number of poor countries are benefiting from the schemes. That suggests the GSP is working as intended: promoting development through trade. But both sides concede the system also has serious weaknesses. Unctad estimates that in 1989 only half the Dollars 226bn worth of imports from developing countries subject to duties were covered by the GSP schemes - mostly manufactures and semi-manufactures. Only half of those actually received preferential treatment. In addition, because the scheme is designed to encourage industrial exports, advanced developing countries have grabbed the lion's share of the benefits. The US dropped the four Asian 'tigers' - Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea - from its scheme in 1989. Even so, the top 10 beneficiaries accounted for over 80 per cent of GSP benefits granted by the US the following year, with Mexico alone garnering a quarter. Overall, the top 10 beneficiaries account for more than 60 per cent of GSP preferences. The 40-plus least developed countries (LDCs), which are most reliant on traditional commodity exports, had preferential exports in 1989 of a meagre Dollars 710m, or just over 1 per cent of total GSP exports by all developing countries. To remedy these deficiencies, developing countries, supported by the Unctad secretariat, are pushing hard for broader product coverage of the GSP schemes. These currently exclude many agricultural products and often 'sensitive' industrial goods such as textiles and footwear, the traditional springboards for industrialisation. Third World nations also see expanded coverage as partial compensation for the reduction in the value of preferences that will inevitably follow from the general lowering of tariffs now being negotiated in Gatt's Uruguay Round of global trade talks. But for the first time developing countries openly acknowledge that the quid pro quo for broader product coverage will be 'graduation' out of the GSP schemes for the most successful Third World exporters. Australia is to follow the US in graduating the Asian 'tigers' from 1993. With the writing on the wall, developing countries are backing Unctad proposals to draft multilateral 'graduation' guidelines in a bid to prevent gross disparities between schemes and protect countries from arbitrary delistings due to protectionist and other pressures. In practice, many Third World nations see advantages in orderly graduation in spreading GSP benefits more equitably. The indirect effects can also be important. In Asia, the US decision has already led to plans for substantial direct investment by South Korea and Taiwan in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to take advantage of trade preferences these countries still enjoy in the American market. The meeting is also discussing ways of remedying two other major defects in the GSP scheme. The first is the fact that the schemes differ in operation as well ascoverage. Thus the same good can satisfy origin rules for one scheme and not for another. More difficult to tackle are differences due to the use of GSP benefits to pressure countries over policies. The EC withdrew GSP benefits for a time from South Korea in a row over intellectual property protection. The US routinely threatens to withdraw benefits to countries whose trade policies it dislikes or which deny basic worker rights. Green criteria may be added if US environmentalists have their way. The second problem is the negation of GSP benefits by non-tariff measures, which Unctad reckons (based on 11 OECD schemes) affect over one-fifth of dutiable imports from developing countries. These measures can take the form of quotas or ceilings, which limit benefits from preferences, or of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties which can wipe them out altogether. In the 1980s the World Bank voiced the views of many development experts that the Third World had made a 'Faustian bargain' by relying on trade preferences that could be withdrawn at will rather than playing an active role in multilateral trade talks. This week's meeting has revealed a new consensus that, while the GSP and other preferential arrangements are no panacea, and certainly no substitute for Gatt, they are a useful and worthwhile form of development assistance in their own right.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Russians agree to join peace partnership General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, ended months of uncertainty last night by saying his country would join Partnership for Peace, the military co-operation project designed by Nato. The general said a Russian agreement to join the programme, which brings together Nato and its erstwhile enemies, should be supplemented by broader statements about Moscow's relationship with the alliance. But in contrast with previous Russian pronouncements, including a statement from the general earlier yesterday, the minister said there were no formal preconditions for entry into the partnership. 'President Boris Yeltsin has authorised me to make it clear that Russia will join the Partnership for Peace', the general said after briefing his western counterparts on Russia's new military doctrine. He said the framework agreement for joining the partnership, which Russia will now follow at least 20 other countries in signing, did not fully set out the principles that should underlie Russia-Nato co-operation. But General Grachev, in one of the most conciliatory statements made towards Nato by a Russian official this year, said it would be 'incorrect and wrongly understood' if Moscow set out formal terms. Western diplomats said they now expected Russia to sign up in late June or early July. This could pave the way for an appearance by President Yeltsin as a guest or participant at the Group of Seven summit in Naples. Russia has baulked at the idea of signing up to the partnership on the same terms as its satellites. It has insisted that its co-operation with the alliance should recognise Russia's status as a great power. Before the general's arrival, Nato defence ministers agreed they might issue a reassuring political declaration about relations with Russia but there could be no question of any supplementary treaty. The ministers also firmly agreed that Russia would not be allowed any veto over the activities of Nato or the partnership in the smaller countries of eastern Europe. Several prominent Russian politicians have demanded such a veto. Diplomats said yesterday's deliberations were unlikely fully to address the fears of the east European states, which are nervous about any Russian participation in European security arrangements. The general said he will set out his views on the partnership in greater detail today at a meeting that will also be attended by defence ministers from the smaller east European nations. Western diplomats welcomed the fact that General Grachev will be speaking to an audience that includes those countries which are most anxious about Russia's intentions.</p>

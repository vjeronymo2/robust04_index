			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GUITARIST SCOTT TENNANT IN RECITAL AT USC  </P> <P> With skill and an unusual sweet-tooth for flashy, ebullient music, guitarist  Scott Tennant presented an impressive, sometimes dazzling recital Saturday  evening at Hancock Auditorium, USC. His virtuosic playing includes an  exceptional right-hand agility and a remarkable fluidity in difficult passages.  </P> <P> Although he generally kept his penchant for showiness under control, this  temptation often ran slightly unbounded, showing up considerably but not  distastefully in works like Giuliani's "Grand Overture." Similarly, Tennant  treated the accessible, sugary consonances in four pieces by John Dowland with  an overflowing amount of sentimentality.  </P> <P> Two purely tonal contemporary works followed the same path: Carlo Domeniconi's  Oriental-sounding "Variations on a Turkish Theme" hauntingly sang and twanged,  while Andrew York's New Age folk study "Emergence" resonated pleasantly though  it is more a sketch than a complete composition.  </P> <P> Fleshing out the program were more routine but convincing performances of four  Etudes by Villa-Lobos, Rodrigo's "Sonata Giocosa" and a transcription of Bach's  Suite in E for solo violin.

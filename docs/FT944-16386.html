			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Audi plans to invest DM730m in Hungarian engine plant Audi, the executive car division of Volkswagen of Germany, is planning to invest DM730m (Dollars 474m) in a new engine manufacturing plant in Hungary over the next five years, it said yesterday. The initial investment will be DM320m and the plant will be Audi's first 100 per cent-owned manufacturing base outside Germany. It is one of the biggest post-communist foreign investments in Hungary and one of several in its nascent car manufacturing sector which has attracted investments from General Motors of the US and Suzuki of Japan. The plant, which opened yesterday, will be the first to manufacture a new five-valve cylinder engine developed by Audi for its new A4 model, the successor to the Audi 80, due to be unveiled in Munich today. In the first phase the plant, located in Gyor in western Hungary, will employ 250 people and produce up to 750 1.8 litre engines a day. Production is scheduled to rise to 2,000 a day by 1997. A third phase would extend the scope of the local production and employ 860 people, the company said. From 1996, the engine will be used for the Audi A6 and the planned A3 and may be used by Volkswagen and its SEAT and Skoda subsidiaries. The company said it aimed to source some components and parts locally within two years but ruled out full-car manufacturing in Hungary. The group had an option on a further 230,000 sq metres of land, as well as its existing 250,000 sq metre site, it said. Future investment decisions would depend on demand for the new engine and on whether Hungary retained its cost advantages, it said. The project will be exempt from profit tax for the first five years of operation. Audi chose the site in Gyor after looking at 180 locations in Europe. Hungary has lower production costs than eastern Germany and Austria while Hungarian labour costs in car manufacturing are about one-sixth those in Germany.</p>

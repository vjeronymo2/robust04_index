			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dashamir Shehi, minister of labor and social </F> welfare, by A. Manaj in Tirana; date not given: "`Shock Therapy'  -- Albania's Economic Revival!"]    [Text] [Manaj] Mr. Minister, recently Mr. Berlusconi  announced, in the name of the Italian Government, the creation  of 1 million new jobs. What would you say about our  government's plans in terms of employment?    [Sheqi] For the year 1994, the government has planned to  employ around 60,000 people who are at present jobless or  receiving social assistance. Speaking about planning, we do not  have in mind the outdated plans of the centralized economy. For  example, this year 13 billion leks have been earmarked for  public investments, 4.6 million of which come directly from the  state budget and the rest is funded by foreign investors and  international bodies. The aforementioned figure originates from  the 10-percent economic growth envisaged for this year. It is  equal to last year's growth, when 60,000 vacancies were filled  in the private sector alone and public investments accounted for  only 4 billion leks.    Also, the employment structure, which is the most important  thing, will change this year. Last year, the largest number of  vacancies was in the private sector and the rest in the  production sphere. By contrast, quite the opposite is happening  this year. It highlights the fact that this is the first year  when, after a long-running break in production, we will witness  an increase in industrial production, as a result of small- and  medium-size privatization of state-owned enterprises.  Meanwhile, as planned, unprofitable enterprises will continue  to be closed down.    [Manaj] What does the new employment structure involve?    [Shehi] Highway construction is one of our labor fronts, but  despite its considerable value, during this construction period  it will not be the most important. The main stage in creating  new jobs will begin after completion of the highways with the  setting up of petrol supply points, motels, hotels, restaurants  and factories like the brewery and Coca-Cola factory recently  opened in Tirana, and so on. By and large, there is a new  climate favoring employment. Our government's plans offer a  relatively large number of alternatives.    [Manaj] What would you say about the 100-percent inflation  indexation approved at the recent government-BSPSH [Union of  Independent Syndicates of Albania] meeting?    [Shehi] We reached agreement on this problem, and within  this framework work is under way for setting up a working group  that will go into the indexation details that will take the form  of a law or an agreement. As far as our government is  concerned, it is, in this respect, in favor of an agreement.    [Manaj] How do you see prospects for our county's  northeastern area, regarding economic growth and employment?    [Shehi] We see this as being closely linked with the plans  that various international economic organizations have to  alleviate the hardship of this poor rural area, whose problems  are actually aggravated as a result of the secluded political  aura in which it is shrouded. In this respect, we see the  improvement of its road network, and the development of its  timber industry and geology -- as for the latter we can mention  here our government's recent agreements on the creation of the  "Albakri" [Albanian copper] joint venture -- as possibilities  offered to this area for the solution of a number of its  economic problems. Likewise, on this front, we are continuing  negotiations on the establishment of the "Albkrom" joint  venture. As for the BSPSH leader's request to the government to  pass a law alleviating the impact of electricity price hikes, in  this region it is not a matter of general measures but of a  specific one related to the coal branch. By this measure, the  government returns some kind of support to this branch.    [Manaj] What stage has the work of drafting the labor  legislation reached?    [Shehi] We have entered the final stage of working out the  Labor Code, and we are looking forward to passing it on to  Parliament for approval before the summer vacations. The labor  legislation, however, cannot be considered complete, unless  several groups of legislation, for various reasons, are  consolidated, and it will take a considerable time to do all  this, including the contracts in the state budget sector and  those dealing with the status of state employees. We think that  Albania will have the basic part of its Labor Code approved by  the end of 1994, which will be enough to enable us to proceed  further with this activity.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 18% OF STUDENTS LACK FLUENCY IN ENGLISH  </P> <P> More than 18% of Orange County's public school students are not fluent in  English, almost double the number six years ago, according to a statewide  end-of-the-decade report on language proficiency released Friday by the state  Department of Education.  </P> <P> The Orange County numbers closely reflect statewide figures that show an  explosive growth in the number of limited-English-speaking students in grades  kindergarten through 12, according to the report.  </P> <P> "The influx of students from non-English-speaking backgrounds is a big  challenge for our schools," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said  in a statement Friday. "It comes at a time when California's schools are  already the most crowded in the nation, and when we are demanding higher levels  of performance from our educators and our students."  </P> <P> James Fulton of the state Education Department's demographics unit said the  number of limited-English students in Orange County soared from 33,133 in 1982  to 64,544 in 1989. Total student enrollment in Orange County grew by only 2%  during the same period, he said.  </P> <P> As a percentage of the total school enrollment, the limited-English student  population rose from 9.6% in 1982 to 18.4% in 1989, Fulton said.  </P> <P> The report also found that another 47,000 Orange County students who speak a  foreign language at home are fluent in English. But Fulton noted that most of  those students are in the upper grades.  </P> <P> "When you look at kindergarten through six, for example, roughly seven in 10  students are LEP (limited-English-proficiency) kids," Fulton said. "When we  look at FEPs (fluent-English proficiency), we find that it's about 51% in  grades seven through 12."  </P> <P> Most of the LEP students in all grades statewide speak Spanish, according to  the report.  </P> <P> In Orange County, 47,577 of the 64,544 LEP students, or about 73.7%, speak  Spanish; 7,182, or 11.1%, speak Vietnamese; and 1,772 students, or 2.7%, speak  Korean. Of the nine other major languages in county schools -- Cantonese,  Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Lao, Mandarin, Armenian, Japanese and Farsi --  there are less than 1,000 LEP students in each.

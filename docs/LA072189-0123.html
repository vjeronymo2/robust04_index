			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin said he wants a "cold turkey"  freeze on funds for the stealth bomber, and President Bush stepped up his  lobbying effort for the radar-evading plane and other defense systems. Aspin, a  Democrat from Wisconsin, said Congress needs more information on the costly  stealth bomber, as the B-2 plane is known. Meanwhile, Bush called Aspin and  other members of the House Armed Services and Appropriations committees to the  White House, pressing them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, as well as  the strategic defense initiative, the MX missile and the Midgetman missile. The  House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on those programs.  </P></p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: French rise hits builders A late move by the leading French commercial banks to raise their base lending rates sent shock waves through the building and construction sector. The rise to 8.25 per cent from 7.95 per cent led to fears that recovery in French construction could be nipped in the bud. Some analysts argued that the move signalled a higher interest rate environment in Europe and could stifle business in Germany where many of the UK construction and materials groups are also heavily involved. However, others suggested that the shift was purely domestic. Speculation that something was happening leaked into the gilts market around midday but the first announcement of a change did not happen until half an hour before the UK market closed. Share prices were already weak and when the news came dealers immediately marked them down further. They cut the price of the FT-SE 100 stocks - RMC, Redland and Blue Circle. RMC fell 15 1/2 to 940p and Redland, which is heavily involved in the French road building programme through its aggregates subsidiary Steetley, fell 9 to 460p. Blue Circle slid 9 to 284p with dealers also citing the current BZW sell stance. However, BPB and Pilkington, Europe's premier glass maker, escaped unscathed and remained steady at 294p and 164p respectively. Telecommunications group Cable and Wireless was one of the weaker spots among leading issues as a large seller dragged down the share price amid concerns over competition and overseas pressure. A 72-point fall overnight in the Hang Seng market in Hong Kong, from where C &amp; W generates around two-thirds of its operating profits, led to initial weakness. This was compounded by news that competition had forced its Mercury subsidiary to make big cuts in the cost of international calls. Also, Mercury's Christmas promotion for its One-2-One mobile phone came in for heavy criticism. The shares ended 12 lower at 378p. Standard Chartered firmed a half to 282 1/2 p despite being exposed to the frailty of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index. The bank is seen as a global takeover candidate. Growing concern over the state of the Mexican economy sent Lloyds Bank shares down 5 to 553p. Though not directly affected by the crisis, the bank is heavily exposed to secondary debt in Latin America and it has seen its capital ratio come under pressure at a time when it needs its strength to push though its proposed acquisition of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Insurance stocks, highly geared to the performance of the market, fell as they also came in for negative press comment on their prospects for 1995. However, Prudential received support from the news that its was taking 25 per cent stake of a Thai life assurance group. The move was seen as securing a toe-hold in the emerging market. The shares closed 5 1/2 lower at 316 1/2 p as two-way business took turnover to 2.1m. Northern Ireland Electricity moved 5 ahead to 363p, as bargain hunters turned their attention to the distributor. The shares were left behind in the recent strong rally in the sector that was ignited by the bid for Northern, 5 lower at 1005p, as the market awaits further developments on the bid. Northern's predator Trafalgar House eased 1 1/2 to 73p, in strong business of 7.3m. Speculation of a further bid boosted Yorkshire 11 to 718p. Rank Organisation hardened a penny to 411p as Smith New Court struck a positive note. Recommending the stock as one of its favourites for the coming year, Smith believes the company will benefit from 'strong growth and the benefits of cost cutting at Rank Xerox,' in which it holds a 49 per cent stake. Hopes of bumper sales over the festive season helped several retailers survive the market slide. Kingfisher gained another 5 to 443p with sentiment enhanced by a press recommendation. High street retailer Boots was also in demand and the shares added 2 to 508p. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Joel Kibazo Other statistics, Page 29</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> HOWARD, DAVIS PREPARE FOR TOUGH RUNOFF  </P> <P> Simi Valley City Council members Vicky Howard and Bill Davis, who will face  each other in November for the 4th District county supervisor seat, predicted  Wednesday that their campaigns will be more hard-fought than during the  primary.  </P> <P> Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in Tuesday's election  to qualify for the runoff.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be an easy race for either one of us," said Davis, who  expressed concern about the wide margin of votes that Howard, his council  colleague and neighbor, received Tuesday.  </P> <P> Davis received 25.4% of the vote, while Howard received 39.6%, according to  tallies released Wednesday by the Ventura County registrar's office.  Challengers Glen Schmidt received 12.8%, Harold Fick 10.3% and Tom Ely 6.7%.  </P> <P> "I'm a little disappointed in the numbers," Davis said. "The numbers tell me  I've got to go out there and work harder."  </P> <P> Davis vowed during the next five months to visit 20,000 homes in the 4th  District, which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara  Valley. He said he also hopes to raise $100,000, about twice the amount he  raised for the primary, to operate a large phone bank and to buy more  advertising to challenge Howard in November.  </P> <P> Davis, 62, said he and his supporters plan to wait a couple of weeks before  officially kicking off the campaign.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Howard said she is already working on her campaign for the November  election.  </P> <P> "I'm not taking any time off," said Howard, who spent Wednesday morning talking  with her supporters about her strategy for the next few months. "We're going to  have a campaign meeting on Friday to put together an analysis of the voter  turnout."  </P> <P> Although Howard said she will reorganize her campaign to some extent, she  declined to reveal details.  </P> <P> Howard, 55, said she is encouraged by her strong showing Tuesday. "It's kind of  a vote of confidence for what I've been doing over the years," she said.  </P> <P> Although the candidates have taken similar positions on a number of issues --  both agree on the need to reduce traffic, conserve water and provide more  affordable housing in the southeast county district -- Howard said her  experience sets her apart from Davis.  </P> <P> In addition to serving on the council for eight years, Howard said, she serves  on a number of county committees and organizations.  </P> <P> As the city's representative on the county's Transportation Commission, she  said she played an instrumental role in getting emergency call boxes installed  on the Simi Valley Freeway. She also worked closely with Rep. Elton Gallegly  (R-Simi Valley) to get extra lanes built on both sides of the freeway through  the Santa Susana Pass, she said.  </P> <P> While Davis acknowledges a debt to Howard for getting him involved in politics  -- she recommended him for a seat on the Planning Commission in 1985 and  supported his appointment to the City Council in 1986 -- he says he has  accomplished more in his 3 1/2 years on the council than Howard has in the last  eight.  </P> <P> He listed some of those accomplishments as getting the city to start a  rent-subsidy program for low-income senior citizens and co-authoring a ballot  measure -- overwhelmingly approved by voters Tuesday -- that calls for amending  the city's growth-control ordinance to allow more development of affordable  housing for the elderly.  </P> <P> In addition to serving on the council for eight years, Howard said, she serves  on a number of county committees and organizations  </P> <P> While Davis acknowledges a debt to Howard for getting him involved in  politics-she recommended him for a seat on the Planning Commission in 1985 and  supported his appointment to the City Council in 1986-he says he has  accomplished more in his 3 1/2 years on the council than Howars has in the last  eight.  </P></p>

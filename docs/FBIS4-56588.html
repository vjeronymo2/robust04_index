			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lourdes Sierra Arenas] </F>   [Text] The Labor Commission for North America began  operations with two lawsuits, one against a General Electric  [GE] assembly plant and the other against the Honnewey [name as  published] Company, both located in Chihuahua State. The suits  accuse the companies of firing 110 workers for attempting to  unionize and of not paying "back wages".    These are the first two cases that have arisen following the  implementation of NAFTA. The two aforementioned companies  violated the norms established in the Labor Agreement for North  America signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, which  acknowledges full respect and protection of workers rights and  laws in each country, said Berta Lujan, secretary general of the  Mexican Network for Action on NAFTA.    At a news conference, Lujan said the charges filed with the  Commission, which is presided over by the labor ministers of  each country, were presented in December and investigations are  now under way to determine to what extent Mexican workers'  rights were violated. The organization is expected to reveal  the results of its study in three months. The plaintiffs  responsible for taking this lawsuit to the trilateral  organization headquartered in Dallas, Texas, are the United  Electrical Workers and the Teamsters Union, who are supported by  the Network, Lujan said.    The GE assembly plant fired 70 workers, while the Honnewey  Company fired 40 workers. The charges were filed to obtain the  workers' reinstatement, to force the payment of "back wages,"  and to demand respect for the right to unionize.    For their part, Andres Penaloza, Victor Osorio, and  Alejandro  Villamar, also members of the Network, expressed the need to  include labor and environmental protection norms in the trade  agreements Mexico is negotiating with Central and South American  countries so there will be protection of natural resources as  well as of workers rights. They believe that with the signing  of these trade agreements, which in the case of Mexico and Costa  Rica already has been signed, our country is looking for a  solution for those companies that will not be able to compete  against the United States. Markets will be won by "striking"  and substituting small producers in those countries.    Within this context, Andres Penaloza, coordinator of the  NAFTA Follow-up Commission, said the Network is developing  several proposals for renegotiating NAFTA, which will be  presented to the nation's presidential candidates.</p>

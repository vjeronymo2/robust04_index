The defense volunteers are deployed at Ban Sap  Tali and nearby villages, and at Ban Phakkat in Tambon Khlong  Yai, Pong Nam Ron District, the point where refugees were sent  back. The deployment of defense volunteers was aimed at  preventing a new influx of refugees as well as to stand by in  readiness for any trouble that might happen where there is a  large crowd of people.    According to the latest report, exchanges of artillery fire  were heard sporadically from inside Cambodia. Correspondents  from Chanthaburi Province reported renewed exchanges of gunfire  between the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge forces. There  was an intense exchange of about a hundred artillery rounds  between 2300 and midnight yesterday opposite Tambon Khlong Yai,  Pong Nam Ron District. Three rounds landed inside Thailand.    There was a report that at 1000 today Cambodian Government  troops clashed with the Khmer Rouge forces opposite Ban Khlong  Yai in Tambon Khlong Yai. About 400 Cambodian people crossed  the border into Thailand at Ban Nong Kok, about 10 km from Ban  Phakkat in Pong Nam Ron District. A Thai marine, however,  explained that those refugees are the people living along the  border. They would cross into Thailand whenever there was a  fighting and return to Cambodia when the fighting died down.</p>

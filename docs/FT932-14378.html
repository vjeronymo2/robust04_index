			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Monday Interview: Evangelist of good sense - Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, talks to Patti Waldmeir and Philip Gawith Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, makes everything he says sound both simple and obvious. In the mad world created by apartheid - where concepts have been twisted and language deformed to fit the needs of an impossible ideology - that is a considerable strength. In the 11 months since becoming finance minister, Mr Keys has used it to advantage. He has used common sense - the moral good sense of the Bible, from which he quotes liberally, and the commercial acumen developed over 30 years as one of South Africa's top businessmen - to induce sanity among the country's fractious politicians. At a time last year when they had sunk to new depths of squabbling, Mr Keys told them a few choice economic truths - that unless they moved quickly, South Africa would not be worth fighting over; it would become a wasteland of high unemployment and low growth, decaying industry and departing skills. The politicians listened, and democracy talks began in earnest. The message is reinforced, if anything, by last weekend's assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani. 'I'm the minister of the bloody obvious,' he says. 'I see myself as someone who jollies people along to do what common sense dictates they ought to do.' He is someone (he does not say it) who has not only the clarity of vision to see what needs to be done but the political skill to persuade the ANC, the black trade unions, the business community and the cabinet that they saw it first themselves. He relies on candour, confidence and his commanding presence - critics call it arrogance - to carry the day. When he speaks, people listen. The message he delivers is a tough one: the economy must undergo radical restructuring; government consumption spending must fall sharply to boost critically low investment; civil service numbers and pay have to be cut sharply; unions must agree a virtual wage freeze; interest rates must remain high to tame inflation. The first difficult steps have already been taken. Last month's budget raised value-added tax by 4 percentage points to 14 per cent and cut government current expenditure significantly in real terms, in an attempt to wrestle down a budget deficit equal to nearly 9 per cent of gross domestic product. In his first budget, Mr Keys reduced the corporate tax rate from 48 to 40 per cent to boost investment - though much of it will be clawed back through a new company tax on profits distributed to shareholders and the abolition of other company tax breaks, making the effect more psychological than real. That is scarcely surprising, for Mr Keys' campaign is overwhelmingly psychological. Put simply, he aims to persuade South Africa to believe in itself. Investors must believe in investing; bureaucrats must believe in giving the civil service their best efforts by cutting waste and inefficiency; the liberation movements must believe in the virtues of a free market; the unions must believe they have a stake in growth; and all of them must believe in Derek Keys. So far, he can boast a surprising degree of credibility even in the most radical circles. The ANC's economic policy chief, Mr Trevor Manuel, is known to respect him, and Mr Jay Naidoo, militant general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest union federation, happily tolerates him, after viciously attacking his predecessor. Mr Keys repays the compliment. He often invites Cosatu to 'correct' his economic plans, and says he thinks the behaviour of organised labour in the tripartite economic negotiating body, the National Economic Forum (involving business, unions and government), has been 'outstanding'. Business is delighted to have a voice in Pretoria. (Mr Keys came to the job from the post of executive chairman of Gencor, the country's second-largest mining house.) The technocrats of the Finance Ministry seem somewhat in awe of him. Never before have they had a minister who had no desk. ('A desk is separation, assertion of authority, subservience to constraints, secretiveness.') Or a boss who throws away every report they give him. (Keys says he hates filing and so reads and discards nearly every paper put before him.) The Keys mystique has yet to impress taxpayers, however. They have already felt the pain, and many doubt there is pleasure to follow. Winning over the people will ultimately determine whether Mr Keys can complete the difficult economic restructuring task he has set himself, at a time of great political upheaval, and under a multi-racial power-sharing government (due to be phased in from later this year) which could prove weak and divisive. 'Government is in a typically feminine role,' he says, sheepishly acknowledging that some might find the comment sexist. It is 'trying to create a situation attractive enough to stimulate some initiative from another party (the private investor). Once you commit yourself to relying on the private sector because only it can produce the investment directions with adequate yields, then you put yourself in this situation. How can I be more attractive? That's the heart of the problem.' Investors, both domestic and foreign, must start investing, growth must resume (after four years of recession), jobless totals must drop (some 40 per cent of the labour force is without a formal job) or the Keys structural adjustment programme is dead. 'The guide has to have some credibility,' the minister volunteers. 'I've been in this job nearly a year and I don't have anything to show. If I'm in this job for another year with nothing to show, what are the grounds for confidence?' His basis for optimism is, oddly for a businessman and government minister, partly religious. Mr Keys consults the Living Light, a publication which provides daily lessons from scripture, every night before retiring and upon rising every morning. He acts according to its guidelines. That, he says, is his recipe for health. 'When I was at Gencor I had to go for the annual check-up and the doctor said to me: 'I'm impressed. How are you handling this stress so well?' I said: 'It's my daily exercises.' He said: 'Oh, what do you do?' I said: 'On my knees, twice a day.'.' His faith in Mr F W de Klerk is also unshakeable. He describes the South African president as 'a political genius'. But his confidence in the entrepreneurial skills of the South African businessman, white or black, is less strong. 'You once became an industrialist (in the highly protected South African economy) by taking an existing stream of products that came into the country, stopping it and replacing it with a stream of your own. That doesn't require an enormous amount of marketing sense,' he says. But the export-oriented growth areas 'that we now have to benefit from are totally dependent on marketing sensitivity,' he points out. 'There are also community attitude problems. Who wants to be rich in a community where wealth is a stigma,' he asks, noting that both the Calvinist ethic of the Afrikaner and the communal ethic of Africans act against the pursuit of wealth. So how will South Africa prosper, in an atmosphere of low labour productivity, social strain and potential economic conflict? 'The question is not, can these people be like the Japanese,' he says somewhat irritably, 'but can they improve? And they can improve, and they are here and so are we, so I think if I were to approach my job on the basis that I had to produce Korea in three years, of course I'd be on the wrong tack. But you say you have to produce something noticeably better in three years, then we're away.' In the end, Mr Keys says, it's all 'a function of hope and faith . . . You don't stay in this business unless you believe in God'.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                             PERSONAL FILE  ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1931     Born in Johannesburg. 1950     B Comm, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. 1954     Qualified as chartered accountant. 1956     Joined Industrial Development Corp, SA. 1965-86  Worked as management consultant. 1986-91  Executive chairman, Gencor.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: HSBC restructures in wake of Midland buy HSBC Investment Banking Group, the investment banking businesses of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, has established a holding company with roughly Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) in capital which draws disparate parts of the company into a single new unit. The move is part of a reorganisation of the bank's businesses following its acquisition of Midland Bank last year. Mr Bernard Asher, chairman of HSBC Investment Banking, said: 'This means that the things we set out to accomplish by the acquisition of Midland have been accomplished.' The ability of HSBC to exploit fully its Midland acquisition by achieving synergies between the disparate units has been questioned by some institutional shareholders and analysts. But Mr Asher said that HSBC had moved swiftly to achieve that. Prior to the reorganisation, which has taken more than 10 months to achieve, HSBC had four separate investment banking and securities operations. The four are James Capel and Co, the stockbroker, Samuel Montagu, European and US merchant bank, Wardley Group, a Hong Kong-based investment bank with activities throughout the world and HSBC Asset Management, which has total assets under management of Dollars 28bn, of which about 60 per cent is for retail and private clients. Mr Asher said the purpose of the reorganisation was 'cross fertilisation' allowing each unit to realise new commercial opportunities from business relationships in other units.</p>

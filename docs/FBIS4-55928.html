			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- President Lech Walesa is setting  off for a three-day visit to Switzerland on Wednesday, at the  invitation of Swiss President Otto Stich on behalf of the  Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation.    Switzerland plays host only once a year to an official  visitor from a foreign state. Poland is the first country in  Central and Eastern Europe to have received an invitation for  such a visit.    President Walesa will head a delegation including Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski, head of the president's chancellery  Janusz Ziolkowski, National Bank of Poland President Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz and Deputy Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak.    Lech Walesa will also be accompanied by 15 representatives  of  Polish business since the visit is intended to strengthen  Polish- Swiss economic ties. At the moment Switzerland is in  13th place in the league of Poland's trading partners, and 234  Swiss firms operate in Poland with a small capital of 170  million dollars.    The last significant Polish-Swiss business deal was the  purchase of the Poznan firm "Goplana" by Nestle.    No trade agreements are intended to be signed but several  meetings are planned which should bear fruit later on. Among  these is a "round table" meeting planned with representatives of  Swiss economic circles which will be chaired by the presidents  of both countries.    The Polish delegation has plans to visit four Swiss cantons  -- Berne, Zurich, St. Gallen and Solure (which is represented by  the Swiss president). President Walesa is to meet  representatives of the thousands-strong Polish community.    This will be Walesa's first visit to Switzerland in his  capacity as Polish president. But in June 1981 as leader of  Solidarity he headed a delegation to the International Labour  Organisation in Geneva.    Bronislaw Geremek, who is now one of the leaders of the  Freedom Union, accompanied him at the time. Several meetings  took place then. This was one of the elements of the "existence  of Poland in the world up to the achieving of independence,"  presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A lifetime's travel for a literary type - Lucy Kellaway on a UK publisher's unlikely choice of sales promotion What would T S Eliot have made of it? The company that publishes his poem The Wasteland is trying to boost its sales with the sort of promotion usually associated with vacuum cleaners and supermarkets. 'A lifetime's free travel - the monthly 'super' draw where no one loses,' scream the headlines. 'Nine great prizes must be won.' All you need do is buy one of UK publisher Faber and Faber's slim volumes of poetry or English literature, and you could win enough money to cruise round the world for the rest of your days. The promotion is one of the first of its kind in the publishing industry, which is only just discovering the marketing gimmicks that other industries have used for decades. First came promotions for individual authors and titles, now Faber is taking it one step further by promoting the whole brand. The move shows how hard publishers are fighting for market share. 'During the recession they increased margins by cutting costs, now they are desperate to build turnover,' says Penny Mountain, deputy editor of The Bookseller magazine. Different publishers are going about this in different ways. In the next few months Penguin and Wordsworth Editions will declare a price war selling paperback classics for Pounds 1 each. Faber's move is at the other end of the spectrum: it is throwing money at its brand to distinguish itself from the pack. The total cost of this promotion is Pounds 250,000, more than a quarter of the company's pre-tax profits last year. According to Joanna Mackle, the scheme's creator, Faber is unusual in having a clear brand image to promote. Only a few other publishers - Mills and Boon, Ladybird, Virago and Penguin - are in this position. She says many readers consciously choose to buy a Faber book. 'We are trying to strengthen that.' But even if people do choose books on the basis of who publishes them rather than who writes them, Faber's choice of promotion could seem curiously down-market. Mackle says not, pointing out that these prize draws work just as well for quality British newspapers such as The Times as they do for the tabloid Sun. And if it means that Faber loses some of its rarefied image, that is not such a bad thing: 'People can make us appear holier than thou,' she says. Up-market or down-market, these promotions appear to be a good way of selling literature. Last year Faber launched its first such campaign, which held out the chance of making one reader a millionaire. Even though the big prize was not won, Mackle claims the promotion was spectacularly successful, and sold an extra Pounds 1m of books. The new travel promotion runs for three times as long and the main prize is worth twice as much again. Since the beginning of the month, anyone who buys a Faber book is presented with a travel bond. They could win a weekend on the Continent, a transatlantic ticket for two, or a lifetime's travel worth more than Pounds 1.5m. There is, however, a 'several hundred to one' chance against the main prize being won at all. But, just in case it is, Faber has taken out insurance to cover the cost. Eliot is most definitely not turning in his grave, says Mackle. As a banker and a gambler he would surely have approved of the promotion.</p>

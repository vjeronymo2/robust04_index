			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCCARTNEY AND VISA  </P> <P> Re the Visa credit card TV ad featuring Paul McCartney:  </P> <P> Big corporations pay big dollars to artists such as McCartney to attach a brand  name to their art through a slick commercial. Each time a viewer sees the ad,  that attachment is made stronger.  </P> <P> Eventually, every time the viewer hears the song involved, the TV commercial  gets a free run in his or her mind. It's free subliminal advertising time every  time he or she hears the song anywhere.  </P> <P> I consider this a rape of my loyalty to a musician's work.  </P> <P> Every time I hear "Tonight Tonight" by Genesis, all I see in my head is a bimbo  at a bar about to have sex with some guy cause he's drinking Michelob beer.  Same with "Don't You Know What the Night Can Do" by Steve Winwood and "After  Midnight" by Clapton. Three or four Stones' songs mean "Drink Budweiser!" now.  </P> <P> Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, REM and Neil Young seem to do just fine  without the extra cash this racket generates. Maybe McCartney could ask them  for some pointers on making ends meet.  </P> <P> MARK WITSKEN  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

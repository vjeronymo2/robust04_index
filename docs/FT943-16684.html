			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Books: The language of self-obsession - Fiction ART &amp; LIES by Jeanette Winterson Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 294 pages Speaking in the voice of her character Sappho, Jeanette Winterson writes in Art &amp; Lies, 'In the beginning was the Word. And at the end'. There is a truth and an evasion here, for Winterson's obsession is certainly with language - specifically the language of the Authorised Version of the Bible  -rather than the novelist's incunabula of character and plot. The evasion, however, lies in the way she uses this admitted preoccupation to mask her true literary project. At first glance Winterson's trajectory as a novelist has been an uncertain one, so much so that her second novel, Boating for Beginners, has now been relegated by its author to the status of 'comic book' in her list of previous works. Readers and reviewers alike refer nostalgically to her hugely successful debut, Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, and tend to regard her most recent novels - Written on the Body and now Art &amp; Lies - as both difficult and a departure from what she originally appeared to promise. Art &amp; Lies arrives with a whimsical sub-title, 'A Piece for Three Voices and a Bawd,' which immediately signals that it is not concerned at any level with realism. The voices belong to Handel, a defrocked priest and breast surgeon; Picasso, a young woman who has been sexually abused by her brother and who longs to be a painter; and Sappho, the lesbian poet. In between we hear from Doll Sneerpiece, a scatological type which has been a stock feature of Winterson's fiction since The Passion. Handel, Picasso and Sappho end up together on a train, although there is nothing in the novel as conventional as denouement. Yet while Arts &amp; Lies is determinedly abstruse and experimental, there is a sense in which it is a wholly logical step in Winterson's literary development. Its 'voices', especially that of Sappho, are frequently indistinguishable from that of the unnamed narrator of Written on the Body; both, for all their declared subjugation to the women they love, are blatantly self-regarding. Winterson's fictional love-objects are a striking weakness of her work, from the sick, etiolated Louise in Written on the Body to the insubstantial Picasso in Art &amp; Lies, In dramatic contrast, her lovers are of heroic or even monstrous proportions, reaching their apotheosis in the greedy, devouring narrator of Written on the Body. Winterson's interest in love and passion tends to reveal itself in the form of intense self-examination in the part of the lover, with whom she often appears to identify, rather than of the beloved. Indeed her rejection of character and plot in Art &amp; Lies can be seen as an increasingly confident attempt to liberate herself from the necessity to mask her solipsism; the subject which has always engrossed her, from the fictionalised autobiography of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit to the magisterial pronouncements on life and art in this latest novel, is her own development. It is a truism that Winterson's obsession with Biblical language can be traced back to her upbringing as a teenage evangelist. Art &amp; Lies declares this influence from start to finish; 'Kiss me with the pulled-apart open space, demolition of propriety, rebuilding of a place of worship among an upright people'. And, on the same page: 'The word and the kiss are one.' Yet the point about the language of the King James Bible is that, for all its flights, it is anchored by an unshakeable belief in the existence of God. Without this centre the words become meaningless, which is the direction in which Winterson's verbal pyrotechnics have begun to tend. Yet the evidence of her novels, particularly Art &amp; Lies, is that Winterson is bent upon the creation of an alternative centre which is not the Word but the endlessly-fascinating self.</p>

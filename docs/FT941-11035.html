			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / British show little liking for work The British have the most negative attitudes to work to be found in Europe, says the continent's most extensive survey of employee satisfaction. However, a UK company, British Shoe, was one of the five best individual companies in International Survey Research's annual survey, based on results from more than 500 businesses. The Swiss emerge as the most satisfied, and - Britain excepted - the Protestant work ethic appears alive and well. Employees in northern countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland responded far more positively to their employment than those in France, Spain and Italy. Employees were asked to give their views on 17 aspects of working life including company management, immediate supervision, training and information, pay, job security and job satisfaction. The Swiss came top in 16 categories out of 17 with an average positive response of 70 per cent. The British had the least favourable attitudes in 10 categories out of 17 with an average mark of 54 per cent. The overall satisfaction level of European employees remained constant between 1992-93 and 1993-94, but this masked a number of changes. Attitudes in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain deteriorated markedly during the year, although the Netherlands still came second and Belgium fourth. Germany, which came third, saw a slight rise after a sharp decline in 1992-93. The 7 per cent improvement in attitudes towards product quality was the strongest positive trend recorded for any country or category. The categories attracting the lowest favourable responses were pay (42 per cent) where France had the lowest figure of all, and communications (46 per cent) where the UK was bottom. The categories attracting the most favourable response were job satisfaction, working relationships and operating efficiency. The individual European companies which scored highest were Texas Instruments, the semiconductor and electronics manufacturer; DHL, the distribution company; and Nokia Mobile Phones. Mr Roger Maitland of International Survey Research said it was useful for individual companies to measure their employee response against a country norm.

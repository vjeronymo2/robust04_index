			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Better balance for loan arrangers: Falling profits from corporate lending mean UK banks are seeking broader customer relationships For bankers who lend money to large companies in the UK, this has been an unsettling year. Six months ago it appeared that the business, which was hardly worth the candle by the end of the 1980s, had been revived. But banks now face the return of hard times. 'We have managed to transform very thin returns, but we are beginning to fall back over the edge,' says one banker. The pressures have yet to hit published profits. Operating profits in the Royal Bank of Scotland's corporate and institutional banking division were Pounds 82m in the six months to March, compared with Pounds 58m in the same period a year before, while National Westminster Bank's corporate and investment banking arm, NatWest Markets, doubled profits last year. Yet this earnings level is under pressure as banks compete for business. The most obvious evidence is in the price of loans, which has fallen sharply this year. Large companies which had to pay interest of 0.8 per cent (above wholesale interest rates) on loans a year ago are now being charged closer to 0.3 per cent. 'In the last six months, banks have given up half the lending gains they made in the past six years,' says Mr Roger Byatt, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets. Banks have found a distinct lack of enthusiasm for borrowing among large companies, whose ability to tap capital markets more cheaply means they use bank loans mainly as standby finance, similar to overdraft facilities for individuals. Furthermore, other services that banks have relied on heavily in the past two years to compensate for low returns from lending - such as foreign exchange contracts and financial derivatives - are under pressure. Less volatility in European exchange and interest rates means banks are selling fewer products and at lower margins. The recognition that income from lending to large companies will probably never recover to levels where it gives an acceptable return on capital has galvanised banks. Following the example of other banks, Barclays' new chief executive, Mr Martin Taylor, has just re-organised its corporate banking services - ranging from lending to cash management and equity underwriting - into a single group. Mr Graham Pimlott, the Barclays executive who recently took charge of this group, says that although UK banks have tried in the past few years to improve corporate banking profits, they have not gone far enough. 'Lending as a profitable business has been in decline for many years. US banks responded to that in the 1980s, and it is slightly surprising that it took us 10 more years to respond to it,' he says. Lending profitability deteriorated sharply in the late 1980s, as competition among strongly-capitalised banks reached a peak. One banker estimates that banks need to charge about 1.4 per cent interest on loans to large companies to make adequate returns on capital. The fall in margins in the 1980s compounded other problems faced by British banks in dealing with large companies. First, in contrast to continental European banks, commercial and investment banking were divided. As large companies raised more funds on capital markets, a growing proportion of their business passed from commercial banks to investment banks. A second problem was that their technology did not allow most banks to calculate the total profits they made from each customer, the risks they ran, and the costs they incurred. Many wanted to lend as much as possible, even at low margins, to cover fixed costs. This drew them into making loans to companies with which they did no other business, on terms which did not earn a sufficient return on capital. These risks were exposed when many large companies, such as Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, collapsed or had to be refinanced in the early 1990s. The combination of large losses, and new capital requirements imposed by the Basle-based committee of international bank supervisors, led many banks to reshape their business with large companies. Mr Byatt says this process has been so effective in NatWest's case that it has raised its earnings from large companies to three times the level of the late 1980s. Banks have been reforming their approach to large companies in several ways: They have analysed the returns on capital of each relationship with a large company - including services such as cash handling and lending. This has shown that lending alone is no longer profitable enough. 'You have to gear lending with other forms of income to make an adequate return on capital,' says Mr David Harrison, head of corporate banking at Lloyds Bank. They have ended relationships with companies which want only to borrow money. NatWest Markets has reduced its customer base from a peak of 2,400 to about 900. Banks have played on the greater vulnerability of some recession-hit customers by pointing out that they are more inclined to rescue those loyal in good times. 'Banks find it harder to support clients who fall on hard times if they were operating purely in a transactional way, and trying to squeeze every last basis point from their bankers,' says Mr Byatt. They have raised lending profits by adding higher-margin loans as old ones have expired. They have been helped by the withdrawal of many Japanese banks from the London market because of difficulties in their domestic markets in 1990. But the strongest thrust has been to try to improve profits by selling more products to companies, using the lending relationship as an introduction and lever. Mr Iain Robertson, head of corporate and institutional banking for Royal Bank, says his bank makes clear to companies merely wanting to borrow that 'we intend to work with them in the longer-term to ensure we build a profitable relationship'. It is difficult for banks to do more than suggest that they deserve a slice of more attractive business in return for a loan. There is strong competition for the most profitable forms of wholesale banking. Companies can insist on banks making loans before they consider buying other services, such as foreign exchange contracts. Moreover, not all other forms of banking activity are so profitable that they make up for depressed lending margins. Mr Harrison of Lloyds argues activities such as cheque clearing and cash handling are a valuable addition to lending. But others argue such transactions are hardly more profitable than lending. Probably the greatest prize for commercial banks would be to persuade their blue-chip clients to use them as investment banks as well as commercial banks. If such borrowers sought corporate finance advice or asked their banks to underwrite equity issues, the banks would have captured the most profitable businesses from investment banks. This is the rationale for National Westminster bringing its corporate and investment banking operations together in NatWest Markets two years ago, and for Mr Pimlott taking control of both corporate lending and merchant banking within Barclays. Yet banks face difficulties in persuading UK companies to accept advice, loans and underwriting from a single source. Many companies are doubtful about the quality and independence of the advice they might receive. Even Mr Pimlott is cautious about the chances of short-term success, arguing that it would be counter-productive to try to pressure companies to use the whole range of products and services now under his remit. 'In my experience, customers do not like people arriving and trying to force them to use one service when they are quite happy using another,' he says. Yet the pressures on banks such as Barclays and NatWest to induce companies to buy such products will grow if they cannot sustain the recovery in profits of the past two years. Mr Byatt of NatWest says the bank was surprised by the rapidity with which it improved earnings after integrating its lending and investment banking activities. But he admits that it will be hard to maintain the momentum. As loan margins deteriorate and profits are squeezed, the hard times of the late 1980s no longer seem so far away.</p>

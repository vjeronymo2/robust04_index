			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blagden tumbles Pounds 10.6m into red Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker which has been badly hit by recession in continental Europe, is planning a Pounds 20m rights issue and is passing its final dividend after dropping to a Pounds 10.61m loss in 1993 . The shares fell 26p to 127p on the news. The pre-tax loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 7.63m, was after Pounds 13.3m of exceptional items and interest of Pounds 3.23m (Pounds 3.27m). Mr Lance Levine, finance director, blamed the group's problems largely on the situation in the German drum market which he said was 'becoming lunatic'. 'No-one in our business in Germany is making money. The industry is being run by people who have never known bad times.' He added that the problems were exacerbated by public sector support for some of Blagden's struggling competitors which in Britain would be insolvent. 'It is not a level playing field,' he declared. Blagden, 80 per cent of whose drum sales are on the Continent, is relatively small in Germany. But German exports have flooded into its main markets in France and Belgium. Drum sales outside the UK fell to Pounds 118m (Pounds 123m) despite a boost from the lower pound, and profits to Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 7.23m). Group operating profits dropped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 5.88m on sales of Pounds 225.5m (Pounds 229.8m). The provisions pushed gearing to an 'undesirably high' 82 per cent and the group is planning a rights issue to raise at least Pounds 20m before the end of May. Mr Levine said negotiations with its lead banker, National Westminster, were progressing well and that the delay was because of the recent arrival of new chief executive Mr Richard Searle. 'He needs some more time to decide just where we should be going.' Mr Searle joined the group earlier this month, replacing Mr Cameron Smith who left 'after amicable discussions'. The exceptional items included a Pounds 3.8m provision for loss on disposal of its French and Belgian packaging operations, Pounds 831,000 for the closure of the Paisley drum operation, Pounds 2.33m for redundancies, in the UK, Spain and France and a further Pounds 6.85m for unspecified site rationalisation costs. No final dividend leaves a 1.5p interim for 1993, against the previous year's 9.5p total.</p>

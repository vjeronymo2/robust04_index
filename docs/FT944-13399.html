			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (11): Gatt deal could hit exports - Agriculture The Gatt agreement signed last April in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakesh could, paradoxically, cost the kingdom as much as Dollars 700m in lost exports. Exports of farm products, notably citrus, tomatoes, potatoes and cut flowers would be hit. A confidential report drafted last January by the Moroccan ministry of agriculture puts export losses in the farm sector at Dh500m, a figure which was confirmed a month ago by a paper on 'the Uruguay Round and its effects on North Africa', presented at the annual conference of the French Association of Economic Science in Paris. The reason for this state of affairs can be traced to the strategy adopted by Morocco in the run-up to the Gatt agreement. The kingdom's farm produce has, since the first agreement signed with the European Union in 1967, enjoyed preferential access to European markets. Lower European import duties are charged on a range of produce exported by Morocco than on similar produce imported from countries which have not signed a partnership agreement with the EU. Preferential access was confirmed in the 1980s and was seen as a form of compensation for the trade diversion which Morocco was bound to suffer because of the access of Spain and Portugal to the EU in 1986. Spain's accession, in particular, gave such produce as citrus and tomatoes from the Iberian Peninsula much easier access to the markets of northern Europe. The EU granted Morocco quotas to help it overcome this. The new Gatt agreement, by changing the pattern of European protection, technically forced the EU and Morocco to renegotiate their previous agreement. Morocco's strategy during the Uruguay Round was to avoid including multilateral concessions on Mediterranean fruit and vegetables in the broader discussion in order to prevent the preferential access its products enjoyed in the European Union being granted to all parties. This would have encouraged new competitors to try their hands in EU markets. There was always a risk, however, that Morocco's strategy would backfire if only because of the reluctance of the European Union to include Mediterranean produce in the free trade agreement which it was then in the process of negotiating with the kingdom. The Commission was under heavy pressure from Spanish, Dutch and Belgian exporters of tomatoes, cut flowers and citrus fruit to use the Gatt negotiation as a means of curtailing Moroccan access to EU markets, to the detriment, in Moroccan eyes, of European consumers. Indeed, such Moroccan produce is of higher quality and somewhat cheaper than its Dutch, Belgian and Spanish equivalents. Reducing Morocco's capacity to export and earn foreign income also rebounds on those European companies which export to the kingdom. Morocco simply has fewer means to pay for new machinery and other goods, most of which it buys in Europe. The dilemma that Moroccan policy planners face today is all the more acute because the country's farming sector is at a crossroads. The uncertainty created by recent events could have serious consequences, in particular that of holding back investment both by Moroccan nationals and by the many European companies which have set up joint ventures in the farming sectors in recent years. A steady flow of investment, whose aim is to improve both the quantity and quality of what is produced, transported and marketed, is crucial if Morocco wishes to maintain the competitive edge many of its producers have gained in recent years. These producers are mindful of repeating the mistake they made a decade ago when they did little to improve quality in the citrus sector while Moroccan exports were rising at a comfortable 5 per cent a year. Their complacency was rudely shaken when they realised, too late, that ahead of joining the European Union, Spanish producers had massively extended fruit groves, replanted many trees and, in the process, virtually doubled their country's production capacity. Moroccan exports of citrus, potatoes, tomatoes and cut flowers have been buoyant in recent years. Exports of tomatoes increased from 80,000 to 138,000 tonnes in the five years to 1993 and those of cut flowers from 1,1000 to 3,000 tonnes between 1988-89 and 1992-93. Overall, this sector employs an estimated 300,000 people and 1.5m Moroccans depend on it for their livelihoods. The potential adjustment costs if no agreement is brokered between Morocco and the EU would be considerable, quite apart from lost exports. Writing down capital would be expensive and technical know-how would be lost. The social consequences in a country with severe unemployment would be heavy. A recent World Bank report on 'agro-industrial development - constraints and opportunities' estimates this sector's contribution to GDP at 5 per cent, its contribution to industrial GDP at 25-30 per cent and to exports at 16-20 per cent. The value added of such exports has grown at 8-14 per cent annually in recent years. 'The estimates are likely to understate the contribution of agro-processing,' the report notes. The options for Morocco are twofold. Either the EU can find a way of maintaining some of the preferential treatment it has afforded to such imports or the Moroccans will have to make, in the words of one expert, 'a huge reconversion towards processed products which, though they enjoy less value-added than fresh fruit and vegetable exports, are less politically sensitive in the European Union.' More broadly, were Morocco to aim for self-sufficiency in cereals, edible oils and sugar, where domestic production respectively meets 40-70, 30-35 and 70 per cent of domestic needs today, such a policy would come at a very high cost to consumers and the country's natural resource base, notably water. Indeed, periodic drought puts a premium on the use of water, which, according to the World Bank, is today only charged Dh1 a cubic metre, a price which represents 16 per cent of recovery costs. To date, the European Union has used its financial muscle essentially to extend aid to Morocco rather than to allow free trade. This 'aid rather than trade' policy, which is part of the logic of the Common Agricultural Policy, has the perverse effect of doing little to ensure long-term stability in a key southern partner of Europe. No-one in Morocco disputes that the kingdom itself must put its house in order. The same World Bank report points out that 'despite significant efforts by several government agencies to ensure quality, these efforts are unco-ordinated and, at times, incoherent.' Credit to agriculture is another constraint. Short-term loans are available. However, the report says, 'scarce long-term finance is rationed among enterprises via high collateral requirements and loan guarantees. This policy militates against newer and less-established enterprises. Even for those with access to formal credit, they have to finance long-term investment with short-term loans, which increases their financial vulnerability.' The banks, as in other sectors of the economy, seldom seem to act as promoters of economic activity. In the past decade, Morocco has switched from an inward-oriented and regulated approach of its economy to an outward-looking policy which relies on market mechanisms. New technology, marketing structures and consumer preferences worldwide, however, are forcing the pace of change. Morocco's food processing industry is still in its infancy. The full integration of Spain and Portugal into the European Union the year after next will inevitably erode some of the preferential treatment its farm exports have enjoyed. As farming and food processing provide the livelihood of half the kingdom's 26m people, its well-being is a key to future social and political stability. In the eyes of Moroccans who have a stake in these matters, the sooner the uncertainty in its relations with the European Union ends, the better.</p>

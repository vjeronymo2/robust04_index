			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CASE OF KARAJAN'S NAZI PAST DROPPED  </P> <P> Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan was under investigation by the Justice  Department over allegations of involvement in Nazi persecution, but the case  against him was dropped when he died last month, a government lawyer said  today.  </P> <P> Had he lived, "there might have been a question of the watch list" -- putting  the famed musician on a list of people banned from the United States for their  Nazi pasts -- said Neal M. Sher who heads the Justice Department's Office of  Special Investigations.  </P> <P> Among the allegations were that Karajan might have worked for the Nazi security  police and might have had a role in ridding German orchestras of Jews and other  "non-Aryans," Sher said.  </P></p>

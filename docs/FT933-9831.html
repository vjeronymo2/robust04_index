			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Job prospects for school leavers 'very grim' JOB prospects for school leavers are 'very grim', Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday, David Owen writes. Launching a Labour survey on youth unemployment, Mr Dobson warned that this year's 16 to 19-year-olds could become 'a lost generation'. He added that unemployment among 18 and 19-year-olds had almost doubled in the three years to April. The Department of Employment said prospects for young people were better this year as the economy and the labour market were picking up.</p>

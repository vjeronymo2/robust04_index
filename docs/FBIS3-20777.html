			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Uros Komlenovic: "The Lords of Serbian Rulers </F> Street"]    [Text] Veljko Dzakula, former deputy prime minister of the  Serbian republic Krajina [RSK] and leader of the SDS [Serbian  Democratic Party] of Western Slavonia, is not the first  kidnapping victim in Belgrade: Before him a similar fate was  suffered by Dusan Reljic, VREME editor, and a year before that  by Jovan Mandic, chief of the research section of  Elektrodistribucija Beograd [Belgrade Power Company], the man  who during the St. Vitus Day rally turned off the street lights  in the vicinity for several moments. (The kidnapping of Sandzak  villagers and travelers from the train on the Belgrade-Bar  railroad is a separate chapter in the Balkan history of  dishonor.) However, by contrast with Reljic and Mandic, who were  released after lengthy interrogation (Reljic) and even beating  (Mandic), this time there is some question whether Veljko  Dzakula is alive. Five days after the kidnapping the information  service of the RSK MUP [ministry of internal affairs] issued a  news release stating that "Veljko Dzakula, who is the subject of  investigatory proceedings before the district court in Glina,  was again turned over to the competent authorities of the  Serbian republic Krajina on 4 February."  <H5>  This Is No Film </H5>   The kidnapping took place on 4 February at about 1130 hours  in Belgrade, at the corner of Serbian Rulers and Svetozar  Markovic. Thus, in the middle of the day and the busiest section  of the city. Incidentally, similar scenes have been seen many  times in detective films, but by contrast with the Hollywood  "professionals," who nimbly stuff the victim into a car and  vanish, leaving the confused pedestrians wondering whether it  all really did happen, reality here is quite different and  proves that in addition to brutality and a disturbing  self-confidence, Dzakula's kidnappers displayed a clumsiness  that would give gray hairs to the head of any respectable and  effective secret service.    Judging by the testimony of the numerous eyewitnesses, the  abduction took a long time and was painful to watch, to say the  least. As Veljko Dzakula and Dusan Ecimovic, former RSK  information minister, were walking down Serbian Rulers Street,  an unknown man accosted them and asked, "How are you, Mr.  Dzakula?" and with the help of two confederates immediately  grabbed the victim. Ecimovic, shoved out of the way, ran away as  a fourth kidnapper said to him, "You don't have to run."    Then there was a fight. Three of the abductors tried to  shove  Dzakula into a gray Japanese car (the witnesses do not agree on  whether it was a Toyota or Mazda), with the license plate BG 936  525, parked in a section of Svetozar Markovic Street that is set  back a bit, between the fence of a nearby construction site and  the pedestrian crosswalk. The car's rear right door was open,  but the former deputy prime minister of the Krajina government  had no intention of getting in and giving up without resistance.  In the fight and shoving he lost his glasses, the sleeve of his  coat was ripped off, and his appeals for help drew the attention  of a group of passersby who gathered at the crosswalk and  watched what was happening in disbelief. They were the  responsibility of the fourth abductor, who produced some kind of  credentials, representing himself as a policeman and warning  those gathered not to interfere with his colleagues. One  eyewitness noted that on the other side of Serbian Rulers Street  there was a strikingly nervous man holding a walkie-talkie, and  according to the statements of other witnesses, there were six  or seven people involved in the entire action. Unusual dialogue  was also recalled. When one of the gathered citizens asked, "Why  are you knocking him down?" this was the answer: "Well, you can  see that he doesn't want to go."    Chemistry was called upon as a last resort. The most  striking  of the abductors (a very tall and strong young man with  short-cropped blond hair, wearing a suit, a loud tie, and  sunglasses) at one point pulled out a spray can (it was probably  tear gas or something similar) and shot a stream in Dzakula's  face. It took a great deal of work to get the job done --  Dzakula was handcuffed, thrown into the car, and one of the  attackers gave him a powerful kick with both feet, holding to  the car roof, presumably to confirm the triumph. The rest of the  team got in another car, which was red (also Japanese, but no  one remembered the license plate number), and left the astounded  citizens to cross themselves in amazement.    It is worth pointing out that one of the eyewitnesses met  four policemen a bit later on the corner of Serbian Rulers and  Prince Milos and told them the whole story. Only one of them  wanted to listen to him (the rest went on their way without  turning around), but in the end he queried: "What can I do about  it?" and went off.  <H5>  Town Gossip </H5>   News about the abduction spread quickly through the city,  but  the speediest reaction came from the Citizens Alliance of Serbia  [GSS], which immediately sent a telegram to Slobodan Milosevic  and Zoran Sokolovic, minister of internal affairs, informing  them about the event and demanding Veljko Dzakula's release. A  Committee to Free Veljko Dzakula and Defend Political Freedoms,  headed by the Belgrade criminologist Vladan Vasilijevic, was  immediately formed (this is actually the same organization which  last June worked to get Danica and Vuk Draskovic freed). Nikola  Barovic, Borivoje Borovic and Boris Popovic, along with Dragor  Hiber (GSS)... were hired as attorneys. Depositions were taken  from witnesses, press releases were issued, information about  the abduction was made public at a press conference, and even  DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] was heard from. The Public  Security Service of the Serbian MUP [ministry of internal  affairs] denied any part in the abduction, and a similar  statement was issued by the RSK MUP. The State Security Service  [SDB] of Serbia was not heard from, although it is the one  accused of the abduction.    That is, one of the witnesses said that he heard the  attackers say they were from the Serbian SDB. What is more,  POLITIKA, alluding to statements from "well-informed sources,"  called attention to an official house next to the Security  Institute on Banjica, where members of the Serbian SDB are said  to be holding Veljko Dzakula prisoner.    The press release from the RSK MUP we have mentioned was  last  to arrive; it was probably supposed to put a stop to the talk  about the abduction. However, it had the opposite effect. The  Krajina MUP, that is, says that until recently Dzakula was in  custody of the competent court, but he had been released from  pretrial custody on the basis of a guarantee that he would not  leave the town where he lived (Pakrac). It goes on to say that  Dzakula is suspected of espionage and threatening territorial  integrity (it does not say which state's territory is in  question), but Articles 128 and 116 of the FRY Criminal Code are  mentioned?!    Until recently Dzakula was in fact in pretrial custody: on  21  September of last year he was arrested along with Dusan Ecimovic  and Mladen Kulic. The "first political prisoners of the RSK"  spent 72 days in prison (the first five days in Knin, and later  in Glina). They were charged because of the 11-point agreement  which they signed along with representatives of the Croatian  side on 18 February in the village Doljani, which is near  Daruvar. That agreement did not prejudice resolution of the  Serb-Croat conflict, but was an attempt to settle in some  fashion certain infrastructural issues (the express highway,  gas, mutual communication...), which was in any case of the  greatest interest to the "ordinary" Serbs and Croats in Western  Slavonia. Experts in international law say that the agreement  did not have the "weight" of an official intergovernmental act,  and they are thus contesting the charges of "espionage" and  "treason." That is why Dzakula, Ecimovic, and Kulic were  released from pretrial custody, and aside from the statement of  the RSK MUP made after the fact, there have no suggestions  whatsoever that their movement was limited.  <H5>  The Interview </H5>   It is of interest that all three traveled to Belgrade on 2  February, two days before the abduction. We have learned that  Dzakula came to Belgrade to see his wife and child (he had not  seen them for eight months) and to get food (2000 fryers) and  seed for planting in order to help the people of Pakrac get  through the winter somehow. On Thursday 3 February Veljko  Dzakula was a guest on the program "Viewers' Interview" of  Independent TV Studio B, where he recalled certain interesting  and neglected events, which is generally believed to have been  the reason for the abduction. He was abducted 11 hours after the  program.    In any case Veljko Dzakula's abduction gives rise to a  number  of extremely important questions: Who abducted him? Is he alive?  If he is, then where is he? Does he have the right to a lawyer  and an honest trial? Does the Krajina MUP have the right to  carry out such an action on the territory of the FRY? Does the  Serbian SDB have the right to cooperate in this way with its  counterparts on the other side of the Drina? Who is in control  of the Serbian SDB anyway? How long are the citizens of Serbia  going to put up with the most brutal violations of elementary  human rights?    Answers should be sought from Slobodan Milosevic, Zoran  Sokolovic, Jovica Stanisic, who heads the Serbian SDB, or Franko  "Frankie" Simatovic, the operative of the Serbian SDB  responsible for liaison with the Krajina, who, we have heard,  was recently promoted to head the operations department of the  SDB. Perhaps the case of Veljko Dzakula will be the one that  shows whether Serbia, at least in its pronouncements, is a  law-governed state, or in future will we all be living even  officially according to the "law" of Attila the Hun and Al  Capone?</p>

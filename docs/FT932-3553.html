			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Outcry at British Gas price moves PLANS BY British Gas to increase its transportation charges are threatening to drag the company into an embarrassing row with its regulator and competitors just as the inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into its business is drawing to a close. British Gas has proposed raising the fees it charges rival shippers for sending gas through its pipelines, in some cases by as much as 30 per cent. The company says it has been subsidising the transport charges of rivals for the past three years in an effort to encourage the development of competition. Mr John Huggins, director of gas transportation at British Gas, said: 'We reduced our charges to a point where we didn't recover our full costs in order to allow competition to happen.' British Gas is allowed to earn a 4.5 per cent rate of return on its pipelines business, but says it has not been achieving this. In a letter to shippers, Mr Huggins said even the new arrangements involved the company subsidising shippers' transport costs by Pounds 30m next year. Shippers say that British Gas has provided no figures to back up its claims. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, said: 'It's a one-sided conversation. We have no basis on which to judge the returns British Gas is getting from the system.' Ofgas, the regulator, is also sceptical about British Gas's claims. Other shippers suggest that British Gas is trying to maximise profits in its transpor tation arm because it sees its profits in the domestic mar ket eroded by strong regulation. British Gas says that the new charges have been in the pipeline for at least a year and shippers should have seen them coming. The company has deferred for a year further changes to its transport arrangements in response to pressure from competitors and Ofgas. Mr Huggins said: 'We consider we've gone far enough and will stand firm on this occasion.' The dispute centres on the planned charges by British Gas for connecting to the gas grid new industrial sites supplied by its rivals. In many cases these tariffs are 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher than charges levied on existing sites. Charges for existing sites will be increased in October next year. Several shippers have made formal complaints to Ofgas and some are in negotiations with British Gas to try to secure lower rates. Ofgas has asked British Gas to explain the reasoning behind the increases in a bid to resolve the dispute. Mr Greg MacGregor at Ofgas said: 'Ofgas has the ability to direct British Gas to adopt what we think of as appropriate transport terms, but we don't want it to get to that stage.'</p>

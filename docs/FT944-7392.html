			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Row over French media ban An amendment to French secrecy laws which would curb media coverage of corruption investigations came under fire yesterday from French magistrates and the press. The amendment, which was passed through the National Assembly late on Tuesday night, proposed a ban on reporting investigations until a suspect is brought to trial. It will become law if it is approved next month by the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament. Drafted by Mr Alain Marsaud, a Gaullist backbencher, the amendment prompted widespread criticism. Le Monde described it as an attack on liberty and said it violated freedom of speech. The newspaper questioned whether the party funding and corruption scandals which have emerged over recent years would have been brought to light if the media had not reported the findings of dogged magistrates. The USM magistrates' union said the amendment would stifle reporting of corruption scandals and that it was a way of 'putting the lid' on affairs which have shaken the French business and political establishment. Mr Marsaud said his amendment was designed to protect the presumption of innocence, which is 'daily flouted'.</p>

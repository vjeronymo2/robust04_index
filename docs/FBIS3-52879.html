Kusret Rasul sought Major's cooperation in bringing about a  partial lifting of the embargo to help "improve the material  situation of our people" in a letter handed to Britain's Lord  Archer who was in Kurdistan last week.    Lord Archer, better known as the author Jeffrey Archer,  addressed the Kurdish regional parliament on Wednesday and  delivered a message from Major, recognizing it.    Archer said Britain would contribute through the United  Nations, the European Community and directly to the humanitarian  aid budget pledged by the international community to the Kurdish  autonomous region.    The trade embargo was imposed on Iraq after its invasion of  Kuwait in August 1990. The northern Iraqi Kurdish autonomous  region is affected by the sanctions, being part of the country.</p>

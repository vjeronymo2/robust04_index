			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Faster growth expected than previously thought - The forecast The government is now predicting that economic growth will be faster, and inflation lower, than previously expected. Gross Domestic Product is expected to rise by 4 per cent in 1994, compared with the Treasury's summer forecast of 2.75 per cent. That is a rate last achieved in the Lawson boom of the mid-1980s. The forecast does assume that the pace of GDP growth will slow in 1995. 'This largely reflects much slower growth of North Sea output following the very large increases of the past couple of years,' according to the Treasury's Red Book. But the pace of growth will still be 3.25 per cent, compared with the Treasury's earlier estimate of 2.75 per cent. And if the oil and gas sector is excluded, GDP is projected to rise by 3.5 per cent in 1994 and by 3.25 per cent in 1995. The slight slowing in non-oil growth next year is a result of low growth in public spending and no increase in stockbuilding. These rates are much faster than the long-term trend rate of British growth, which is estimated to be between 2 and 2.5 per cent. Economic theory suggests that provided actual output growth is below its long-term trend, the so-called output gap will reduce inflationary pressures. But if this gap disappears, inflation will accelerate. The red book is optimistic on this score. 'The current size of the output gap cannot be estimated with any certainty,' it says, 'but there is almost certainly still a sizeable gap. In other words there is still spare capacity in the economy as a whole. 'This should allow the economy to continue growing faster than trend without any significant upward pressure upon prices.' The Treasury believes that 'there are grounds for thinking that currently reported levels of capacity utilisation represent less of a constraint on expansion and hence less of an inflationary threat than in the past. Under pressure to cut costs companies have probably been exploiting opportunities to use their existing capacity more efficiently.' Accordingly, the government is able to reduce its forecast for inflation in 1994 and 1995. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, is forecast to rise from 2 per cent in the current quarter to 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of next year. The Treasury's earlier estimate for next year was 2.75 per cent. The Treasury says that the pick-up in inflation next year will be prompted by manufacturers expanding margins and by higher commodity prices. 'But the rise is expected to be limited by the intensity of competition in the retail sector', says the report. Producer output price inflation is expected to rise to 3.25 per cent by mid-1995, but fall to 2.25 per cent by mid-1996 as upward pressure on margins eases and import cost inflation recedes. However, the Treasury is forecasting underlying inflation at only 2.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1996, in line with the government's aim of between 1 and 4 per cent by the end of this parliament. The Treasury is also optimistic about corporate investment, arguing that companies have already repaired their balance sheets after the recession. 'Companies in aggregate are now in reasonable financial shape and have little need to forego profitable investment opportunities for the sake of sustaining substantial financial surpluses,' says the red book. The Treasury forecasts that business investment is likely to grow by only 2 per cent in 1994 but by nearly 11 per cent in 1995. Fixed investment in the economy as a whole is expected to grow by 3.75 per cent in 1994 and 5.75 per cent in 1995. These buoyant economic forecasts may still not result in a feelgood factor. Consumers' incomes are being restrained. Real personal disposable income is expected to be static in 1994 and to grow by only 1.75 per cent next year. Despite this, consumer spending is forecast to grow as consumers reduce their savings rate. Consumption is expected to rise by 2.5 per cent in both 1994 and 1995, and the red book says there is 'much less evidence of any significant weakening since the tax rises in April and the trend in retail sales remains buoyant'. Another indicator of consumer confidence, the housing market, has been sluggish. The Treasury says the weakness may be the consequence of persistent negative equity and significant, though diminishing, repossessions. Furthermore, the 2 percentage-point rise in fixed rate mortgages may have kept some purchasers out of the market, and the reduction in mortgage interest relief may have had an impact. However, the red book adds: 'Housing market indicators point to renewed recovery.' Continued economic growth should lead to modest increases in both turnover and house prices next year. On unemployment, the government says that various factors will increase the number of people participating in the labour market and this means that unemployment is likely to fall less than employment rises.</p>

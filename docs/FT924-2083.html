			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: English hearing - Legal briefs Litigation between British Aerospace and Dee Howard of the US should be heard in an English court and not in America, the High Court has ruled. Dee Howard is suing BAe for Dollars 50m in a Texas court for alleged failure to provide materials under a technical assistance agreement for the re-engining of BAC 1-11 aircraft. BAe is counterclaiming Dollars 6m in unpaid invoices and damages for breach of contract. Mr Justice Waller ruled that the agreement between the companies contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause under English law. The judgment is considered by some lawyers as an important clarification of English law on exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30-CAR PILEUP SHUTS VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE  </P> <P> A "massive chain-reaction collision" involving 30 cars and as many as 14  separate accidents shut down traffic on the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro  for 2 1/2 hours early Tuesday, according to the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Despite the amount of property damage -- one CHP officer described it as "just  a mass of damaged vehicles pointed in all directions" -- no one was seriously  injured.  </P> <P> The bumper-car-style pileup began at 5:45 a.m. when one car rear-ended another.  From the first crunch to the last bump, the incident lasted just 13 minutes.  During the pileup, a jackknifed truck blocked both eastbound lanes of the  bridge and a car caught fire when a motorcycle slid underneath it.  </P> <P> "Basically," said CHP Officer Ken Ratcliff, "it was just a bunch of collisions  one after another that just blocked the whole bridge. . . . It stretched out  for approximately 300 yards on the bridge -- 30 damaged vehicles, some turned  backwards, some turned crossways."  </P> <P> Two people suffered minor injuries. Motorcyclist James Lord, 34, fell off his  bike before it slid under the car and fractured his foot.  </P> <P> And the driver of one of the cars involved in the first collision, Flordileno  Lahep, 47, of Gardena, suffered neck strain.  </P> <P> Both were treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Long Beach.  </P> <P> There was no damage to the bridge itself and no damage estimate was immediately  available for the cars.  </P> <P> Bridge workers and Caltrans officials said Tuesday's pileup was the biggest  accident on the 26-year-old Vincent Thomas in recent memory.  </P> <P> The bridge, which connects San Pedro to Terminal Island, is a commuting route  for hundreds who work on the industrial island in Los Angeles Harbor.  </P> <P> According to Ratcliff, the first collision, in which Lahep's car rear-ended  another, occurred on a curve just over the crest of the bridge. The road was  somewhat slick, because of morning dew, but officials have not said what caused  the initial crash.  </P> <P> By the time other drivers spotted the crash, he said, it was too late for them  to slow down to avoid it.  </P> <P> Both sides of the bridge were reopened at about 8:15 a.m., Ratcliff said.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: British machine tool hopes THE BRITISH machine tool industry is hoping to increase its exports to the US following a successful trade mission for the automotive and related industries, such as construction equipment. A dozen senior executives from companies such as General Motors, Caterpillar, Deere and Dana have just completed a week touring UK machine tool factories. The mission was organised by the UK's Machine Tool Technologies Association, with financial support from the Department of Trade and Industry. Increasing exports to the US, the world's third biggest consumer of machine tools, is particularly important for the British machine tool industry. Last year the US regained from Germany its position as the UK's biggest single export market for machine tools, with equipment worth Pounds 50.8m sold there. This year the German market has continued to fall while the US is recovering, albeit slowly, as customers in manufacturing industry become more confident about buying capital equipment. Imports accounted for approximately 45 per cent of the Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.6bn) US market last year.</p>

It is not even necessary to be a member of a trade union any longer. Have Pounds 25 ready and you are promised five days of fun with the brothers and sisters. Top of the bill is Labour leader John Smith, followed by the canny Padraig Flynn, European Community social affairs commissioner, making his first appearance on the TUC stage. Fans of retiring TUC general secretary Norman 'Ramblo' Willis will also be anxious to catch his performance as he struggles with his girth and his syntax for one last time. The TUC, desperate to drum up some interest in its affairs, is advertising the event as 'a unique opportunity to hear trade unions discuss the key industrial issues of our time'.

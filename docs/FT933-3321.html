			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (2): From profligacy to investment - Foreword by the director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation / Neil Johnson argues there is not enough productive capacity in the UK I AM delighted that the Financial Times is giving such a high profile to engineering, the largest of the UK's manufacturing industries. By showing readers the vital contribution that engineering makes to national prosperity, what engineers actually do and what is happening in the industry in other countries, the Financial Times is helping to correct the anti-industrial bias which still exists in Britain. This survey is a bold and imaginative step which will help to keep engineering firmly on the national agenda. Engineering is important. It employs 1.7m people, contributes some 8 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product and provides 36 per cent of the UK's total exports of all goods and services - an essential and irreplaceable part of our international trade. Engineering products provide the main technological basis for growth of productivity and living standards throughout the economy. However, we cannot take engineering for granted. If the UK is to remain an advanced and prosperous nation, it must recognise fully the vital importance of its engineering industry - as do the world's most successful economies in Europe, America and Asia. That means building a bigger industry for there is simply not enough productive capacity in UK engineering. We have expectations for living standards which the economy will be unable to deliver in the immediate future. It will be unable to deliver them at all unless we rebuild our industry. Investment is the key to economic recovery. For over 20 years we have gradually increased the proportion of national output we consume, increased our borrowings from overseas and reduced the proportion we reinvest. Today, we spend more than we earn and consume more than we can afford. Our profligacy has caught up with us. To recover from recession, we must have a massive increase in investment, reversing the trend of the last 20 years. There was a surge of investment in the late 1980s, but much of that was misdirected into financial services and over-expansion of office and retail property which was not actually needed. Even including the property boom, net new investment as a proportion of national output did not reach the levels that were normal in the 1960s and early 1970s. Almost all investment goods are provided by just two sectors of the economy  -the engineering manufacturing sector and the construction sector. But neither they nor other sectors of the economy are encouraged to undertake long-term investment. The government is now showing signs of recognising the importance of engineering and manufacturing, but the acid test will be the measures the chancellor takes in his November budget. To secure rising living standards in the later 1990s, we must rebalance our spending today. Putting more of our national output into investment now will mean spending less of it on consumption. That will mean at best slow growth of living standards and could well mean a standstill for several years. That will be difficult for politicians to accept, but it is a reality which cannot be avoided for much longer.</p>

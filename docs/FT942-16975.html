			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Telegraph pays directors Pounds 2.72m Directors of The Telegraph newspaper group received total emoluments of Pounds 2.72m in 1993, up from Pounds 1.51m the previous year. A large part of the increase represented a one-off Pounds 480,000 payment to Mr Daniel Colson for his work in connection with the group's investment in John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, where he is chief executive. That bonus made Mr Colson the highest paid director in 1993, receiving Pounds 692,000. Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph, received an increase from Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 237,000. In addition, The Telegraph pays two thirds of the cost of Mr Black's office at Hollinger, The Telegraph's parent, and pays Hollinger for other services, such as advice on acquisitions. These costs totalled Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 813,000). During 1993, The Telegraph and Hollinger combined to take a 18.7 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper publisher.</p>

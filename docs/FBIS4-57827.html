			<p>BFN     [Text] Today in Rome, Cuba's new ambassador to Italy Mario  Rodriguez Martinez asserted that he is impressed by Italian  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, to whom Rodriguez presented his  credentials on 23 May. Rodriguez told journalists that Scalfaro  turned out to be very much aware of the problems of Cuba and  Latin America.    Rodriguez replaces Javier Ardizones, who was Cuba's  ambassador to Italy for 10 years. Rodriguez added that among his  goals are that of maintaining and further developing the already  good political, economic, and trade relations with Italy and  that of spreading the truth about Cuba.    Rodriguez was very much interested in getting to know the  new  Italian Government, which defines itself as centrist, and he  reiterated that he is very pleased to have met with Scalfaro.</p>

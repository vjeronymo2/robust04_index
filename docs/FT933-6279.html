			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris, Madrid, Lisbon set new record highs FRANCE and Spain in particular thought positively yesterday but investment decisions elsewhere were not made easier by opposing views on Europe and the US from two big UK merchant banks, writes Our Markets Staff. Baring Securities overweighted continental Europe (especially Germany) and underweighted the US within a flow of funds approach to global strategy published yesterday; on Thursday, Kleinwort Benson moved in the opposite direction. PARIS shot forward to set a new record high of 2,198 in the CAC-40 index during the session before late profit-taking dragged it back to close up 10.27 at 2,183.88, a week's rise of 2.6 per cent. Turnover was estimated at FFr4.2bn. Kleinwort Benson, in its latest French equity review, forecast that the CAC-40 could reach 2,300-2,350 by the end of the year as lower interest rates begin to take hold. The brokers added that they did not expect a fall in the index because of poor corporate profits: 'The worse the figures are, the faster and further interest rates will have to be brought down.' BSN was one of the few issues to go against the trend, falling FFr16 to FFr912. The stock was affected by news that Heineken of the Netherlands was recalling bottles, made by BSN's Dutch subsidiary, because of an alleged bottling fault. Bouygues put on FFr18 to FFr727 after announcing that one of its divisions had won a FFr1.3bn contract to build the terminal for the Hong Kong metro linking the new airport to Kowloon. FRANKFURT began by incorporating, and adding to, its post-bourse fall on Thursday after the Bundesbank's decision not to cut its key interest rates. But the DAX index recovered from a low of 1,887.83 to close 3.45 up on the day, and 0.9 per cent down on the week at 1,904.60. Dealers gave the credit to short-covering before the weekend and renewed optimism on interest rates. However, turnover eased from DM6.8bn to DM6.7bn. Enthusiasm was curbed by the approach of the UK bank holiday on Monday, and the renewed weakness in the dollar which hit big German exporters on Thursday. Retailers were weak. Revised sales figures, and a forecast of higher 1993 profits from Kaufhof did not stop the shares falling DM6.50 to DM530. Karstadt, Germany's largest department store chain, fell DM13.50 to DM576 on a 2 per cent rise in first half sales, profits below expectations and no hope of a second half improvement. AMSTERDAM recovered some of Thursday's losses and the CBS Tendency index ended 0.6 higher at 128.1, barely changed over the week. News that Heineken was to recall and destroy 17m bottles of its export brand after glass splinters were discovered in some batches initially took the shares down to a day's low of Fl 180.20; but they later recovered to end up 80 cents at Fl 186.00. Analysts remarked that the news was unlikely to have a long-term effect on the brewer's earnings. Among other major stocks, ABN Amro added 60 cents to Fl 67.20 on news of better-than-expected interim figures and plans for a rights issue, while DSM, which had fallen sharply on Thursday over worries in the European chemicals sector, regained Fl 1.70 to Fl 96.30. MADRID broke the 300 barrier, the general index closing 3.45 higher at 302.97, up 3.8 per cent on the week with the support of interest rate hopes and the rise in the Spanish bond market. Turnover shot up from Pta27bn to about Pta36.8bn. Most banks and some construction shares were strong, but one of the biggest individual rises was in Ercros, the chemcial group controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office, which reported a cut in net losses and rose Pta20 to Pta154. MILAN was firmer in fairly active trading helped by the government's decision after the close on Thursday to give the go ahead for a number of public construction projects, including a high-speed train link. The Comit index put on 3.70 to 627.91, a week's rise of 2.2 per cent. In the construction sector Italcementi added L382 to L12,330 and Italmobiliare, the holding company, L1,168 to L44,450. Unicem, the cement manufacturer, rose L140 to L10,100. STOCKHOLM rebounded sharply after several days of declines, the Affarsvarlden general index adding 19.2 to 1,270.2, down 3 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to SKr1.64bn. The bank and insurance sector index climbed 3.4 per cent with Handelsbanken up SKr11 to SKr129, and S-E Banken up SKr2 to SKr76. SCA B fell SKr2 to SKr129 after announcing a SKr1.4bn rights issue while Volvo B rose SKr16 to SKr470 after Thursday's good interim figures. LISBON reported another spurt of foreign buying as the BTA index rose 43.0 to a new 1993 high of 2,565.0, 2.8 per cent higher on the week. ISTANBUL added 2.1 per cent to settle at a new record high, the composite index adding 244.1 to 12,020.6 for a week's gain of 8 per cent. Turnover was about TL1,200bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- August 27                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1298.46   1300.67   1303.12   1304.94 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1393.66   1395.87   1397.19   1396.34  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1306.43   1308.24   1309.04   1308.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1399.46   1401.07   1401.17   1397.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 26    Aug 25    Aug 24    Aug 23    Aug 20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1298.46   1310.93   1296.82   1291.83   1297.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1384.05   1385.62   1375.46   1374.00   1380.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1310.26 ; 200 -  1402.62 Low/day: 100 -  1298.40  200 -  1392.13 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

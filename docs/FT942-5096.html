			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Bosnia talks get under way Talks on a comprehensive ceasefire in Bosnia got under way yesterday ,four days late and in an atmosphere of belligerence and suspicion. The mainly Moslem Bosnian government ended its boycott of the United Nations-sponsored talks yesterday, following the withdrawal of armed Serbs from a 3km exclusion zone around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. However, Mr Yasushi Akashi, who heads UN operations in Bosnia, failed in his effort to bring the two sides to the same negotiating table, damping hopes that a nationwide ceasefire was a real possibility. Mr Akashi put to each side separately a draft UN plan which reportedly includes an initial four-month ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons from front lines and the separation of forces by interposition of UN troops. The plan would require at least 5,000 extra UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The Bosnian government favours a short truce, fearing that a four-month ceasefire would effectively freeze existing battle lines and leave the Bosnian Serbs in possession of territory seized by force. The Bosnian Serb side wants a permanent ceasefire, or one lasting at least six months.</p>

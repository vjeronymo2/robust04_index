			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The United States has  proposed an additional five areas of trade be upgraded to  "priority" sectors for the bilateral trade framework talks which  the two countries announced Tuesday [24 May] to resume,  government sources said Wednesday.    The U.S. Government has suggested that financial services,  glass, intellectual property, lumber, and antitrust policy and  deregulation be added to the list of priority areas for  negotiations.    Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging  framework, are government procurement of telecommunications and  medical equipment, insurance, and autos and auto parts.    The sources said the Japanese Government will basically  accept the U.S. proposal, except for lumber.    The proposal was made during vice ministerial-level talks in  Washington which led to the reopening of the framework  negotiations.    The trade framework talks were agreed last July as a means  of  reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus with the U.S., but hit a  snag in February this year due to a discord over a U.S. demand  for "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese  market.    The two countries agreed to reopen the talks Tuesday.    Of the five categories, which were all included in the  original framework, negotiations over deregulation concern  Japanese regulations over distribution.    The U.S. had suggested by February more than 40 items of  changes in Japanese policies on deregulation and antitrust law.    For financial services, Japan has been asked to deregulate  management of pension and pension funds.    The U.S. also wants Japan to make efforts to increase the  share of foreign products in the Japanese sheet glass market.    Japan also has been pressed to harmonize its patents  protection system with the U.S. patent system to prevent copying  by Japanese firms of U.S.-made computer software.</p>

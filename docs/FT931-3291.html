			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nike shares up on record earnings SHARES in Nike climbed more than 5 per cent yesterday after the company posted record third-quarter earnings. The shares advanced Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 76 3/8. Although the results were in line with expectations, investors were encouraged by a jump in 'futures' orders and news that Nike's US footwear business had its strongest quarter in two years. The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, said orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between March and July climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 1.65bn. It warned that these orders were not necessarily indicative of total revenues for successive periods. Nike's net income for the quarter to February rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Dollars 82.5m, or Dollars 1.08. Revenues advanced 12.1 per cent to Dollars 972m, against Dollars 867m. For the first nine months, Nike's net earnings advanced 11.5 per cent to Dollars 288.1m, or Dollars 3.74, from Dollars 258.5m, or Dollars 3.38.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter called a press conference at the Thongil House [as  received] in the north side portion of Panmunjom today before  leaving the DPRK.    He arrived in Pyongyang on June 15.    He told local and foreign reporters that his trip to the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea was positive. He said,  "All my discussions with President Kim Il-song were very open,  frank and without restraint and I think the result is positive."    He added that direct talks between the DPRK and the United  States can be resumed.    He said North Korea's graphite moderated reactor system will  be replaced by a light water reactor system.    "Overall questions about nuclear weapons can be resolved,"  he  said.    He said he thinks "sanctions" are definitely a serious  mistake. "If the things continue to go well there is no need to  consider sanctions any more."    "I have never thought sanctions are effective or necessary,"  he said. "Hope now my government will agree that the crisis is  over and the sanctions are no more necessary for consideration."  [sentence as received]    Giving his impressions of Korea, he said the most exciting  impression was made when he witnessed the performance of  children in Pyongyang yesterday. "This was the most remarkable  performance I have seen in my life," he added.    "Hope the whole world will see the children of North Korea  as  we appreciated yesterday," he said. [sentence as received]    He said he will strive with sincerity for harmony between  the  two countries.</p>

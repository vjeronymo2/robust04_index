The Secretary takes this action for reasons stated elsewhere in this notice. The postponement is designed to make the CAN as useful as possible to the educational community and other parties interested in programs administered by the Department.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On June 10, 1994 the Secretary published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 30190) the first section of the CAN for FY 1995. Included in that document were individual notices inviting applications for new awards under 65 programs and competitions. These were direct grant and fellowship programs administered mainly by the Office of Postsecondary Education and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. Since June 10 a number of other programs have published application notices for new awards for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the document published on June 10, the Secretary announced the Department's intent to publish a second section of the CAN for FY 1995 in September, 1994. However, legislation authorizing or reauthorizing many of the Department's remaining programs has only recently been passed by the Congress. This legislation includes programs administered by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, some programs of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, and some programs of the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These programs could not publish application notices in September without enacted legislation authorizing the programs and, in some cases, without necessary implementing regulations or notices of funding priorities. Thus, the Secretary believes it would be more helpful to the Department's customers to delay publication of the second section of the CAN until a time when application notices for most of these programs can be published or, at least, listed with an estimated date for publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to awards under programs affected by reauthorization, awards under some other programs and competitions are to be governed by new regulations or funding priorities that have not yet been issued in final form. Still other programs and competitions must delay publication of application notices for FY 1995 pending approval of application forms by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary estimates that publication of section two of the CAN for FY 1995 will take place before the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1995. That document will (1) include any individual application notices ready for publication at the time, (2) reference all application notices for FY 1995 previously announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including those contained in section one of the CAN, which was published on June 10, 1994, and (3) give estimated dates for programs and competitions for which application notices are to be published at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, the Department will continue to publish individual application notices when they are ready.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For further information about a program, please write to that program at the U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Call to help long-term jobless Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, highlighted the problem of structural unemployment in his Budget but failed to provide sufficient resources to tackle long-term unemployment, the Employment Policy Institute, the independent think-tank, says in its economic report published today. The institute says the funding cut for the Training for Work scheme could be justified by the poor track record of such programmes to get people into work. But if Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, is serious about improving training provision, he should conduct a review of adult training schemes and consult on possible reforms.</p>

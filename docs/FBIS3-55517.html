Ryabov,  followed by Decree No. 162 of the Russian Federation Central  Electoral Commission "On Scheduling the Elections of Deputies of  the Federation Council and the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly in the Chechen Republic," dated  Moscow, 5 January 1994 and signed by Russian Federation Central  Electoral Commission Chairman N.T. Ryabov and Russian Federation  Central Electoral Commission Secretary V.A. Zagulyayev]    [Text] The Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission  proposes to the people and leadership of the Chechen Republic  that they examine and resolve positively the question of the  Chechen Republic's participation in the elections to the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly in March 1994.    In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, the  Chechen Republic was and still is a fully equal component  [subyekt] of Russia and must by rights be worthily represented  in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly.    By means of their active stance and their daily dialogue  with  colleagues from other parts of Russia the newly elected Federal  Assembly deputies from the Chechen Republic could make an  appreciable contribution to eliminating the problems that exist  today.    For its part the Russian Federation Central Electoral  Commission is ready to provide organizational and financial  backup in holding the elections to the Federal Assembly from the  Chechen Republic.    We are convinced that, given good will and the desire for  happiness and prosperity for the peoples of our common  multinational motherland -- Russia -- a second appeal on this  question will elicit understanding and a positive decision from  the people and the leadership of the Chechen Republic.    With very best wishes,    [Signed] N.T. Ryabov, chairman of the Russian Federation  Central Electoral Commission    [Dated] 5 January 1994    The elections of deputies of the Federation Council and the  State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly were not  held in the Chechen Republic 12 December 1993.    For the purposes of ensuring the right, provided for in the  Russian Federation Constitution, of citizens of the Russian  Federation to participate in the management of affairs of state  and to elect and be elected to federal organs of state power,  the Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission decrees:    The elections of the deputies of the Federation Council of  the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in the No. 20 two-seat  electoral district and of the deputy of the State Duma of the  Russian Federation Federal Assembly in the No. 32 single-seat  electoral district formed by the Russian Federation Central  Electoral Commission on the territory of the Chechen Republic  are to be scheduled for 13 March 1994.    The report of the scheduling of the elections in the Chechen  Republic is to be published in the press.    [Signed] N.T. Ryabov, chairman of the Russian Federation  Central Electoral Commission    V.A. Zagulyayev, secretary of the Russian Federation Central  Electoral Commission    [Dated] 5 January 1994</p>

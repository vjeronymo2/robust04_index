			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEIMERT LIVING  </P> <P> I appreciated the article about Leimert Park (At Home, April 2).  </P> <P> According to your statistics, I am one of the 3.7% white residents of Leimert.  I moved into the neighborhood very recently after having lived in apartments in  Santa Monica, Westwood and West Hollywood. I now own my own home.  </P> <P> A typical two-bedroom house in Leimert Park currently goes for about $160,000.  For this type of money, there is no place in Los Angeles with the mix of  convenience, location, neighborhood pride and simple straightforward beauty  like Leimert. I can think of many neighborhoods on the Westside with far more  graffiti.  </P> <P> I invite Angelenos who have never been to this part of town to educate  themselves. Come to Leimert for a Sunday drive and also check out the new  shopping center and beautiful adjacent hillside neighborhoods of View Park and  Windsor Hills. I guarantee a surprise.  </P> <P> RANDALL E. ADAMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

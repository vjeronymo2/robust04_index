			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIPELINE WORK EXPECTED TO TIE UP TRAFFIC;  </P> <P> MOBIL OIL: IMPACT REPORT SUGGESTS SUSPENDING WORK DURING RUSH HOURS,  UNDERGROUND TUNNELING AND NIGHT WORK IN NON-RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  </P> <P> Construction of Mobil Oil Corp.'s proposed new pipeline would create  bumper-to-bumper traffic -- and in some instances gridlock -- in the San  Fernando Valley and on the Westside, according to an environmental impact  report.  </P> <P> The report recommends mitigation measures, such as suspending construction work  during rush hours, tunneling underground where utility lines allow, and working  at night in industrial and commercial neighborhoods.  </P> <P> But those suggestions offered little assurance to some traffic-weary activists,  who predicted that commuting during work on the $88-million project will go  from bad to worse -- particularly because at least one lane in roadways and  intersections will have to be closed.  </P> <P> "You just can't do that in already gridlocked streets," said Don Schultz,  president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. "I don't understand how they can do  this work, regardless of the hours, without impacting the traffic flow."  </P> <P> Schultz and others also said they remain deeply skeptical of Mobil's motives in  replacing an existing, deteriorating, pipeline.  </P> <P> Fresh in the minds of opponents is the failed attempt two years ago by a group  of oil companies to build the so-called Angeles Pipeline, which would have  brought 330,000 barrels of crude oil a day 135 miles south from Bakersfield to  the Los Angeles Basin. The plan failed because of community opposition.  </P> <P> Mobil was not part of the Angeles Pipeline consortium and its proposed, 92-mile  pipeline would be narrower than the L.A. project. However, the new Mobil  pipeline still would increase by a third the current pipeline's capacity, the  report says.  </P> <P> The existing pipeline, which ranges in size from 10 to 16 inches wide, carries  about 60,000 barrels of crude oil a day. The new pipeline, which would be a  standard 16 inches in diameter, would carry more than 90,000 barrels a day, the  report says.  </P> <P> Some critics of the project said they not only fear breaks and leaks in their  neighborhoods but that the larger pipeline could be used by Mobil later to  justify an expansion of its Torrance refinery.  </P> <P> "We understand it needs to be replaced," said Mary Edwards, secretary of the  North Valley Coalition, "but we hope it's not enlarged, because there is  certainly no need to bring in more crude oil into this basin, which is already  the most polluted place in the United States.  </P> <P> "We're really frightened they'll be given license to expand under the guise of  making it safer," Edwards said.  </P> <P> Dean Hargis, who directed the environmental study for the consulting firm Dames  &amp; Moore, said his staff was told by Mobil in a "very clear statement" that  there is "no proposed expansion of the refinery in connection with this."  </P> <P> Hargis said the firm's research shows that Mobil's pipeline capacity into  Torrance exceeds its refinery's production capacity. That means Mobil would  have to modify the refinery itself to increase output, according to Hargis, who  said that process would require a separate set of permits and full review.  </P> <P> As proposed, the new Mobil pipeline would run south from Kern County to  Torrance, passing through the Westside for about 12 miles, following Sepulveda  Boulevard most of the way.  </P> <P> The report says at least one travel lane in roads and intersections will have  to be closed to accommodate construction.  </P> <P> As a result, the report predicts extensive congestion "during most periods of  the day" along Sepulveda Boulevard from the San Fernando Valley through  Sepulveda Pass all the way to the Marina Freeway interchange in Culver City.  </P> <P> The report noted that many Sepulveda Boulevard intersections already suffer  "overcapacity conditions" at rush hour. During construction, vehicles traveling  on Sepulveda toward the following intersections can expect to wait through  several light changes before getting through Wilshire, Olympic, Pico, National,  Venice, Washington and Santa Monica boulevards.  </P> <P> Construction will also aggravate congestion at Slauson and Jefferson  boulevards, and will restrict access to the nearby Fox Hills Mall.  </P> <P> The interruptions at a given site would last from about a week to three weeks,  Hargis said, and the entire project, from Kern County to Torrance, would take  about 18 months.  </P></p>

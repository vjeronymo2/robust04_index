			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (7): The price of progress - Paul Quigley compares tariffs on the GSM digital cellular networks around the world As mobile telecommunications become part of the central information highway within businesses both large and small, the technology itself will be of less significance than the cost benefits it delivers. Yet, while GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is taking up an unassailable position as a world-wide technical standard for next generation digital cellular communications, wide variations in tariffs remain. Connection charges, and monthly access and call charges - the individual chargeable elements of GSM operators' tariffs - all show striking differences . Some GSM carriers, operating in markets with limited or no competition, can exploit their domestic market by offering inflated tariffs compared with those of neighbouring countries. Others, in highly competitive cellular markets, are offering low GSM tariffs on a par with existing analogue cellular tariffs. Where value-added tax (VAT) rates are high, such as in Denmark (25 per cent), Sweden (25 per cent), and Finland (22 per cent), GSM tariffs are still among the lowest. But in countries where VAT rates are lower, such as Luxembourg (15 per cent) or where there is no tax to pay, such as in Switzerland, GSM tariffs are often high. Over the last twelve months, more than 60 per cent of GSM operators have reduced prices for peak rate call charges. The largest reductions in prices have been made by Comvik in Sweden, and by the two Portuguese operators, TMN and Telecel. France Telecom and its rival network, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone (SFR) have also reduced peak rate call charges by around 20 per cent, but are still the highest in overall cost terms. In Switzerland and Luxembourg, peak rate call charges have increased by 64 per cent and 55 per cent respectively in the last year, as the Swiss and Luxembourg telecoms authorities make the most of the absence of competition in GSM. At the other extreme, Dansk Mobiltelefon which has more than 70,000 subscribers on its Sonofon network, compared with around 5,000 at this time last year, has increased peak rate call charges which were previously much too low. How do tariffs line up for a typical user on the business tariff rate who uses a GSM telephone within the boundaries of the home network for thirty minutes per day, during the peak rate period, for five days a week, over a forty-eight week year? French users are likely to be paying the highest prices for GSM. France Telecom's Itineris network which has been in commercial service for nearly two years has the highest overall cost at present, and a fairly low subscriber total of around 150,000. SFR tariffs are also high in relation to other countries. Total costs have, nevertheless, fallen on both French GSM networks by up to 20 per cent over the last year. In Germany, where GSM is experiencing rapid growth (with more than 1.2 million subscribers), tariffs are also high. Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the D2-Privat network operator, and Deutsche Telekom Mobil's D1 network have maintained high tariffs levels because of overwhelming demand, but D2 is down overall while D1 is up on last year. Vodafone of the UK has reduced tariffs some 17.5 per cent in the face of growing domestic competition. In Italy, state operator, SIP continues to exploit its monopoly position ahead of the award of the second GSM operator licence this year, as does Belgacom Mobile in Belgium. There are other variables affecting overall GSM cost. 'Unitisation' - the way a call's duration is divided into time slices - varies from periods of one second for some operators to sixty seconds for others. Unitisation of calls is an area where GSM operators can differentiate themselves from competitors. In addition, some GSM operators charge a 'multiplier' based on a percentage of the particular type of call made, such as whether it is a domestic call or a cross-border 'roaming' call. The cost of GSM terminals can vary widely, too, from one country to another. New GSM services this year have been set up or are being opened in Jersey, Latvia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates. Second operators are also starting services in countries where there is already a GSM operator in the market. These include Germany (with the launch at the end of May of the DCS 1800 network, E-Plus) as well as Cyprus, Hungary, and Italy. Beyond 1994, it is expected that Russia and China will launch regional and provincial GSM networks, and GSM off-shoot, PCS 1900, is expected to make big inroads in the US digital cellular market. In the meantime, the mass consumer market is being invited to join the personal communications revolution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------             Costs compared: GSM digital cellular tariffs                             Currency: Ecu  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Country            GSM operator  Connec'n  Monthly      Call      Call                                    charge   access   charge:   charge:                                                         Peak  Off-peak  --------------------------------------------------------------------- AUSTRIA             PTV Austria     33.25    28.82      0.39      0.25 BELGIUM                Belgacom     90.69    45.34      0.38      0.19 DENMARK      Dansk Mobiltelefon     74.31     8.07      0.28      0.14                     TeleDanmark     74.31     8.49      0.30      0.15 FINLAND         Telecom Finland      6.39     7.99      0.23      0.13              Radiolinja Finland      5.24     7.86      0.26      0.13 FRANCE           France Telecom     53.05    37.89      0.61      0.38                      SFR France     53.05    37.89      0.56      0.38 GERMANY  Deutsche Telekom Mobil     33.81    36.41      0.62      0.25            Mannesmann Mobilfunk     35.37    35.37      0.63      0.25 GREECE           Panafon Greece     86.32    34.53      0.32      0.16                     STET Hellas     86.32    34.53      0.32      0.16 HONG KONG   SmartTone Hong Kong    112.10    45.59      0.27      0.13           Hong Kong Telecom CSL     89.68   103.69      0.27      0.17 HUNGARY      Westel 900 Hungary    209.74    22.65      0.23      0.14 IRELAND         Eircell Ireland     63.74    25.50      0.32      0.22 ITALY                 SIP Italy    108.57    27.48      0.36      0.11 LUXEMBOURG           P&amp;T LuxGSM     75.57    50.38      0.45      0.45 NORWAY        Tele-mobil Norway      9.82     4.91      0.33      0.29                   Netcom Norway      0.00     3.93      0.35      0.29 PORTUGAL           TMN Portugal     41.80    32.23      0.36      0.16                Telecel Portugal     45.32    32.73      0.37      0.19 SOUTH AFRICA   MTN South Africa     17.73    29.55      0.24      0.14            Vodacom South Africa     17.73    29.55      0.24      0.14 SWEDEN     Telia Mobitel Sweden     33.54     6.71      0.30      0.13                   Comvik Sweden     32.98    11.18      0.22      0.12                NordicTel Sweden     39.13    10.62      0.32      0.16 SWITZERLAND           Swiss PTT     48.61    39.50      0.46      0.30 TURKEY              PTT Turkcel    168.63     3.93      0.15      0.15                    PTT Teknotel    168.93     3.93      0.15      0.15 UK                      Vodafon     65.02    32.51      0.33      0.13 AUSTRALIA     Telecom Australia     40.44    21.78      0.30      0.15                    Optus Mobile     28.00    21.78      0.25      0.12                    Vodafone Pty     40.04    21.78      0.26      0.13  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Data source: Paul Quigley  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

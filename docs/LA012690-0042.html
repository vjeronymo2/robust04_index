			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / STAGE: USIU THEATER COMPANY DECIDES TO PASS ON 'DOLLY'  </P> <P> Goodby, Dolly! -- at least for now. The International Musical Theatre Company  of USIU is canceling its February production of "Hello, Dolly!" at the Lyceum  Stage, and rescheduling it for the opening of next season at the Theatre in Old  Town. Despite rumors to the contrary, the financially troubled university is  not canceling for financial reasons, according to a USIU spokeswoman , but  because "We've just concluded with regret that it's too big a bone for these  kids to chew at this time."  </P> <P> Instead, United States International University subscribers will get "Talking  with . . . " at the Theatre in Old Town March 15-25. And, at the Lyceum, San  Francisco producer and theater owner Charles H. Duggan, who already had a slot  reserved at the Lyceum Stage, will use the extra time to present "Ain't  Misbehavin'," the Tony-award winning tribute to the music of Fats Waller, with  the original New York cast Feb. 13-March 4, and "Jeeves Takes Charge" with its  original London star, Edward Duke, March 13-April 1.  </P> <P> "Ain't Misbehavin'," which closed Sunday in Dallas, will leave San Diego for an  April 3-29 Tokyo run in a 1,000-seat theater, with a possible one-week stopover  in Osaka, before returning to San Francisco.  </P> <P> Duggan had been negotiating until the eleventh hour for the San Diego rights to  "Nunsense," which he had produced in San  </P> <P> Francisco with Phyllis Diller. But the rights were not to be released for this  city until the end of April, too close to the beginning of the San Diego  Repertory Theatre season, he said from his office in San Francisco. Still,  "Nunsense," starring Diller, is a good bet for next year, he said.  </P> <P> "Jeeves Takes Charge" was licensed by Duggan for an Old Globe Theatre  production in 1988, but with San Diego actor Don Sparks in the one-man show  under Duke's direction. Duggan doesn't think that will hurt sales for a "Jeeves  Takes Charge," with the original London star -- Duke, directed by Gillian  Lynne, the choreographer for "Phantom of the Opera" and "Cats."  </P> <P> After all, he points out, the audiences came out strongly for Duggan's  production of "Greater Tuna" with the original cast at the Lyceum Stage last  year, which was four years after the Old Globe had produced their own version  of "Greater Tuna" with their own cast (which included Larry Drake, now an  Emmy-winning regular on "L.A. Law").  </P> <P> USIU, coincidentally, also had a successful run with a student cast for "Ain't  Misbehavin' " in 1988.  </P> <P> And, for "Greater Tuna" groupies, Duggan reports that the sequel to "Greater  Tuna," called "Tuna Christmas," is alive and well and playing at the Kennedy  Center in Washington. The Texas-inspired show, still running in San Francisco  after six years, was evidently a big hit with President Bush, who took his  wife, Barbara, to see the show on their 45th wedding anniversary, and followed  up the show with a breakfast for the Bushes and "Greater Tuna" stars Jaston  Williams and Joe Sears.  </P> <P> The show is due to close at the Kennedy Center on Feb. 4, which is "about the  longest you push a Christmas show," Duggan said. But there will be a final  performance at the White House on Feb. 28 for the Governor's Conference in the  East Room.  </P> <P> Duggan has already proposed producing "Tuna Christmas" at the Lyceum in time  for the holiday season, but said if he is turned down (because of the show's  possible conflict with the San Diego Rep's annual "A Christmas Carol"), he will  pitch it elsewhere -- possibly to the Old Globe, which books rather than  produces in December.  </P> <P> "That would work out very nicely," Duggan said.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Doug Jacobs, artistic director of the San Diego Repertory  Theatre, returned to San Diego from a trip to England, Ireland and Scotland on  Saturday night, but his wife, actress Darla Cash, was sidetracked on the New  York stopover. Her friend, playwright Allan Havis (a professor at UC San Diego)  wanted her to perform in the premiere of his play, "The Bartered Bride" at the  Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn. Cash, who had done the play in a staged  reading at the South Coast Repertory Theatre, took the role and will open in  three weeks. . . .  </P> <P> Lillian Garrett-Groag, who directed "The Granny," still running at the Old  Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage through Feb. 18, is one of 12 finalists in  the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, a prize given to women playwrights.  Garrett-Groag was honored for her play, "Ladies of the Camellias," a story  about legendary actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse that was produced  in the Old Globe's Play Discovery program. The winner and a runner-up will be  announced in February. Past finalists have included Marsha Norman, Beth Henley  and Caryl Churchill. . . .  </P> <P> The Performing Arts Theatre for the Handicapped (PATH) just received $2,500  from the City of Carlsbad Arts Commission to hire additional teachers and  acting coaches. The theater, which mainstreams disabled performers, is  presenting "The Curious Savage" in La Costa through Feb. 18. Other theaters  among the eight arts organizations to receive grants from a $15,000 total are  the Carlsbad Youth Theatre, which received $1,000 for a February production of  "The Hobbit" and the Patrons of the Arts Foundation, which received $4,000 to  produce a 1990 summer musical at the Carlsbad Community Cultural Center. . . .  </P> <P> In honor of Black History Month, KPBS Radio will present a 30-minute  documentary called "August Wilson's Sacred Book," about playwright August  Wilson, author of "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano Lesson," both of  which played at the Old Globe Theatre, and "Fences." The show airs Feb. 17 at 4  p.m. . . .  </P> <P> Charlene Baldridge, better known locally as a public-relations officer at the  Old Globe Theatre, is the writer of "Winter Roses," playing at the Itchey Foot  Ristorante in Los Angeles today and Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A: FULTON'S 30 YEARS AS LISA  </P> <P> Eileen Fulton has connived, lied and schemed her way into viewers' hearts as  the vixenish Lisa on the long-running CBS daytime soap opera, "As the World  Turns." This month, Fulton celebrates her 30th anniversary on the hourlong  series, which airs weekdays at 1 p.m. on CBS. She discussed those years with  Susan King.  </P> <P>  Thirty years on the same series is pretty amazing.  </P> <P> That's a long time, isn't it?  </P> <P> I've enjoyed it. I think what has kept me going is that the producers and the  writing staff have made it possible for me to go out and do many other things.  I didn't come to New York to be one character. I'm an actor and must play many  characters.  </P> <P> How many months do you take off a year?  </P> <P> I have four months off, so I can do other shows. I have a one-woman show I am  working on now -- a nightclub act. I love to sing. We are booking for the  summer.  </P> <P> You must have seen a lot of changes in the soap opera world over the past three  decades.  </P> <P> I don't think soaps have changed that much. There have always been love  affairs, illegitimate babies. We didn't have AIDS back then. But we have kept  up with the times as far as what is going on in the world. The only difference  is that now people don't mind saying they watch the show.  </P> <P> May I tell you a fun story? When I was doing my nightclub act in Texas, a man  told me, "You have almost ruined my business." I said, "What is your business?"  He said, "I am a funeral director. No one will come to a funeral between 1:30  and 2 p.m."  </P> <P> Is your character of Lisa as evil as Alexis Carrington was on "Dynasty"?  </P> <P> Lisa was a conniving, screaming witch. She wasn't just out-and-out ugly (like  Alexis). She lied and wanted everything her way. She just bent the truth so it  went her way. She's had six husbands, 38 lovers and was raped repeatedly from  California to Texas and lost her mind twice. She's had two children, little Tom  and little Chuck, now dead, and one phantom fetus.  </P> <P> A phantom fetus?  </P> <P> Yes, it was my most unfavorite story line. I had to walk around and say, "I am  pregnant and I don't know how it happened." I had already had three husbands  and two children, so I thought it was kind of silly. It turned out to be an  ovarian cyst.  </P> <P> How do fans react when they see you in person?  </P> <P> I used to get smacked around.  </P> <P> Fans would hit you?  </P> <P> At the very beginning. When I was first on the show, a very nicely dressed  woman -- she really looked beautiful -- came up to me on the street said,  "Aren't you Lisa?" I opened my pocketbook to get out my pen to sign an  autograph, and she said, "I hate you," and she whacked me on the arm and pushed  me in the gutter. Everybody looked at me like I was scum.  </P> <P> And about 10 years ago, when Lisa was after Bob Hughes, letters came in again  saying if that witch gets him, we are going to come down and finish her career  so she'll never act again. They wrote to the producer, the directors and the  head of CBS. I had to have police protection.  </P> <P> But things are a lot different now. Lisa has changed over the years. She has  matured and learned from her mistakes, but is as spunky as ever. Now I get love  letters. In fact, I get letters from as many men as I do women. I get letters  in the hundreds from women saying they were named after me. Lisa was not a  popular name, and now it's one of the top names. And it's because of me.  </P> <P> Do you remember any crazy thing that happened when the show was done live?  </P> <P> I had to make cherries jubilee once. I had to say the line, "We are all  finished," and I couldn't say it if we weren't finished. We didn't want to talk  with our mouths full, so we had to time it. From 7:30 in the morning we were  eating cherries jubilee. They kept putting more and more brandy on the  cherries, and we kept slurping it up. We were smashed by the time the show went  on the air.  </P> <P> Then they put Sureflame in the thing so it would blaze up and look wonderful.  When I took the lid off, it went "boom," and fire went up the curtain and  things caught on fire. We didn't care. We were drunk.  </P></p>

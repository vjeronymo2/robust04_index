			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mates may resign as Nadir link threatens fresh crisis THE CAREER of Mr Michael Mates, the junior minister linked to Mr Asil Nadir, was last night under threat as rapidly falling support for him among Tory MPs threatened a fresh crisis for the government. Senior Tory MPs voiced concern that Mr Mates may have to resign amid the failure of the party hierarchy to stop continuing controversy over the support given to Mr Nadir by Conservatives before he fled to northern Cyprus. As a wider debate erupted with Tory ranks over the secrecy surrounding donations to the Conservative party, several MPs said privately that the position of Mr Mates as security minister at the Northern Ireland Office was almost untenable. His future fate is expected to be raised when the powerful 1922 executive of backbench MPs meets on Thursday. One member, among the most pessimistic about Mr Mates' chances of survival, said yesterday: 'I doubt whether he will last that long.' A resignation would be a further embarrassment for Mr John Major who has only just recovered from the fallout after Mr Norman Lamont's sacking as Chancellor. Even Tory MPs suggesting Mr Mates may have to go, accept that it would be another example of the Mr Major losing a minister after media pressure. But the row over Mr Mates has triggered calls from within the Tory party for the Pounds 440,000 Mr Nadir donated to the Conservative party to be repaid and for a wider-review of how the party sets out its accounts - demands likely to be reiterated when the Commons debates the funding of political parties tomorrow. Mr Mates was unavailable for comment yesterday but even his colleagues were worried about the cumulative impact of the row which started with revelations Mr Mates had raised Mr Nadir's treatment by the Serious Fraud Office with the Attorney General. Conservative Central Office said yesterday that Sir John Cope, former deputy chairman and now Treasury minister, had written two years ago to liquidators of Mr Nadir's business empire setting out the payments the party had received from him. However the party was still waiting to be told formally if the donations had been from 'stolen money'. Mr John Major last night reiterated that if the money had been paid illegally it would be returned to the Polly Peck administrators. Speaking on his arrival at the Copenhagen EC summit, he said: 'Any money that was dishonestly obtained and dishonestly donated to the Conservative party is not wanted by the Conservative party.' He refused to answer questions about Mr Mates. Earlier, Mr David Mellor, former cabinet minister, said one way of dealing with the issue was to recognise that the money would never appear a legitimate donation and send it back. Administrators at accountants Touche Ross have traced a series of payments totalling Pounds 365,000 during 1987-90 which were paid through a bank account in Jersey of Unipac, the northern Cyprus-based packaging manufacturer within the Polly Peck group. Touche has also identified several payments totalling at least Pounds 75,000 in the period 1985-87 paid directly with funds from Polly Peck International, the parent company. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said Mr Major must explain publicly the 'very murky' circumstances in which funds were paid to the Tories. Tories unsettled, Page 7 Observer, Page 17</p>

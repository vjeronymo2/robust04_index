			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Huanqin (2799 3562 0530)] </F>   [Text] Vienna, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- A meeting of the Board of  Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  closed here this evening after passing a resolution on the  Korean nuclear issue.    The resolution says: The DPRK, as a party to the "treaty on  the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons," failed to carry out  the main part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented  the IAEA from inspecting its nuclear facilities to check the  history of the reactor fuel rods and to determine whether the  nuclear materials produced by its reactors have been diverted to  other uses. The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate  fully with the IAEA Secretariat and to guarantee the IAEA access  to all the documents and places concerned. The resolution says  that the IAEA has decided to stop its nonmedical aid to the DPRK  according to Section C of Article 12 of the IAEA Charter.    The representatives of the 35 member countries of the Board  of Governors, including China, attended the meeting today. The  Chinese representative pointed out during discussion: "The  ultimate objectives in settling the Korean nuclear issue should  be to ensure the denuclearization of the peninsula and to  safeguard peace and stability there." "Losing one opportunity  to carry out a technical inspection does not mean that all  safeguard and supervisory opportunities and all the hopes to  settle the nuclear issue have been lost." He said that the key  point at present is that all parties concerned should calm down,  make solid efforts, and leave some leeway for solving problems,  rather than create an impasse.    The Chinese representative said: It is difficult for China  to support the resolution. First, past experience proves that  adopting a resolution is not a constructive move, and it will  inevitably worsen the atmosphere, intensify contradictions, and  create new difficulties in settling the Korean nuclear issue.  Second, the suspension of technical aid to the DPRK, as  mentioned in the resolution, is in fact a kind of sanctions.  China is extremely worried about the possible serious  consequences of such an action.    The resolution sponsored by 18 countries including the  United  States, Japan, France, and Russia was adopted by vote toward the  end of the meeting. Twenty-eight countries voted for it, and  one voted against it, while four countries, including China,  abstained. Two others did not participate in voting.    The meeting of the Board of Governors opened on 6 June. With  the Korean nuclear issue being its main topic, the meeting has  been followed with interest by all countries of the world.</p>

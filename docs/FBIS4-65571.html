			<p>BFN     [Text] Denmark is saying no to a UN request to contribute  personnel and equipment to the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda.  The Danish foreign minister says Denmark is already  contributing UN troops at other sites. In addition, he  questions whether the United Nations has a reasonable chance to  carry out the task in Rwanda.    The United Nations has also asked Sweden to support the UN  force in Rwanda. According to UN diplomats, Sweden could  contribute engineering troops, helicopters, and hospitals.</p>

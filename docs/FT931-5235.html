			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Books: Magic in Memphis THE ORACLE AT STONELEIGH COURT by Peter Taylor Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 324 pages UNTIL recently, Peter Taylor was one of America's most undervalued writers. Born in 1917, he toiled in relative obscurity until just a few years ago, when his novel A Summons to Memphis won a long overdue Pulitzer Prize. Luckily for Taylor and his readers, this recognition was not a case of too little, too late. As his latest collection of stories proves, Taylor remains a masterful and surprising writer of fiction, a magician who is able with a few deft strokes to conjure whole worlds out of thin air. The worlds conjured in The Oracle at Stoneleigh Court range from the supernatural habitat of ghosts to the more earthly territory of the Old South. The collection's title novella introduces its central theme, showing how the ghosts of a family's past can haunt and manipulate those still alive. It tells the story of a young soldier who pursues a beautiful young woman named Lila from their native Tennessee to Washington in the years just before the Second World War. While there, he looks up an eccentric, elderly aunt, a seer of sorts who lives in a stately apartment building called Stoneleigh Court. She soon insinuates her way into the lovers' relationship, bringing the young man under her spell by conjuring the ghosts of his illustrious ancestors while at the same time secretly causing the girl to abandon her would-be lover by implanting ambitious dreams in her. The young soldier goes off to war, where he wins the Medal of Honor for an heroic deed forever blotted from his memory. He returns to Tennessee to convalesce, only to have his aunt and Lila once again enter his life when the elderly lady returns to her native home to die. He and Lila enter into a brief affair yet soon break it off, realising that the aunt's meddling has made their love impossible. It is a haunting story, typical of Taylor's work in its subtle evocation of mystery and passion and loss. It sets the tone for the remaining stories, such as 'Demons', in which a young boy realises that the disembodied voices which populate his childhood must be forsworn if he is ever to become a man. In 'The Witch of Owl Mountain Springs', a jilted young woman stays on to haunt the posh Tennessee resort where her heart was broken, growing into a backwoods hag until she can exact her revenge on the glamorous couple who betrayed her. In its more territorial offerings, Taylor's collection is equally assured as he explores the fact that 'in the Tennessee country of my forebears it was not uncommon for a man of good character to disappear'. For instance, 'Cousin Aubrey' tracks the strange life of a bastard son as he gradually takes on the personality of his famous father. Disappearances of a far more painful sort are the theme of 'In the Waiting Room', in which a group of strangers come together in a Memphis hospital to swap stories of how they have all been forced to abandon their old folk to death. One of the most pleasing things about the book is Taylor's willingness to tackle the supernatural straight on, to show how it can be a manifestation of personal loss and guilt without for a moment denying that the voices and ghosts that sound through this book are every bit as real as its more tangible fictions. But, as in all of Taylor's work, the most memorable achievement of this remarkable book is its careful and loving evocation of the insular, complex world of genteel Southern society as it existed before being eroded by the levelling forces of television and jet travel. His old Memphis is a world where people take pride in their Confederate General ancestors for the battles they lost; a world in which a pretty young woman can be ruined simply by being publicly jilted; a world where a man's way of overcoming bastard status is not to achieve fortune or fame but to grow a magnificent goatee to hide his unfamilial chin. It is an antique world but not a vanished one, not for as long as Peter Taylor is able to use his uncommon skill and sensitivity to keep its ghosts and voices alive.</p>

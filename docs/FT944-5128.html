			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (5): A pattern emerges - Bangkok's business district / William Barnes describes how a central business district is emerging from the sprawling chaos of Bangkok as institutions start to gravitate towards certain focal points Bangkok's traffic jams, skilled staff and poorly enforced commercial laws might seem enough to stifle the city's ambitions to become an international business centre. Yet amid the polluting haze which bathes the capital (a tolerance for airborne pollution is as useful as a portable telephone) it is now possible to discern the makings of a viable, even attractive, regional business hub. Bangkok is one of the world's great unplanned metropolises. Many urban schemes have been proposed over the years, but no-one has possessed the will or the means to overcome the combined inertia of bureaucrats and self-serving politicians. The first urban rail scheme was proposed 25 years ago. But little progress has been made in building any of the city's three planned mass transit systems. Yet it is worth remembering that Bangkok, where more than half the country's wealth is created, is merely choking on its own success. The number of foreigners moving into Bangkok will increase because Thailand needs their technology to produce the higher value-added exports it must sell to remain competitive. Many international companies will continue to place their regional offices in Bangkok because Thailand remains a relatively cheap place to do business yet has a large and increasingly wealthy domestic market. The price of renting a top grade office in the first quarter of 1994 was Dollars 176 per square metre per year, compared with Dollars 1,020 in Hong Kong and Dollars 307 in Singapore. But trying to work out where to set up shop in Bangkok's sprawling chaos can be a tough decision given the dire consequences of becoming committed to a property half a kilometre beyond the wrong set of traffic lights; you could condemn your colleagues to years of having to leave mid-morning for a lunch appointment. Nevertheless during the 1990s the accelerating movement of previously scattered businesses towards certain focal points revealed the outlines of a central business district (CBD) at the heart of the Bangkok metropolitan area - which is one-and-half times the size of Hongkong or seven times the size of Singapore. Property consultants differ over the exact dimensions of the CBD but most agree that it is bounded in the north by Ploenchit Road (and the British Embassy) and sweeps southwest, stopping some way short of the river. 'We are starting to see a very definite congregation of finance and services type companies in this area. But only in a specific number of buildings which shows that quality is becoming important too,' says Mr Paul Scales, Jones Lang Wootton's managing director in Bangkok. Certainly, Silom Road, Sathorn Road and Wireless Road are important locations, even if the area - broken in two by Lumpini Park - is still big by City of London standards. Even three years ago Thai investors appeared rather unconcerned about location. That has changed, and a feature of the property market in 1994 has been the phenomenal success of condominium projects within the CBD. Rentals on the fringes of the developing financial district may be suffering because companies want to be in, rather than merely near, the CBD. Thus Sukhumvit Road - traditionally the foreigners' ghetto - has fallen somewhat out of favour because of its particularly bad traffic, even though its western end links to the emerging CBD. Prime rentals are lower on Sukhumvit than around the busy junctions of the Vibhavadi Rangsit and Phaholyothin roads in the north of the city where trading and automobile companies have gathered; such areas acquire their own hotels, entertainment areas and housing. Similarly the riverside hotels risk losing business customers because their picturesque location is separated from the northern end of the CBD by frequent traffic congestion. However, Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest financial institution, along with the Bank of Ayudhya, could drag other financial companies with them when they move to new headquarters sites by the river in about 1996. Other casualties are the companies which were lured on to the awkwardly placed Asoke Road - a particularly congested route running off Sukhumvit - which was touted at the beginning of the decade as a new financial district.</p>

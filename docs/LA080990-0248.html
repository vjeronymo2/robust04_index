			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DIESEL FUEL SULFUR CUT ORDERED  </P> <P> In a move that could further drive up the price of diesel fuel but that  promises to virtually eliminate the belching black smoke from diesel engines,  the Environmental Protection Agency today ordered an 80% cut in the sulfur in  the fuel over three years.  </P> <P> The new rule will add between 1.8 cents and 2.3 cents per gallon to the cost of  the fuel, heavily used within the transportation industry as a fuel for trucks,  buses and locomotives. Some passenger cars also have diesel engines.  </P> <P> Although the price of the fuel will go up, the EPA also said the prospect of  lessened engine wear and cheaper emissions controls could offset some or all of  the higher per-gallon price.  </P></p>

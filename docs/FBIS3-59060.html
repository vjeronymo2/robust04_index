The 7 May 1993 asylum treaty with  Poland had already been settled, when the Federal Export Office  (BAFA) performed its duty: It raised objections.    The supply of night vision devices to Poland's Border Guard  was a violation of the export ban on industrial goods that can  be used for either civilian or military purposes ("dual use").    A German manufacturer of optical and electronic sensors  started producing civilian rather than military goods  ("conversion"). Instead of guidance systems, the optical sensors  now guide probes used in medical endoscopy. His exports are a  success. Israel is also a customer. However, German officials  are placing massive obstacles in the way of delivering spare  parts to Israel: The sensor technology could be converted to  military use in the recipient country.    Nothing but theory? German foreign economic policy knows  better since German firms industrial equipment for the Libyan  chemical weapons plant at Al-Rabitah. "Auschwitz in the  desert," were the comments that William Safire, the NEW YORK  TIMES columnist, made. Al-Rabitah and "civilian" German goods  supplied to Iraq have led to controls on all "dual-use" exports  to suspicious countries. The United States has deemed the effort  "exemplary."    Nevertheless, Bonn is not happy. Industry is using the  economic crisis as a means of attacking excessive controls.  They have resulted in "massive international competitive  handicaps." That has drawn a positive reaction from the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag  group. The main advocate of a relaxation of controls is the  spokesman on foreign policy, Karl Lamers.    What has now given a new lease of life to the debate is the  tug of war in the European Union (EU) regarding uniform export  regulations for "dual use" goods. Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, FDP [Free Democratic Party], has doggedly been demanding  that the strict German law should be recognized as being a  national exception under EU law. The CDU/CSU is opposed, and  the Federal Chancellery is vacillating. Lamer's parliamentary  colleague, Andreas Schockenhoff says: "What is at stake is the  ability of German industry to cooperate on joint projects with  EU and NATO partners."    In plain English: This does, of course, apply to what are  solely defense projects. There are more and more reports from  the aerospace and marine industries that German partners are no  longer being approached by West European partners.    To provide one example: England sells Tornadoes with German  electronic technology to Saudi Arabia. The manufacturer is to  repair a guidance system for the customer: It can be repaired  within 27 days. However, BAFA must give its approval and that  takes between two and five months.    That becomes known. Recently, however, customers all over  the world now want "package approvals" from the German  authorities. That has not been permitted until now. Others say  that offers from Germany do not make any sense "as long as  German export policy remains unpredictable."    The competition from England, France, and the United States  is not asleep. Their representatives go knocking on doors with  the German law under their arm, and they have some good advice  to offer: "Don't buy German." [preceding words in English].</p>

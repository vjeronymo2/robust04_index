			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World news in brief: Braer inquiry calls for urgent action The inquiry into shipping pollution, launched in the wake of the sinking of the oil tanker Braer off the Shetlands, called for urgent national and international action to improve the safety of ships and reduce the danger of pollution. The inquiry, chaired by Lord Donaldson (left), identified human error as the cause of almost all accidental pollution from ships and said the best preventative measure was to improve the standards of maintenance and operation.

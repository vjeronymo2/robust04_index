			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Rwandan rebels defy France Rwandan rebels said yesterday they would press ahead with their military advance across the central African state despite France's order to its troops to halt them. In an interview in London, Dr Theogene Rudasingwa, secretary-general of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), said French troops had no business in Rwanda and if they stood in the way they would be seeking confrontation. 'There is no reason for the French to be in Rwanda. It is a partisan force only there to support the evil forces that have unleashed terror and are responsible for the genocide. They must withdraw or we shall fight them for as long as possible.' The rebels have seized control of much of the capital Kigali and are poised to take government-held Butare, Rwanda's second city. However, French troops in Gikongoro, south-west Rwanda, have received orders to stop any warring faction from capturing the town or going beyond it. The French Foreign Ministry said France was setting up a 'safe humanitarian zone'. France had insisted it would maintain neutrality in its mission, for which it is seeking a United Nations mandate, but now says its troops must stand in the way of rebel advance to protect refugees in the south-west. Dr Rudasingwa said: 'The fact the French government has given orders to stop us is proof their role is military and political, not a humanitarian effort as they have claimed.' He added that the RPF had plans for forming a broad based government and start making plans to establish a democracy in the country. But all this could only happen with the departure of the French. French Colonel Didier Thibaut, based in Gikongoro, said he had orders to stop the rebels from capturing the town or going beyond it: 'No one will go any further. We will not allow anyone to bother the population - whether they are militias, the Rwandan army, or the RPF.'</p>

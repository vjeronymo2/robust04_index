			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Nigerian parties to link with military NIGERIA'S military regime has gained provisional backing from both the country's political parties to set up a joint interim government of unelected civilians on August 27 instead of the democratically elected government promised by President Ibrahim Babangida. Yesterday's agreement by the Social Democratic party (SDP) and National Republican Convention (NRC) to take part underlines the dominant position of the armed forces, which annulled last month's presidential elections after it became clear that the SDP had won. The plan weakens the chances of Mr Moshood Abiola, the successful SDP candidate in the June polls, becoming Nigeria's next president. A diplomat in Nigeria yesterday described the military's handling of the crisis since they refused to uphold the SDP's victory as 'a very good tactical withdrawal. The people have expressed a view at the ballot box, but the military retain control, leaving Abiola with no cards to play.' The civilian protest against the annulment of last month's polls subsided yesterday, two days earlier than planned. Businesses, government offices and transport resumed normal operation in the commercial capital after a crackdown on security and deployment of troops quelled widespread disorder. Several key members of the Campaign for Democracy, which organised the protest, have been detained by security forces. On Thursday Mr Abiola said he had no hand in the demonstrations, desite the overwhelming support they showed from his fellow Yorubas in Lagos and other parts of the south-west. He dissociated himself from the violence and destruction arising from the protests, called for order and said: 'Justice will prevail.' This is a far cry from Mr Abiola's message last week to defy the military's annulment of the polls and 'damn the consequences.' The ruling National Defence and Security Council will meet in Abuja today to discuss the proposals of the two army-created parties.</p>

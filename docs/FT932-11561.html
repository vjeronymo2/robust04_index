			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Blushes at Belgian jailbreak THREE of Belgium's most wanted men yesterday put the country's prison service and police to shame with an audacious armed break-out from a Brussels jail. The trio were still on the run last night after releasing the last of four hostages. The escape may set the farcical seal on what was supposed to be Belgium's 'trial of the century' - that of the notorious Haemers gang, nine people accused of 15 bloody armed hold-ups and the 1989 kidnapping of former prime minister Paul Vanden Boeynants. It will also put further pressure on the Belgian political establishment, which is already under stress from rumours of political and business corruption as well as the more familiar strains of holding together a coalition government. Two of the Haemers gang were among the prisoners to escape yesterday morning, as riots broke out at two Brussels prisons. Their trial was supposed to have begun last month but was already in a state of surreal suspension, following the court's failure to round up enough jurors and potential jurors. It could resume in September, assuming the two defendants are recaptured, and the government can rush through emergency legislation changing the rules for picking juries. Mr Patrick Haemers, leader of the gang, has escaped custody before, fleeing to Rio de Janeiro in 1986, before being recaptured in 1989. This time he was not among those to make the break for freedom; his lawyers are exploring a more orthodox way of securing his release. They argue that he has already served an unreasonably long prison term while awaiting trial - nearly five years - and that it is affecting his health. A Brussels court yesterday rejected their request that he be temporarily freed, but Mr Haemers' lawyers are likely to appeal against the decision. Haemers' alleged accomplices, Mr Philippe Lacroix and Mr Basri Bajrami, were sprung from St Gilles prison, in a Brussels suburb, yesterday morning along with Murat Kaplan, Belgium's self-styled 'Getaway King'. Several other inmates also tried to escape during the riot, but were recaptured. The trio immediately took four prison officers hostage using two handguns and three grenades and escaped in a stolen BMW, before leading the police across Brussels, leaving behind them a trail of abandoned getaway cars and hostages.

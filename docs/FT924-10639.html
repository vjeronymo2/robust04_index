			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Poll may follow Dublin split IRELAND faces the possibility of an imminent general election, following the emergence of apparently irreconcilable differences between the leaders of the two coalition parties in government. Last Tuesday, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, accused Mr Des O'Malley, his industry minister and leader of the Progressive Democrat (PD) party, the junior partner in the coalition, of being 'reckless, irresponsible and dishonest' in giving evidence last June to a parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry. Mr Reynolds made the accusation during the inquiry, where he has been defending his record as industry minister during 1987 and 1988, when he authorised export insurance cover to a number of Irish companies for beef exports to Iraq. Mr O'Malley has not responded publicly to the accusation, but his party said on Wednesday it had 'undermined the effectiveness of the government'. Yesterday Ms Mary Harney, a PD deputy and a junior minister of state, said shortly after speaking to Mr O'Malley: 'We cannot now pretend it is business as usual and that everybody can go into a cabinet room as if nothing has happened. That would be terribly dishonest and the government in those circumstances just couldn't be effective.' Under intense cross-examination yesterday by the counsel for Mr O'Malley at the beef inquiry, Mr Reynolds stood by his allegation, although he had to be pressed 10 times by the counsel and was finally instructed by the inquiry chairman, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, to 'just answer the question' to identify exactly what part of Mr O'Malley's evidence he considered dishonest. Mr Reynolds said he considered a figure given by Mr O'Malley of a 'potential liability' to the state of IPounds 170m (Pounds 182m), as a result of Mr Reynolds' decisions in granting export insurance cover to Iraq, was dishonest. Relations between the two coalition partners have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, because of differences over the administration of industrial development policy, and over the wording of an abortion referendum due in December. Neither party, however, wishes to be seen as the one which precipitates a general election, so the political brinkmanship could continue for days or weeks yet.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAIL BLAZERS GET EVEN FOR GAME 1 COLLAPSE, 106-105;  </P> <P> NBA FINALS: DREXLER'S FREE THROWS FINALLY DEFUSE LAIMBEER'S BOMBS IN OVERTIME.  THE NEXT THREE GAMES ARE IN PORTLAND.  </P> <P> Shots poured in from Bill Laimbeer, a hail of three-pointers that helped the  Detroit Pistons overcome a 12-point deficit in the second quarter, a five-point  deficit with 5:38 left in regulation and then take a four-point lead in  overtime.  </P> <P> What it came down to, though, were two free throws by Portland's Clyde Drexler.  He made both with 2.1 seconds remaining in the extra five-minute period to give  the Trail Blazers a 106-105 victory Thursday night at the Palace of Auburn  Hills in Game 2 of the NBA finals, snapping the Pistons' 10-game home winning  streak in the playoffs and tying the best-of-seven series.  </P> <P> Laimbeer tied Michael Cooper's record for three-point baskets in a final with  six. Two came in succession and helped Detroit climb back from an 86-81 deficit  to an 89-86 lead, only to have the Trail Blazers force the overtime when Terry  Porter's free throw with 10.2 seconds remaining made it 94-94.  </P> <P> At 96-96, Laimbeer hit his first of three three-pointers in overtime. The next,  with 1:30 to play, gave the Pistons a 102-98 edge. Again, the Trail Blazers  responded, eventually going ahead, 104-102, on Buck Williams' two free throws  with 9.6 seconds left.  </P> <P> Laimbeer, once more. He came out nearly to half court to accept the entry pass,  turned, faced the basket and looked to pass. Seeing no outlet, he dribbled in a  few steps and bombed over Drexler. Good, with 4.1 seconds showing.  </P> <P> Drexler had failed. His assignment was to make sure Laimbeer didn't wind up  again from long range, whatever methods it took.  </P> <P> "I was supposed to be the guy to dive and tackle Laimbeer," he said.  </P> <P> There was an obvious chance for redemption, so when Drexler got the ball at the  top of the three-point circle, he drove toward the right side of the key and  was fouled on a hand-check by Dennis Rodman.  </P> <P> Drexler said he was definitely fouled. Rodman didn't stay around to give his  side of the story.  </P> <P> Whatever, Drexler made both free throws for the last of his 33 points. He was  one of four Trail Blazers to reach double figures.  </P> <P> "That was the only thing on my mind," Drexler said of making his two tries.  "Total concentration."  </P> <P> The 2.1 seconds that remained gave the Pistons several chances to win, even  though they were playing without Isiah Thomas, who fouled out with 1:10 to play  after scoring 23 points. Portland, with a foul to give, made a wise tactical  decision by wrapping up James Edwards as soon as he caught the ball, forcing  Detroit to take the ball out again, this time with only 1.5 seconds left.  </P> <P> The ball came back to Edwards, but this time his shot was swatted away by Cliff  Robinson. Edwards scored 26 points, tying Laimbeer for team-high honors.  </P> <P> "It was emotion like, 'I can't believe this,' " said Portland center Kevin  Duckworth, who fouled out with 49 seconds left. "We were up, and then started  screwing around. Laimbeer started hitting and they came back. Then Clyde hit  the free throws. There's nothing I can do as a player but sit back and watch."  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers gained some respect and took away the Pistons' home-court  advantage, with the series heading to Oregon for three games.  </P> <P> "I think people finally realize we didn't get here on a fluke," said Porter,  the Portland guard who had 21 points, 10 assists and only one turnover. "We  played the world champions close for two straight ball games. Right now, we're  sitting pretty."  </P> <P> Though trailing at halftime, the Pistons had at least one encouraging sign:  Edwards, 30 of 71 from the field during the last eight outings -- including two  of nine in Game 1 -- made his first five shots for the first 10 points of the  game for Detroit.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers stayed close with their own inside scoring, Duckworth  exploiting Laimbeer's lack of defensive quickness. The Portland center, coming  off a 17-point, eight-rebound effort in Game 1, scored 11 of his team's first  17 points.  </P> <P> By then, Detroit had a 25-17 lead. After Rodman's free throw with 1:53 to play,  the Piston cushion reached 30-19. At quarter's end, it was 30-23.  </P> <P> A basket from Laimbeer 31 seconds into the second period seemed to indicate the  Pistons would continue what for them is an abundance of offense. But it just  marked trouble, Detroit going without another field goal until Joe Dumars hit  from the left side with 5:57 to play in the second quarter. The one Detroit  point in a 15-1 Trail Blazer run was Dumars cashing in on Portland being called  for a second illegal defense.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Trail Blazers had a 38-33 advantage. That went to 45-37 with 4:30  remaining and 53-45 at the break. The Pistons shot 32% (six of 19) in the  second quarter and were outscored, 30-15.  </P> <P> Edwards had 16 points at halftime and teammate Isiah Thomas 14 more, but that  still wasn't enough to offset a Trail Blazer team that hit at 51.1%. More  important, the Trail Blazers had only two turnovers, compared to 13 for the  Pistons that led to 20 Portland points.  </P> <P> Detroit got as close as two points twice in the third quarter -- both thanks to  Edwards baskets in the lane. The last time was at 59-57, at which time the  Trail Blazers regained more control.  </P> <P> A 9-4 run gave Portland some room, 68-61. That held up through the end of the  third quarter, when the lead was 75-69, the Pistons having managed just five  field goals in the last 7:26.  </P></p>

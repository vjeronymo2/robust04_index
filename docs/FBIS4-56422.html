			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio  arrived this afternoon in Havana at the invitation of Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez. Foreign Minister Sanin is  accompanied by other officials from the Colombian Foreign  Ministry and Government.    The goal of the two-day visit is to sign an education accord  on 4 May and to ratify the work program of the Cuba-Colombia  joint commission. The minister will also present a donation of  books to the Jose Marti National Library, visit Casa de las  Americas, and meet with Carlos Lage, member of the Politburo and  vice president of the Council of State.    Minister Sanin held high-level talks this afternoon at the  Cuban Foreign Ministry where she met for more than an hour with  Foreign Minister Robaina and several Cuban vice foreign  ministers in a relaxed and congenial atmosphere.    Regarding the condition of ties between Cuba and Colombia,  Minister Sanin pointed out upon her arrival at Jose Marti  International Airport that these were exceptionally healthy and  were developing quite well in a climate of mutual respect,  unhurriedly, and with respect for the sovereignty and decisions  of each nation.    Regarding an issue of great importance for Cuba, the oil  issue, which has caused numerous problems and impaired ties  between Cuba and Colombia, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin stated:    [Begin Sanin recording] Colombia sells oil to Cuba without  reservation so long as Cuba pays according to the terms and  conditions established by Colombia. If Cuba can meet the  Colombian conditions, we have no problem selling it. We are  therefore discussing credit and terms. [end recording]</p>

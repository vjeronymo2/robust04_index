			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: Counting the cost of timidity What price radicalism? Whatever the precise figure, it is apparently still too high for the leaders of Britain's two main political parties. Beneath the intellectual torpor at Westminster, it is possible to detect a shared assumption running from left to right that economic realities have stripped the credibility from their central political ambitions. Senior figures on both sides will acknowledge in a whisper that sooner or later they will have to confront the structural tensions in the nation's finances: the inexorable rise in a Pounds 75bn welfare budget and the tax privileges for pensions and home ownership that cost the Treasury more than Pounds 15bn a year. Of itself, economic recovery will deliver neither the scope for income tax cuts central to the Conservative philosophy nor the money for the industrial strategy and the fairer society pledged by the Labour party. As the Treasury and Civil Service committee reminded us yesterday, something has to give. If it does not, the present pessimistic projections for the budget deficit may prove to err on the side of optimism. That much should be common ground, even if for obvious reasons Mr John Major must still proclaim publicly that most of the deficit will melt away with the return of economic growth. But even three or four years away from a general election neither Mr Major nor Mr John Smith will engage in a serious debate about how the financial circle can be squared. Universal state pension and child benefit payments, tax exemption for occupational pension schemes and mortgage interest tax relief are issues still judged off-limits for public consideration by politicians. For all the talk of the 'Clintonising' of the Labour party and of the plethora of new ideas at Mr Major's brainstorming sessions at Chequers, these are issues to be discussed at a distance. Mr Smith has handed them over to an independent Commission on Social Justice. In spite of its distance from official Labour policy, the party leader has felt it necessary to make clear from the outset that the party does not want to tamper with universal benefits. On the Tory side, the debate is being left to the think tanks and to a handful of Thatcherite true believers. There are some members of the cabinet willing to discuss in private a radical reduction in income tax reliefs or the eventual means-testing of universal benefits. The horrifying deficit forecasts being churned out by the Treasury's computers have re-focused attention on mortgage interest relief and on the present exemptions from value added tax. But the prevailing mood in 10 Downing Street is risk- averse. The government remains, in the words of one minister, distinctly 'wobbly'. Potentially unpopular decisions are pushed to the bottom of Mr Major's in-tray. So it has been left to the independent thinkers on the back benches at Westminster to articulate the arguments. The first - and most radical - salvo has been fired not by the Tory right but by Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead. His central point is that Labour must turn on its head the traditional preconception that an expanding welfare system is a measure of success. Instead, the party should recognise it as an admission of failure. Its concern should be with economic and social policies that pull people out of the state safety net by spreading individual wealth as well as employment. Then comes the political ingenuity. Stealing some clothes from the Tory right, Mr Field calls for what he terms the biggest-ever transfer of wealth from corporate to individual hands: the unitisation of the Pounds 24bn in occupational pension schemes to give every fund member ownership of their share of the scheme. The idea would be the logical conclusion of the shift to portable pensions engineered by the Conservatives, marking the end of employer-controlled final salary schemes. That is only half the equation. Mr Field suggests that the huge transfer of capital to individuals would provide the background for the phasing out of the tax privileges of both pensions and mortgages. The extra Pounds 15bn to Pounds 20bn in revenue could be used to allow Labour to trump the Conservatives and pledge to slash the basic rate of income tax by 10p to 15p in the pound. It would pave the way also for a cap on the state pensions bill by allowing the targeting of future increases on the poor. It is an ambitious package. And Mr Field's conclusion that individual ownership of pensions would nurture also a new culture of long-termism to underpin Labour's industrial strategy may stretch credulity. But Tory ministers are among those who admire its boldness. Mr Major and Mr Smith should take note: the cost of timidity could well be higher than the price of radicalism.</p>

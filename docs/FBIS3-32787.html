			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marianella Samper from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] This weekend, Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of  the Cuban Council of State, returned to Cuba after a fruitful  work visit to Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. He said the  meetings with the presidents were excellent, and there was great  communication. This visit, he pointed out, provided great  possibilities for explaining the island's current situation, the  measures which are being adopted, and the importance of the  struggle against the U.S. blockade in our conditions.    Lage added that he also met with other leaders, officials,  and businessmen of those nations and he noticed there is a very  positive atmosphere for strengthening the political, economic,  and social relations. With regard to the most outstanding points  of these meetings, the Cuban vice president said:    [Begin Lage recording] I think the most outstanding aspects  were respect for the Cuban Revolution, interest in our country's  situation, the growing awareness of the need to fight the U.S.  blockade, an understanding of the measures the country is  adopting to adapt to the circumstances we are living under, and  the possibilities these measures will provide for an economic  integration with Latin America.    I believe the results have stimulated the participation  process with investments in the Cuban economy, strengthened  economic and commercial relations, and opened (?possibilities)  of exporting Cuban products to those countries in the region.

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS 1989;  </P> <P> SERRA AND CARSON PLACE FOUR PLAYERS EACH ON FIRST TEAM  </P> <P> An appropriate theme for The Times South Bay All-Star High School Football Team  would be "To the victors go the spoils."  </P> <P> Serra, which captured its first CIF-Southern Section football title Saturday  with a 34-31 win over Lompoc in the Division VII final, and Carson, heading  into the L.A. City Section 4-A championship game Friday night, dominate the  all-star squad.  </P> <P> Each placed four players on the 23-member first team, which will be honored  Sunday at The Times High School Football Awards Brunch at the Anaheim Hilton.  Stanford Coach Dennis Green is the guest speaker.  </P> <P> Winners of the South Bay Coach, Back and Lineman of the Year awards will be  announced at the 9 a.m. brunch.  </P> <P> Serra, under first-year Coach Leo Hand, put the finishing touches on a 14-0  season with a hard-fought victory over unbeaten Lompoc at El Camino College. It  marked only the second time in the 1980s that a South Bay football team ended  the year with a perfect record. West Torrance was 14-0 in 1982.  </P> <P> Serra is represented on the all-star team by fullback Dennis Gerard, tackle  Kenny Thomas, linebacker Steven Johnson and safety Clayton Lopez.  </P> <P> Carson (10-1) will try to win back-to-back L.A. City titles for the first time  since 1972 at 7:30 p.m. Friday against Pacific League rival Dorsey (9-3) in the  4-A Division final at El Camino College. The Colts have won four City  championships in the '80s, seven overall.  </P> <P> Carson players selected to the all-star first team are quarterback Armin  Youngblood, wide receiver Michael Ross, linebacker Nkosi Littleton and  cornerback Clayvand Thomas.  </P> <P> After Serra and Carson, five schools placed two players each on the all-star  team: Ocean League champion West Torrance, Bay League co-champions Hawthorne  and Palos Verdes, Leuzinger and Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> The Bay topped all leagues with eight selections, followed by the Pacific,  Ocean and Camino Real with four each.  </P> <P> Rounding out the offense are wide receiver Eric Hansen of North Torrance,  linemen Robert Ferkula of South Torrance, Kyle Holderman of Palos Verdes, Jim  Justice of Leuzinger and Corey Miller of San Pedro, running backs Chris  Alexander of Hawthorne and Robert Coulter of Rolling Hills and kicker Angel  Andrade of Leuzinger.  </P> <P> The rest of the defensive unit is made up of linemen Jae Kim of West, Chris  Maumalanga of Bishop Montgomery and Kenny Talanoa of El Segundo, linebackers  Sione Mahe of Hawthorne and Jim Rudberg of Rolling Hills and defensive backs  Mark Antrobius of Palos Verdes and Josh Moore of West.  </P> <P> A closer look at the all-stars:  </P> <P> WIDE RECEIVERS:  </P> <P> Eric Hansen (North Torrance) -- The state's leading receiver at the end of the  regular season, Hansen caught a South Bay-record 84 passes for 1,224 yards and  six touchdowns in 10 games. His single-season total ranks eighth on the  all-time Southern Section list. Said Coach Don Bohannon: "He was our offense."  </P> <P> Michael Ross (Carson) -- Entering Friday's L.A. City Section 4-A title game,  Ross has 46 catches for 862 yards (19.2 average) and 15 touchdowns. He holds  virtually every school receiving record, eclipsing past Carson stars such as  Wesley Walker, Michael Wilson and Derek Hill, all members of NFL teams. Ross is  known for his sure hands, leaping ability and knack for making catches in  traffic.  </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINEMEN:  </P> <P> Robert Ferkula (South Torrance) -- Chosen the Ocean League Offensive Lineman of  the Year, Ferkula helped pave the way for a productive running attack for the  Ocean runners-up, who averaged nearly 200 yards rushing a game.  </P> <P> Kyle Holderman (Palos Verdes) -- The top lineman and strongest player for the  Bay League co-champions, Holderman was a standout two-way starter. "A tough,  tough lineman," Coach Bill Judy said. "He's quick and constantly had to be  double-teamed (on defense)."  </P> <P> Jim Justice (Leuzinger) -- Rated the Olympians' No. 1 player by Coach Steve  Carnes, the aggressive Justice anchored a line that helped Leuzinger average  250 yards rushing a game and reach the quarterfinals of the Southern Section  Division II playoffs.  </P> <P> Kenny Thomas (Serra) -- The top lineman for the Southern Section Division VII  champions, Thomas was a consistent performer at righttackle and helped Serra  rush for more than 4,000 yards in 14 games.  </P> <P> Corey Miller (San Pedro) -- Considered one of San Pedro's best blockers in  recent years by Coach Henry Pacheco, Miller helped the Pirates capture the  Southern League title with his steady play at center.  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK:  </P> <P> Armin Youngblood (Carson) -- A gifted athlete, Youngblood made the transition  from running back to quarterback this season and has set several of the  school's single-season passing records heading into Friday's championship game.  He has completed 117 of 229 attempts (51%) for 2,306 yards and 30 touchdowns to  lead the Colts to their ninth consecutive appearance in an L.A. City final.  </P> <P> RUNNING BACKS:  </P> <P> Chris Alexander (Hawthorne) -- Named the Bay League Co-Most Valuable Player,  Alexander used his sprinter's speed (he placed fifth in the state 100 meters  last spring) to rush for 1,133 yards on 122 carries (a 9.3 average) and score  17 touchdowns, including a 99-yard kickoff return in the playoffs against San  Marcos.  </P> <P> Robert Coulter (Rolling Hills) -- The only junior on the first-team offense,  Coulter led South Bay rushers during the regular season with 1,545 yards and 15  touchdowns in 10 games. Coulter transferred from Texas late in the summer and  quickly became the catalyst of Rolling Hills' offense with his trademark  cut-back runs.  </P> <P> Dennis Gerard (Serra) -- Chosen the Camino Real League Most Valuable Player,  Gerard led the South Bay in rushing with 1,920 yards and 28 touchdowns in 275  carries. The hard-running fullback saved his best for last, gaining 239 yards  and scoring two TDs in the Division VII championship game.  </P> <P> KICKER:  </P> <P> Angel Andrade (Leuzinger) -- The area's second-leading kick scorer with 50  points, Andrade converted nine of 13 field goals, including a long of 46 yards,  and made 29 of 33 extra points. He also punted for the Olympians.  </P> <P> DEFENSIVE LINEMEN:  </P> <P> Jae Kim (West Torrance) -- Named the Ocean League Defensive Lineman of the  Year, Kim was one of the South Bay's leading pass rushers. He had 11 sacks,  including seven in the last four league games, and finished with 20 tackles for  135 yards in losses. Kim, who also played linebacker, finished tied for the  team lead with 58 unassisted tackles.  </P> <P> Chris Maumalanga (Bishop Montgomery) -- Although the Knights were 0-4 in the  Angelus League, the 6-4, 320-pound Maumalanga was so impressive the league's  coaches named him Defensive Player of the Year. The two-way starter had nine  sacks and 86 tackles.  </P> <P> Kenny Talanoa (El Segundo) -- Named the Santa Fe League Lineman of the Year,  Talanoa helped the Eagles to second place and the Southern Section Division  VIII playoffs with his play at defensive end and tight end.  </P> <P> LINEBACKERS:  </P> <P> Nkosi Littleton (Carson) -- An All-L.A. City selection last season as a  defensive lineman, Littleton blossomed into a dominating middle linebacker this  year. He leads Carson with 131 tackles (59 unassisted), four fumble recoveries  and two forced fumbles. He was chosen the Pacific League Defensive Player of  the Year.  </P> <P> Sione Mahe (Hawthorne) -- Selected the Bay League Defensive Player of the Year,  Mahe's aggressive play helped the Cougars share the Bay title with Palos Verdes  and reach the Division II playoffs. He paced Hawthorne with 161 tackles (42  unassisted).  </P> <P> Steven Johnson (Serra) -- The defensive signal caller for Serra, Johnson led  the Cavaliers in tackles and helped the team hold opponents to an average of  less than 10 points a game. He is known for his speed and rugged play.  </P> <P> Jim Rudberg (Rolling Hills) -- A versatile two-way performer, Rudberg set the  school record for most tackles in a season with 121 and earned the Bay League  Offensive Player of the Year award for his blocking at tight end.  </P> <P> DEFENSIVE BACKS:  </P> <P> Mark Antrobius (Palos Verdes) -- The South Bay interception leader with 10,  Antrobius rarely came off the field for the Sea Kings. He also played wide  receiver and punted, averaging 37.6 yards a kick. He capped the season with two  interceptions in a Division II playoff loss to Newbury Park.  </P> <P> Clayton Lopez (Serra) -- Regarded as Serra's top college prospect, Lopez had  eight interceptions and ranked second on the team in tackles. He also played  wide receiver and contributed several big plays during the Cavaliers' drive to  the Division VII title.  </P> <P> Josh Moore (West Torrance) -- One of the area's most versatile players, Moore  led the Warriors in interceptions (eight), rushing (750 yards in 110 carries),  touchdowns (17) and ranked second in receptions (19 for 155 yards) playing  running back and cornerback. He was named Ocean League Player of the Year after  leading West to a 7-0 record and the championship.  </P> <P> Clayvand Thomas (Carson) -- The only junior on the all-star defense, Thomas  leads the Colts with six interceptions, including three he returned for  touchdowns. The cornerback also has three deflected passes, two sacks and a  forced fumble.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS 1989  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSE  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Eric Hansen  </P>

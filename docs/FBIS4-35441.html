			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's response yesterday  to the report about a "Palestinian constitution" drafted by a  French jurist at the request of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat was  one of derision. "It is all talk, just like the radio program,"  Rabin said.    On the other hand, senior political sources in Jerusalem  said  that preparing the constitution is "'Arafat's gravest violation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far," and that Israel's policy  will be to make sure the Palestinians "stick to the letter" of  the agreement. Political elements in Jerusalem are highly  embarrassed by Rabin's speech on Wednesday in which he mocked  'Arafat and described as utter nonsense the PLO head's remarks  about a Palestinian state and Jerusalem.    Rabin's abrasive reaction and his responses of "utter  nonsense" and "it is all talk" were viewed as ignoring the steps  'Arafat has taken so as not to lose public support for the  agreements with the PLO. The prime minister is expected to  clarify his position today, and to stress the importance with  which he views adherence to the spirit and letter of the  agreement.    Senior security sources, headed by Lieutenant General Ehud  Baraq, the chief of staff, and the Shin Bet head, recently  called on the prime minister to make sure the Gaza-Jericho  agreement is assiduously adhered to by the PLO and to react  sharply to any violations. They warned the prime minister that  if Israel ignores minor violations, the agreement might erode  and Israel's security and citizens might be harmed.    A senior Israeli defense source said "we must insist on  strict adherence to the agreement in the security field, and not  permit anything that deviates from the terms of the agreement.  We must be tough with them on every detail of the  implementation." The same source warned that "the  implementation will involve security and civilian problems, but  the security aspect is more worrisome, therefore standing firm  on security demands is the most important aspect for Israeli  society."    He said that if the Palestinians do not institute reasonable  security and effective control of Gaza and Jericho, Israel will  be forced "to take a complementary series of steps to manifest  our responsibility." Another senior element said in internal  consultations that if the PLO has the will it can fulfill its  commitments under the agreement despite the difficulties it is  facing. Nevertheless, there might be violations, whether due to  a deliberate policy by the Palestinian leadership or due to  difficulties in understanding and coordination in the field.    Various security sources said in internal deliberations that  the Palestinian leadership's activities in the Autonomy must be  thoroughly overseen to make sure it does not foment an intifadah  in the Jerusalem and West Bank areas remaining under Israeli  control. The security sources stressed in particular the need to  follow up on the PLO's promise not to harm collaborators in the  territories.    Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer, who played a  crucial role in drafting the agreement with the PLO, reacted  sharply to 'Arafat's reference to jihad and his announcement to  annul the military government's decrees in the territories.  Singer called 'Arafat's action a violation of the agreement and  said Israel has the right to respond with a violation for each  violation, which is legitimate under international law.    "Our ability to react under the law is almost limitless,"  Singer said in internal consultations. Security elements in  contact with the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho  however believe it is premature to evaluate the PLO's ability to  implement the agreement, and an additional test period is  required to learn the agreement and create understandings that  will enable its implementation. Sources in the field believe  that hitches in implementation are unavoidable at such an early  stage.</p>

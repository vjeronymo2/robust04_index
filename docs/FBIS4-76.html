			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 30 SAPA -- The South African Defence  Force [SADF] expects a good response to the call-up of Citizen's  Force and Commando members for the election period. SADF  Communications Chief Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said on  Wednesday [30 March] predictions of a turn-out of as low as five  per cent were hopelessly exaggerated.    Last year 49 per cent of part-time SADF members reported for  service when called up, and only 10.6 percent failed to report  for duty. Others obtained exemption, served in crucial posts or  could not be traced, said Gen Opperman.    The election call-up period is from April 15 to May 15.    Gen Opperman said he wanted to stop predictions of a low  response rate because this could lead to its realisation. "I  can't see how such predictions can be made. If people stop  creating a negative perception, and concentrate on the positive,  we can expect a good number of men."    The call-up had the approval of most parties, including the  End Conscription Campaign and the African National Congress, he  said. "They are all saying that the chaps should report. The  call-up is truly in the national interest and for ensuring free  and fair elections. I think people will react responsibly  despite their personal fears because this will be in South  Africa's macro-security interests."    Part-time force members would get salaries equalling those  of  their permanent force colleagues during the call-up period.  Subject to approval, the SADF would also pay an allowance to  them and permanent force members deployed to assist the police.    Asked about concerns about the party-political loyalties of  part-time SADF members and units, Gen Opperman said: "We have  total confidence in the members of our part-time forces and  think they will react very responsibly without allowing party  politics to influence their judgment."</p>

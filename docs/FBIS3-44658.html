Qi Jingfa, director of the Rural Enterprise Administration  Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the rural firms  earned a total profit of about 160 billion yuan (28 billion U.S.  dollars according to the then official exchange rate) last year,  while handing over to the state another 95 billion yuan (16.6  billion U.S. dollars).    The figure represents an increase of 70 percent over the  previous year's 150 billion yuan.    He put the total output value produced last year by the  country's 20 million rural firms at an estimated 2,900 billion  yuan, compared with 1,650 billion yuan in 1992, up 75.7 percent.    The official said the rural firms in the developing middle  and western part of China expanded rapidly and in the developed  coastal areas the rural firms made big progress in developing  export- oriented economy and improving their efficiency and  quality of products.    The total output value of exported goods manufactured by  rural firms last year is estimated at 190 billion yuan, about 60  percent more than in the previous year. They accounted for 45  percent of the country's total commodities purchased for export.    The director said the scale of rural firms and total  investment continued to grow, adding that the number of rural  firms whose gross output value exceeded 100 million yuan  increased from 256 in 1992 to 400 in 1993.    About 300 rural firms each sold more than 100 million yuan  worth of their products in 1993. Nearly 100 firms became the  biggest export goods producers among rural firms; each of them  produced more than 100 million yuan worth of exported goods.    In addition, ownership and management reforms are  progressing  across the country, with 10 percent of the 20 million rural  firms introducing a share-holding or cooperative system.    "Mergers, auctions, transfers of ownership, and filing for  bankruptcy have been introduced on a trial basis among China's  rural firms," said the official.    It is estimated that rural firms hired an additional six  million rural laborers last year, increasing the total number of  rural firm employees to 112 million.    Qi said that about 60 percent of the net per capita income  of  900 million Chinese farmers came from rural firms.    According to him, a lack of funds and specialized personnel  is among outstanding problems facing the rural firms.    He warned that rural firms in China will have to face more  challenges coming from growing competition in and outside China.    The introduction of the modern enterprise system to  state-owned enterprises, one third of which are now running at a  loss, will give full play to their advantages in technology,  management, capital and specialized personnel.    In comparison, some advantages of rural firms will gradually  be weakened. And the government's reform plans for this year,  including reform of existing financial, taxation, investment and  foreign trade systems, will have positive impacts on the rural  firms in general. But some changes will affect rural firms  adversely, the official said.    He cited as an example the fact that China is streamlining  its tax rates, saying that rural firms will pay more taxes than  before.    China's rural industry, which was a few years ago described  by Deng Xiaoping as "a new force suddenly coming to the fore",  has been growing at 30-50 percent each year since 1980.    Rural firms accounted for 31 percent of China's gross  industrial output in 1992, becoming the fast growing sector of  the country's economy.    Both the central and local governments have encouraged in  recent years the development of rural enterprises. The policy  was designed by the government to promote rural development,  improve farmers' income and absorb the huge number of surplus  rural laborers.    Surplus rural laborers in China now number about 100  million,  a figure expected to double by the year 2000.    China has set the total output value of the rural firms for  the year 2000 at 7,600 billion yuan, with a profit of 750  billion yuan and creation of 50 million new jobs.</p>

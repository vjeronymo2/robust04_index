			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Carey warns on Church finances THE CHURCH of England faces 'serious but not disastrous' financial problems as a result of an alarming decline in its assets, Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, told its General Synod yesterday. 'We have been living beyond our means for many years,' the archbishop told a debate on a report into the conduct of the Church commissioners, who are responsible for the Church's investments. He said action had to be taken to ensure that the problems did not become unmanageable. The total value of the commissioners' income-producing assets declined from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year, largely due to falls in the property market. In August a report from the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand commissioned by Dr Carey criticised the commissioners' heavy speculation in property. The Rt Rev John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford, who chaired the Lambeth Group - a committee set up to consider the report - told the Synod he did not seek to 'minimise the seriousness of the situation or to make light of the errors of judgment, or the instances of organisational weakness' which investigations had revealed. The Church commissioners, he said, saw yesterday's debate as an occasion for them to offer a public apology for what had happened. There had, said the bishop, been three principal problems: The commissioners increased an already large exposure to property, and compounded the problem by borrowing to finance speculative property investments. Their assets committee failed to receive regular and accurate reports from executive management. The commissioners took on commitments to finance clergy benefits in excess of their financial capacity. As a result of the fall in investment income parishes will have to meet more of their costs - a 15 per cent rise in local financial support is being sought - and the Church is examining ways of simplifying its organisational structure. Canon John Stanley, a member of the Lambeth Group, said he found it difficult to believe that Pounds 380m had been borrowed without reference to the commissioners' board of governors. The General Synod also attacked the government's policy of pit closures yesterday. The Bishop of Sheffield, the Rt Rev David Lunn, said: 'It seems to me quite amazing that ruthless treatment of the environment and communities can take place without proper consultation. This is an act of vandalism.'</p>

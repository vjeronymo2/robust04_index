			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Burda forecasts record profits on 8% sales gain THE AGGRESSIVE Burda publishing group yesterday forecast record profits and an 8 per cent increase in sales for 1991. Turnover, which has more than doubled in the past five years, would reach DM1.35bn, (Dollars 881m), the company said in an informal review of the last year. Claiming a 15 per cent share of the newly-opened magazine and newspaper market in east Germany, the company announced a DM500m, five-year investment programme. Half the total will be spent on expanding its five print works. The owner, Mr Hubert Burda, traditionally ploughs back all profits - expected to be DM75m in 1991 - into new plant and publications. In the past year, it has bombarded easterners with a range of lurid full-colour newspapers and magazines such as Super-Zeitung, which now sells 450,000 a day, matching the east German circulation of the long-established Bild. Burda opened a new print works in Berlin in a joint venture with News International.</p>

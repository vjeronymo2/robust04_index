			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Jozsef Kaproczay, parliamentary </F> representative of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Attila  Nagy; place and date not given: "Is the MDF's Popularity  Growing?"]    [Text] Ference Kulin, parliamentary group leader of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), recently said at one of  his regular Friday news conferences that during the past few  months the MDF's popularity has increased, especially in the  provinces. What is the opinion of Jozsef Kaproczay,  parliamentary representative from Szigetvar?    [Kaproczay] Before answering this question, I have to tell  you that my electoral district includes 71 local governments and  85 topographically distinct areas. There are numerous very  small settlements, with 50 villages having fewer than 500  inhabitants. Szigetvar's three large enterprises--the canning  and shoe factories, and the state farm--are in an unbelievably  difficult situation; I mention this because of the unemployment  situation that has developed, which obviously has an impact on  the so-called agglomerated districts as well as on agricultural  production. In spite of this, as I go around among my electors,  I have the feeling--and I am trying to formulate this  cautiously--that we have moved from the low point of  unpopularity.    [Nagy] What do you think is the reason for this?    [Kaproczay] Perhaps first is the farmers' circles movement,  which is increasingly "on solid ground." Thank God, in our area  during the past few months such farmers' circles have been  formed in five or six settlements. The preferential  machinery-purchasing drive also has had a very good effect on  the people who live in villages, especially in South Baranya  county, where conditions are more favorable for agriculture. I  should note, however, that as far as I know, this drive has 2  billion forints at its disposal; it would be a very great  mistake if it would not be possible to continually "replenish"  this sum. It would cause tremendous disappointment. Thus I can  say unequivocally that something has started to move. At the  same time, I must emphasize that people are interested in  knowing what is going on and they are starting to notice that  many things have happened in this country during the past four  years.    [Nagy] Do you think the media had a role in this?    [Kaproczay] Undoubtedly, although this is precisely what  prominent members of the opposition parties object to. I  personally object strenuously to the suggestion that this is  similar to the rosy propaganda of the last part of the Kadar  era.</p>

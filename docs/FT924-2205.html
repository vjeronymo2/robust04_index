			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Rowland's threat to move Lonrho surprises Bock MR TINY Rowland's threat to transfer the domicile of Lonrho to Germany has surprised advisers acting for Mr Dieter Bock, who is buying Mr Rowland's stake. Mr Bock, the German financier, expects to move to London if he decides to take up the seat on Lonrho's board, after completion of the rights issue on January 15. According to one adviser the idea of transferring Lonrho's operational headquarters to Germany is the first he has heard of it. "None of this has been discussed with Mr Bock," said the adviser. In an interview with The Observer, which is owned by Lonrho, Mr Rowland said: "If I felt the company would be better understood and receive greater support, we would be quite prepared to move our headquarters to Germany." Mr Bock is underwriting half the 200m shares in the three- for-10 rights issue at 85 per share, taking up Mr Rowland's rights, and buying half his 15 per cent stake at 115p a share with an option to buy the other half in three years time. Following the rights and sale of VAG, the Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operation in the UK, for Pounds 124m, Mr Rowland is predicting that Lonrho's net debt will soon fall below Pounds 700m, against Pounds 947m at September 30. Further asset sales are planned, including some of the 4,300 flats which Lonrho owns in western Germany. It is understood that while Mr Bock has not discussed changing Lonrho's domicile to Germany, he believes continental Europe will be an increasingly important trading area. This has encouraged further speculation that Mr Bock may be in favour of re-opening the talks with Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining group, over the future of Lonrho's 73 per cent controlling stake in Western Platinum. Mr Brian Gilbertson, head of Gencor, is keen to merge his platinum interests with Lonrho's to create the world's biggest platinum group.</p>

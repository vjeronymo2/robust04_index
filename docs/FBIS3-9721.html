That means that the ODS (66 deputies in the 200-seat  parliament) will insist on its stand although some ODS deputies  spoke with their coalition colleagues about a possible  compromise on Friday [25 March]. The ODS has favored that this  year it would be determined what senators would be elected for  two, four or six years.    The coalition is divided over the issue, as the minor  parties, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, 14 deputies), the  Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL,  15) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10) prefer a  different system consisting of 27 three-mandate constituencies.    The opposition is against having a Senate at all and is  calling for its abolition.    "This is the only way to apply the electoral system  stipulated by the Czech Constitution," Petrova stressed.    During Monday's coalition talks Premier and ODS Chairman  Vaclav Klaus told his partners that his party had not been fully  informed on the steps of some of its deputies regarding the  compromise. Today the ODS leadership appointed Klaus to deal  with the coalition partners on the issue.</p>

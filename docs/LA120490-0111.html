			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S WHERE L.A. COUNTY'S MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS GO  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's $256-million budget for  fiscal 1990-91 was designed to support a complex network of services for the  mentally ill, including 24 county-run outpatient clinics and 42 private,  nonprofit clinics running programs under contract to the department.  </P> <P> In addition, the department provides funding to psychiatric units at four  county hospitals, maintains residential programs for abused children or other  special groups, and has rights to 1,080 beds in the state mental hospitals.  </P> <P> When the budget was adopted in August, the county Board of Supervisors was  gambling on receiving millions of dollars of revenue from the passage of the  Proposition 134 liquor tax on the Nov. 6 ballot. But Proposition 134 was  defeated, leaving county mental health officials with the task of slashing  $41.9 million in programs.  </P> <P> Unless alternative funding is found, the department plans to close 19  county-run clinics and cancel numerous program contracts that will cause an  estimated 14 of the 42 private clinics to close and greatly reduce services at  others. About 27,000 patients of 58,000 currently treated at the clinics will  be cut off from care, mental health officials estimate.  </P></p>

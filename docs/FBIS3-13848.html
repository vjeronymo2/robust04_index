A few minutes ago, we spoke to Palestinian President  'Arafat in Tunis and asked him about his evaluation of the  Security Council resolution.    ['Arafat] Despite the fact that we do not have any queries  regarding the clarifications given by the U.S. envoy [to the  United Nations] especially with respect to the issue of  Jerusalem. [incomplete sentence as heard]    [Tannuri] Mr. President, there are positive indications from  the PLO regarding the resumption of talks. What, in your  opinion, is the ideal scenario for returning to the negotiation  table?    ['Arafat] As I said now, what has been agreed on in the  Security Council must be implemented very quickly. Israel must  take important and basic steps regarding the settlers,  especially in the Hebron area. They are the ones who claim that  there are two organizations that have become virtual outlaws.  These are Kakh and Kahana Hay. These two organizations have  supporters among the settlers. They have time bombs in their  possession. In addition, they have settlements; around five or  six settlements belong to them. What will the Israeli  Government's measures be regarding these settlements belonging  to these two groups?    [Tannuri] The other concerned Arab countries have decided to  return to negotiations. Does this raise questions once again  regarding Arab coordination?    ['Arafat] Yesterday, King Husayn phoned me twice, after he  had telephoned my brother President Hafiz al-Asad. He told me  that they had received telephone calls from U.S. President  Clinton to return to the peace negotiations. We agreed to  convene a meeting of the five foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria,  Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine as soon as possible to coordinate  stands over this matter.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Income funds look to Gas STRONG support for British Gas, apparently from income funds seeking to take advantage of the 3.5 per cent yield on the final dividend, drove the shares up sharply to close 9 higher at 298p. Buying was additionally fuelled by reports that James Capel, the leading agency broker, had upgraded its dividend forecasts for the company after Gas's 1992 figures announced on Thursday. The income funds are expected to be keen supporters of the stock until it goes ex-dividend on May 10. However, some specialists cautioned that the outcome of the inquiry being carried out by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission may be made public before that time.</p>

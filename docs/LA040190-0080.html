			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEP YOUNGSTERS AMUSED, BUILD A GAZEBO SANDBOX  </P> <P> Gazebos are still a trendy yard decoration, even though they're as old as  gardening itself. Gracing the hills of Rome in the first century, gazebos are  appearing more and more in contemporary gardens.  </P> <P> A variation of the summerhouse, as gazebos are sometimes called, is our gazebo  sandbox. Sure to bring joy to the whole family, it's a focal point for your  garden and a shady place for children to play.  </P> <P> Hexagon in shape, it measures 7 feet high and 5 feet wide. Choosing  splinter-free finished lumber (fir is recommended), the sandbox sides are  assembled.  </P> <P> Posts are next mounted with seat pieces fitting easily in the post slots. An  apron is added as an optional feature to strengthen the seat; the bottom  portion is left open so a lawn trimmer may be used.  </P> <P> Redwood lath material is cut and fitted upon rafters forming the gazebo, which  is then screwed down upon the posts. A materials list and a lumber shopping  guide are included in the plan; as well as detailed step-by-step directions,  photos and drawings.  </P> <P> To obtain Kids Gazebo Sandbox, Plan 792, please send $5.50. Also available is  our Patterns for Better Living catalogue, picturing over 700 woodworking and  handicraft projects, $3.95. Prices include postage and handling.

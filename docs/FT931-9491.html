			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Unigate launches Pounds 50m bid for Clifford UNIGATE, Britain's fourth largest dairy group, yesterday launched a Pounds 50.37m recommended cash bid for Clifford Foods, the Berkshire-based dairy, juices and food company which recently suffered a sharp drop in profits. Unigate is offering 573p for each Clifford ordinary share and 251p for each non-voting A share. The bid has been accepted by Clifford's directors and family shareholders, who together control 51.8 per cent of the ordinary shares. Unigate said it expected the acquisition to enhance earnings in the first year. It would add about 3 percentage points to Unigate's share of the liquid milk market in England and Wales, taking it to about 16 per cent. Clifford has two milk processing facilities and five depots in southern England and provides doorstep deliveries to 170,000 customers. It also produces fruit juices, food ingredients and chilled and frozen convenience meals. Mr Ross Buckland, Unigate chief executive, said the addition of Clifford would strengthen his group's dairy business, which covers a band stretching across the south of the country from Kent to Cornwall. As well as expanding the dairy capacity, the acquisition would provide a modern fruit juice plant to replace a Unigate facility in London due to close shortly. Clifford's pre-tax profits fell 60 per cent to Pounds 1.03m in the first half last year on turnover of Pounds 70.1m. It blamed the cost of modernising a dairy, lower sales of convenience foods and the impact of price-cutting on supermarket milk sales. The deal is conditional on there being no reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, but Mr Buckland said he expected no competition policy problems. Clifford's share price closed at 473p yesterday, down 50p, while Unigate closed at 342p, up 15p. Unigate, which is also involved in food processing, road transport and used car auctions, has steadily added to its liquid milk operations recently. Last year it acquired two small dairies, Abbots and Sussex, and last month acquired some of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk distribution businesses. This is the second time Unigate has bid for Clifford. Its first offer, which was hostile, was rejected in 1980.</p>

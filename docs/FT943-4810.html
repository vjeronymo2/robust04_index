			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: The Playboy of the Western World - Theatre Watching and hearing JM Synge's celebrated play The Playboy of the Western World - in my case for the second time in 15 days - is an astonishment. So simple a story, dramatised with such surprising ambiguity. I have plenty of reservations about Lynne Parker's new staging at the Almeida, but I take it that the full-throated approval of the first-night audience denotes pleasure in the play itself. Which is as it should be. The most vital of all the play's layers is its language. There is the infectious skill with which Synge makes ordinary Irish talk intoxicatingly poetic. And it is Christy Mahon, the lying playboy, whose talk is the most infectious of all: '. . . there's torment in the splendour of her like, and she a girl any moon of midnight would take pride to meet, facing southwards on the heaths of Keel.' Not that his words are all lies. From his capacity for poetry we glimpse his capacity for courage; and it is he who changes most during the play. The finest poetry arises from the romance between Christy, the dark starving stranger who arrives from the cold, and Pegeen Mike, the daughter of this house in County Mayo. Sometimes Synge makes their love sound as predestined and potent as if they were Siegmund and Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walkure - and yet he also satirically debunks it. For this is only County Mayo, where people, including Pegeen, are daft enough to hero-worship Christy for his tale of having killed his own father. And he is only Christy, whose lies may make him the all-conquering 'playboy' on his arrival, but who is still scared of the father who is only too alive. Synge has us laugh at all these characters - up to a point. The final, beautiful twist of his play, is that their base coal can indeed be turned to diamond. For Christy really does win the village games, and then does beat his father; and Pegeen really has lost her heart to him. Lynne Parker's direction has great virtues. All the characters are three-dimensional; Christy (Aidan Gillen) is, correctly, not the gorgeous hunk that the village women all make him out to be; and the loneliness of Pegeen and Christy is unusually touching. On the other hand, the production's tempo is frequently too deliberate, its tone too carefully distilled. Where Synge's lines cry out to be spoken with spirit and speed, they are often here taken slowly and softly. Other reservations? Christy, on arrival, is too clean; everything and everybody (save Pegeen) looks - in Kathy Strachan's designs - too prosperous and modern for 'the wild coast of Mayo in 1907'; Pegeen's father and the other Mayo men are too sober; and Pegeen and the Widow Quin (Gina Moxley) are sometimes inaudible. And to frame the play with one of McCormack's Irish-song records - between scenes as well as at the start and end - adds a heavy note of polite nostalgia not to be found in Synge's play. There are, none the less, rewards enough here. Until Christy's exit, Aislan O'Sullivan brings Pegeen to life - her boredom, longing, temper  - with first-rate body-language. Gillen is pretty well the kind of raven-haired shrimp that Synge's playboy should be, a weak son whom every woman will motheringly adore, yet with just enough steel to surprise. And at every point the absence of Oirish cuteness and blarney is pure tonic. Almeida Theatre, London N1</p>

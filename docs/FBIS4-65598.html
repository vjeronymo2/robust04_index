			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by </F> Francoise Crouigneau, Jacques Decquiert, and Jean-Michel Lamy;  place and date not given: "Jean-Luc Dehaene: `Belgium Is a  Forerunner as Far as Federal Matters Are Concerned'"]    [Text] As the leader of a center-right coalition, the  Belgian prime minister is no stranger to compromise, whether it  is a matter of following the line of decisionmaking within his  political family or looking for a new balance within the new  federal system. In Belgium, the regions and the communities  actually have real powers. The essential thing is to manage to  run the government efficiently.    This constraint -- or this ambition -- is exactly the same  as  that involved in organizing Europe. This head of government is  so convinced of this that most of the diplomats are saying that  he will succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European  Commission. Officially, he is not a candidate. However, he is  the favorite of France and Germany. His vision of Europe is one  of a pragmatic government which takes action to correct extreme  diversity via carefully identified unifying elements.    [LES ECHOS] You played a major role in the rise of Belgian  federalism. How does a prime minister, a man of power, judge  its strengths and weaknesses?    [Dehaene] For 15 years I was very closely involved in the  reform of the Belgian state, convinced that we could develop a  policy which was more in line with the particular features of  each region and community. This process began in the seventies,  after the preliminary implementation of a number of language  laws. The options for an eventual Belgian federation were then  potentially integrated. Our success was due to the stages we  undertook. In 1970, we created separate Parliaments comprising  national members of Parliament who had two separate duties. In  1980, we set up regional and community governments with their  own administrations and budgets. Initially, they were put  together within the context of national power. In 1988, the new  phase transferred many more powers and resources to the regions  and communities. As of the next elections, this will be the  final phase: Each region or community will have its own  Parliament.    In 20 years, we have moved from a unitary system to a  federal  organization, as used in Switzerland, Germany, and the United  States. We did this through political agreements passed with  special majorities, and this never led to any bloody fighting.  I am convinced that this is an evolution which will eventually  be achieved in several European countries.    In Spain, there are 16 different regions having differing  powers. Italy is debating the same issues now that it is forming  a government. In Germany, the Laender are asking for more  powers. All this is not just the mere application of the  principle of subsidiarity. I never saw this better expressed  than at the Edinburgh summit, where the issue was to avoid too  much centralization at European level. As European unity grows,  there is a need for a stronger link with the basic identity and  a search for ones roots. In many countries, this is the nation.  However, in several countries, the nation concept was born in  the 19th century by driving back deeper fundamental links that  will now have to be reassessed. To use a cliche, we need unity  in diversity.    Europe needs unity to get the most out of its own potential  capacities, while at the same time avoiding to become a uniform  melting pot. Belgium is a forerunner as far as federal matters  are concerned. Sublimating diversity necessarily implies forms  of nationalism which will lead to racism if there is no European  unity to counterbalance this tendency. The Yugoslav crisis is  exactly that.    [LES ECHOS] Can one imagine a federal Europe which even the  French and British find satisfactory?    [Dehaene] I am wary of labels. I think that Europe must be  given a structure while at the same time avoiding the struggle  for labels. In certain strategic areas there must be enough  coherence for Europe to operate as it is. I am convinced that  we never would have reached a GATT agreement if trade issues had  not been defined, since the time of the Treaty of Rome, as  falling within the authority of the Community. If the Twelve  had negotiated separately, we never could have concluded the  negotiations. We must therefore put the authority at the level  where it should be. In certain cases, the national or regional  dimension is more efficient.    [LES ECHOS] Over the past few years, has too much priority  been given to harmonization?    [Dehaene] Europe has fallen somewhat victim to the process  of  building up the single market; "1992" was a major factor in  anticipatory economic dynamics. With the recession, the good  times collapsed in an even more visible manner. It must be  stressed that the Single Act called for an increase in the  number of directives, something which will never be repeated.  These European laws were often implemented in an overly  detailed and overly centralist manner. Most of the time, this  was not the fault of the Commission, but was the result of  demands made by certain countries which wanted to safeguard  national interests. Afterwards, it is easy to poke fun at it.  However, this centralism does not spring from the wishes of the  European bodies.    [LES ECHOS] In the future will you be favorable toward  strengthening the system of European Union [EU] preferences?    [Dehaene] In the context of GATT, we reached certain  agreements on this matter within the EU. We have to be able to  successfully eliminate elements of social and environmental  dumping. The constitution of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  is an important factor in regulation. The EU must play an  active role. We cannot deny it certain protectionist tools  which others might be using as well.    [LES ECHOS] How do you view France's attitude during these  trade negotiations?    [Dehaene] The French position contributed a number of  factors  to the EU strategy. France played an important role on the  cultural clause, which was adopted on its behalf by the EC.  Conversely, Paris was forced into positions which, in the long  term, seem to me to be easier to defend. The situation would  have been different if France had operated on its own. All in  all, the outcome was better.    [LES ECHOS] Should not the member states be given back their  role with respect to the Commission? Where does the right  institutional balance lie?    [Dehaene] This debate will be at the heart of the  intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996 on the reform of  the institutions. It will take a lot of creativity to find a  balance between the various approaches. There is a tendency to  mix them up. Some are using the enlargement process as an excuse  to demand more decisionmaking powers for large countries, while  at the same time pleading for an intergovernmental approach to  Europe. Now, this would imply equality between all the  governments. Clarification is needed. Subsidiarity requires  one to know the different approaches one wants in different  areas. If we take the example of trade policy, the element of  control lies more at the level of the European Parliament and  the Commission, with a specific role for the Council of  Ministers. When the intergovernmental aspect dominates, then it  is the Council of Ministers which takes precedence.    The principle of subsidiarity makes it possible to move  forward. In this respect, and with all its weaknesses, the  Maastricht Treaty represents progress. Especially if we look at  it in terms of a dynamic process.    [LES ECHOS] Does this concept not imply at least an element  of arbitration, if not the elaboration of a Constitution?    [Dehaene] One of the challenges of the years to come is to  guarantee this European dynamism by being pragmatic enough to  take into account the way in which reality develops. It is  clear that such dynamism was evident at one stage. It is also  clear that for the time being, in public opinion practically  everywhere, there is at least skepticism and, even in some  places, a tendency to fold back on oneself: Supposedly Europe  no longer has the meaning it had following the end of the Cold  War. Admittedly, the environment is different, but then the  Community was not a product of the Cold War. And outside the EU,  there is tremendous hope. Maybe these outside hopes are  excessive, but maybe the internal disappointments are also  excessive. We must ponder this paradox of a certain tendency to  once again call into question this dynamism at a time when the  European element needs strengthening.    [LES ECHOS] This skepticism on the part of Europeans is a  product of concern about rising unemployment, in particular.  What do you consider to be the most interesting aspect of the  White Paper in terms of creating jobs?    [Dehaene] The merit of the White Paper is that it created a  framework of reference for organizing the labor market. Some  elements are common to all countries: There is a structural  unemployment problem, which is characteristic of Europe. In  Belgium, the "global plan for employment and competitiveness" is  a specific application of the chapter on employment in the White  Paper. We have introduced reforms along the lines of what is  happening virtually everywhere in Europe. We must be able to  achieve this transformation of the labor market in a manner that  avoids calling the European model into question once again. In  most countries of the Community, social security is funded to an  excessive extent by taxes on employment, by increasing wage  costs and, above all, the gap between gross and net salaries.  The issue can only be resolved by completely "unraveling" the  system providing social protection. Consequently, we must seek  alternative sources of financing. However, this choice could  lead to distortions if it is done separately in all the member  states. Taking up one of the ideas contained in the White  Paper, we should use new sources of financing, such as taxes on  carbon dioxide emissions. I am in favor of this provided that  the fiscal pressure on companies is not increased. A change  must be made in the way social security is financed, while the  tax burden on an overabundant factor, employment, should be  relieved in return.    [LES ECHOS] How do you view the dynamics of the present  enlargement?    [Dehaene] We should have deepened the Community before  enlarging it. However, the compromise agreed in Lisbon in June  1992 opened up the way for negotiations with the four candidate  countries, before any deepening could take place. This enabled  us to break the impasse concerning ratification of the  Maastricht Treaty, which was blocked at the time. It is rather  facile to go over the discussion again today without taking  account of the context.    Why this prejudice claiming that the four new member states  will weaken European dynamism? I have noted a political will on  their part that goes beyond mere participation in the single  market. In other bodies they play the institutional game to the  best of their ability. They must be given their chance.    As for Eastern Europe, we should probably proceed with  political cooperation at a swifter pace. Association with  Western Europe is important. The agreements concluded in the  economic sector are also important. However, for the moment, it  is premature to set any date. On the other hand, we must  establish a timetable and define its stages.    [LES ECHOS] In Belgium, as in France, there are those who  criticize the strong monetary policy and its rigor. Do you  still believe that you will manage to respect the convergence  criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty?    [Dehaene] If we do not manage to achieve monetary union,  then  sooner or later the single market will be rendered unsound.  Devaluation can perhaps be used as a competitive tool only once;  using it two or three times is untenable. In order to keep its  place in the world, Europe needs the single market. The path  mapped out at Maastricht is the only way forward. I am  convinced that the decision on the single currency will be  political, and not purely mechanical. Just look at the example  of the union of the eastern and western German mark. If Helmut  Kohl had taken a gradual approach, Germany would definitely not  have become unified. I am aware that the policy of monetary  stability that Europe has chosen is not an easy option, but it  is the only road that will provide us with a healthy structural  base. The other path would put us to sleep and lead, sooner or  later, to a painful awakening.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Federal Interior Minister Maj Gen  (retd) Naseerullah Babar. Wednesday said army's operation  clean-up in Sindh was likely to continue until June.    Talking to newsmen here at the exhibition of Japanese  calendars, he said the police and Rangers were being retrained  to handle the situation in the province.    He said the government was planning to introduce police and  jail reforms to improve the law and order situation in the  country.    The minister said the Peshawar-based Arab volunteers had  been  asked to leave the country before January 31. He said the  government had decided not to renew the passports of the  nationals of other countries residing in Pakistan. He said the  government was facing some difficulties due to its earlier  decision to issue passports to 150,000 foreigners.    About the presence of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing]  agents  in the country, the minister said the number of Indians visiting  Pakistan had increased manifold after the late President Zia's  cricket diplomacy. He said a large number of Indians made it  difficult for police to check them properly.    About the process of accountability, the minister said: "We  do not want to harass any one. The government has always taken  the nation into confidence over major issues."    Commenting on the possibility of filing reference against  the  Nawaz government functionaries, he said: "We should be  positive." However, he said, the matter would be decided after  the finalisation of enquiry report of schemes like Motorway and  yellow cab. "Whoever plundered the national exchequer will be  taken to task," he said.    He said: "There is no emergency. We do not have much time  to continue chasing them. We should be firm, the cases should  not be half-baked like the previous government had done. It was  just the waste of time and money."    Commenting on Nusrat Bhutto's recent remarks, he said the  government was stable and becoming more and more stable  day-by-day. He said Nusrat referred to an astrologer and her  comment was not based on any political analysis. "We do not  want to be disrespectful to anyone. She is the mother of the  Prime Minister, but no one is above the law.    Asking the press not to exploit the family matter, he said:  "Nusrat is a mother who faced many tragedies."    Gen. Naseerullah Babar said the opposition was trying to  satisfy their ego. "They are not harming us but the national  interest," he said.    Referring to Nawaz's visit to Bosnia, the minister said it  should be investigated as to how he got money for the visit. He  said it was up to the CBR [Central Board of Revenue] to enquire  into the matter.    About Mir Murtaza Bhutto, he said: "if he is declared  innocent by the court, we will have no objections to his  release. Let the law take its course. Murtaza Bhutto was not a  political threat to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government  as he had no impact on the party."    About Altaf Hussain, he said: "The MQM [Muhajir Qaumi  Movement] leader will meet the same fate as Murtaza Bhutto had  faced," adding that the law was same for everyone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The OECD is likely to revise  slightly upward the economic growth it forecast for the Group of  Seven (G-7) industrialized economies for 1994, the Paris-based  organization's Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye said Tuesday  [5 April]. "The U.S. economic recovery is stronger than  expected, there is the first sign of recovery in Europe and the  very beginning of the first sign in Japan," Paye said.    In its economic outlook issued in December, the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast a 2.1 percent  growth for member nations, with a 0.5 percent growth for Japan.  The organization is expected to issue a new outlook in June.    Paye, currently on a regular visit to Tokyo to discuss the  OECD's annual ministerial meeting in June with Japanese leaders,  mentioned the possible upward revision at a press conference at  the Japan National Press Club.    Regarding the agenda of June's meeting, Paye said the focus  will be on the problem of unemployment among member nations, the  future of world trading following the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round of trade talks, and OECD relations with nonmember nations.    The main cause of the current unemployment problem is, Paye  said, "the gap which exists between the need for adjusting our  economy and ability or willingness to adjust."    He said the OECD nations need to tackle this problem through  a macroeconomic approach and by revising structural policy,  leading to a more flexible economy and a more skillful work  force.    As for global trading following the conclusion of the  Uruguay  Round of talks, Paye pointed out the importance of balancing  trade and protecting the environment.    In this respect, he stressed the necessity of creating  international rules to prevent protectionist moves using  environmental concerns as excuses.    Paye said the OECD has expanded its relations with nonmember  nations in line with the rapidly changing global situation. As  part of that, the organization will welcome Mexico as its first  new member in 21 years at the forthcoming ministerial meeting,  bringing the number of its member states to 25.</p>

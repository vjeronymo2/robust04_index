			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW COLUMNISTS DRAW PRAISE FROM NEAR AND FAR  </P> <P> How marvelous to read Melvin -- formerly Mel -- Durslag in the Los Angeles  Times. The more formal name can't presage a more elegant or sophisticated view  of the sporting scene since he long ago scaled the heights in both those  categories.  </P> <P> Congratulations and thanks for acquiring his unique talents.  </P> <P> E.C. BRESSLER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

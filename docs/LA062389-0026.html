			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $108-MILLION EXTENSION COMPLETE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO TROLLEY SET TO START EL CAJON RUNS  </P> <P> The latest extension of the San Diego Trolley's East Line -- connecting the  Spring Street station in La Mesa with the El Cajon Transit Center -- will go  into service Saturday with a Community Ride Day.  </P> <P> Metropolitan Transit Development Board administrators and local officials plan  to inaugurate the six-mile segment with a ribbon-cutting ceremony today. The  new track completes the $108-million, 11.1-mile East Line extension.  </P> <P> "MTDB is extremely pleased to expand the San Diego Trolley from a 24-mile to a  30-mile system consisting of lines in two major travel corridors," MTDB  Chairman James R. Mills said in a news release. "The San Diego community at  large should take credit for supporting innovative ideas to solve our regional  transportation problems."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Began in November, 1986  </P> <P> Work on the latest extension began in November, 1986, and was scheduled to be  completed by July, 1989. "MTDB is proud that, like the South Line and the first  two East Line segments, our third project is opening ahead of schedule and  under budget," MTDB General Manager Thomas F. Larwin said.  </P> <P> The 11.1-mile extension from Euclid Avenue to the El Cajon Transit Center is  MTDB's first to be built with federal money. The total budget of $108 million  -- $58 million in federal funds -- paid for the installation of the tracks,  electrical lines and eight new stations, as well as 15 air-conditioned cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> System Welcomed  </P> <P> East County public officials welcomed the trolley system's arrival into their  communities. "The East Line gives our residents an alternative way to get to  downtown San Diego besides driving on increasingly congested freeways," said El  Cajon Mayor John Reber.  </P> <P> East Line trolleys, running at 15- and 30-minute intervals, are expected to  ferry 15,000 riders a day by the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Rides on the new segment during the Community Ride Day Saturday are free, and  entertainment will be provided at the stations. Fare service begins Sunday.  </P></p>

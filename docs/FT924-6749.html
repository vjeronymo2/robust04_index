			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,700 mark A CALM session in UK equities suddenly sprang to life yesterday afternoon when the FT-SE Index jumped 24.8 points to regain the 2,700 mark again in response to better news on domestic retail sales, interest rate cuts in Belgium and Holland and hints that the resumed GATT talks would reach a satisfactory outcome. The upturn, which favoured consumer and retail industry stocks, was led by demand for stock index futures and by speculative excitement prompted by disclosure of a potential bid for Union Discount, once one of the monarchs of London's discount house network. Having shown only a very modest improvement until early in the afternoon, the stock market rose sharply when the December future contract on the Footsie threw off the lethargy of the past two sessions and moved back into a substantial premium against the underlying index. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,704, just below the day's best levels, with the December contract still showing a good premium. Trading volume increased as the market advanced to record a Seaq-reported total for the day of 551m shares against 480.4m on Tuesday. Dealers said that turnover remained below the peak levels of recent weeks, noting that shortage of stock had been a significant factor yesterday's price gains. Retail value on Tuesday was relatively low at Pounds 816.7m. Market strategists expressed confidence in the market's rebound which underlined London's success in resisting weakness in other global stock markets earlier this week and was unperturbed by yesterday's news that the UK government plans another sale of shares in BT, the national telecommunications network. They hope to see the Footsie challenge its all-time trading highs of around 2,744 reached in May this year. The rise of 0.1 per cent in October domestic retail sales, showing a year on year rise of 1.8 per cent, surprised a market discouraged on Tuesday by a somewhat bearish report on the distributive trades from the Confederation of British Industry. News of interest rate cuts in Belgium and Holland, together with suggestions that bank analysts in Germany were predicting sharp falls in Bundesbank rates as early as January, restored some of London's hopes that the next cut in UK base rates will not be long postponed. Nervousness lest the cut in base rates announced in the Autumn economic statement might prove the last for some months had unsettled the market at the beginning of the week. Gradually, sentiment in the market turned higher after a dull start which had seen shares held back by another fall in Hong Kong equities. A lengthy list of corporate trading statements helped buttress confidence. Good results from the sector helped breweries follow the retail store groups and the banks to higher ground. The international blue chips, restrained by an easier trend in the US dollar, and by an uncertain start to the new session in New York, achieved only relatively modest gains. However, these leading stocks later began to respond to the strength of the stock index future and also to renewed interest in prospects for ICI's plans to demerge its bio-scientific interests.</p>

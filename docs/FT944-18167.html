			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Group led by cool chairman The Gooda Walker agency did itself no favours when it recruited Mr Michael Deeny, a 49-year-old Irishman and chairman of the victorious Gooda Walker Names Action Group, to become a member of its flagship syndicate - 290 - in 1985. Mr Deeny, a chartered accountant, has proved an able and proficient political leader, successfully co-ordinating the biggest campaign for compensation ever fought by Lloyd's Names. He is now a music promoter organising concerts for the likes of U2, Bruce Springsteen and Nirvana and Luciano Pavarotti, but trained as an accountant after graduating in history from Magdalene College, Oxford. Recruited to Lloyd's by an agent who had links with a number of Irish QCs, Mr Deeny says he considered Lloyd's to be a conservative investment. 'I thought if they think it is OK it will be OK. It seemed to be an established institution which had been sending Names cheques for 300 years,' he explained. However, unlike many fellow Gooda Names, Mr Deeny took an active involvement at the market, interviewing underwriters and checking accounts. He has an informed view of accounting policies at Lloyd's, criticising those of the one Gooda Walker syndicate of which he was a member, the group's flagship syndicate 290, as 'highly misleading', mainly because of the way purchases of financial reinsurance - a policy which allows syndicates to manage their reserves more effectively - were treated. After losing money Mr Deeny became active in the group's campaign and took over as chairman following a row over a plan to remunerate committee members late in 1992. As chairman of the action group, Mr Deeny has taken a cool and calculated approach, avoiding the loose allegations and emotionalism favoured by some of his fellow leaders. The group's action was tightly focused and well organised. Yesterday Mr Deeny was typically phlegmatic. 'The photographers are hassling me to crack open champagne but I really don't feel like it,' he said. 'This thing has wrecked people's lives. It has been pretty horrific.'</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Former director issues denial MR MICHAEL STONEY, a former senior executive in the Maxwell business empire, yesterday 'vigorously denied' any dishonesty in relation to documents naming him as a signatory to more than Pounds 180m in 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers last year. Mr Stoney, group managing director (finance) of MGN until December last year, was named alongside Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell in the chairman's review issued on Tuesday with the group's 1991 accounts. Mr Anthony Burton, his solicitor, said last night: 'In so far as it is inferred in the reports about Mr Stoney, my client vigorously denies that his conduct in relation to all or any of these transactions was dishonest.' Mr Burton said he was considering the MGN document and press reports surrounding it, and would take 'whatever action we consider appropriate'. Mr Stoney has been working full-time with accountants from Arthur Andersen, administrators to the private Maxwell companies, since the end of last year, helping in their efforts to investigate movements of funds through the business empire. He has also answered questions posed by Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, trustee and manager of the Maxwell pension funds. However, Mr Stoney, through his solicitors, declined to answer questions posed by MPs on the Commons social security committee earlier this year, citing 'his common-law right of silence'.</p>

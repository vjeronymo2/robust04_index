			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT IN STEP WITH LEADER, LIGACHEV SAYS  </P> <P> Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative in the Kremlin's leadership, said  Thursday that he fully agrees with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the need  for fundamental political and economic reforms despite speculation for more  than a year of a deep rift between them.  </P> <P> "There are efforts to set Ligachev against Gorbachev and against other people  as well," Ligachev declared. "But the position of Ligachev totally and fully  coincides with that of Gorbachev."  </P> <P> Ligachev made his remarks at an unusual press conference, his first with  foreign journalists, after the close of a two-day party Central Committee  meeting on agricultural reforms. He arrived from the daylong meeting appearing  dour, but at the end of the two-hour session he was smiling and joking.  </P> <P> Also at the press conference, Vadim A. Medvedev, who succeeded Ligachev last  autumn in the key post of the party secretary in charge of ideology, announced  that the Central Committee has appointed a special commission to look into the  behavior of Boris N. Yeltsin, a former alternate member of the Politburo who  has clashed with both Gorbachev and Ligachev in the past.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who many observers believe will win election to the new Congress of  People's Deputies, was removed from the Politburo early last year after  complaining that Ligachev behaved dictatorially and that Gorbachev's reforms  were proceeding too slowly.  </P> <P> The relationship between Gorbachev and Ligachev, who had stood second in the  ruling Politburo until last autumn when he was shifted from being the party  secretary in charge of ideological issues to party secretary for agricultural  policy, has been widely discussed in political circles here; Ligachev is often  viewed as the voice of caution and conservatism as Gorbachev has tried to  broaden and accelerate his reforms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ligachev the Defender  </P> <P> He and Gorbachev have appeared to differ most recently over the agricultural  reforms, with Gorbachev advocating the leasing of farmland, equipment and other  assets to small groups of farmers and even individuals in an effort to expand  agricultural production and Ligachev defending the 60-year-old system of state  and collective farms although they are unable to feed the nation.  </P> <P> Earlier, he and Gorbachev had diverged significantly in their public statements  on the scope and speed of the whole program of political, economic and social  reforms, on the ideological basis for Soviet foreign policy and on the way that  the Communist Party leads the country.  </P> <P> But at Thursday's press conference, Ligachev wagged a finger at questioning  journalists and said: "Please understand me. We have full unity on all basic  questions, not only in agriculture but on other matters of principle as well."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, he added, "carries out his duties splendidly" and has the  Politburo's full support.  </P> <P> "I know they call Ligachev a conservative, sometimes even a reactionary,"  Ligachev said. "But this arises from misunderstanding of the matter, or  sometimes also out of a desire to see a divided Soviet leadership. Ligachev's  positions are fully in line with the Politburo's positions."  </P> <P> Ligachev expressed confidence that the new agrarian policies will resolve the  country's acute food shortage by 1995.  </P> <P> Despite Ligachev's unusual remarks on the much-debated issue of his  relationship with Gorbachev, Radio Moscow gave more prominence in its late  evening news report to the appointment of the special party commission on  Yeltsin, even though the report on Yeltsin will not be ready until well after  the March 26 election.  </P> <P> The commission, appointed on the complaint of a Central Committee member from a  Moscow electrical engineering plant, is to review the former Moscow party  chief's statements to see whether he had broken with party policy and whether  he should be further disciplined.  </P></p>

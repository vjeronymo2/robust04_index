			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURROGATE PARENTING  </P> <P> It's absolutely infuriating to read about an individual who sues another for  something that is practically impossible to decide fairly.  </P> <P> I'm referring to the article about the surrogate, Anna Johnson, who is suing  the biological parents of the child she is carrying for "fetal neglect" (Aug.  14).  </P> <P> Johnson had an agreement with Cris and Mark Calvert to bear their child since  Mrs. Calvert was unable to do so. That should be it. What gives her (or anybody  else) the right to decide that the Calverts will not be suitable parents when  too many variables are involved?  </P> <P> It's cases like this that weigh down our court system and make it unworkable.  </P> <P> TERRI NOLAN  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

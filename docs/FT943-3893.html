			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Virus test decision should be explained Sir, Your editorial 'Open science' (September 8) was exactly on target. This society, which has worked for more than 26 years to preserve Britain's native butterflies, moths and their habitats, was very concerned indeed to learn of tests of a genetically engineered virus near Oxford. The virus was known to be lethal to a large proportion of the UK butterfly and moth species on which it had been previously tested in the laboratory, although the commercial aim of the new field tests, we understand, is to develop sprays to combat insect attack on crops in, mainly, developing countries. The test site was just 100m from Wytham Wood, one of the richest sites for lepidoptera in the whole of the UK, including now-rare species. We raised formal objections when we first heard about these tests, which are only notified to the public by advertisements in local newspapers. We were therefore concerned to hear that, on the advice of the ACRE Committee, the secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, had authorised the tests. In the following weeks we have made vigorous efforts to find out from him the basis of the trials, what consideration the ACRE Committee gave to our and others' objections, and what practical steps were insisted upon to guard against escape of the virus and where the responsibility lies for monitoring these precautions. We have received two letters which really do not go any way to answer our questions. It is high time, as you say, that the deliberations and bases of decision of such committees were in the public domain. We are forced to be suspicious that the committee gave inadequate consideration to the risks and the objections; if this is not the case, why is there so much obfuscation of their processes of decision.

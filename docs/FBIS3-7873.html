After a last  round of talks, attended also by the members of the delegations,  the two presidents made short statements to the press.    Romanian President Ion Iliescu underlined the political  significance of the visit -- the first at that level since the  December revolution in Romania and Mr. Censu Tabone's first  visit in Romania -- and the favourable political climate of the  relations between Romania and Malta. "President Censu Tabone's  presence in Romania represents an expression of the political  willingness to consolidate the bilateral relations and the  collaboration within international bodies," said the Romanian  head of state. Both parties have agreed to intensify the  cooperation in the fields of shipment, telecommunications,  services, tourism, science and culture. The Romanian Foreign  Ministry will draw up a draft treaty of friendship between the  two countries to be signed, if possible, within the current  year, President Iliescu said.    In his turn, the Maltese head of state said that during the  three days of his visit in Romania he learned of Romania as of a  country experiencing a development process, a people who  regained the democratic beliefs and who affirmed an European  vocation, who is boldly integrating within the European  structures. President Tabone expressed hope that the  preparation of the friendship treaty would not last too long as  its finalisation within the current year would enable President  Iliescu to make a visit in the Republic of Malta. President  Tabone said he would ask the Maltese Parliament and Government  to invite the Romanian president for a visit in Malta.    The Maltese president's visit in Romania included interviews  with the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and  with the Senate's vice-president Ioan Doru Taracila (the Senate  president was making a visit in Japan at the time). An  invitation was made that a Romanian parliamentary delegation  make a visit in the Republic of Malta. During his stay,  President Tabone visited also Sinaia mountain resort and the  Brasov County, central Romania.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Food and Drink: Technique saves the day - Edmund Penning-Rowsell considers the 1993 clarets IN THE first 10 days of August there was the prospect of a very fine claret vintage in Bordeaux but severe gales, followed by weeks of rain, changed the prospects radically. September was the wettest month since the disastrous 1965 vintage. Yet, if 1993 will not turn out another vintage-of-the-century candidate, it will not be a catastrophe either as some favourable conditions were maintained, ensuring at least a large proportion of healthy, fairly mature grapes. The skins were very thick and there was little or no rot for those chateaux equipped to deal with earlier mildew and botrytis, and which had summer-pruned their vines (vendange verte) in July. Mouton-Rothschild sprayed its vineyard 14 times rather than the normal nine. Merlot grapes always ripen before the Cabernets. Those who picked them early brought healthy grapes of good alcoholic strength into the fermentation vats  -as I saw in a number of chateaux. Large troupes of pickers were employed, and Petrus was entirely picked on September 24 and 25. Selection was all-important in the vineyard as well as before being tipped into the hoppers. There were none of the clouds of rot dust that, in bad years, rise as damaged grapes pour down. So technique saved this year's vintage. But from the sodden ground the water entered the grapes and they were diluted. This can be corrected to some extent by chaptalisation (sugaring the must in the vats). Also widely practised was saignee - where the unfermented juice is drawn off from the skins and the proportion of skins to juice increased. As a result of the thick skins the colour is remarkably deep. However, all this does not make a great wine, and many of the generic Bordeaux Rouge growers and those petits chateaux which did not have the adequate technical resources to deal with such a difficult year will have made variable wine. The dry whites, picked before the rain, are excellent. However, for the second year running most of the sweet wines are a disaster. Outside France, there is unlikely to be any en primeur sale for the '93 clarets. In price it is improbable that they will be more expensive than the low-price '92s, although it is generally agreed to be a better vintage. The old game of matching the year with others has already begun. No less an expert than Jean Delmas, regisseur of Haut-Brion, has suggested that it may turn out like the good, but tannic '88. Others say better than '87. The '92s will be available in bottle next year and, together with the '93s, should in four or five years time, provide agreeable and relatively inexpensive early drinking, even at classed-growth level. Opinions are divided in Bordeaux as to whether the '92s are superior to the '91s. In the Pessac-Leognan Graves there is a slight preference for the '92s, in the Medoc it is the other way round. In St Emilion and Pomerol, where the frost struck rather worse, little '91 was made and none at all under the chateaux label at Cheval-Blanc, Figeac, Petrus and other leading Pomerol estates. Not the least pleasure in claret drinking, are the opportunities afforded for amiable disagreement about the relative superiority of one or other of adjoining vintages. Today there are '89 and '90 to be argued about, and '85 and '86. Out there senior Bordelais are still disagreeing about the '28s and the '29s.</p>

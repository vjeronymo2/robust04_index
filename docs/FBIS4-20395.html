			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by You Caixiang (1429 1752 7449) and Li Qingyuan </F> (2621 1987 0337), of the Ministry of Domestic Trade's Unified  Planning Office; edited by Jiang Dongsheng (5592 2639 3932):  "A Projection of China's Consumer Goods Market for 1994"]    [Text] I. The Impact of China's Macroeconomic Climate  On Our 1994 Consumer Goods Market    The rapid growth of China's national economy and our  improved  macroeconomic climate in 1993 added to our overall national  might and stamina, laying a solid foundation for economic  development and market prosperity in 1994. We are here  presenting a detailed analysis of the impact of our  macroeconomic climate on our 1994 consumer goods market.  <H5>  1. Our Demand Climate </H5>   1. Investor demand. Investor demand has always played a  decisive role in China's economic development, with the years of  larger investment bringing faster economic growth rates. While  our rapid economic growth in the first half of 1993 was driven  largely by investment-adjusted growth, too rapid investment  growth with too much construction also causes many problems,  particularly a decline in investment efficiency. In light of  this, the state will base its actions in 1994 on maintaining an  appropriate growth of investment scale, by tightening its  regulation, control, and management of overall investment and  credit. Meanwhile, it will speed up investment reform and  strengthen investment restraint forces, so that investment  subjects can make their own decisions, be liable for their own  risks, and act less blindly. So in 1994, our investment demand  will grow slower than in 1993, with funding sources invariably  somewhat tighter than in 1993, arbitrary exceeding of investment  plans down sharply, and overall investment growth clearly lower  than in 1993. We project our 1994 investment growth at about 20  percent.    2. Consumer demand. Since the 1980s, China's consumer  demand has increased yearly, with steadily upgraded consumer  concepts and more stable, higher consumption quality. Our  overall consumption level is now in a transition stage from  "having enough food and clothing" to "being comparatively  well-off." In which case, will consumer demand decline in this  stage? And will our consumer goods markets "slump"?    First, we will briefly analyze the causes of our two  most-recent economic "overheatings" and market "slumps." At the  end of 1988, in order to control economic overheating and  inflation, the state took "brake-slamming" steps, such as  cutting back capital construction and tightening credit, as well  as ones, such as raising savings interest rates and adding a new  color-TV consumption tax, which lowered the average increase in  incomes from 1988's 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent by 1989 for  city dwellers, and from 1988's 17.8 percent to 10.4 percent by  1989 for rural residents. In addition, price increases  gradually receded, increasing the wait-and-see consumer mindset  of holding onto money, which resulted in a national market slump.    Our wave of market panic-buying in 1988 and our  exceptionally  brisk market sales in the first half of 1993 were caused mainly  by the above abnormal factors, resulting in consumer-mindset  anxiety. There were two particular points: 1) as investment and  currency put into circulation grew too quickly, causing waves of  price increases, residents were clearly affected by inflation;  2) interest rates were lower than price rises, with declining  exchange rates and negative growth in savings efficiency, so  that the awareness of coming inflation strengthened in advance.  This resulted in a large-scale phenomenon of purchasing and  advance consumption as a hedge against inflation.    It is thus obvious that both our economic "overheatings" and  market "slumps" were caused mainly by either too lax management  or too tight regulation and control of our macroeconomic climate  by the state, causing too much investment, price, interest rate,  and exchange rate volatility. But once effective steps were  taken to return these factors to normal, our consumer goods  market stabilized quickly.    Second, consumer confidence is up. The "Resolution on  Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist  Market-Economy System" passed by the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Congress set our basic direction of developing a  socialist market economy, sharply raising the enthusiasm of the  people throughout China to intensify reform and speed up  development, and enhancing consumer confidence at all levels.  An example of this was the bottoming out and pickup in rolled  steel futures trading in Suzhou in late November 1993, showing  that consumers had seen the coming good trend. Meanwhile, the  center has taken a series of regulation and control steps to  ease inflation and stabilize the RMB value and exchange rate,  which will promote stable market-economy development, stabilize  consumer confidence, and eliminate the phenomena of advance  purchasing or holding onto money with a wait-and-see approach.    China's overall consumption is now in a transition stage  from  "having enough food and clothing" to "being comparatively  well-off." In the world's developed countries, this stage was  one of consumption expansion, in which markets could not  "contract" sharply without special circumstances. So in 1994,  China's market-economy establishment will be even more full of  vitality, with consumption standards and quality developing to  higher levels.    Third, purchasing power is growing quickly. Beginning in  1993, the state raised the wages of employees in administrative  organs, for a projected annual increase of more than 28 billion  yuan, which will correspondingly drive up wages for employees in  enterprises and institutions. Meanwhile, 1994's tax-sharing  system and internal enterprise reforms will help to arouse  enterprise and individual initiative, correspondingly raising  employee and individual income. This, in addition, the normal  capital-increase factor, means that our employee incomes will  grow more in 1994. In the fall of 1993, we had a better  harvest, with farm and sideline industries growing very quickly,  purchasing-fund payments better than in previous years, and  peasant income rising steadily, which brought the beginnings of  a rural market pickup. In 1994, the state is going to sharply  raise purchasing prices for farm products, such as grain and  cotton, as well as improving fund-payments in one step, so that  peasant income will continue to grow steadily. In addition,  peasant income from business, such as township, construction,  and tertiary industries, will rise sharply. It is projected  that overall cash incomes will grow a record of more than 20  percent in 1994.    Fourth, we have a huge market-consumption potential. China's  major consumer-goods market is our rural market, which accounted  for 51.9 percent of our retail commodity sales in 1992. While  this rural-market ratio has been declining in recent years, its  consumer potential of 800 million peasants is enormous. For  instance, our rural household power-usage rate is very low  which, in addition to lower purchasing power, is due to the  following two factors: 1) water and power are in short supply  at high prices; 2) highway construction, communications and  transportation, and after-sales service are lagging. But as  peasant income rises and rural infrastructures are improved,  peasant consumer demand, including that for large durable  consumer goods, is bound to take a quantitative leap.    So our 1994 consumer-goods market demand will not "shrink,"  but rather will tend to grow.  <H5>  2. Our Supply Climate </H5>   1. Industrial production. Through some decades of  development, China has established a quite complete industrial  system, with a strong manufactured-goods production capability.  In recent years, our industrial production has continued to  advance at a higher rate. Meanwhile, through several years of  structural adjustment and market-oriented reform, enterprises  are more able to change track and retool, with a faster rate of  product renewal and exchange, and additional effective supply of  manufactured goods. An analytical ranking of the supply and  demand of over 530 manufactured goods in recent years shows that  the varieties in short supply are declining yearly, with their  ratio down from 1991's 6 percent to 4 percent by 1993, while  commodities in long supply or where supply and demand are  basically balanced are increasing steadily. Our markets  essentially no longer suffer from commodity shortages due to  production-capability problems, so that our market goods supply  is fully ensured.    2. Agricultural production. As our output of farm  products, such as grain, cotton, and edible oil, has been  fluctuating for two consecutive years, their 1994 production  and market condition remains not optimistic. This is due  mainly to: 1) The price scissors between industrial goods and  agricultural products have grown steadily in the last two years,  dampening peasant cultivation initiative. In addition, all sorts  of development zones and urban construction projects have been  crowding out cultivated land, so that our area sown to farm  products is in a declining trend. 2) Our 1994 yields of grain,  cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar are all down to varying  degrees, which will have a sharp impact on 1994 market supplies.  The center is paying great attention to this, having taken a  series of steps to expand agricultural production, and going to  sharply raise purchasing prices for staple farm products, which  will certainly increase peasant income. These steps will  arouse peasant initiative to a certain extent, promoting  agricultural-production growth. In short, while 1994 will  bring slighter tighter supplies of staple farm and sideline  products, with higher prices, it will not see large-scale  shortages.    3. Communications and transportation. In 1994, as no new  railway arteries are being put into operation, our transport  capacity will not be clearly higher, with communications and  transportation remaining a sharp "bottleneck," and our transport  shortage being about the same as 1993's at over 20 million tons,  continuing to limit our national economic development.    In summary, analyzed from areas such as our 1994  macroeconomic climate, our market supply and demand state, and  our consumer mindset, our 1995 [sic] consumer goods market will  grow steadily, with no recurrence of sharp slides or market  slumps.  <H5>  II. The Impact of Economic Reform on Our 1994 Consumer Goods </H5> Market    In 1994, the state is going to conduct significant tax,  banking, investment, and foreign trade reforms, which will be a  major step in speeding up the establishment of our new socialist  market economic system, and will be of key significance in  making our national macroeconomic regulation and control system  sounder, and in promoting sustained and steady national economic  growth. These significant reform steps will also have a positive  impact on our consumer goods market.    1. Tax-revenue system-reform. Our most important 1994  reform will be the implementation of a tax-sharing system, in  which our current local revenue package [lump-sum] system will  be changed to separate collection for each taxable item based on  clarifying central and local tax categories and administrative  jurisdiction, with the establishment of separate central and  local tax systems, to change the current steady drop in central  revenues and weakening macroeconomic regulation and control  capability, in order to ensure a steady increase in central  financial might.    This tax-sharing system will have positive impacts on  markets.    A. It will help to reduce fiscal deficits and ease  inflationary pressures. In recent years, the "separate revenue  systems" have caused a steady drop in central revenues, with the  central ratio of all national revenue down from 1981's 57  percent to 38 percent by 1992. These yearly growing central  fiscal deficits and annual revenue overdrafts from the central  bank have sharpened inflationary pressures. State-planned  priority construction projects are often not completed on  schedule due to limited financial might and funding shortages.  Statistics show that the fund-shortage rate for China's  priority construction projects is now about 30 percent, leaving  the construction of key domestic infrastructures lagging far  behind our national economic development needs, with sharper  "bottleneck" limitations, and blocked commodity circulation.  So the tax-sharing reform will gradually increase central  financial might, reducing deficits and easing inflationary  pressures.    B. It will help to weaken local protectionism, to speed up  commodity-circulation development and the formation of a  nationally uniform market. One of the defects of the separate  revenue systems is that they reinforce local protectionism.  Duplicate construction by all areas makes economic structures  too similar, and rampant local protectionism obstructs  commodity-circulation development. So tax sharing will  strengthen central regulation and control capability, while  weakening local protectionism, as well as strengthening local  concepts about the overall situation, while ensuring the  implementation of national industrial-development policy.    C. The imposition of a uniform tax rate will contribute to  equal competition among state, collective, and individual  commerce. As to state-owned commerce, the new tax system will  lower the overall tax rate for state-owned commercial  enterprises from the current rate and somewhat reduce aftertax  profit payments to the state, playing a positive role in  lightening the burden on state commerce, adding accumulation,  increasing sales, improving the state of unequal competition  with private and collective commerce, and gradually reversing  longstanding losses.    2. Financial-system reform. This reform's priorities will be  to ensure that the central bank exercises an independent  monetary policy, by strengthening its overall regulation and  control of the money supply, in order to maintain currency  stability; to separate policy banking from commercial banking,  in order to overcome the current financial chaos caused by  specialized banks being responsible for both functions; to  develop plural-equity nonbank financial institutions, credit  agencies, and all sorts of investment, insurance, and securities  companies, in order to gradually set up an open and orderly  money-market system. These financial reforms will contribute as  follows. A) They will help to stabilize the value of the  currency. Our overall money-supply damper will use the method  prevalent in developed Western countries of independent  central-bank regulation and control, which will help to change  our past state of repeated credit expansion due to the policy  factor, elminate the system factors that induce inflation,  stabilize our inflation rate at a lower level, and thus preserve  stability of consumer mindset over a longer term. B) They  will help the banking sector to clarify obligations, by  separating policy from business. The policy bank will aim at  breaking even or earning tiny profits, to exercise state policy  operations, while commercial banks will be liable for their own  profits, losses, and risks, to prevent unchecked credit  activities. C) They will contribute to the establishment of a  developed money market. Through valid forms such as financing  and borrowing, enterprises will expand their funding sources,  which will ease the longstanding fund shortages of circulation  enterprises, to enhance enterprise operating flexibility.    3. Investment-system reform. This will be mainly the  establishment of investment-restraint mechanisms for enterprise  corporations, so that investment subjects make their own  decisions and are liable for their own risks. This will help to  change the past situation of disregard for qualifications,  competition to start projects, and unchecked expansion of the  investment scale, to put enterprise investment scale and  structure on a scientific and feasible basis, as well as  ensuring that investment subjects and commercial banks are each  liable for their respective risks, in order to ensure investment  economic efficiency. As these investment-restraint forces are  gradually established, there will be no recurrence of the real  national investment scale exceeding plans to reach 350 billion  yuan as in 1993, with elimination of the vicious system-cycle of  investment impulse and expansion--leading to a sharp rise in  investment-product prices--causing consumption expansion and  price rises--resulting in retrenchment, to maintain stable  market development.    4. Foreign trade system-reform. This will involve mainly  putting the official exchange rate on track with the  market-conversion rate, expanding enterprise foreign-trade  operating authority, eliminating the method of foreign trade  enterprises turning over foreign exchange to the state either  with or without compensation, abolishing import licensing,  reducing quota restrictions, and gradually lowering tariffs.  These reform steps will contribute as follows: A) They will  help to further speed up our opening to the outside world,  expanding our foreign trade, and bringing into full play the  supplementation and regulation role of international and  domestic markets. B) They will help to promote the merging of  international and domestic markets, improving the current  isolation of domestic-trade enterprises from the international  market, helping to resolve the current conflict of manufactured  goods being in long supply with some products being  slow-selling, and helping domestic-trade enterprises to  understand international trends to reduce import costs, in order  to make domestic markets more prosperous and brisk.  Market-converted foreign exchance now accounts for 80 percent of  our foreign-exchange usage. As this has become the key means  of foreign-trade operation for domestic enterprises, the  merging of foreign exchange onto a single track will not have a  sharp impact on ordinary consumer goods prices. Rather, as  tariffs will be lower, it will help to lower imported-commodity  prices to promote consumption.  <H5>  III. A Consumer Goods Market Projection for 1994 </H5>   Based on this overall analysis of our 1994 macroeconomic  climate and our economic-system development, China's consumer  goods market will maintain a stable-growth trend, neither  "slumping" nor "overheating."    1. Commodity sales will remain overall stable. We project  1994 retail commodity sales of 1.6 trillion yuan, up 20 percent  from 1993 and, adjusted for inflation, up a real approximately 7  percent. This includes retail sales for consumer goods of  1.455 trillion yuan, up 21.5 percent, and for agricultural  capital goods of 145 billion yuan, up 10 percent. Our rural  markets will continue in a rebound trend, with some briskness in  the midst of general stability.    2. Prices will rise considerably. The rapid rise in prices  in 1993 will have a considerable lagging impact on 1994 prices.  Meanwhile, there will be more upward price adjustments in  1994, with more force, in addition to spontaneous price-rise  factors, so that we project that our 1994 retail commodity  prices will rise less [sic] than in 1993.    3. By commodity category: a) Food commodities. Overall sales  will be more stable. Staple farm products, such as grain,  cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar, will be in general short  supply, with prices up considerably. Sales will be  increasingly brisk for new foods that suit comtemporary  lifestyles, characterized by convenience, fast, nutritional,  and health foods. b) Clothing commodities. All clothing sales  will be brisk, mostly of medium grade, with sales of expensive  clothing growing steadily, but markets for cheap clothing  increasingly narrow. Sales will remain brisk for all sorts of  Western clothing, T-shirts, jackets, wool, and woolen textiles,  with better sales of new and distinctive styles.  Outer-clothing sales will be comparatively stable. Sales of  knitted cotton goods will gradually improve due to low prices,  practicality, and higher demand by low- and middle-income  consumers. c) Daily-use commodities. Sales will be stable but  slack at lower prices for expensive large durable consumer  goods, such as color TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines,  due to a high urban-household use rate, more production than  demand, lower import tariffs, and sharp market competition,  while air conditioner sales will be stable but rising, with  consumers choosing more brand-name household appliances. Sales  will be brisk for smaller household-appliance market goods, such  as humidifiers, electric heaters, water heaters, oil and smoke  intake fans, microwave ovens, and home computers. Sales will  continue to flourish for interior-decoration items due to  commercial-housing development. Cosmetics and detergents will  see quite brisk sales, with volume stable but rising.    4. Income levels will widen, with consumer pluralization  tending to grow clearer. In recent years, income levels have  been increasingly widening. Statistics show that there are now  over 2 million high-income families throughout China with  incomes of more than 100,000 yuan a year. This disparity is  predicted to grow somewhat in the short-term. Urban consumers  will continue to seek out brand-name, excellent, new, and  specialty commodities, with a prominence of one-step consumer  behavior, commodity consumption fields expanding, and no  recurrence of the phenomenon of rivalry to buy a few  commodities. Rural consumers will generally seek out mostly  cheap and practical goods, with their consumption ratio  continuing to rise for clothing and daily-use commodities, and  consumption levels and structures for families in developed  regions increasingly approaching those of urban residents.    5. Purchasing power diversification will continue to grow.  Spending in 1994 will continue to grow for noncommodity items,  such as housing, health care, insurance, education, tourism, and  recreation; the steady growth of stock and bond markets will  absorb a lot of money; banks' high-interest-rate policy will  make savings continue to rise steadily. The pluralization trend  in the consumer spending structure will grow more conspicuous.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: Figures for managed trade view outdated Sir, The arguments you make against the managed trade strategies proposed recently by Fred Bergsten and Marcus Noland of the Institute for International Economics ('Strong-arm tactics', June 25) are most convincing. Another weakness of those demands becomes obvious from the table you show in your article: as you mention, conditions in Japan change rapidly and - as even many proponents of managed trade would admit - most formal restrictions on entry to Japanese markets have been lifted in recent years. The arguments for managed trade presented by the Institute for International Economics are obviously based on outdated figures. For example, during the Bubble Keizai, ie after 1987, Japanese consumers developed strong preferences for foreign luxury goods. As a result, imports of passenger cars and other luxury goods to Japan rose dramatically. Thus, it does not make much sense to look at foreign companies' share of domestic sales in 1986 in search of 'reconcilable differences'. They might have vanished in between.

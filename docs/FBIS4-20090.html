			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Weary of recent political and economic  developments in this country, a majority of Turks have no  confidence in the government's "economic measures package" but  still believe democracy will continue without a military  takeover, a Turkish Daily News [TDN] poll conducted last week  has shown.    The TDN last week randomly polled a total of 2,455 Turks in  five provincial centers and two towns, questioning them on  popular confidence in the economic package announced by Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller on April 5.    Three questions were put. A majority of those polled said  they did not believe the economic measures would solve the  country's economic problems and said they have no confidence  that the state will participate in the "sacrifice" which the  government has asked the people to make.    A majority also said that despite these deficiencies, the  ailing economic situation would not lead to an interruption of  the democratic order by the military.    Asked whether the "package" would solve Turkey's problems,  63.42 percent of those questioned said "no," while only 34.46  percent replied positively. Those who did not believe the  package would be of any use numbered 1,557 against the 846  people who expressed confidence in it and 52 people, or 2.12  percent, refused to comment.    When asked whether they believed the state would make the  necessary sacrifice for the package to work, a majority of 71.28  percent, or a total of 1,750 people replied, "No." Only 638 of  those polled, 25.98 percent, said, "Yes," while 67 refused to  comment.    Of those polled, 102 (4.17 percent) refused to comment on  the  question: "If this package does not solve the problems, will  there be a military coup?" But the majority gave a clear "no"  (65.94 percent, representing 1,619 people). Only 734, or 29.89  percent, believe there will be a military takeover. In the  Turkish capital of Ankara, of the 1,055 people randomly polled  in several districts, including downtown Kizilay and Ulus, over  a period of two days, 65.9 percent of the citizens said they did  not believe the package would solve their problems and 70.9  percent said they did not believe the state would make any  sacrifices. While 56 percent said a failure of the measures  would not lead to a military coup, 35.8 percent said it would.  In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, of the 577 people polled,  48.8 percent said the new economic package would not solve  Turkey's problems, and a mere two percent more (50 percent) said  that it would. As in Ankara, a majority said there would not be  a coup--representing 79.8 percent of the polled.    Results in the Aegean port city of Izmir were similar among  the 418 randomly polled, with 74.4 percent saying the measures  would not work, 77 percent saying the state would not make  sacrifices and 71.5 percent saying there would not be a military  coup in the case of failure.    Of the people polled in the southern touristic resort city  of  Antalya and the western industrial city of Bursa, 69.5 percent  said they did not believe the measures were any solution to  Turkey's problems and 74.7 percent said they did not believe the  state would make any sacrifice--as it has promised to do. About  the likelihood of a military takeover, 62.1 percent said they  did not believe it likely.    In the resort towns of Bodrum and Marmaris, where the TDN  has  offices, 61.7 percent of those polled said the economic package  would not solve Turkey's problems, 68.5 percent said the state  would make no sacrifice and 64.5 percent said they did not  believe the military would intervene when the package failed.    Comments:    Those questioned in all of the cities where the TDN public  opinion poll was conducted expressed a deep lack of confidence  in the government's economic package mainly because they do not  trust the state will make its share of the sacrifice. Some of  those who refused to comment said they still did not know the  contents of the package, while the main criticism was directed  at government waste of its own resources.    In the main, the comments reflected a lack of trust in state  organizations and administrations, with criticism such as:  "They always promise, but never do what they say," and "First  they should make sacrifices and then ask the people to do the  same."    One widely heard view from those who believe that a military  coup can take place in Turkey was based not on a possible  economic failure but on the possibility of the pro-Islamic  Welfare Party coming to power. A majority of those who fear a  coup may take place commented that this would happen only if the  RP came to power or there were attempts at establishing Shariat  rule in Turkey.    Some of the comments on the possibility of a coup by those  polled were as follows:    "If Shariat comes there will be a coup."    "There can never be another coup in Turkey."    "If a coup is staged this will thrust us back by ten years."  "There will be a popular revolt, not a coup, if the package  fails."    Among those polled, there was also a feeling in favour of  "making a change", and some responded by saying that all  establishment parties had been tried and it was now time to try  the Islamic experience.    The TDN poll also revealed, once again, that when questioned  on military coups and the armed forces, a considerable number of  Turks are still reluctant to comment.</p>

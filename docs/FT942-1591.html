			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft HQ for sale Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German metals, mining and industrial group, has entered negotiations to sell its headquarters site in the centre of Frankfurt. The site could have a market value of DM750m (Dollars 469m), Metallgesellschaft said, but cautioned that not all the proceeds would flow to the company as the land is jointly owned with a company controlled by Dresdner Bank. The group said it had entered into negotiations to sell the land as it made no business sense to have administrative offices, a car park and research laboratories on such a valuable site. The move follows the sale last week of its 80 per cent stake in its Buderus engineering subsidiary which raised DM1.2bn. The disposal of the Buderus stake, together with the planned sale of the land and of other subsidiaries, come against the background of continuing business problems at MG Corp, the New York-based trading subsidiary of the German group whose speculative trading in oil derivatives brought Metallgesellschaft to the brink of collapse in January. MG Corp was still a 'machine for losing money,' Metallgesellschaft's chairman Mr Kajo Neukirchen warned yesterday.</p>

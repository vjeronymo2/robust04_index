			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FINALLY: The centerpiece of Weird Al Yankovic's new movie "UHF" is a spot-on  parody of Dire Straits' 1985 hit "Money for Nothing." The sequence is an  uncanny re-creation of the computer-animated look of the prize-winning video,  but the really amazing thing is how the guitarist nailed Mark Knopfler's guitar  part so perfectly.  </P> <P> Actually, it was pretty easy, since Knopfler played the part himself. It's the  first time that one of Yankovic's parody subjects has participated in the  spoof.  </P> <P> The song and five others from the movie are featured on Yankovic's new album,  "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack &amp; Other Stuff." Our favorite: "Spam,"  an ode to the canned meat set to the tune of R.E.M.'s "Stand."  </P></p>

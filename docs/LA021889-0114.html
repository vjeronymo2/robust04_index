			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPONENTS CRITICIZE ASSEMBLYMAN BANE OVER S&amp;L BILL  </P> <P> Shortly after accepting $18,000 in campaign contributions from two financial  institutions early last year, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) introduced  legislation that opponents said would have aided the two firms in a pending  multimillion-dollar lawsuit.  </P> <P> The measure, introduced by Bane last February, prohibited litigants in civil  lawsuits from obtaining confidential information from the state Savings and  Loan Department through a subpoena. The bill, supported by the California  League of Savings Institutions, passed the Assembly with no opposition last  year but died in the Senate.  </P> <P> An Assembly consultant and the bill's opponents say the measure could have been  retroactive, thereby affecting the pending lawsuit. The defendants in the case  were financial institutions that who were seeking to prevent documents obtained  from the Savings and Loan Department with a subpoena from being introduced as  evidence against them. Both were major contributors to Bane. Representatives of  the two financial institutions could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Bane did not return phone calls Friday. The Daily News of Los Angeles reported  that he said he did nothing improper, quoting Bane as saying that he intended  to prevent disclosure of all confidential Savings and Loan Department records  without a court order, including those involved in the pending legal case.  </P> <P> Bane, chairman of the influential Rules Committee and a champion of the savings  and loan industry, reportedly said: "I would have introduced the bills if there  were no contributions. Anything wrongly obtained should be returned."  </P> <P> The Savings and Loan Department said that the measure would merely clarify  existing law, said Kenneth Cooley, chief counsel of the Assembly Finance and  Insurance Committee, which unanimously sent the bill to the full Assembly with  little discussion. He said such a clarification could have been considered  retroactive, although Assembly committee members were not informed that it  might apply to an ongoing lawsuit.  </P> <P> The bill could have affected pending litigation involving American Savings  &amp; Loan of Stockton, which has since been sold and divided into two  financial institutions, and Gramercy Mortgage, a Burlingame-based affiliate of  Homestead Savings.  </P> <P> Both companies were named in a December, 1982, lawsuit filed by Dividend  Development Corp. of Santa Clara. Dividend attorney Peter Fortune said Friday  that the suit alleges American and Gramercy improperly foreclosed on two large  real estate projects in the Bay Area and is seeking $40 million in damages. He  said the suit accuses Homestead of fraudulent misrepresentation and  concealment, breach of contract and unfair business practices. Homestead filed  a countersuit against Dividend; the litigation is pending.  </P> <P> Dividend Development used a subpoena in 1985 to obtain confidential Savings and  LoanDepartment documents about the foreclosure that "severely impeach  Homestead's defenses and claims in the litigation," Fortune said. Homestead  claimed that the documents were released illegally and had sought  unsuccessfully in court to suppress the information.  </P> <P> Bane received a $6,000 campaign contribution from Gramercy on Jan. 11, 1988,  and another $6,000 on Feb. 1. On Jan. 25, 1988, he received a $6,000 campaign  contribution from American Savings &amp; Loan. Each firm also gave him $5,000  in early 1987. The contributions coincide with the timing of Bane's annual  Valentine's Day dinner, his major annual fund-raiser. He introduced the savings  and loan bill on Feb. 17, 1988.  </P> <P> After the bill passed the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee last June,  Dividend Development hired a lobbyist who subsequently informed Banking  Committee Chairwoman Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba) that the measure could affect  the company's pending lawsuit. Vuich then retrieved the bill for a second look  by her committee in August.  </P> <P> "We don't like to pass out legislation that affects a court case," she said  Friday. An aide to Bane added that it died when Bane failed to ask for it to be  heard again.  </P> <P> State law makes it illegal to accept contributions in return for a specific  action, such as sponsoring or supporting a bill. Bane has maintained that the  savings and loan industry backs him because he supports their role in financing  home construction and creating jobs.  </P> <P> Bane, who ran a national savings and loan association for a decade, received a  total of $102,480 in campaign contributions from the industry in 1987-88,  nearly 10% of the $1.1 million he raised, according to his campaign reports.  </P> <P> Miller reported from Los Angeles and Gladstone from Sacramento.  </P></p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors win vote on deal CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have been given a final chance to vote on the once-and-for-all compensation plan worked out by the bank's liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. The result will delay the Abu Dhabi package, but the bank's liquidators, led by Mr Brian Smouha of Touche Ross, were unable to say last night whether the delay threatened the survival of the compensation plan. If the package is not threatened, the liquidators will almost certainly be forced to renegotiate it. A Luxembourg judge yesterday told the liquidators that she would not deliver a final judgment on the compensation package until the unsecured creditors had been allowed to express a firm 'yes' or 'no' to it. The judge, Mrs Maryse Welter, ordered liquidators to complete their consultation with the creditors by October 1. A further hearing will be held in Luxembourg on October 7 to discuss the results of any poll. The judge offered no immediate explanation of her decision, which was consistent with the suggestions of the Grand Duchy's state prosecutor in his summing-up this month. Earlier this year Touche Ross and Abu Dhabi said that, for the compensation deal to take effect, it needed the support of creditors by the end of November. With the Luxembourg ruling not due until early October, it seemed inevitable yesterday that that deadline would not be met. The compensation plan requires formal approval from the court in Luxembourg, where BCCI had its brass-plate headquarters. The package, which would involve a payment to creditors of between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.7bn, has already been approved by courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands. On Friday a group of creditors failed in their appeal against the British court decision. The judge's ruling will keep alive the hopes of many small creditors who are dissatisfied with the deal struck by the liquidators. Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on BCCI, said: 'It's a brilliant decision and the first court decision which will please creditors and former depositors in Britain.'</p>

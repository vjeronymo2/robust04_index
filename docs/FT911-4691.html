			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: GTE hit by charge of Dollars 245m GTE, which operates the largest non-Bell telephone system in the US, yesterday revealed a sharp fall in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 200m, compared with Dollars 407m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per cent share slipped from 46 cents to 22 cents. However, the market was already aware GTE would take a one-time charge, resulting from its merger with Contel, and had expected the bottom-line reduction. GTE said that, exclusive of the Dollars 245m one-off charge and a compensatory gain on the transfer of minority interests in certain cellular properties, net income worked out at Dollars 404m, or 45 cents a share. This, it said, represented a 7 per cent advance on the first quarter of 1990  -once the previous year's results were also adjusted to include a full period of operations for the cellular properties bought last year. Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 5.22bn, with Dollars 3.79bn coming from the telephone operations. GTE said the reduction in revenues from its telephone operations reflected the weakening economy. Operating income in this division improved by 7 per cent to Dollars 964m, largely due to cost control and a reorganisation of operations.</p>

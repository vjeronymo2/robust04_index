			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Inco digs deep to squeeze costs  -The nickel producer is celebrating rising prices What a difference a year has made at Inco. Twelve months ago, the western world's biggest nickel producer was trimming its sails to cope with what looked like an unremitting market slump. Inco produced 15,000 tonnes, or about 8 per cent, less nickel last year than in 1992. As the nickel price dipped to a low of USDollars 1.80 a lb in September 1993, it cut output by another 18,000 tonnes and pared capital spending to the bone. Some feared the Toronto-based company, which supplies about a third of western nickel output, might buckle under its Dollars 1.1bn debt burden. The mood was just the opposite at Inco's board meeting in the last week of October. The three-month nickel price had climbed to more than Dollars 3 a lb, hitting a peak of Dollars 3.45 last week. The directors were sufficiently confident of the outlook to approve a clutch of new projects at its Ontario and Manitoba mines. They include the Dollars 158m development of the McCreedy East deposit, near Sudbury, Ontario, which is expected to produce 22.5m lbs of nickel (equal to about 6 per cent of 1993 output) and 77.5m lbs of copper a year by 1999. In addition Inco has just given the go-ahead for a drilling programme at what is believed to be a rich orebody, known as Pipe Deep, in Manitoba. It is also pressing ahead with development of another high-grade orebody, known as Victor, near its existing operations at Sudbury. Plans have been unveiled to install a Dollars 13.6m ore-handling system as a prelude to deepening the Creighton mine at Sudbury. 'It's our intention to get every pound of nickel possible out of the ground,' an Inco official says. Another 'good news' announcement, on which the company declines to elaborate at this stage, is scheduled for early next week. The turnround has begun to show in Inco's earnings. Primary metal operations have swung from a Dollars 19m loss in the third quarter of 1993 to a Dollars 39m profit this year, in spite of an accident at a Manitoba mine which cut third-quarter output by 3,600 tonnes. The median forecast of a group of 13 North American analysts suggests that Inco will recover from a loss of about 40 cents a share this year to earnings of Dollars 1.50 a share in 1995. Those looking further ahead bravely predict earnings will climb to about Dollars 2.25 in 1996. Mr Peter Marcus, analyst at PaineWebber in New York, is increasingly confident that his 'good case' scenario of an average 1995 nickel price of Dollars 5 a lb will be realised. Much of the renewed optimism rests on unexpectedly buoyant demand from stainless steel makers, who make up about 60 per cent of western nickel consumption. Inco has raised its forecast of 1994 stainless steel production by 5 per cent to 12.6m tonnes. As a result, its estimate of nickel demand has climbed by 18,000 tonnes to 711,000 tonnes. Inco predicts a similar rise in western supplies during 1995, reflecting the return of mothballed mines to the market, and new capacity in western Australia and Indonesia. This would bring the market roughly into balance. Mr Fraser Phillips, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, predicts that while a price correction could occur over the next six months, inventories should start dropping in late 1995 and prices should then improve sharply. This optimistic view of nickel's prospects hinges on stagnant, or falling, Russian exports. Uncontrolled shipments from Russia and eastern Europe have been one of the most disruptive forces in the nickel market in recent years. Ms Stephanie Anderson, Inco director of market research, said in a recent paper that Russian deliveries to the west would be 'the swing factor that dictates the direction nickel prices take in the future'. Supplies from former communist countries are expected to be about 126,000 tonnes this year, or 18 per cent of worldwide nickel supplies. According to Ms Anderson, Norilsk, the main Russian producer, cannot sustain its output without investment and regular maintenance to mine and plant equipment. 'Based on a lack of capital spending alone, not to mention the social and political problems, production at Norilsk could well fall,' she said. But she also acknowledged that 'it is almost impossible to quantify what is really happening to (the Russian) industry'. No matter what happens, Inco hopes to benefit from its drive over the past three years to cut costs, especially at its Canadian operations. According to Mr Marcus, break-even costs may be down to Dollars 2.25 a lb within the next few years. Unit costs in the early 1990s were around Dollars 2.45 a lb. The nickel market has become increasingly volatile as banks and investment funds have emerged as important forces. The daily open interest on the London Metal Exchange - that is, the number of contracts which have not been closed off by metal deliveries - has soared from 48,000 tonnes in 1990 to around 340,000 tonnes. Trading volumes have surged fivefold to 70,000 tonnes a day. Mr Marcus at PaineWebber estimates Inco's earnings a share rise or fall by Dollars 2 for each Dollars 1 movement in nickel prices. For the time being, volatile markets are working to the advantage of producers. But Inco's ability to weather future downturns is likely to hang on its success in maintaining the costs squeeze, even as it celebrates rising metal prices.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (6): A severe squeeze on incomes - The rural economy ON paper, Derbyshire has a smaller agricultural sector than many other parts of Britain generally thought of as rural. Only 1 per cent of the workforce is engaged in agriculture, compared with a national average of 2 per cent and a higher level for some counties such as Devon and Cheshire. However, agriculture is only part of the countryside's activities these days and Derbyshire has a large rural economy with some 38,000 people working and living in the Peak National Park alone. Farming in Derbyshire is mixed. There is hill farming of livestock in the north of the county while in the Peak district, where the upland soils are acidic, there is dairy farming. A small horticultural sector flourishes in the south of the county on loamy soils and in the east there is some arable farming on the clay soils. Roughly 70 per cent of the farming is grass-based. There are about 4,000 farms in Derbyshire. The average size is 50 hectares but sizes range from the vast sporting estates to smallholdings in the hills. Typically, a hill farmer in the north of the county would supplement his income by either working in the coal mines himself or have male members of his family work in the mines. In the past, lead mining in the Peak District served as an additional occupation for farmers. Farm incomes depend on a number of factors such as the level of debt, the kind of farming involved, the efficiency with which the farm is run. What is common to all farms, however, is the severe squeeze on net incomes seen since the mid-eighties, as the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community have reduced subsidies and cut prices. Mr Brian Angel of Adas, the advisory service of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), reckons that the trend of net farm incomes in Derbyshire would broadly be in line with national figures which indicate a steady fall of about 50 per cent between 1981 and 1991. He says: 'What has happened is there has been continuous upward pressures on inputs as prices have levelled off or stabilised. Farmers do everything to keep costs down. For fixed costs they have machinery rings where they share machinery. Variable costs are kept down by shedding labour'. With such a squeeze on incomes there is a great emphasis on trying to diversify the agricultural economy into the broader rural economy. A whole raft of government schemes and measures are available for diversification and for conversion. Part of the Peak District, the High Peak, has been designated an economically sensitive area (Esa); one of 19 such areas in the UK. Participation in the Esa scheme is voluntary. Farmers who join sign a legally-binding, five-year management agreement with MAFF and comply with a set of management prescriptions in return for an annual payment. For farms not within an Esa, there are various other schemes including the 'set-aside' where farmers are paid to leave land fallow for certain periods; and the farm woodland project. For Derbyshire, however, the two most relevant and widely-applied programmes are the farm diversification grant scheme and the Rural Development Commission's grant scheme. Parts of Derbyshire are designated rural development areas. The Rural Development Commission can provide grants for the refurbishment of redundant buildings to bring them back into productive business use. The grant can also be used for the upgrading of mains services (electricity, gas, water etc) in premises already in productive use, provided that the work will enable the business to survive or expand. The rate of grant is 25 per cent of the eligible costs of conversion or refurbishment subject to a minimum grant of Pounds 250 and a normal grant maximum of Pounds 12,500. Grants are also available under the farm diversification grant scheme. This is run by Adas and offers a package of assistance to farmers thinking of diversifying into non-agricultural profit-making activities on their farm. Various kinds of advice on drawing up projects and marketing products are on offer. Mr Angel says he has seen no precise figures for the number of farms which have attempted diversification, but at a rough guess he would think it was about 2,000 farms. Schemes include not just conversions to take in tourists or create farmhouse holidays but also projects such as farm shops, riding schools, trekking centres and various craft workshops. Mr Angel stresses that the emphasis is as much on conservation as on diversification. He says: 'It becomes increasingly difficult to conceptualise the farm economy as something separate from the wider rural economy.' Many of schemes are geared to keeping people on the land and employed in the rural sector as far as possible. What many schemes try and avoid is giving grants for barns to be converted into second homes for rich city dwellings or first homes for commuters into Derby and Nottingham. Derbyshire, as elsewhere, has witnessed the phenomenon of sons and daughters of farmers and agricultural workers being unable to afford properties in the villages where they grew up because of pressure from outsiders. The recession has eased the problem, but it is one which those concerned with the rural economy in Derbyshire do not want to recur.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS WIN GOVERNORSHIPS IN FLORIDA, TEXAS; 7 STATES UNDECIDED;  </P> <P> STATEHOUSES: AT LEAST THREE INCUMBENTS ARE OUSTED. NO SINGLE ISSUE DOMINATED  THE RACES.  </P> <P> Democrats Tuesday strengthened their hand heading into next year's  congressional reapportionment, wresting control of governorships in rapidly  growing Florida and Texas from the GOP.  </P> <P> But both parties continued to sweat out results from seven gubernatorial races,  including Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and the richest prize on the ballot:  the tight California governor's race between Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and  former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> Those states will determine whether Democrats expand their current 29-21 margin  in governorships.  </P> <P> On a night with little turnover in Congress, the battle in the statehouses  proved far more turbulent, with at least three incumbents being ousted and  seven open seats changing party control.  </P> <P> Democrats had the most to cheer about, marking gains in all parts of the  country.  </P> <P> In Florida, former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles crushed GOP Gov. Bob Martinez,  leading 1,829,444 to 1,420,418, or 56% to 44%, with 94% of the vote counted.  </P> <P> In Texas, Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards roared past Republican  Clayton W. Williams Jr., leading 1,804,091 to 1,690,692, or 52% to 48%, with  94% of the vote counted.  </P> <P> In Kansas, Democratic state Treasurer Joan Finney ousted Republican Gov. Mike  Hayden, who was weakened by an unpopular hike in property taxes. With 96% of  the vote in, Finney led 370,895 to 321,431, or 54% to 46%.  </P> <P> In Oklahoma, where Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon is stepping down, Democrat  David Walters overwhelmed GOP candidate Bill Price 504,867 to 283,403, or 64%  to 36%, with 97% of the vote counted.  </P> <P> In Rhode Island, the third time proved a charm for Democratic businessman Bruce  G. Sundlun who defeated Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, after losing in both  1986 and 1988. Sundlun won decisively, capturing 254,391 votes to DiPrete's  87,573 with 99% of the vote in. In New Mexico, former Democratic Gov. Bruce  King captured the seat being vacated by Republican Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers.  With 92% of the vote in, King defeated Republican Frank Bond 204,318 to  169,788, or 55% to 45%.  </P> <P> For Republicans, the best early news came from Ohio, where former Cleveland  Mayor George V. Voinovich defeated Democratic Atty. Gen. Anthony J. Celebrezze  Jr., by 1,874,792 to 1,489,700, or 56%to 44%, with 98% of the vote in.  </P> <P> In Massachusetts, former U.S. Atty. William F. Weld defeated Democrat John R.  Silber. Weld led 830,608 to 809,438 with 77% of the vote in.  </P> <P> Former Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., running as an independent, won  election in Connecticut, attracting 455,381 votes, or 40%, to 423,034, or 38%,  for Republican Rep. John G. Rowland, and 232,048, or 21% for Democratic Rep.  Bruce A. Morrison, with 99% of the vote in.  </P> <P> With control of redistricting at stake, both parties devoted unusually heavy  attention to governor's races this year. With results in California and Arizona  unclear, Democrats enter the decennial redistricting controlling the  governorships in at least five of the seven states expected to gain seats; with  Illinois and Michigan still too close to call, Democrats now hold the  governorship in six of the 13 states slated to lose seats.  </P> <P> Overall, 36 governor's seats were contested Tuesday -- 20 of them currently  held by Democrats, 16 by Republicans. These included some of the year's most  closely watched campaigns. In particular, the battles for control of Florida,  Texas and California -- the three states expected to gain the most new  congressional seats in next year's reapportionment -- drew enormous national  focus and set spending records.  </P> <P> For Republicans, the Florida race became a long-shot as soon as Chiles entered  the contest earlier this year. After a bruising primary victory over Rep. Bill  Nelson, Chiles virtually coasted to victory over Martinez, who had suffered  through a rocky first term.  </P> <P> The Texas gubernatorial campaign was as chaotic as the Florida race placid.  Spending millions of dollars of his own money, Williams held a double-digit  lead through most of the fall. But a series of gaffes in early October  undermined his support. CNN exit polls showed an enormous gender gap in the  race, with men favoring Williams by 10 points, but women giving Richards an  insurmountable 61-39 margin.  </P> <P> Verbal fireworks also dominated the gubernatorial race in Massachusetts, where  tart-tongued Democrat Silber outraged liberals with a series of acerbic remarks  dubbed "Silber shockers." Exit polls showed Weld winning half the vote of  self-described liberals, and nearly 40% of Democrats.  </P> <P> In the other large industrial states, Democratic Govs. Mario M. Cuomo of New  York and Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania won reelection, though Cuomo's margin  of 53% represented a substantial drop from his record-setting 65% tally four  years ago. But Michigan Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard struggled against  Republican John Engler in early returns. And Republicans were in a strong  position to hold Illinois; with 72% of the vote in, Secretary of State Jim  Edgar led Democratic Atty. Gen. Neil F. Hartigan 1,156,267 to 1,094,606.  </P> <P> No single issue dominated the governors' races. Abortion appeared to have  somewhat less of an impact than originally expected.  </P> <P> In 20 states, voters chose between candidates who differed on the abortion  issue. But those seats split between candidates who favored and opposed  abortion rights. Democrats Chiles and Richards, both supporters of abortion  rights, defeated Republicans who opposed abortion in Florida and Texas. But in  Kansas and Ohio anti-abortion candidates swept to victory.  </P> <P> Perceptions of the local economy seemed to be more decisive. In 10 states where  control of governorships changed party, 72% of those surveyed by CNN rated the  local economy weak. But only 40% were so pessimistic in the 18 states where the  same party has already kept control of the Statehouse.  </P> <P> Both parties were also keeping a close eye on state legislative races in the  major states expected to gain or lose seats in next year's reapportionment.  Currently, Democrats control 69 state legislative chambers, and Republicans --  who have been frustrated in attempts to translate their national success into  local gains over the past decade -- just 29, six fewer than in 1980.  </P></p>

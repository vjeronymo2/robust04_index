			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $7.6 billion of new three-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.80%, up from 7.65% last week. Another  $7.6 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of  7.77%, also up from 7.65% last week. The new discount rates understate the  actual return to investors -- 8.07% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill  selling for $9,802.80 and 8.20% for a six-month bill selling for $9,607.20.  </P></p>

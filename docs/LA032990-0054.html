			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VANDALS HIT SCHOOL FOR 4TH WEEKEND  </P> <P> Vandals have struck Hazeltine Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys on four  consecutive weekends, causing police to increase patrols at the school and to  ask neighbors and parents to watch for unusual activity at the site.  </P> <P> About $3,500 worth of property, which included videocassette recorders, speaker  systems and computers has been stolen in the series of break-ins, school  officials said.  </P> <P> In addition, about $850 in damage was done to the school buildings, school  police said.  </P> <P> Hazeltine Principal Nathan Glickman said four suspects in the latest vandalism,  which occurred last weekend, have been identified. But Glickman and school  police said they are unsure whether those suspects, who have not been arrested,  were responsible for the series of incidents. The suspects are young adults,  Glickman said.  </P> <P> "It happens so frequently," Glickman said of the recent incidents. "They simply  destroy the interior of the room, spray-painting it, throwing out the desks or  tearing open files. They discharge fire extinguishers in the room. It's  complete vandalism," he said.  </P> <P> Richard Page, assistant chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District  police, said that security officials are "increasing coverage of patrol stops"  near the school in response to the vandalism.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 16 June -- Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman  has left for Simferopol. Mr. Moroz told UNIAN that the main  purpose of his visit was to meet Crimean Supreme Council  deputies. "The Crimean authorities' alienation from the center  does not contribute to the settlement of Crimean problems," said  the Supreme Council chairman. Considering the frequent bias in  some of the media coverage of the Crimean issues as well as  third party political manipulations "by Russia," Oleksandr Moroz  plans personal meetings with Crimea's residents and labor  collectives in person. There will be no time for a meeting with  the Black Sea Fleet command, although the Ukrainian Supreme  Council chairman said he was willing to hold one.</p>

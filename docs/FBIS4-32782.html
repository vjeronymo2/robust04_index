			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- U.S. activists will  participate in a demonstration in front of the White House and  the Congress in Washington to support an anti-blockade bill  proposed by Representative Charles Rangel, PRENSA LATINA learned  today.    The demonstration, which will include more than 4,000  people,  will be staged on 9 June, Raymundo del Toro, of the  Cuban-American Peace Committee, reported by telephone from New  Jersey.    Del Toro told this agency that they expect the participation  of clergymen, friends of Cuba, and Cubans residing in this  country, who will also send letters to the Capitol and call the  White House to demand an end to the economic measures.    The participants, he added, will pay for their own  transportation to Washington to support Rangel's bill, which has  been debated in several committees of the House of  Representatives since 17 March as a free trade initiative.    The fate of Rangel's initiative, which is supported by more  than 30 congressmen, is expected to be known by 9 June, Del Toro  pointed out.    The demonstration, he said, is promoted by various  organizations such as the Cuban Information Project, the  so-called International Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz para  Cuba], the Pastors for Peace Motorcade, the House of the  Americas, and the Cuban American Committee of Washington, among  others.    In the United States there are currently more than 62  organizations affiliated with a national network of solidarity  with Cuba, which has organized several actions to oppose the  blockade that has cost the island $40 billion since 1962.    The growing movement of solidarity with Cuba has resulted in  three motorcades carrying humanitarian aid, construction  brigades, and actions to defy a ban on travel to Cuba by U.S.  citizens, among other activities.</p>

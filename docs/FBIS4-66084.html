			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/MAR/RHR: "Delcroix Does Not Rule Out </F> Automatic NATO-Russia Consultations"]    [Text] Brussels, 25 May (BELGA) -- Speaking on Wednesday  [25 May], Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix did not rule out  the establishment of automatic consultations between NATO and  Russia. He told the BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and  Television]: "I am not `a priori' opposed to such consultations."    According to the Belgian minister, setting up such a  consultation process would not be tantamount to giving Russia  the right to veto NATO decisions. Futhermore, he added that  these consultations could be very useful, as in the case of  Bosnia, for example.    Mr. Delcroix termed "positive" the comments of Russian  General Pavel Grachev, who participated in the meetings with  NATO defense ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday. Delcroix said:  "A degree of confusion has reigned in Moscow in recent weeks  concerning Russia's membership of the `Partnership for Peace  (PFP),' a program of increased cooperation between NATO and the  other European countries, essentially those in the East."    As we recall, General Grachev stated on Tuesday evening that  Russia would join the PFP unconditionally, but then on Wednesday  morning requested the establishment of a permanent mechanism for  consultation between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance.    Mr. Delcroix also stated that it was logical for another  channel to be opened between NATO and Moscow, although, he  added, "that does not mean they will have any guarantees."    According to the minister, it is necessary for Russia to  first join the PFP: "We must take account of the 18 countries  who have already joined the PFP before we can talk of forging  closer links with Moscow." He believes that Russia could sign  in June.    Mr. Delcroix added that he did not approve of Russia's  proposal to give the CSCE priority over NATO. He stressed that  the CSCE is too large a forum (BELGA editor's note: comprising  52 countries from Europe, North America and Central Asia) to be  truly functional.</p>

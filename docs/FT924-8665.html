			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: On a wing and a prayer It's taken more than a year, but Hollis Harris has at last had his prayers answered. In August 1991, Harris, then president of Continental Airlines, urged employees of the bankrupt US carrier to join him in praying three times a day 'that God will show us a way to survive'. The very next day Continental dispensed with his services. But the Methodist minister's son from the Georgia Bible belt has bounced back. He resurfaced earlier this year in Montreal as chief executive of Air Canada; and one of his early moves was to submit an offer - together with a group of Texan investors - for his former employer. Now Continental has decided to accept the Air Canada-led bid in the hope that the infusion of new capital would enable it to emerge from Chapter 11 early next year. For its part, Air Canada hopes the deal will make it a more attractive partner for international alliances. Harris could do with another burst of divine intervention, however. Air Canada itself is still bleeding about a million dollars of red ink a day and has debts of over Dollars 3bn. Whether or not these problems can be overcome, it won't be for lack of prayer in the executive suite. Air Canada's chairman, Claude Taylor, is a devout Baptist.</p>

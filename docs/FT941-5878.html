			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Feuds doused by Red Adair MP: Sir Terence Higgins must be feeling hard-pressed Sir Terence Higgins must be feeling a bit like a hard-pressed heathland fire-fighter. Whenever a flare-up has threatened in the Commons committee system as a result of Labour's campaign of procedural non-co-operation with the government, the veteran Tory MP has hosed it down in his capacity as chairman of the liaison committee - the committee of heads of all the select committees. But with no sign so far of a change of heart by Labour, Sir Terence has yet to be blessed with the break that would permit him to stand easy. His skills may soon be called upon again to quell a row over a planned foreign affairs committee trip to Brussels. It is the consequences for the system that have provoked the most bad blood in Labour's procedural battle. Tory MPs have bridled at being deprived of expenses-paid trips to South Africa and Belize. Meanwhile serious students of constitutional matters, including Sir Terence, cannot see why the main opposition party should wish to hamper the functioning of parliament's most powerful tool for scrutinising the executive. They believe Labour is cutting off its nose to spite its face by refusing to let its MPs 'pair' - agreeing with a Tory counterpart to miss non-crucial votes - at least in the effects of this on the committees. An indication that Labour sees some merit in this argument came when it agreed to allow one of its MPs to visit Bosnia next week, as part of an expedition by the defence committee. The shadow cabinet agreed on Wednesday night that this was a special case. But the party has made clear both that the ban on 'pairing' stays and that the leadership is determined to pursue its non-co-operation policy. Opposition business managers argue that there is nothing to stop MPs going ahead with pre-arranged foreign visits without their Labour colleagues. Some Labour whips have even been known, in unguarded moments, to question the value of most overseas visits - a view with which many taxpayers might sympathise. Seven Labour leftwingers yesterday tabled a Commons motion expressing 'appreciation' for the saving of over Pounds 100,000 on fact-finding tours by committees 'because of non-co-operation preventing such excursions'. Sir Terence's flame-dousing skills worked again this week when Conservative members of the trade and industry committee in effect withdrew their threat to unseat Mr Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman. This was after the committee agreed a report to parliament criticising Labour for blocking the body's planned visit to South Africa. 'Due to the intervention of the opposition the committee was not able to make the visit at the time intended,' the report said. 'Political disagreements elsewhere in the House related to the conduct of legislation should not be allowed to impede scrutiny of the executive by select committees.' Labour could have retaliated to the threat against Mr Caborn by paralysing the entire committee system. The trade and industry committee is also calling for a full review by backbench MPs of the committees. This would examine - among other subjects - whether there should be an automatic right for committee recommendations to be put to a Commons vote. Some committee members are understood to believe this review should contain an international dimension, comparing the British system with the functioning of congressional bodies in the US. If the review goes ahead, some good may come out of the wrangling. In the meantime, Sir Terence will no doubt be turning his mind to stopping sparks flying over the planned Brussels trip.</p>

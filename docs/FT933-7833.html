			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: New opera, 'Anna'/ 'Tourist Variations' - The Edinburgh Festival Noble intentions, dire results. To keep opera alive there is a continual need for new works and in the last few years both the Royal Opera and English National Opera have set up studios, where composers can watch their operatic young struggling to take their first painful steps. With noble commitment the Edinburgh Festival has now undertaken at least a single exercise of a similar kind, acting jointly as midwife with the Traverse Theatre. On Tuesday they presented two operatic premieres. The Traverse ambitiously chose two of Scotland's leading young composers and two equivalent dramatists to produce a pair of small-scale operas. Noble aims indeed - but the offspring should have been smothered at birth. Marginally the better of the two was Anna, words by John Clifford, music by Craig Armstrong. A woman is dissatisfied with her life. Unabashed at boring all around her with her troubles, she indulges in long periods of emotional navel-gazing with four characters called North, South, East and West. By the time one of them declares, 'Who are you? The self you've never known]', it is clear that whichever point of the compass she heads for, she will end up in pseuds' corner. The music manages to build up some feeling of world-weariness as poor Anna trudges the streets in despair, but Armstrong falls back far too easily on repetitive minimalist note-spinning to accompany the long passages of moralising. Pamela Helen Stephen, an involving singer, did her best to make the hour bearable. The other piece was Tourist Variations, a two-handed conversation piece about tourism and the meaning of life. This sort of comedy where the most banal statements are supposed to roll wit, satire, and cosmic relevance into one is difficult to bring off, though Poulenc tried. The ingenuity to keep it going for an hour would stretch the most brilliant minds and proved way beyond Iain Heggie (words) and James MacMillan (music). Their package deal was a one-way ticket to tedium. Eirian Davies and Alasdair Elliott were the hard-working singers. ***** In the morning there had been a recital of the latter composer's chamber music at the Queen's Hall. James MacMillan is the special focus for new music at this year's festival. Widely recognised as the front-runner among young Scottish composers, publicly acclaimed by audiences at the Proms, he is both an obvious and an enterprising choice for an Edinburgh retrospective. The recital was of early pieces. From the beginning MacMillan at his best has been a distinctive voice, rhythmical, pungent, able to hit upon snappy memorable ideas which are repeated for a minute or two, before he moves on. Works such as the Piano Sonata probe darker feelings. It is interesting to hear that his style, shorn of its vitality and unpredictability for Tourist Variations, can be made to sound like Sondheim - but not encouraging. There is more MacMillan next week. Chamber concert sponsored by Scottish Power</p>

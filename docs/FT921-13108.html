			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: JCI gold mines produce 28% rise in profits SUCCESSFUL cost contain-ment and productivity increases at the Randfontein mine allowed Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) gold mines to show a 28.6 increase in net profits for the December quarter. Net profits rose to R58.4m (Dollars 20.90m) from R45.4m the previous quarter. Of this, R54.5m came from Randfontein, which recorded a 46.1 per cent rise. A large part of Randfontein's success arose from a productivity bonus scheme reached with workers in exchange for a low annual wage increase last year. The mine produced 7,821kg of gold at R26,018 per kg in the December 1991 quarter compared with 7,363kg at R27,694 per kg in the December 1990 quarter. Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said that workers had received, in terms of the productivity scheme, about 23 per cent of the benefits from the mine's improved performance. This involved the mine paying out about R5.2m in productivity bonuses during the quarter, which translates to a wage rise of about 12 per cent. The interim dividend was lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share. Less fortunate was the performance of the Western Areas mine. Serious flooding in October resulted in gold production dropping by 5 per cent to 2,791kg. This fed through to a 62.2 per cent decline in net profits to R2.96m. The Joel mine, which is still undergoing development work, lifted net profits to R890,000 from R201,000, but continued to make a loss after capital expenditure. Encouraging news came from the South Deep prospect, where a new mine may be developed. Sampling in the shaft pillar area has produced considerably better results than contained in the prospectus.</p>

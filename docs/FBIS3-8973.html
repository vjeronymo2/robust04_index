			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Adrian Severin, vice president of the Democratic </F> Party(National Salvation Front), PD(FSN), at the meeting of the  PD(FSN) Steering Collegium, in Bucharest on 12 March: "In Times  of Distress Democracy Is Impossible Without a Solid National  Consensus"]    [Excerpts] I will try to talk about what we think is the  current main political event, namely the negotiations between  the Democratic Party(National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] and the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. [passage omitted] We  have to try to maintain a dialogue, but not for the sake of  being somewhat closer to the spheres of power; with great  responsibility, we are simply considering the current situation  of our country and of our people. There are social segments  that are facing such difficulties that they are no longer  interested in political issues. We cannot come out of this  impasse unless all responsible political forces unite. Only in  this way will we be able to relaunch the economy and the reform  process. [passage omitted]    In connection with the recent government reshuffle, I would  like to specify that two PDSR figures, Mr. Ioan Solcanu and  Oliviu Gherman, affirmed that this reshuffle had taken place by  consulting the opposition. There was no such thing; these  affirmations were made only to fool people. [passage omitted]  This goes to show how confusing, if not immoral, the  involvement in the dialogue by the majority formation is, and it  also shows how difficult it is for us to discuss things under  such conditions. Despite all this, we will continue along the  same road. [passage omitted]    First I want to clarify whether the negotiations begun by  our  party with the PDSR representatives mean a change in our policy.  The answer is no. [passage omitted] These negotiations are  nothing but a resumption, under more dramatic circumstances, of  the negotiations that we conducted in November 1992 before the  formation of the Vacaroiu government. [passage omitted] From  this point of view, there is no change in our policy. It is,  however, the dramatic situation in our country that has caused  these negotiations to resume. With what thoughts each side  comes to these negotiations remains to be seen. We can talk  only about ourselves. Within this context, I want to say that  when we started negotiations with the PDSR we affirmed three  things: "We have not come to judge you, we have not come to be  judged -- because nothing gives you the right to be our judges  -- and we have not come to change your views or to change our  views -- because we are not your teachers just as you cannot be  our teachers. [passage omitted] What we want to do is to see  what measures we can find to seek joint objectives and the means  of cooperation to implement them. [passage omitted]    Second, what are our objectives? [passage omitted] Or  rather, what are not our objectives? It is not our objective to  form an alliance with the PDSR. Such an alliance is ruled out.  We are trying to achieve an alliance with genuinely  social-democratic parties. [passage omitted] I am not talking  of a political alliance. [passage omitted] It is our objective  -- and we have affirmed this from the very beginning in these  discussions -- to restructure the parliamentary majority.  [passage omitted]    Third, what alternatives do we have at our disposal? The  first one would be that this new majority generate a new  government made up of the three reunited groups, the second  alternative would be a government made up of the PDSR and the  CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] supported in parliament  by the PD(FSN) proving that we do not want to be an obstacle in  the formation of a better government than the current one and  that we do not want to lay our hands, at all costs, on any of  the portfolios. All we desire is to replace a government that  is dangerous for the country. And the third alternative is a  PDSR monochrome minority government supported in parliament by  the current opposition. This third alternative -- which was  rapidly taken up by the PDSR -- led to a number of discussions,  controversies, and confusion in public opinion. [passage  omitted] When we said that the third alternative would be to  support a PDSR minority government, we did not say that this  government was the Vacaroiu government -- against which we have  launched four motions. [passage omitted] It goes without  saying that we do not support this government. Not because of a  narrow- minded position, but because in two years of governing  it has demonstrated that this government neither knows, wants,  nor is able to do anything for the benefit of this country.  When I said that we will support a PDSR government, I said that  we will support any government other than the Vacaroiu  government, and that we will not support the government without  conditions. In order to support such a government, we have to  agree on three aspects. First, on a reformist government  program; second, on isolating extremist, intolerant, chauvinist,  and anti-Semitic forces preventing such forces from being in  power, and third, to guarantee that commitments will be  respected and that the democratic process in Romania will  continue. [passage omitted]    Fourth, this is a question I was asked in connection with  the formula that was launched, which was not the most fortunate:  Namely a nonaggression Pact. [passage omitted] This is what we  proposed. [passage omitted] From our point of view, it is much  easier for us to respect such an accord because our attitude  already abides by it and because we do not put pressure on local  administration nor on the other party's members, and so forth.  It is clear that the PDSR has to assume serious responsibility  in this respect. This is what we discussed.    Another question was raised in connection with possible  negotiations with a view to obtaining certain advantages  regarding the famous penal files, which have been opened or are  to be opened by the control corps of the prime minister led and  guided by the Romania Mare Party. Here, before you, I want to  fully deny the following hypothesis: We have by no means  started from the idea that, by conducting such discussions, we  will be able to close some files. On the contrary. In our  proposal regarding the way of action, we asked the ruling party  to take steps so that the procedures of pursuit and  investigation will be completed, no matter the results. We  should not bargain on such things and I personally, as our  party's vice president and leader of this delegation, will not  let myself be blackmailed into such negotiations. It will not  be possible to put pressure on us by manipulating these files,  although we know -- and you should know, too -- that for a few  days now, further pressure has been put on the Prosecutor's to  reactivate the operations on the respective files; thus,  additional arguments will probably be brought to the negotiating  table.    The last question is linked to reactions and prospects.  There are several kinds of reactions to these negotiations: On  the one hand there were reactions in support. Unfortunately, to  all our arguments there were signs of interest only when it came  to party interests and not national ones. [passage omitted]  There were also negative reactions. I had the opportunity to  read an article in a local newspaper in Prahova County, which  was unsigned, but betrayed the "vigorous" verbs of Mr. N. Ilie  Nica, and which accused the Democratic Party. It is clear-cut  that Mr. N. Ilie Nica does not want the negotiations to succeed.  We also have information that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  has instructed our ambassadors, particularly in countries with  powerful social-democratic parties, to make it known there that  the PD(FSN) has ceased to exist, that there is dissension in its  leadership, that Petre Roman and other leaders will soon be  replaced, and other such things. We have absolutely factual  information in this respect. It is a recent action. I am sure  that those who have desired that this government reshuffle take  place the way it did also include people who believe that such  methods will stop the negotiations or make us much more rigid.    As you see, there have been a whole number of reactions to  these negotiations. Everybody favors reform, democracy, and  national consensus; in actual fact, however, it seems that the  moment opportunities emerge for all this to be built, there are  certain people who create obstacles for such a process.    I want to conclude with a sentence I heard recently at the  Council of Europe uttered by Thorvald Stoltenberg, one of the  two negotiators on former Yugoslavia. Asked whether he was  optimistic about the results of the negotiations, he said he  was, but when asked what reasons there were to be optimistic, he  said there were none. I will tell you the same thing. We do  not have special reasons to be optimistic. Despite this, we  will remain optimistic, no matter what obstacles may arise; we  will prove that we stay optimistic to the very end, even risking  being considered naive; we will prove our goodwill even if we  risk being called foolish. We will do all we can, to the very  end, so that no one can say that we have not made all possible  efforts to achieve a positive result, and so that we cannot be  blamed should these negotiations fail.</p>

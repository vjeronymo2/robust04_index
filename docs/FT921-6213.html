			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US and Mexico face Dollars 24bn boost - The North American Free Trade Agreement A SUCCESSFUL North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) would add an annual Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.7bn) to trade between the US and Mexico by 1995, according to a study by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. The US would transform a visible trade deficit in 1990 into a substantial trade surplus. A total of 609,000 jobs would be created in Mexico. While 112,000 US workers would be 'dislocated', the creation of 242,000 jobs would give the US a net gain of 130,000 new jobs, the study suggests. The study appears at a highly sensitive stage in negotiation of the Nafta. A series of meetings since January has generated unexpected momentum, raising hopes that agreement can be reached ahead of US presidential elections. The study contradicts widely publicised - and politically effective - predictions by political opponents to President Bush that the Nafta would lead to job losses in the US due to migration of factories into Mexico. The study argues that a 'properly crafted' Nafta 'holds the promise of becoming a landmark agreement': it could demonstrate that a middle-income nation like Mexico could be successfully joined to two high-income states; it could 'reinforce and lock in' recent economic reforms in Mexico; it could 'pioneer the meaningful inclusion' of labour and environmental issues into a trade agreement - something the Uruguay Round of negotiations on world trade reform has been unable to accommodate. The study forecasts that if the Nafta is successfully negotiated, Mexico's exports to the US would rise by Dollars 19.45bn from Dollars 27.2bn in 1989 to Dollars 46.65in 1995. At the same time US exports to Mexico would surge by Dollars 33.6bn from Dollars 25.0bn to Dollars 58.6bn. This would transform a US deficit on visible trade in 1989 of Dollars 2.2bn into a surplus of almost Dollars 12bn. In the absence of a Nafta, Mexican exports to the US would grow more modestly to Dollars 38.9bn, while US exports would rise to Dollars 41.85bn, leading to a visible surplus in the US favour of just under Dollars 3bn. The net gain in trade attributable to the Nafta would thus be worth Dollars 16.7bn in exports from the US, and Dollars 7.7bn in exports from Mexico. The deterioration in Mexico's visible trade balance would be fully financed by inflows of foreign capital, and repatriation of Mexican capital, fuelling 'a rapid acceleration of Mexican growth' - with real GNP growth averaging 6 per cent a year - the study predicts. Mexico's trade with Canada, which stood at a meagre Dollars 1.9bn in 1990, would expand by 30 per cent by 1995. The study calls for the Nafta to be compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). It should avoid any taint of 'Fortress North America' and should include commitments to 'harmonise up' environmental standards. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Canada would lose about 5,000 jobs from the three-way pact, according to the study. Its exports to Mexico could grow about 20 per cent, but its imports could jump as much as 40 per cent. * North American Free Trade: Issues and Recommendations, by Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott, available from Institute for International Economics, Washington.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- PROJECTED EFFECTS OF NAFTA, ACCOMPANIED BY MEXICAN POLICY REFORMS, IN 1995 (CHANGES FROM 1989 LEVELS)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade Effects                             US Dollars bn  -------------------------------------------------------------------   Larger US exports to Mexico                      16.7   Larger Mexican exports to US                      7.7   Net change in US trade balance                    9.0  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Employment Effects                                000's  -------------------------------------------------------------------   US jobs dislocated                              112.0   US jobs created                                 242.0   Net US job gains                                130.0   Mexican net employment gains                    609.0  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wage Effects                                   Per cent  -------------------------------------------------------------------   Change in US wage rate                            0.0   Change in Mexican wage rate                       8.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Institute for International Economics  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

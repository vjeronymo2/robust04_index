			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / RJB offered Pounds 914m in bidding to win British Coal regions RJB Mining, the coal company, put in an offer of Pounds 914m to win the government's backing as preferred bidder for the English regions of British Coal, it emerged yesterday. In one of the boldest and most controversial fund-raising exercises in recent times on the London Stock Exchange, RJB aims to raise Pounds 425m in a share issue and Pounds 628m as debt. In presentations to potential investors, RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, indicate that they believe the debt can be cleared by 1998 when existing electricity contracts end. RJB predicts annual pretax profits of Pounds 220m by the turn of the century on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn. Profits before then will be Pounds 116m in 1995, Pounds 188m in 1996, Pounds 211m in 1997 and Pounds 186m in 1998. The amount of money RJB, capitalised at Pounds 157m, needs to raise means that investors will study its projections closely. Many executives in the electricity and coal industries believe the company, which bid more than 50 per cent higher than the nearest rival, is taking a highly optimistic view of markets, particularly after 1998. RJB says in its presentation, copies of which have been obtained by the Financial Times, that it expects to sell about 34m tonnes of coal from the regions it is acquiring and sell it at an average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule at today's prices. Some analysts believe sales around the mid-20m tonne mark are more realistic. The generators, to which most of the coal will be sold, are thought to want to buy coal for nearer Pounds 1 a gigajoule and are prepared to import rather than pay what they believe to be excessive UK prices. Among other key aspects of the presentation, RJB says: Costs per tonne can be cut by at least 10 per cent, partly through streamlining colliery management and increasing equipment utilisation. The English electricity supply market will require 27.1m-43m tonnes a year at the turn of the century. Of the Pounds 628m it plans to borrow, Pounds 528m will be through bank debt and Pounds 100m through corporate bonds. Net assets of the regions being bought are Pounds 902m and projected operating cash flow over five years is Pounds 1.35bn. Expected dividend yield is 4.5 per cent initially, with a policy of rapid dividend growth after the debt is cleared. Some 95 per cent of shares will be placed with institutions, with 5 per cent set aside for an offer for sale, although this could rise to 15 per cent if there is demand. RJB yesterday refused to comment.</p>

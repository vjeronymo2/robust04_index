			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Personal View: Give shareholders more power over pay While wage increases are decided by companies individually in the UK, a collective, inflationary, consequence can arise. In the past managers and employees have been expected to provide the solutions to the problem. However, the externality of wage inflation would best be internalised by turning to institutional shareholders and investors to provide a remedy. This might be achieved by their providing a more direct influence on the aggregate level of wage increases. Unusually, at the moment the aggregate effect of wage decision-making generates little concern. The rate of average earnings increases is at its lowest level since the early 1960s, while wage settlements across the private sector are at record low levels. Despite this encouraging situation, the need for a solution to Britain's pay problem is perhaps more timely than at any stage since the return to free collective bargaining in 1979. Before the recovery gathers pace and improving company profitability causes employees to pursue their wage demands with increased vigour, the perennial British problem of wage growth outstripping productivity needs to be addressed. To imagine, on the strength of recent statistics, that the issue that has bedevilled economic management in postwar years has disappeared could prove over complacent. While the change in the labour market in recent years, through legislation, decentralisation and union decline, has been considerable, the unco-ordinated pattern of pay determination needs to be reinforced with a mechanism to ameliorate Britain's structural pay problem. Many advocate a system designed to establish a consensus on affordable pay increases nationally. Professor Metcalf (Personal View, June 2) suggests involving the views of the Seven Wise Men who advise the Treasury, buttressed by a forum of the largest 50 private sector companies to establish a co-ordinated view on earnings growth. Though the importance of the issue is not in question, a system which is not governed by the interests of individual companies may prove ineffective. Since managements cannot easily be induced to behave in a manner that appears contrary to their immediate interests, the adverse externality of wage inflation can arise. Therefore, an economy-wide dispersion in wage settlements, around a lower nominal average increase, would be best achieved via a mechanism applied through corporate shareholders rather than managements. To see the problem in a shareholder/management context offers a potential solution. Collective co-ordination of wage growth through corporate shareholders could exert an effective discipline on the corporate sector as a whole. By providing appropriate pressure at this level, any benefits of a collective approach might be better appreciated, while the institutional investors would also be best placed to regulate such a mechanism through the application of pressure on their shareholdings. Although such a proposal may seem beyond the current ambit of shareholders in Britain, it should be seen as a logical extension of their existing mandate. This control mechanism could be put into effect by extending the remit of the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, in its direction on strategy and performance. It could include a responsibility to advise on an economically feasible average wage increase across the corporate sector as a whole. Subject to this 'external' constraint, individual management teams could continue to use pay as a managerial tool within their organisations. Company managements would therefore remain free to act as they see fit under prevailing circumstances while the institutional shareholders ensure the well-being of the corporate sector as a whole. In such a mechanism neither shareholders nor managers are required to act in any way other than the pursuit of their individual interests. Ownership in the corporate sector has become progressively more concentrated over recent years: more than 50 per cent of shares in British quoted companies are effectively controlled by a small cluster of institutional investors. So, where individual companies pursue outcomes that are collectively disadvantageous, it should be at this higher level of corporate control that a remedy should be sought. If a need should arise for exhortation on pay or co-ordination of wage awards, it should emerge from Britain's institutional investors. This would provide the attraction of economically consistent pay settlements combined with the scope for flexibility while enabling the private sector to control itself.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 10 (CNA) -- The second round of tariff  reduction consultations between Taiwan and the United States  will help facilitate Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu  Ke-sheng said Tuesday [10 May].    "We hope the United States can better understand Taiwan's  efforts in pushing for free and fair trade," he noted.    Sheu made the remarks prior to his departure for Washington,  D.C., where Sheu and his 30-member delegation will meet with  their American counterparts on both tariff and non-tariff issues  Thursday and Friday.    Major topics during the two-day talks include farm trade,  opening of service markets, the special exchange agreement, the  government procurement [words indistinct], trade-related  intellectual property protection, Tokyo round codes, and  non-tariff trade barriers, he said.    The United States first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048  products last November, including tariffs on industrial goods to  below 10 percent and farm goods to less than 20 percent. It  also demanded that Taiwan immediately slash tariff rates on 699  items by up to 50 percent.    The two sides failed to reach agreement during the first  round of tariff talks held in Taipei in February.    After the talks, Sheu and his delegation will proceed to  Geneva May 14 to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT working  party on Taiwan's membership scheduled for May 17-19.    During the working party meeting, Sheu will hold bilateral  tariff consultations with Canada, Switzerland, and South Korea.    So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with  the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South  Africa, Hungary, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan  among 21 countries, which have asked for such talks with Taiwan.    Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are  considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based  world trade regulating body.    Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

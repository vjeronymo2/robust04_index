			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Political funding: the rewards and the pitfalls AT a UK construction company which is one of the Conservative party's biggest donors, one executive went on the offensive this week. Commenting on the row which has flared in parliament and the press over corporate contributions to the Tories, he declared: 'Take a look at Italy, or even the good old US,' he said. 'By comparison, what happens in the UK is tiny.' The executive's point is partly justified. The dispute in Britain centres on what the Labour party calls a Pounds 15m 'credibility gap' - the difference between the Conservative party's declared total of Pounds 19m in donations during the run-up to the 1992 general election, and the Pounds 3.7m in publicly disclosed contributions, detailed in companies' annual reports. The rest comes from undisclosed individual and foreign sources. The gap is indeed small compared with the Pounds 1bn-plus hole in the accounts of the Italian parties, which are at the centre of financing scandals which have undermined the country's political structure. In the US, trading cash for influence is an accepted part of the political system. Ex-President George Bush awarded a dozen ambassadorships to members of Team 100, individuals who had given at least Dollars 100,000 to the Republican Party. Ms Pamela Harriman, the English-born widow of the US statesman Averell Harriman, gave about Dollars 75,000 (Pounds 50,000) to Democratic candidates last year, and is now US ambassador in Paris. In the main industrialised countries there are a plethora of reasons why parties give  - or do not give  - to political parties, but Britain has been some way down the list of countries where malpractice is prevalent. In Italy, there is often a precise and mutually beneficial relationship between payments to political groupings and rewards in the shape of extra orders. Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti, the computer and office equipment group, has recently denounced as 'racketeering' the routine payments of Italian companies to pay kickbacks to political parties to win contracts. He says his company was forced to make such payments to win orders from the posts ministry. Total bribes and kickbacks paid annually by Italian companies to win contracts have been estimated at L5,000bn to L6,000bn (Pounds 2.2bn-Pounds 2.64bn), much of which has ended up in the pockets of the political parties. Fiat, the big motor group, has brought in a code of conduct forbidding payment of kickbacks by its employees. If such initiatives prove workable, they would have a dramatic effect on Italian business life. In the US, too, restructuring of party financing is on the political agenda. For 20 years the most efficient means of disbursement has been via political action committees (PACs), which 'bundle' together and pass on contributions from individuals and special interests either directly to candidates or, to get around ceilings on such donations, to the two political parties. President Bill Clinton wants to ban PAC contributions and stop the transmission of such so-called 'soft money' to candidates. His bill to reform campaign finance has already passed through the Senate without substantive alteration. Mr Clinton and Mr Bush each got Dollars 55m (Pounds 37m) from the federal purse, plus about another Dollars 10m from their respective parties, to fight their campaigns last year, but refused to accept PAC contributions. Mr Ross Perot, the maverick free enterprise candidate, paid for his own campaign  - about Dollars 70m. Sometimes, corporate attempts to gain a hold over the levers of power can go disastrously wrong. In Japan, which has one of the most extensive networks of legal and illegal payments linking big companies and the government party, the most obvious failure was the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. In the hope of gaining influence, the company illegally donated at least Y500m (Pounds 3m) to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced power-broker of the Liberal Democratic Party. The company has since had to be financially restructured, while the executives involved are on trial for breach of trust. Mr Kanemaru had to resign, and is facing tax evasion charges. In Canada, which has well-developed rules for disclosure, many of the largest contributors  - to both political parties  - are businesses which have a poor public image and are thus under threat of political action (such as the big banks and the tobacco companies). In Spain, corruption involving channeling of funds to state authorities and party interest appears to be endemic in the construction industry. 'It is part of everyday life, built into the business you could say,' said a senior executive in a leading construction company. Germany's Siemens electrical group has been caught up in allegations of payments of at least Pta825m (Pounds 4.23m) to a group of Spanish intermediaries linked to the ruling Socialist party. Siemens' prize was to clinch a Pta100bn contract in 1989 to provide electrification along the 471kms of high-speed train tracks that link Madrid and Seville. Siemens says the payments were bona-fide commissions representing an agreed percentage of the final contract. In France, which like Spain has had its share of recent funding scandals, companies are coy about their political contributions  - although greater disclosure will be required next year under a recently-passed law. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), the French luxury goods group, who describes his company's gifts as 'extremely modest,' says the rationale behind them is: 'You can't separate yourself from the life of the nation.' In similar terms, Deutsche Bank, one of the largest donors in Germany, says it gives money to all parties 'to support democracy.' The chairman of its supervisory board, Mr F. Wilhelm Christians, said recently the bank had given no money to the opposition Social Democrats 'because they didn't ask.' Sometimes, big companies can think of good reasons not to give money. BASF, the German chemicals giant, says loftily it makes no donations to political parties because 'it is part of the company's culture to be neutral.' Sir Patrick Sheey, chairman of BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services conglomerate, says it makes no donations in the UK because 'as a multinational that stands you in better stead.' In Canada, however, BAT's 42 per cent owned associate Imasco, is one of the country's largest political contributors, giving about CDollars 48,000 (Pounds 25,000) each to the Liberals and Conservatives in 1991. Cynics might note that Imasco owns Imperial Tobacco, which has a 66 per cent share of the Canadian cigarette market; whereas in the UK, BAT sells no cigarettes.

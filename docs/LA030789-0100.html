			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lotus Wins Court Case: Lotus Development Corp. announced that a federal judge  has dismissed all claims made by SAPC Inc. against Lotus and its founder,  Mitchell D. Kapor. In November, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton dismissed  SAPC's claim of copyright infringement, ruling that SAPC gave up its right to  sue when it sold most of its assets to Lotus in 1985. Keeton dismissed all  remaining charges against Lotus and Kapor last week. Those claims included  charges of breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and  confidential secrets and unjust enrichment.  </P></p>

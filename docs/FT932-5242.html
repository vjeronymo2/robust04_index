			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Lower loan-loss provisions lift results at CIBC CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce benefited from stronger fee income and lower loan-loss provisions in the second quarter of fiscal 1993. The bank, Canada's second biggest, reported earnings of CDollars 180m (USDollars 142m), or 75 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, compared with a CDollars 440m loss, or CDollars 2.54 a share, a year earlier. Return on equity in the latest period was 10.8 per cent. Last year's heavy loss was caused by loan writedowns totalling CDollars 1.19bn, largely reflecting CIBC's exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the crippled real estate developer. Loan-loss provisions in the latest quarter were CDollars 220m, indicating an unchanged estimate of loan losses for the year of CDollars 880m. Like most of the other Canadian banks which have reported over the past 10 days, CIBC noted a modest improvement in its loan portfolio. Non-performing loans fell to just under CDollars 3bn on April 30, from CDollars 3.14bn three months earlier. The bank attributed a 21 per cent jump in non-interest income from the previous quarter to strong earnings from underwriting and brokerage activities, as well as higher foreign exchange and swaps income. Non-interest income rose by 4 per cent over the year. Assets stood at CDollars 137.9bn on April 30, up CDollars 1.7bn from a year earlier. Thanks to several common and preferred share issues, the bank has boosted its total capital-to-assets ratio from 8.7 per cent to 9.7 per cent over the past six months. CIBC is the last of the Big Six Canadian banks to report second-quarter earnings. Although the banks continue to experience problems with their commercial property portfolios, the results point to a gradual improvement in earnings and shareholder returns. Most of the banks are actively expanding their fiduciary and insurance interests to take advantage of financial-service reforms legislated last year. The securities businesses which the banks acquired after similar reforms were introduced in 1987 have been significant generators of profit in recent quarters.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            CANADIAN BANKS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS (CDOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      3 Months to April 30 1993                                             Loan Loss        Return on                            Net income       Provision         Equity %                          1993    1992     1993     1992     1993   1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of Canada      243     212      175      185     13.7   11.6 Canadian Imperial Bank   of Commerce (loss)      180    (440)     220    1,187     10.8      - Bank of Montreal          173     143      163      125     14.2   13.0 Bank of Nova Scotia       172     171      117      110     14.2   16.4 Toronto-Dominion Bank      90      79      150      120     7.5     6.5 National Bank of Canada    40      30      100       94     9.5     5.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Reynolds Metals expands aluminium can capacity REYNOLDS METALS, the US integrated aluminium manufacturer, is to buy Miller Brewing's aluminium beverage can manufacturing operations. The deal will make Reynolds the third-largest aluminium can producer in the world. The transaction will increase Reynold's US aluminium can capacity by nearly 50 per cent, according to Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds' chairman. The acquisition is part of the company's strategy to expand its value-added aluminium businesses. Commodity aluminium prices are very weak, and Reynolds recently announced plans to shut significant portions of its US primary aluminium manufacturing. A spokesman for Miller, which is part of Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, said the company was divesting the can properties because it wished to focus on its core business of brewing beer. Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Reynolds said the deal would be financed through short-term borrowing against existing lines of credit. Once the purchase is finalised, the companies will enter a long-term agreement where Reynolds will supply Miller with 'substantially all' of its beverage can requirements. Miller's can plants, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Fulton, New York, Fort Worth, Texas, Reidsville, North Carolina, and Moultrie, Georgia, have a combined capacity of 5bn beverage cans per year, and employ more than 800 people.</p>

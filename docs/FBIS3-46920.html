Johnson; "The  Day Will Come When Mongolia Will Render Assistance to Others..."  -- MONTSAME headline; date and place not given]    [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 30 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- 1.  Question: Can you tell us about achievements in  Mongolian-American relations during 1993?    Answer: Before anything else, on behalf of the government  and people of the United States, I would like to wish the people  of Mongolia a happy New Year 1994, and express the hope that the  year will be full of success, good fortune, and happiness.    In 1993, our relations continued to show important and  positive developments. I will cite just a few examples: the  successful visit of Prime Minister Jasray to the United States  in June, our statement in support of Mongolia's status as a  nuclear free zone, the delivery of food and other aid to  Mongolia in the spring and fall, and the deepening of our  cultural and educational exhanges with the arrival of our press  and cultural attache. These are developments for which both  sides have worked hard and cooperated successfully, so we feel  great satisfaction over our work this year.    2. Question: What would you like to say about the future of  relations between Mongolia and the U.S.?    Answer: In a very short time, our two countries have  established a very good foundation for stable, friendly and  active relations.    As ambassador, I would like to continue to build on this  foundation.    Of fundamental importance to our relations is our shared  commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, political  pluralism, and to a market economy. In this regard, the example  given by the citizens of Mongolia in this year's presidential  elections cannot be overlooked. President Ochirbat was  re-elected in an open, fair, and internationally monitored  election, an event that all people of Mongolia should feel great  pride about.    Having said all of the above, I must add that there remains  a  great deal that we can do to further develop relations. For  example, our economic links are still far below what they should  be. Mongolia needs to intensify its efforts to attract  investment to this country. We need to establish more contacts  in the areas of science, information, and culture. These are  things that I am working on as ambassador and will continue to  pay attention to.    3. Question: What do you think about the current reform  process in Mongolia?    Answer : My country supports Mongolia's efforts to make a  successful transition to a market economy. These efforts have  involved pain and sacrifice for many Mongolians, and for many  people it may be hard to see progress. But there has been  progress. Inflation during 1993 has slowed dramatically, and  should continue to slow down in 1994. The decline in GDR  [expansion unknown] has been reduced, and if present policies  are continued, we believe that there will be positive economic  growth in 1994. Some areas of business are already expanding,  for example the textile sector.    The important thing is for Mongolia to keep ahead with the  reform process, because it is beginning to show results.    More results will be visible in the next year or two. To  help ease the transition, my country has provided food and  economic assistance. We will continue to support your efforts.  However, we also look forward to the day when Mongolia will be  assisting others, and not receiving assistance from abroad.</p>

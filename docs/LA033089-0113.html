			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: MORAL DEBATE RAGES OVER WRITERS WHO EXPLOIT HUMAN TRAGEDY  </P> <P> Some murder cases don't die. They become the source of endless literary  arguments.  </P> <P> For most of this month, journalistic tongues have been wagging over a two-part  article by Janet Malcolm in New Yorker magazine in which Malcolm -- after  investigating the tangled aftermath of a celebrated multiple homicide --  castigated her colleagues for "preying on people's vanity, ignorance or  loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse."  </P> <P> Titled "Reflections: The Journalist and the Murderer," Malcolm's 40,000 words  have provoked a barrage of rebuttal, including an editorial in the New York  Times and an expose on Malcolm in New York magazine.  </P> <P> The argument, interestingly enough, is based on a Southern California court  case that was largely ignored by the East Coast press at the time it occurred.  </P> <P> Malcolm's chief contention is that journalists lull their subjects with  displays of false camaraderie and -- after those naive subjects bare their  souls -- turn on them by writing stories that are unflattering and often  vicious.  </P> <P> In her opening paragraph, Malcolm wrote, "Every journalist who is not too  stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he  does is morally indefensible. . . . Like the credulous widow who wakes up one  day to find the charming young man and all her savings gone, so the consenting  subject of a piece of nonfiction writing learns -- when the article or book  appears -- his hard lesson."  </P> <P> Malcolm's jumping-off point for this and other sweeping pronouncements was a  lawsuit filed in 1984 by convicted murderer and former Green Beret Dr. Jeffrey  MacDonald against writer Joe McGinniss, author of "Fatal Vision," a book -- and  later a television miniseries -- about MacDonald and the murder of his wife and  two young daughters Feb. 17, 1970. In the suit, MacDonald, who once practiced  in Long Beach, charged that McGinniss had strung him along by pretending to  believe that he was innocent, all the while writing a book that portrayed the  former Army doctor as a psychopathic killer. The suit was tried in federal  court in Los Angeles in 1987 and resulted in a mistrial. McGinniss, in a move  that shocked many, later settled out of court with MacDonald, agreeing to pay  him $325,000, rather than endure a new trial.  </P> <P> Much of the trial -- and most of Malcolm's charges -- hinged on letters  McGinniss wrote to MacDonald in prison in which McGinniss constantly reassured  MacDonald with sympathetic comments. At the trial in Los Angeles, a number of  witnesses, including columnist and author William F. Buckley and crime writer  and novelist Joseph Wambaugh, testified that misleading or lying to subjects  about their true feelings was an acceptable technique for writers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Got What He Deserves  </P> <P> Malcolm concludes that McGinniss got what he deserved; that has provoked the  outraged response to her articles.  </P> <P> New York magazine contributing editor John Taylor got off the most telling blow  in an article in the March 27 issue. Taylor reported that in preparing a New  Yorker profile of psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson, Malcolm had engaged in many of  the same tactics for which she vilified McGinniss.  </P> <P> Wrote Taylor: "Like McGinniss, she (Malcolm) acquired the trust of her subject  ("have a little faith," she told him at one point). Like McGinniss, she  exploited the confidences her subject revealed. Like McGinniss, she portrayed  her subject as a sort of monster. Like McGinniss, she left him feeling utterly  betrayed. And, like McGinniss, she was sued."  </P> <P> Taylor also reported that in Malcolm's article on Masson, "a number of  quotations were not on Malcolm's tapes or in her handwritten notes."  </P> <P> But he also noted that Malcolm successfully defended herself, with a federal  court in San Francisco ruling that "there was an absence of malice and that  '(t)he inclusion of quotation marks in a passage does not require complete  accuracy; a writer may resort to rhetorical license.' "  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Taylor said there "has not been a letter or phone  call from the New Yorker" contradicting his article. In his story, Taylor wrote  that Malcolm did not reply "to numerous messages and requests for an  interview." (Masson's suit against Malcolm is being appealed, and a New Yorker  representative said the magazine would not comment until the case is finally  settled.)  </P> <P> Like others who have read Malcolm's article about McGinniss and MacDonald,  Taylor said he was captivated by it. "I think the New Yorker's great . . . and  I think Janet Malcolm is a very profound writer and her piece is very profound  though skewed," he explained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasingly Puzzled  </P> <P> But as he read the two installments, Taylor said he became increasingly puzzled  because Malcolm never mentioned her clash with Masson despite its obvious  parallels.  </P> <P> Taylor speculated that Malcolm's examination of how journalists work struck a  chord because "journalists, like most people, don't examine why they do what  they do" and the article "really set people thinking."  </P> <P> In the latest salvo on Malcolm, Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley filed a  commentary this week in which he made the distinction between journalists who  ply their trade daily or weekly and nonfiction writers who turn out blockbuster  books.  </P> <P> Yardley concluded that "Janet Malcolm's exploration of this question is flawed  in numerous ways, not least of them her reliance on precisely the amateur  psychologizing she so deplores in McGinniss, but her essential arguments are  sound and important. There is nothing sacred about the cynical process by which  real human calamities are turned into blockbuster books; it is business pure  and simple, not very pretty business at that, and it deserves exposure as  precisely what it is."  </P> <P> Perhaps overlooked in this debate is one remarkable fact -- the murders that  led to it happened more than 19 years ago. That they are still the ultimate  source of news is due largely to the almost inhuman persistence of MacDonald,  who continues to proclaim his innocence.  </P> <P> In a prescient passage in "Fatal Vision," McGinniss quoted one of his sources  as saying that MacDonald is "never going to accept his guilt. He's never going  to just sit in jail. . . . The case is never going to be in a posture where he  just quietly sits in jail and lets the years roll by."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Merger Consequences?  </P> <P> Now that the initial spate of publicity over the merger of Time Inc. and Warner  Communications Inc. has died down, Media Industry Newsletter, an insider's  newsletter, has weighed in with some second thoughts. Among other things, the  newsletter's anonymous authors wonder if film-TV giant Warner might not find  magazines a bit passe  </P> <P> "Is it too remote to imagine the 'entertainment power bloc' in the combined  companies looking at magazine publishing as an anachronism in their new world  of global film-TV-cable interests?" the newsletter asks. "If entertainment is  TWI's new 'core' business, how long will the news and information print  properties be looked upon favorably?"  </P> <P> Good questions.  </P></p>

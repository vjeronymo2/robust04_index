			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Malta urges early talks on EU entry Malta yesterday called for an 'immediate' start of accession negotiations to join the European Union, arguing that it would shortly overcome the final economic obstacles to entry, Lionel Barber reports from Brussels. Dr Eddie Fenech Adami, the Maltese prime minister, said in Brussels that his government would 'in a matter of weeks' meet the European Commission's requirements for regulatory reforms in financial services, competition and consumer protection. The Maltese declaration puts the European Commission and the 12 EU member states on the spot. Though sympathetic towards Malta's application, sentiment has leaned toward a delay until the end of enlargement negotiations with Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway. But Dr Fenech Adami said Malta intended to ensure the Commission stuck to the conditions set down on its generally favourable opinion on EU membership issued last year.</p>

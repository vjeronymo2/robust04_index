			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / RSI compensation awards continue Unions have won Pounds 118,000 in compensation for sufferers of repetitive strain injury in the past two months in spite of a ruling by a High Court judge that the condition is 'meaningless', the TUC said yesterday. It said the awards were from 30 cases involving five unions, mainly in out-of-court settlements. Those affected were bank workers, journalists and engineering workers. In October Judge Prosser, rejecting a claim for compensation from a journalist against Reuters news agency, said RSI had 'no place in the medical books'.</p>

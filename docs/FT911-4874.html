			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Brussels fears for software directive CONTROVERSIAL EC legislation aimed at ending piracy of computer software could face a last-minute battle in the European parliament today after more than a year of frenetic lobbying by rival camps in the computer industry. The European Commission is afraid that the compromise thrashed out with EC member states in December will be jeopardised if the parliament adopts amendments to the directive. The proposed directive, part of the EC single market programme, aims to extend copyright laws to computer software. It has been the subject of a fierce struggle between large computer groups, such as IBM, which want strict rules on copyright protection, and smaller groups which want the ability to create software which is compatible with their larger rivals' products. The December compromise would allow a limited amount of 'reverse engineering' - the unpicking of programs by smaller groups in order to create compatible software. Christian Democrat MEPs, the second largest grouping in the parliament, are expected to vote against the amendments, put forward by a parliamentary committee, which aim to broaden the scope for reverse engineering. However, the largest group, the Socialists, has yet to decide its position, and the pressure looks likely to continue right up to this evening's vote. If the Socialists abstain or vote against, then a majority in favour of the amendments would be impossible and the directive would pass back to Community ministers unchanged for formal adoption by a qualified majority of member states. If the amendments go through, however, the directive would then require the unanimous approval of member states, which could prove difficult. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner responsible for the internal market, said yesterday he hoped MEPs would throw out the amendments. He told the deputies that the Commission and EC ministers had taken account of parliament's views after the first reading of the directive last July. Several MEPs yesterday condemned the intense lobbying which has plagued the measure, claiming that colleagues aligned to one or other industry camp were still trying to enlist the support of undecided deputies.</p>

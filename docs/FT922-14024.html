			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Fat bonuses for big hitters - The return of high earnings at Wall Street Whisper it; just one year after the US securities industry posted record losses, multi-million dollar bonuses are back in fashion on Wall Street. In the past few weeks a host of company proxy statements have revealed how much top executives in the securities industry were rewarded for 1991's record earnings. At Merrill Lynch, Mr William Schreyer, chairman, picked up almost Dollars 6m for the company's best year, and he could earn another Dollars 10m or more from stock options that came with his pay packet. Over at Morgan Stanley, the three most senior executives earned more than Dollars 5m each for steering the securities firm to record profits in 1991. With stock options, their pay totals nearer Dollars 8m apiece. Even the chairman of Bear Stearns, a smaller firm, pulled in Dollars 5.3m, while his counterpart at the much bigger Shearson Lehman Brothers earned Dollars 2.8m. These are a few of the numbers that made the newspapers. Behind the headlines lie hundreds more multi-million dollar and multi-thousand dollar payments to traders, analysts, arbitrage experts, underwriting managers and senior executives. In the case of some specialists, their pay cheques exceeded even those of the chairmen and chief executives. The payouts on Wall Street stand out in contrast to much of the rest of US business, which has been put on the defensive over the issue of pay and bonuses by indignant shareholders who want to bring compensation more into line with profits and performance. Wall Street's highest paid executives have escaped the criticism reserved for the chairmen of Time Warner, United Airways and ITT because their businesses have performed so well in the past year that shareholders have had no reason to complain. What must be particularly galling for outsiders is that the big bonuses on Wall Street are being handed out at a time when the US economy is still struggling to climb out of the longest recessions in its history. However, for Wall Street the timing could not be better, coming at the end of a three-year period when pay levels in the securities industry were either frozen or cut back because of the slump in earnings. Fuelled by rising share prices, falling interest rates, record levels of bond and equity issues and heavy investor activity in stock markets, Wall Street firms last year earned fat fees and massive trading profits. Equally important, return on equity improved rapidly. Pre-tax return on equity at Merrill Lynch rose from 9 per cent in 1990 to 27 per cent last year, at Morgan Stanley from 20 per cent to 36 per cent, and at Bear Stearns from 21 per cent to 36 per cent. The share prices of publicly quoted Wall Street houses have risen sharply over the past 12 months. On a strict pay-for-performance basis, the money has been well-earned, much as it was in the good years of the 1980s when large bonuses were handed out like confetti. Yet there are important differences between that carefree, spendthrift era and today. The most fundamental concerns the distribution of profits. In the 1980s, everyone enjoyed a big bonus during the good times, irrespective of their contribution to earnings. Today, things have changed, says Ms Joan Zimmerman of G Z Stephens, a New York executive recruiting firm. 'Given the cost-consciousness and profit-consciousness that has finally begun to sink in on Wall Street, firms have clearly differentiated between the significant producers and originators, and those people who are merely processors of in-house deals.' That the big hitters on Wall Street have been paid so well is not just a reflection of their positions at the top of the career ladder. They received big cheques because they delivered. If they had not brought in lots of revenue, their rewards would have been much smaller. This is the second break from the recent past. In the 1980s there was little downside earnings risk for senior executives on Wall Street, who were normally guaranteed a certain level of compensation no matter what the results. If the firm suffered a bad year, management saved money by reducing compensation or shedding jobs among junior and mid-level staff. Since then, Wall Street firms have realised it makes no sense to relate the pay of lower level executives to performance because they cannot be expected to bring in much revenue so early in their careers. Now, senior professionals are having to bear the brunt of any swings in profitability. Wall Street insiders say there are plenty of examples this year of firms which did not give big bonus cheques to senior executives in certain departments - mergers and acquisition and corporate finance come to mind - because those particular lines of business fared poorly in 1991. In spite of this new approach, there is concern that the record earnings of 1991 and the strong start to 1992 could raise expectations on Wall Street staff to dangerous levels. Mr Vincent Perro of Sibson, a human resources management consultancy, warns: 'Firms run the risk of losing some of the discipline they gained during the lean years.' Although some have put performance management systems in place that help identify, and reward, the real revenue earners, employees may fall into the trap of thinking that last year's bonuses, and those in the immediate future, should compensate for the relatively meagre returns of 1989-90. Trying to set some sort of ceiling on pay and expectations is difficult because it runs counter to logic on Wall Street. 'The basic tenet of the business is that you have very portable, valuable assets, and it is difficult to artificially restrain the market for those assets,' explains Mr Perro. Just take at look at Salomon, which undertook a very public reform of its compensation system in the wake of last year's bond trading scandal. The new management of the firm pledged to make no promises on pay, and to align compensation with performance. Yet the new policy contributed to a wave of departures by unhappy staff, and Salomon was forced to issue some up-front guarantees on pay to keep executives who threatened to leave for rival firms. As Ms Zimmerman puts it: 'There was some wishful thinking in executive suites that (Salomon's new approach) would influence the general mentality on the Street. But 1991 was the most profitable year in Wall Street's history, and the reality was that firms had to reward the best people or stand a very good chance of losing them.'</p>

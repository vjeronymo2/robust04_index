			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour promise on investor rights LABOUR yesterday pledged measures to protect individual and employee shareholders in the latest of a series of attacks on what the party sees as the government's failure to stand up to vested interests in the City and elsewhere. Mr Stuart Bell, the party's City spokesman, claimed merchant bankers, lawyers and accountants had practiced the 'black art' of creative accountancy to deprive individual shareholders of proper investment information. 'They made a mockery of the share-owning democracy and popular capitalism,' he said, addressing the Institute of Credit Management. By using a range of devices including off-balance sheet financing and inflated asset values, he added, 'a massive hoodwinking of the individual investor was perpetrated'. Mr Bell proposed a series of measures to redress the balance in favour of smaller shareholders. He said a Labour government would: Build on the government's statutory obligation for auditors to report alleged fraud, giving the regulatory auditing authorities greater powers to ensure that balance sheets reflected not only the true and fair state of a company but also whether it was a going concern. Examine the question of allowing investors in employee share owning schemes to elect 'one of their own' to company boards. Extend existing share option schemes to cover employees of subsidiary as well as parent companies. 'We need to empower individual shareholders to play a full part in company development by encouraging them to participate,' Mr Bell said.</p>

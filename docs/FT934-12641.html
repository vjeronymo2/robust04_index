			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Citibank appeals over Pounds 14m payout THE Court of Appeal yesterday began hearing an appeal by Citibank against a High Court ruling that it should pay Pounds 14.7m compensation to Smith New Court, the securities house, for losses incurred on the purchase of Ferranti shares worth Pounds 23m. The 28m shares were bought in July 1989, shortly before the discovery of a fraud on Ferranti halved the value of the stock. The High Court held in March last year that SNC's bid price for the shares had been induced by fraudulent misrepresentations made to it by Mr Christopher Roberts, the then head of private banking at Citibank, part of the US Citicorp group, and a director of Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management), its marketmakers. Mr Roberts had falsely told SNC it was competing with two other bidders, Mr Justice Chadwick had said at the hearing. SNC was awarded Pounds 10.7m compensation plus interest of about Pounds 4m. Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, for Citibank, yesterday argued that the judge had made a finding of fraud against Mr Roberts without adequate foundation. Mr Sumption said a high standard of proof was needed to support the allegation of fraud - especially since Mr Roberts was acquitted of similar criminal charges. SNC's allegations were always based upon evidence given by two of its directors, Mr Lewis and Mr Abrahams, who were primarily responsible for the transaction, Mr Sumption said. Mr Justice Chadwick had regarded both men as discredited witnesses whereas he made no adverse finding about the credibility of Mr Roberts. The judge's finding of fraud was therefore substantially based on speculative inferences. This was a wholly inappropriate basis on which to make the grave finding of fraud, Mr Sumption said. The case is due to last 10 days.</p>

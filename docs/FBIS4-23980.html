			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Ugandan Government has decided to open  embassies in South Africa and Japan. This was disclosed today  by the minister of finance and economic planning, Mr. Joshua  Mayanja-Nkangi, when he was presenting the 1994-95 budget in the  National Resistance Council. Mr. Mayanja-Nkangi disclosed that  he was the one who announced the ban on trade with South Africa  in 1964, when he was minister of commerce, in protest against  the country's white minority regime's policy of apartheid.

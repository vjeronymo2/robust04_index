			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Mideast talks end amid criticism of US proposals THE TENTH round of Middle East peace negotiations ended in Washington yesterday with little sign of progress and both Israelis and Palestinians criticising a US document aimed at bridging their differences. Some hours before the final session of talks began two Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a bus in Jerusalem, wounding three people and then killing the woman driver of a car they later hijacked. The two Palestinians were later shot dead by Israeli troops at a road block near Bethlehem. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said the attack, the most serious since the closure of the occupied territories in late March, was aimed at destroying the peace negotiations. He believed that the shootings had been ordered by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, two of the radical groups in the West Bank and Gaza opposed to the peace process. In Washington, Palestinian negotiators expressed 'extreme displeasure' at the latest American proposal aimed a finding common ground on a declaration of principles to guide negotiations over an interim self-governing authority for the occupied territories. Mr Rabin, who is visiting Paris, said he was disappointed at the changes the US had made to the first document it submitted at the end of the ninth round of talks. But there was still room for discussion, he said, and was confident that negotiations and contacts would continue. 'Both the Israeli and Arab side have passed the point of no return on the road to peace.' Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said the latest US document offered no basis for negotiation. She added that it violated the terms of reference for the peace process, but would be further studied by the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis. One of the key obstacles to have arisen again during the past three weeks in Washington has been the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians insist that east Jerusalem, captured by Israel during the 1967 war, has to be within the competence of the interim self-governing authority which will be established before negotiations open on the final status of the occupied territories. The Israeli government has said that the talks have no future if the Palestinians continue to raise the issue of Jerusalem because the future of the unified city is not negotiable. No date has been set for the next round of talks but Mr Dennis Ross, the US peace talks co-ordinator, will visit the Middle East with State Department officials next week to continue contacts. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is also considering a visit to the region in the next few weeks. The negotiations between Israel, Syria and Lebanon, also ended yesterday without any hint of a breakthrough.</p>

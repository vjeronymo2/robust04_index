			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 300 ACTIVISTS SQUARE OFF ON ABORTION IN FULLERTON;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION: EACH SIDE CLAIMS VICTORY IN RALLIES STAGED AT MORE THAN 20  CLINICS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES.  </P> <P> Hundreds of anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates staged side-by-side rallies  at a women's clinic Saturday, culminating a morning of protests and  counter-protests at more than 20 clinics throughout Los Angeles and Orange  counties.  </P> <P> Police estimated the crowd at about 300 and said it was equally divided between  abortion-rights activists and Operation Rescue abortion opponents. But each  camp estimated its own group at several hundred more than that.  </P> <P> Pro-choice advocates rallied in front of the Women's Center on Orangethorpe  Avenue singing, "Joy to the world, choice has come" and other modified  Christmas carols. Nearby, anti-abortion protesters sat and sometimes kneeled in  entrance ways as they prayed and sang hymns. There were no arrests or reports  of violence.  </P> <P> Earlier, anti-abortion activists had skipped from clinic to clinic, trying to  elude pro-choice advocates, who were tracking them throughout the morning.  </P> <P> Both sides claimed victory at rallies that began shortly after noon.  </P> <P> "Our numbers are growing and growing and growing," said Ellie Smeal, president  of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, a national abortion-rights group based  in Los Angeles. A crowd that sported blue pro-choice buttons, signs and  T-shirts cheered her remarks.  </P> <P> "We are determined to make this a pro-choice assembly and a pro-choice  governor's mansion," said Smeal, past president of the National Organization  for Women. Moments later, former San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein, a  candidate in the governor's race, came to the makeshift podium.  </P> <P> "We will stand shoulder to shoulder until we have our right to protect our  reproductive freedom," Feinstein said. The Roe vs. Wade decision by the Supreme  Court established the legality of abortions in 1973. But in the court's  decision in the Webster case earlier this year, which gave states broader  powers, the abortion issue "was thrown to a political arena and the vagrancies  of state legislatures, which are all controlled by men," she said.  </P> <P> About 20 feet away and a short while later, Russ Neal, director of the Southern  California Operation Rescue, addressed his followers, who carried graphic  posters and signs reading "Stop Killing Babies," as well as prayer books and  Bibles.  </P> <P> "This was a very successful rescue," Neal said. "We have heard that they had a  full schedule of abortions today, and we got here before they opened and before  those children who would have been killed were killed."  </P> <P> Pro-choice and Operation Rescue forces gave conflicting accounts of whether the  demonstration had affected the day's business at the Fullerton clinic. Owners  of the clinic could not be reached for comment. Kathy Spillar, national  coordinator for the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said the clinic had planned  to remain closed Saturday and that no abortions had been scheduled at the  clinic, which offers a variety of health services, most of which do not pertain  to abortion.  </P> <P> But Carla Black, a member of Operation Rescue who described herself as a  counselor, said that she had persuaded one pregnant woman on her way to the  clinic to reconsider her plans for an abortion. Black said the woman was taken  by other Operation Rescue workers to the Crisis Pregnancy Center, which she  said was an anti-abortion center that helps pregnant women.  </P> <P> The day began early for both anti-abortion and pro-choice activists. Spillar  said more than 500 pro-choice activists had been dispatched by 5 a.m. to 26  clinics throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties that had been considered  potential targets of Operation Rescue. The anti-abortion group had earlier  announced it was planning a "rescue" -- during which members try to form  blockades and keep clinics from opening -- but, as in the past, Operation  Rescue leaders kept secret the precise targets until early Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Before converging in Fullerton, Operation Rescue sent forces to clinics in El  Monte, Long Beach and Tustin. Pro-choice activists said patients were scheduled  for early morning appointments and thus managed to avoid protesters at the  Doctor's Family Planning Clinic on Irvine Boulevard in Tustin. The patients  were inside before 8 a.m., while Operation Rescue workers did not arrive until  about half an hour later. In Long Beach, patients were also treated as  scheduled, pro-choice activists said. They added that the El Monte clinic was  not scheduled to open Saturday.  </P> <P> By 9 a.m., most of the day's activities were focused in Fullerton, where  pro-choice and anti-abortion activists staged rallies and then lingered until  later in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "I'm always fearful people won't cross over the Orange curtain, but Los Angeles  and Orange County coalesced today in big numbers," said Barbara Jackson, a  member of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Orange County. "Pro-choice people are  going to support women's rights anywhere in the country, even Orange County."  </P> <P> Demonstrations were less peaceful in Brookline, Mass., where 60 Operation  Rescue activists were arrested for blocking patients from entering the Repro  Associates clinic. Authorities videotaped the anti-abortion protesters and said  they would use the tapes in a pending civil suit against Operation Rescue. The  anti-abortion group has been charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organization law by Brookline officials, who hope to recoup overtime costs for  police assigned to maintain order at the protests.  </P></p>

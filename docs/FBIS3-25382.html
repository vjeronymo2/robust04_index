			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The South African Trade Mission in Swaziland this  week on Thursday [17 February] ceases to be a trade mission and  becomes a fully fledged embassy. This, therefore, means that  the South African trade representative, Mr. Heath, becomes the  first South African ambassador to Swaziland, and Mr. Sam Malinga  becomes Swaziland's first ambassador to South Africa after  presentation of letters of credence by both ambassadors.  Formalities to this effect will be finalized on Thursday when  the South African trade representative meets the minister of  foreign affairs, Mr. Solomon Dlamini.    Also to call on the foreign affairs minister on Thursday  will  be the United States ambassador designate to Swaziland, Dr. John  Sprott.</p>

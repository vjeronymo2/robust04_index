			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY FINDS WIDE SUPPORT FOR BUSH STANCE ON THE NEA;  </P> <P> OPINION: SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT 93% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT  TO VIEW CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORKS.  </P> <P> The year-old controversy over artistic freedom and the National Endowment for  the Arts has captured the American consciousness to an extent actors in the  debate may not have thought possible, a new national survey released Thursday  appears to show.  </P> <P> The new survey -- of 1,200 people questioned at random by telephone between  March 14 and 26 -- shows that in the fight over whether Congress should place  controls on the content of artworks the NEA may support, 61% support the NEA  and the Bush Administration, which oppose the restrictions.  </P> <P> The survey also found that 93% of Americans believe the public has a right to  view controversial artworks and 80% disagree with the contention that nudity in  art is usually pornographic.  </P> <P> However, a majority of respondents -- 53% -- agreed that art should be censored  if it offends a majority of people and 86% said art galleries should notify  parents if work they display is unsuitable for viewing by children. A total of  74% agreed that censorship in general "is not the American way" and 81% opposed  laws limiting freedom of artistic expression.  </P> <P> The poll was sponsored by the liberal People for the American Way group and  conducted by Research &amp; Forecasts Inc., a New York opinion survey  consultant.  </P> <P> With support for federal government funding of the arts holding steady at about  2-to-1 -- nearly the same ratio as in a similar poll conducted by The Times  last fall -- the new survey results show that the months of controversy over  arts funding in Washington and elsewhere has attracted the attention of a  majority of Americans.  </P> <P> While three quarters of a sample of 2,217 Americans last September said they  had never heard of the controversy, 57% now say they are familiar with it.  Moreover, the political battle has boosted the arts endowment's name  recognition rate to 76% -- the same proportion familiar with the endowment's  key congressional opponent, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> Only 30% of the respondents in the new nationwide poll believe government  funding for avant garde art should be stopped because some of it is  controversial, and 66% disagreed with the contention that Congress should cut  off funding for controversial art projects or shows.  </P> <P> The new opinion poll was released simultaneously at press briefings in  Washington and Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, People for the American Way also  announced a newspaper advertising campaign intended to target Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), a leader of anti-arts endowment forces in the House.  </P> <P> Full-page advertisements -- depicting an empty picture frame over the headline  "Is This the Only Kind of Art Rep. Rohrabacher Would Be Happy With?" -- are to  be placed in several Southern California newspapers, said Michael Hudson,  Western vice-president of People for the American Way.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher criticized the People for the American Way poll, contending that  "many of the questions were worded in a way that had no relationship to the  battle that's going on over the NEA." Rohrabacher took issue with the poll's  focus on censorship. "If someone asks me if I'm in favor of censorship,"  Rohrabacher said, "I emphatically say, 'No.' "  </P> <P> Helms did not respond to requests for comment. The NEA also declined to  comment.  </P> <P> "Americans overwhelmingly reject censorship of the arts and support the NEA,"  Hudson said. "Rep. Rohrabacher has taken the leading role in the House calling  for the abolishment of the NEA. If we are to win this battle, we must energize  and mobilize the creative community here in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The new survey also found that:  </P> <P> * Attendance at arts events is more popular than going to live sporting events  nationwide, with 72% of respondents reporting attending arts events in the last  year compared to 53% who went to sporting events. Arts attendance averaged six  events per year compared to 4.1 for sports.  </P> <P> * A total of 68% endorse the concept of government funding of the arts, with  30% opposed and 2% unsure. However, 60% also agreed that the NEA should be held  responsible for the content of artworks it supports and a slim majority -- 51%  -- agreed that artists who get government grants should "sign an oath regarding  the content of their art."  </P> <P> * The arts endowment had a higher positive opinion rating than Helms -- 30%  versus 11%. A total of 69% disagreed with the notion that the NEA is a waste of  taxpayers' money and 83% agreed with the statement that the NEA "serves a very  useful purpose for American society."  </P> <P> * Nearly a quarter of respondents favor increasing the NEA budget -- $171  million this year -- and 56% favor keeping budget levels as they are. Only 13%  advocated cutting NEA funding.  </P> <P> The poll sample had an average age of 40. It was 52% female and 48% male. The  sample was split almost evenly among Republicans, Democrats and people who  identified themselves as independent. Research &amp; Forecasts said the poll  had a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.  </P></p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: System has potential to transform the way we live Sir, In his article on road congestion, Richard Tomkins implies that restraining road usage is necessary just because paralysis is imminent. The real problem with car ownership is that nobody wants to apply economic principles to it. There is a glut of road usage in some parts of the system and there soon will be in others. Economics teaches us that therefore the price is too low. The pricing system for all transport is fundamentally tilted in favour of road transport in general and private road transport in particular. The only way to restore the situation is to charge a realistic price for the roads at the point of use. Modern electronic road pricing does just that. The first move should be on all toll crossings. Every user fitting such a device would not only get through the Dartford tunnel quicker, there could also be a discount. Next it could be used to collect car-park charges both off and on street. It could also be used to pay parking fines - even towing charges. The idea would be to find lots of uses giving the motorist the benefit of convenience and saved time before extending pricing. It could next be used on crowded motorways and in congested cities. All this would develop confidence in the system and gain wide acceptance. Not spending massive sums on car ownership would release immense funds for other uses. The benefits in time-saving, safety and environment would be felt throughout society. Electronic road pricing has the potential to transform the way we live. Its implementation is only a matter of time. Richard Graham, 26 Chipstead Street, SW6</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) gave assurances at a news  conference that the foreign ministers of the European Union [EU]  will meet again next Tuesday [15 March], because "we do not give  up so quickly." Kinkel regretted that the breakthrough "in the  vexatious fishing issue" has failed because of Spain. It is not  justified to speak of a crisis, even in view of the differences  of opinion with Great Britain concerning the majorities in a  16-member EU. Kinkel appealed to the European Parliament in  Strasbourg not to let the procedure for membership fail because  of the pressure of time before the new elections. He is  convinced that the negotiations with Norway will be concluded  successfully.</p>

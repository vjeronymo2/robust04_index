			<p>BFN     [Text] National Defense Chief of Staff Jorge Patricio  Arancibia has stated that the Armed Forces favor compulsory  military service because it helps to safeguard society.    Vice Admiral Arancibia said military service enables youths  to acquire values and principles, and helps them to understand  professional training.    Arancibia said of the 121,000 who registered in 1993, only  29,400 were drafted. He added that the Army and the Air Force  have already reduced military service to one year, while the  Navy is studying this possibility.    Asked about the Argentine decision to create a professional  Army, he said the Chilean Armed Forces should also study this  issue. He declined to say if the Argentine decision constitutes  a threat because Argentina has yet to implement this decision.  Arancibia admitted, however, that a professional Army is more  effective than a nonprofessional Army although it is more costly.</p>

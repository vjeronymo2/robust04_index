			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Blood centres under threat The number of blood transfusion centres in England will be cut from 15 to 10 under reorganisation proposals announced yesterday. Officials of the National Blood Authority said the cuts would lead to a small number of job losses - but unions said more than 1,000 of the service's 5,200 staff were at risk. A strategic review of blood services has produced 35 proposals aimed at increasing efficiency and improving the supply of blood products to the National Health Service. These include managing the service around three administrative zones based in London, Bristol and Leeds, and organising stockholding so that hospitals receive emergency deliveries within two hours. Under the proposals testing and processing of blood would be consolidated at 10 centres. Lancaster, Plymouth, Liverpool, Oxford and Brentwood, in Essex, would eventually be amalgamated with other centres. Mr John Adey, chief executive of the authority, said consolidation at fewer centres would allow more efficient use of new technology and specialist staff, and enhance safety and quality procedures. Formal consultation on the proposals will start next month but Mr Kevin Greene, national officer of Unison, the public service union, said it was 'clear that the key decisions about closure have already been taken'. He said unions were worried that the proposals were driven by a need to cut costs and might put public safety at risk. Centres operated on narrow margins of supply and the closure of facilities was a 'highly risky game'. Mr Adey said the proposed amalgamations of centres would not affect the deployment of mobile teams around the country.</p>

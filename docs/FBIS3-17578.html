Yeltsin is supposed to come back to Moscow today  or tomorrow (this weekend, that is) from Sochi where, they  maintain, he even took a plunge in the 10-degree seawater.    Yet another cold bath awaits him in Moscow. Radio Liberty,  referring to U.S. television people working in the capital and  painstakingly compiling a video library, has revealed a  sensation: The small president-on-vacation story is the product  of simple editing. One shot edited into a small video report  was untraditional and out of keeping with the general tenor,  showing the president wearing a suit against the backdrop of a  swimming pool. They insist that the shot is extraneous and comes  from footage dating back to ...September 1993. It is not clear  who needed this gimmick and why. The odd thing, however, is  that the story was not seen again in later news programs, and  foreign companies begging for the tape for personal purposes  were left empty-handed.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Brooke Tool passes final dividend after Pounds 1.3m loss THE SHARE price of Brooke Tool Engineering almost halved to 7 1/4 p on Friday as it announced a Pounds 2.6m downturn to a loss of Pounds 1.3m, the passing of the final dividend and a change in top management. By mutual agreement Mr Idris Jones has stood down as managing director and will not seek re-election as a director. He has been with the group for 21 years. Mr John Dashper has been appointed chief executive. The group, which as its main activity supplies consumables to the engineering industry, saw its profit fall to Pounds 80,000 at the operating level, compared with Pounds 2.39m last time. Turnover fell from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 25.3m as UK sales dropped 20 per cent with margins in certain areas moving towards 'unacceptable levels'. However, exports rose 14 per cent and now represent 30 per cent of total sales. Charged in the loss were relocation and redundancy costs of Pounds 408,000 and interest payments of Pounds 968,000 (Pounds 1.09m). The workforce was reduced by 18 per cent in the year and by a further 10 per cent to date. As part of the reorganisation and rationalisation, plans had been made to dispose of certain non-core assets to enable gearing to be restored to a more acceptable level and one major sale was being negotiated. Many product areas had remained strong and maintained market share. Losses per share came to 2.5p (earnings 2.2p). Omission of the final dividend means the total is 0.25p (1.225p).</p>

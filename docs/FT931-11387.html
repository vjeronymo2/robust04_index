			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC ministers fail to agree import curbs EC FOREIGN and trade ministers failed yesterday to agree a compromise on lifting or harmonising national import restrictions, adding to confusion about the treatment of non-EC goods in the single European market. Britain, Germany and the Netherlands may be breaking EC law by unilaterally trying to find ways round the problem, according to Community officials. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, warned yesterday that unilateral action to extend or abolish quotas risked 'undermining a unified (EC) trade policy'. The question of what to do about outstanding national quotas is linked to controversial European Commission proposals to streamline the procedure for imposing anti-dumping duties on non-EC imports. Liberal northern member states like Britain, Germany and the Netherlands object to the Brussels plan; they believe it would give the Commission greater power to impose duties. Yesterday, they attacked Sir Leon's compromise, which would have allowed a simple majority of member states to reject proposed duties. Sir Leon rejected claims that the Commission was trying to grab more power for itself, and said Brussels was trying to speed and improve the procedure for imposing duties and trade safeguard weapons. Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK trade minister, said after the meeting: 'If the Commission lays before the council a strong and well-argued case for an anti-dumping or safeguard measure, they will get support.' Failure to agree how to use such weapons means a legal void still exists on the question of national quotas, still in place in many EC countries despite the lifting of internal EC border controls on January 1. Goods covered include textiles and footwear from 'state trading countries' like China and North Korea. In the worst case, that could mean an import ban or reimposition of internal controls to try to stop cheap imports coming across internal borders. In principle, member states wanting to take temporary measures to fill the legal void have to apply to the Commission for permission to extend or abolish quotas. Germany, which has gone for full liberalisation, and Britain and the Netherlands, which want to extend their licensing regimes, have not yet asked for permission, according to EC officials. Foreign and trade ministers may get another chance to discuss the issue next month. Meanwhile, it will be debated again by national officials.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Setback for Bush as challenger beats poll hopes: Tsongas takes New Hampshire lead for Democratic nomination PRESIDENT George Bush suffered a serious setback to his re-election campaign early today after a surprisingly strong showing by Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing challenger for the Republican party's nomination, in voting in New Hampshire. Exit polls indicated a narrow victory for Mr Bush, with Mr Buchanan likely to capture more than 40 per cent of the votes in the republican primary election in the state. In the race for the Democratic party's nomination, former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas was heading for victory, with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas expected to run a strong second. New Hampshire was the first real test of the strength for candidates seeking party endorsement for the US presidential election in November. The conservative eastern state has a tradition of political upsets and voting yesterday was no exception. Republicans and independents in the state appeared determined - through the Republican primary - to register a protest vote against Mr Bush, who has come under fierce attack for failing to deal with the recession-hit economy in the New England region. Mr Buchanan's powerful showing would easily allow him to continue his campaign, increasing the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable in the November election. Mr Buchanan, a television commentator and former speech writer to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, appeared to have swung large blocks of Republican votes with a platform of tax cuts and an 'America First' message of protectionism and neo-isolationism. Mr Buchanan appears ready to continue the fight next month in Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. For Mr Bush, this raises the danger of a split within the Republican party. The White House early today said Mr Bush was delighted with his win and it blamed his weak showing on the state of the New Hampshire economy. Mr Bush said he understood 'the message of dissatisfaction' and pledged to campaign vigorously against Mr Buchanan in the weeks ahead. But the result was a humiliating one for an incumbent president who only six months ago appeared invincible. Most observers said the president needed a two-to-one margin to stave off the challenge from Mr Buchanan who launched his campaign only ten days ago. The unexpected Republican result threatens to overshadow the Democratic results, which showed Mr Tsongas performing less well than expected. Mr Tsongas, a pro-business liberal, has become an unlikely front-runner for Democratic nomination. But leading Democrats have questioned his appeal beyond his regional base and he needed a solid win to deter other candidates from entering the race. Exit polls suggested that Mr Clinton, coming a close second, had overcome damage caused by unsubstantiated charges of adultery and draft dodging during the Vietnam war. Mr Clinton said early today: 'New Hampshire has made Bill Clinton the comeback kid.' The battle for third place in the Democratic race appeared tight between Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. Both needed at least a third place to continue their campaign. Fed eases pressure on banks' profits, Page 5</p>

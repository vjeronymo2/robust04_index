			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate director remuneration in conversions of healthy mutuals because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk and shareholders' votes are dispositive under the ``corporate waste'' doctrine. A law firm, commenting on behalf of a state thrift industry trade group, also noted that compensation benefits are not a safety-and-soundness concern if the institution meets the applicable capital requirements. In addition, it stated that a ``uniformity of benefits between state- and OTS-regulated conversions'' is necessary to assure the end of ``regulatory arbitrage''. A state regulator (and several other commenters) suggested that the FDIC and OTS publish joint MRP guidelines permitting or prohibiting MRPs, along with specific rules therefore. It noted that ``proper resolution of the MRP issue will have a substantial impact on fairness to depositors in conversions''. One savings bank commented that ``when an institution contemplates going public for the right reasons (expansion, market share, competitive advantage) the benefits should go to those willing to risk their careers (board and management team) or their capital (shareholders) not to the faceless non-entity group known as the existing depositors''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A consumer group stated that the FDIC should impose specific limits on MRPs and stock options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon consideration of the comments, the Board has decided to include in the final rule the requirements in the Proposed Rule on insider benefits. The Board does not disagree that management of converting institutions should receive reasonable benefit from the conversion because such insiders are responsible for the bank's success and will undertake additional and perhaps more difficult challenges upon the bank's conversion to stock form. While the Board believes that management and directors/trustees would have increased responsibilities as a public company, the Board believes that, in most cases, market-based management compensation should be determined by the stockholders after the conversion is completed. Such a determination is required by the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the Proposed Rule would have required that all MRPs be approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following the conversion. The FDIC received several comments questioning whether stockholder approval could be obtained at a special meeting, instead of an annual meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They noted that, with the existence of securities and corporate law requirements, there is no need for the FDIC to regulate either the timing or type of the shareholder meeting at which shareholders vote on proposed insider benefits. In response to these comments, the Board has determined that such approval may be obtained at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion. The FDIC believes that the six-month period will give the marketplace sufficient time to obtain and consider the financial data and the shareholders sufficient time to become familiar with the finances and operations of the converted bank in order to make an informed decision in voting to adopt such plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The restrictions in the final rule on MRPs do not include specific percentage limitations. The FDIC believes that the restrictions in the final rule will help safeguard against potential management self-interest in mutual-to-stock conversions. The FDIC also will continue to look to MRP percentage limitations in the OTS regulations, as well as in the applicable state law and regulations, as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC will presume that MRPs that do not conform with the applicable OTS MRP limitations constitute excessive insider benefits and thereby evidence a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility. Bank management would have the burden of convincing the FDIC otherwise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Eligibility Record Date, Priority to Depositors Residing in the Bank's Local Community (Local Depositor Preference), Priority of ESOPs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Eligibility Record Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Rule included a requirement that the eligibility record date for determining the stock subscription purchase priority for depositors of a State Savings Bank be set at no less than one year prior to the date of the board of directors'/trustees' adoption of the plan of conversion (from mutual to stock form). As indicated in the Proposed Rule, the Board believes that, in order for a board of directors/trustees of a State Savings Bank to carry out its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board must assure an equitable and lawful conversion process. From the numerous comments received and from a review of proposed and completed conversions, it is apparent that so-called ``professional depositors'', who place funds in mutual banks and savings associations in order to gain a purchase priority if the institution converts to stock form, have reaped substantial profits on conversions of mutual institutions. A proper exercise of fiduciary responsibilities toward the bank and its longer-term depositors dictates that ``professional depositors'' not be allowed to experience windfall gains in conversions. Requiring that the eligibility record date be no less than one year prior to the board's adoption of the plan of conversion will help assure that longer-term depositors are more likely than professional depositors to benefit from the stock purchase priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Observer: Over-connected Britain's big insurance companies are enthusiastic supporters of non-executive directors playing a forceful role in a company's affairs. Indeed, when it comes to recruiting blue-chip names themselves, they vie with the big banks for the most sparkling connections. Yesterday it was General Accident's turn to add a couple more trophy names to its letterhead. Sir Peter Middleton, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury now carving out a second career at Barclays, is joined by Louise Botting, the ex-presenter of Radio 4's Money Box programme. They enter a boardroom which includes the Earl of Airlie (lord chamberlain of the Queen's Household), the Earl of Mansfield (first Crown Estates Commissioner), Lord MacFarlane (one of Scotland's best-connected businessmen), Sir Nicholas Goodison (chairman of the TSB), Sir Anthony Cleaver (chairman of IBM UK) and Sir David Nickson (a former CBI president), to name but a few. If non-executive directors are really such a good idea, it is difficult to understand why insurance companies and banks have made so many mistakes and plunged into such terrible losses.</p>

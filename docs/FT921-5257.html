			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: A fair deal on the cards 'IF IT was going for a song but it won't play a note, where do you stand?' ask the posters, depicting a sale-tagged radio, which appeared this week in north-east England. In its latest campaign to make the consumer rights message less worthy and more accessible, the Office of Fair Trading is currently running an experimental Square Deal Week in Tyne and Wear. All the county's 600,000 households are receiving through their doors a credit card-sized Consumer Rights card. You are entitled to your money back, it says, when: There is a major fault - even on sale goods. The goods don't do what they are supposed to do. The goods don't fit their description. But you are not if: You've changed your mind. Clothes don't fit (as long as the correct size is shown). The goods have been mistreated. You were able to see the faults before purchase. You have already accepted a credit note. The OFT is spending Pounds 250,000 - more than fifth of its total annual publicity budget - on the promotion. It will be monitoring the impact of the campaign, its most intensive ever, to see whether it should be launched elsewhere. Square Deal Week is the latest example of the OFT's move over the past three years towards a more populist approach to consumer rights. Tyne and Wear was chosen for the experiment because of its relatively high proportion of socio-economic groups C2, D and E, its strong local media and high concentration of shopping meccas, including Newcastle's city centre Eldon Square and Gateshead's out of town MetroCentre, the largest of their types in Europe.</p>

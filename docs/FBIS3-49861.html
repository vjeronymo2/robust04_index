			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eli Paloka article: "Campaign of Deception by Belgrade's </F> Bootlickers"]    [Text] On 15 January some of the Democratic Alliance [AD]  leaders organized a political meeting in Shkoder. Various  sources report this to have been a "meeting of selected  intellectuals" aspiring for pure democracy and political ethics.  However, this meeting used the language of gutter politics. As  at all meetings of this kind, politicians are at pains to air  their ideas and beliefs, while the audience is ready to hear the  alternatives offered to them and choose between them. Some may  approve of what a political group says, and some may not,  because an audience has its own preferences on various issues;  that is democracy. Unfortunately, the AD leaders, once so  determined to defend diversity of opinion within the Democratic  Party, did not permit any reply to the insults and deceptions  they hurled into the auditorium. The result was that a  26-year-old man became the victim of a crime that was in any  event intolerable. How was the quarrel that concluded in  Gjovalin Cekini's murder provoked? Well known for their  bombastic statements and deceptions, the AD leaders exploited  the platform to spit venom against those who govern the Albanian  state today. Not only this, but reports state that their desire  to oppose everything that the Albanian state does today has led  them into new political blunders. Thus, following (baseless)  accusations that "today's rulers are sunk in corruption" (and it  was G. Pashko who said this), or accusations against S. Berisha,  the AD leaders came out in defense of Nano (they once voted  against him). Nevertheless, it is said that the culmination  earns with the statements made about Serbia. "We have neither  ever killed the Serbs nor have they killed us." Meanwhile, "the  democratic government tied us to the Muslims and spoiled our  relations with our neighbors." It seems that the "bootlickers'"  visit to Belgrade was not simply an aberration on the part of  the AD's leaders. Imami said that "we went to Belgrade to avert  war." Is it not a wonder that what the whole of Europe has not  managed to avert was averted by the AD with the powerful  assistance of N. Hoti? Anything can be done with the "youthful  optimism" of the AD leaders and N. Hoti's cosmic intelligence.    Annoyed by such statements, some of the people in the hall  responded and objected. This also happened because the AD  leaders did not reply to all the questions put to them in  writing, and the police intervened.    After the objections, the hall erupted in confusion. The  irritated section of the audience, about half of it, who could  no longer put up with the insults and deceptions about the  "blank check," went outside. Meanwhile, others departed at the  end of the meeting and followed, from the theater to the Radio  Shkoder building, the person who had argued with the meeting's  chairmen, hitting him. Some of the latter's friends were  nearby, and a quarrel between the two sides broke out. One of  them was armed, and fired at the victim in the course of the  quarrel. Thus, a 26-year-old became the victim of the AD's  hooligan politics. The responsible authorities must investigate  this tragic incident. It seems that the deputies without an  electorate have begun a campaign of deception in support of the  call for new elections issued by the Socialist Party leaders.    They have stated that they might win 15-20 percent in the  next elections, but if they continue in this way they will only  increase the number of their opponents.</p>

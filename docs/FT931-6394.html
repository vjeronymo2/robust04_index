			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Gilts sale may affect PSBR funding HEAVY purchasing of gilt-edged securities by banks and building societies in January will increase pressure on the government to alter the rules by which it finances the public sector borrowing requirement. Official money supply figures from the Bank of England show that gilts sales to banks and building societies in January totalled Pounds 2.84bn, accounting for more than three-quarters of total gilts sales in January. Sales to the non-bank private sector were just under Pounds 500m. The current 'full-fund' rule means that the government does not recognise gilts sold to UK banks and building societies as contributing to the funding of the PSBR. This forces it to sell an equivalent amount to the non-bank sector. One argument against altering the full-fund rule was that the banking sector previously showed little interest in UK government stock. However, the sharp fall in inflation to an annual rate of 1.7 per cent in January, along with the drop in short term interest rates to 6 per cent, could increase the attraction of gilts for UK banks. Banks purchased most of the gilts in January. They bought Pounds 2.48bn while building societies bought Pounds 358m. The private sector bought Pounds 497m.</p>

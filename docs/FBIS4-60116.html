			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking in Gaza, Nabil Sha'th said that joint  patrols by the Palestinians and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  would begin today. He noted that the main mission of the  Palestinian police right now is to launch an investigation into  yesterday's attack. We are very concerned, Sha'th said, because  the Palestinians are responsible for whatever happens within the  autonomous areas. He was speaking with reporters in Gaza after  meeting Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq and the head of the  Shin Bet.</p>

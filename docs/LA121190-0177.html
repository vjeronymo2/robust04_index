			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KATHY BATES DELIGHTED WITH ROLE AS OBSESSED NURSE  </P> <P> One of the most terrifying creatures on the big screen this year is the one  brought to life by Kathy Bates.  </P> <P> The diminutive actress plays an obsessed fan named Annie Wilkes in director Rob  Reiner's screen version of Stephen King's novel "Misery."  </P> <P> James Caan is writer Paul Sheldon, whose legs and an arm are mutilated in an  automobile accident. Bates, as Nurse Wilkes, rescues Sheldon and becomes his  sole link with the outside world as he recuperates in her isolated home high in  the Rockies.  </P> <P> Although Bates is required to look her worst throughout the film, she said she  didn't hesitate when offered the part.  </P> <P> "When my agent called to say Rob wanted me, I told her she'd better read the  book," Bates said, smiling. "It wasn't exactly a glamorous Hollywood role.  </P> <P> "Rob had seen my work on the stage. Thank goodness he is a theatergoer. I met  with him, and I was confident I could play the part the way he wanted it. After  reading a couple of scenes together, he said, 'Well, let's do it.'  </P> <P> "Annie Wilkes is an extremely disturbed woman, and very sad. She's pathetic, a  woman I wanted to play after reading the book.  </P> <P> "When Rob called out of the blue and told me I had the part if I wanted it, I  couldn't have been happier. It was Rob who really unlocked all the secrets of  Annie for me. He put me on the right track of creating someone who was truly  frightening instead of a monster of some kind.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased with the way it turned out. Stephen King told me he liked it."  </P> <P> Bates until now played small supporting roles in such films as "Men Don't  Leave," "Arthur 2," "Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"  and "Straight Time."  </P></p>

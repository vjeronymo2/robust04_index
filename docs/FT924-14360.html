			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Beta GEM raising Pounds 13.5m to expand As there are currently favourable opportunities for investment in emerging markets, Beta Global Emerging Markets Investment Trust is seeking to raise Pounds 13.5m net through a placing and open offer. Some Pounds 10.5m will come from a placing of 10.8m C shares at 100p, and an additional Pounds 2.97m from an offer of 3m C shares to existing share and warrant holders. Net proceeds and the investments made with them will initially be accounted for as a separate pool of assets. The net asset value of existing ordinary shares will be unaffected by the introduction of C shares. The C shares will convert into ordinary, with new warrants being allotted on the basis of 1-for-5, either when at least 80 per cent of the assets attributable to the C shares have been invested, or on May 28 next if earlier.</p>

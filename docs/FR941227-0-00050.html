			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this time, the IRS is not planning to issue a revenue procedure setting forth a safe harbor rule for valuing inventory. However, consideration will be given to any safe harbor rule taxpayers may suggest in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Section 1374(d)(8) Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax if an S corporation acquires assets in a transaction where the S corporation's basis in the assets is determined by reference to their basis in the hands of a C corporation (a section 1374(d)(8) transaction) and, thereafter, the S corporation disposes of the assets. The proposed regulations provide that a separate determination of tax under section 1374 must be made for the assets acquired in each section 1374(d)(8) transaction. Thus, an S corporation's section 1374 attributes held on the day it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation held on that day. Similarly, section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation acquired in the same transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commentators argue that restrictions on the use of section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction should not be greater than the restrictions that would apply if the attributes were acquired by a C corporation in a similar transaction. For example, commentators contend that an S corporation's net operating loss carryforwards when it changed from C to S status should be allowed to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on assets the S corporation acquires in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction, subject to all statutory limits on their use including the anti-trafficking rules of sections 382, 383, and 384.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations retain the rules in the proposed regulations. Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax on the ``net recognized built-in gain attributable to'' the assets acquired in a particular transaction. The legislative history under section 1374 states that ``each acquisition of assets from a C corporation is subject to a separate determination of the amount of net built-in gain *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Effective Date and Additional Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that the section 1374 final regulations will generally apply for taxable years ending on or after the date the final regulations are published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , but only where the return is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after that date. The final regulations retain the effective date in the proposed regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that if a taxpayer subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations, contributes an asset to a partnership under section 721(a) in contemplation of making an S election or during the recognition period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation still owned the asset. This provision applies as of the effective date of section 1374. Commentators argue that the rule should apply only for contributions to partnerships after the proposed regulations were issued. The final regulations retain the rule in the proposed regulations to prevent an abuse of section 1374.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that the rules in Announcement 86&hyph;128, 1986&hyph;51 I.R.B. 22, and Notice 90&hyph;27, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 336, apply to taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations. Instead of referring to the rules in the Notice and the Announcement, the final regulations set forth some of the rules contained in those documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commentators suggest that the regulations allow taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations, to elect to be subject to the regulations. The final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because of the burden of administering elections and because taxpayers not generally subject to the regulations nonetheless may take positions consistent with the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Mark S. Jennings of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1_INCOME TAXES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Paragraph 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding the following entries in numerical order to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 26 U.S.C. 7805 *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1374&hyph;1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;2 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;3 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;4 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;5 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;6 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;7 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;8 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;9 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1374&hyph;10 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1374(e) and 337(d). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An undesignated center heading is added immediately following &sect;1.1375&hyph;1 to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1374&blank;Before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.1374&hyph;1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Redesignated as &sect;1.1374&hyph;1A] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

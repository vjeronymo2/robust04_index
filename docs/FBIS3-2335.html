Proceeding from improving the quality of troop leaders and  strengthening management of the armed forces in the new period  form the new situation in the building of the armed forces and  the objective demand of the building of the contingent of  cadres. Cadres at all levels, grass-roots cadres in particular,  are leaders of management of the armed forces and people who  carry out practical work in this respect. If cadres lack  dedication, do not have a strong sense of responsibility, are  not willing to do management work, or do not know how to carry  out management work because their management ability cannot meet  the needs of the new situation, it will not be possible to  properly carry out various kinds of management work. Leaders  and leading organs at all levels must earnestly make greater  efforts to adopt effective measures to improve the quality of  troop leaders.    To strengthen ideological education of troop leaders, to  deepen the dedication and the sense of responsibility of troop  leaders in building the armed forces, and to encourage cadre  willingness to carry out management work are basic engineering  steps to improve the quality of troop leaders. Viewed from the  present situation of the armed forces, both the problems of  cadres not being willing to manage and cadres not knowing how to  manage exist, but the former is the major one. Therefore, it is  necessary to carry out powerful ideological education in light  of the actual ideological problems of cadres. It is necessary  for cadres to take a correct attitude toward the soldiers,  establish the concept of cherishing and understanding soldiers  with great enthusiasm, show concern and care for soldiers,  understand and respect soldiers, and become close friends with  solders, thus acquiring the qualifications for leading troops.  It is necessary to proceed from the nature and purpose of the  armed forces and and from education on function, and to arouse  the sense of mission and the spirit of dedication among cadres  so they will fulfill their duties and do a good job in managing  the armed forces. On the other hand, leaders and leading organs  at all levels should show concern for cadres and energetically  solve practical problems for cadres, particularly practical  problems of grass-roots cadres. All reasonable requests and  problems which can be granted or solved should be  enthusiastically and actively granted or solved in order to  create conditions for cadres to wholeheartedly manage the armed  forces. We should believe that all our cadres, directly  nurtured by the party and the armed forces, have grown to  maturity and they have deep feelings toward the armed forces.  Only if thorough and meticulous ideological work is carried  out, as many practical problems are solved as possible, and  cadres are used in a fair and rational manner, the enthusiasm of  cadres can be aroused and the problem of being not willing to  manage can also be gradually solved.    The issue of not knowing how to manage is also important in  improving the quality of troop leaders. At present, management  of the armed forces is faced with many new tasks. It is  necessary to guide cadres to strengthen study and exploration of  these tasks in light of changes and characteristics of soldiers  in the new period, grasp objective laws, integrate development  of the fine traditions of the armed forces with modern  management, and constantly improve methods for leading troops.  The leadership at all levels should do a good job in training  grass-roots cadres at their posts in a planned manner,  organizing cadres to study the good traditions of management of  the armed forces, acquiring knowledge and study methods of  modern management, and, in light of the difficulties and major  problems in management of the armed forces, exploring measures  to deal with them, summing up experience, and improving the  ability of leading troops in the new period.    "What is important is that cadres should identify themselves  with soldiers." Setting examples for soldiers and influencing  and inspiring them by exemplary acts are indispensable qualities  of troop leaders. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "If  a company commander or a political instructor cannot set a good  example, he cannot bring up good soldiers; and if a leading  cadre cannot set a good example, he cannot establish good common  practice or enhance combat effectiveness." If cadres at all  levels can set an example in taking the lead in observing rules,  regulations, and discipline, in being the first to charge at the  enemy and the first to bear hardship, and in taking the lead in  fairly and honestly fulfilling their official duties, the entire  armed forces will, guided by "noiseless orders," regularly and  in an orderly manner carry out various kind of work under new  historical conditions.</p>

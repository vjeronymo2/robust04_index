			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULES FOR COUPLE IN POLICE SEIZURE OF CARS  </P> <P> Ruling that a Santa Ana couple had a "reasonable expectation of privacy" in  their back yard, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday that  police conducted an improper search and seizure of two automobiles that they  owned.  </P> <P> The judges, sitting in Pasadena, ruled 2 to 1 that the city violated 4th  Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure because it did not  obtain warrants to search the property. Dale and Linda Conner were awarded  $71,000 in damages.  </P> <P> The case traces its roots to a 1983 police investigation of complaints that the  Conners were storing several old and inoperable cars on their property. Santa  Ana police officers scaled the fence of the Conners' property and inspected the  automobiles without a warrant and without the Conners' permission, the court  said.  </P> <P> The Conners objected to the search and filed a complaint with the Police  Department. After conducting a hearing, the department concluded that the  search was proper and the City Council concurred.  </P> <P> In 1985, city officials, again without a warrant, broke down the fence  surrounding the Conner property and removed two of the vehicles from the  property. The vehicles were later destroyed.  </P> <P> The Conners filed suit against the city and a U.S. District Court jury ruled in  1987 that the 1983 search of the Conners' property was unreasonable. The couple  was granted damages and attorneys' fees were awarded.  </P> <P> But the jury agreed with the city that the 1985 search and seizure of the  vehicles was reasonable. The city had argued that a warrant wasn't necessary  for the 1985 search because the Conners had by that time been through several  hearings on the issue of their cars and were aware that they were in violation  of city codes.  </P> <P> In ruling on the Conners' appeal of the ruling in the 1985 incident, 9th  Circuit Judge Robert R. Beezer wrote that the city had the right to confiscate  the cars but conducted the seizure improperly. Police should have obtained a  warrant before going onto the Conners' property.  </P> <P> "The Conners had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their enclosed, fenced  yard. That expectation of privacy remained the same before and after the  hearings," Beezer wrote.  </P> <P> "The warrant requirement applied to the city when, without the Conners'  consent, it broke down their fence, entered their property and seized their  automobiles, regardless of how 'reasonable' the warrantless search appeared in  light of the pre-seizure process afforded the Conners."  </P></p>

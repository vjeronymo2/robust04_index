			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Labour sees EC debate as vote of confidence THE battleground for next week's crucial debate over Maastricht was staked out last night as Labour confirmed that it would turn the occasion into a confidence motion on Mr John Major. The prime minister led senior cabinet colleagues in an intensive charm offensive before his important set-piece address to the backbench 1922 committee tonight in a continued effort to whittle down the number of Tory rebels. But as government business managers promised a narrow victory next Wednesday, the big guns of Euro-scepticism - most notably Lady Thatcher - were sighted in Westminster rallying the undecided to the anti-Maastricht cause. A survey of Euro-sceptics conducted by the FT yesterday indicates that as many as 50 Tory MPs could vote against the government if presented with a motion calling on them to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty. A revolt on this scale would leave the government facing defeat. But if there is a widely held perception that the vote has become a confidence motion in which either the government's or the prime minister's survival are at stake the size of the potential rebellion would shrink drastically. Mr Major felt sufficiently confident to predict victory for the first time yesterday, arguing that Denmark's blueprint for ending the impasse over the treaty, revealed on Tuesday night, further justified proceeding to ratification in the UK. The prime minister's positive tone about the prospects for the Danish proposals was embarrassingly undermined last night, however, by the leak of an internal Foreign Office memorandum warning that Danish requirements were 'unlikely to be acceptable to EC member states'. The paper, written last Friday before Denmark's final proposals were released, said the UK faces 'a difficult negotiation ahead'. Whitehall officials said last night that the paper represented 'first thoughts'. They expressed the view that in the end EC countries would be realistic enough to accept anything short of renegotiation of the treaty. Earlier in the day, Mr Major's claimed justification for proceeding was unanimously rejected by Labour's shadow cabinet who voted to oppose any motion tabled by the government. They said that criteria laid out by the prime minister in September for resuming the ratification process - including European Community agreement on how Denmark might proceed - had still not been met. Broadening the context of the debate beyond the timing of ratification, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, insisted that the key issue now centred on 'the nature and style of the prime minister's conduct of government'. The Liberal Democrats, however, decided to vote with the government if the motion was specifically related to Maastricht. Mr Major's upbeat victory forecast reflected undisguised relief within the government that the Danes had clarified their position. Labour's hardline tactics in insisting that the debate amounted to a vote of confidence was also thought likely to drive some waverers back into the government camp. But the outbreak of optimism among Tory loyalists was tempered by the immediate call from the Euro-sceptics - rejected by Downing Street - for Britain also to adopt the Danes' demands, before ratification procedures in the Commons were resumed. The Euro-sceptic offensive was boosted from the House of Lords by Lady Thatcher, who told friendly MPs that she had felt obliged to abandon her self-imposed decision not to interfere with the Commons. She was reported to be urging Conservative waverers not to join the 'roll of shame' of those voting to proceed with the ratification process.

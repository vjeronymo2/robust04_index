			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bear raid depresses brewer VOLATILE trading in Allied- Lyons followed a rumour that the brewery group was about to issue a trading statement. The misleading talk appeared to originate in the options sector in early trading, but soon spilled over into the equity market. The shares, which had opened at 647p, tumbled 33 at one stage, with other unreliable gossip resurrecting speculation about a rights issue. A downgrade by Hoare Govett, although merely bringing the broking house into line with the rest of the market, added to the negative sentiment. However, the rumours quickly proved unfounded, with Allied denying any trading difficulties. Dealers said the shares, which had been sparkling performers in recent weeks, had been the subject of a bear raid. They later recovered to close at 638p, a fall of 9 on the day. Turnover was a hefty 5.8m. Vickers upset News of a substantial cut in the dividend as engineering group Vickers reported an expected poor set of interim figures caused a bumpy ride for the shares. The company posted a loss of Pounds 4.1m, in line with market forecasts, but a worse than expected reduction in the dividend, from 3.7p to 0.5p. This sent the shares tumbling to an eight-year low of 60p and caused a backwardation - a situation in a fast market in which the bid price has temporarily become greater than the offer price. Nerves were, however, steadied at the analysts meeting that followed the release of the results, with researchers particularly reassured by the prospect of subsidiary Rolls-Royce Motor Cars breaking even next year. This produced a sharp turnround in the stock which, also aided by the strength of the general market, jumped to 84p for a rise of 5 on the day after turnover of 2.4m. Analysts downgraded their Vickers forecasts for the full year. Smith New Court, which remains cautious about the prospects for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, changed its previous estimate of a Pounds 9m profit to a loss of Pounds 14m. Half-time results from United Newspapers were well received, with revenue from the group's national newspapers being better than expected. There was also a lower interest charge helping to give an Pounds 8m boost to profits at Pounds 46.5m and a maintained dividend. Analysts are looking for full-year profits in the Pounds 95m to Pounds 105m region. The shares rose 16 to 425p in turnover of 1.9m. Kleinwort Benson, the UK securities house, was heavily involved in the telecoms sector, recommending a switch out of BT and into Cable and Wireless and Vodafone. The Kleinwort stories, plus news that County NatWest had taken BT off its buy list and reduced dividend forecasts, prompted early weakness in the BT shares, which fell to 357p, but they ended a shade firmer on the day at 359 1/2 p. Turnover was 6.5m. County cited continuing difficult volume trends and redundancy costs as being behind its profits downgrade for this year from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds 2.7bn and for next year from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.28bn, but it expects BT to lift the dividend by 6 per cent to 15.25p this year and by 7 per cent to 16.3p next year. C and W added 19 at 614p and Vodafone 3 at 328p. Sustained strength by both classes of Securicor shares and Security Services, Securicor's associate, was said to have reflected optimism over the forthcoming battle for supremacy in the cellular phone business in the UK. Securicor 'A', well supported all this week, climbed 9 to 554p. Racal Electronics put on 2 1/2 at 69 1/2 p, albeit in disappointingly low turnover of only 1.9m shares, while Racal Special-Ex firmed 3 to 145p on 630,000 traded and Chubb When Issued moved up 7 to 202p on turnover of 789,000. Banks, regarded by analysts as one of the sectors most highly geared to reductions in interest rates, raced higher, although traders said gains had been exaggerated by a shortage of stock. Specialists also tended to play down what they said were rather wild stories of huge profits for the big international banks resulting from the recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets. National Westminster leapt 20 to 373p on turnover of 5.4m. SG Warburg surged ahead in early trading - with one buyer said to have paid 550p - as the stock remained buoyed by market suggestions that the merchant bank, regarded by many as the UK's premier investment bank, could be the target of one of the US banks. The stock finished the day 6 higher at 536p. A merchant banking analyst said he discounted a full merger of SG Warburg on the basis that the goodwill write-off involved in such a deal would be very heavy and that the size of a potential deal - he said Dollars 1.5bn would not be an excessive valuation - would most likely put off even the largest predator. But the analyst did not rule out a co-operation deal. It was also suggested that Warburg's corporate finance and securities operations would do well from the sudden upsurge of business in markets. Insurance stocks maintained their strong performances, reflecting the beneficial effect on their balance sheets from the big gains in equities in recent sessions. Of the composites, Royal Insurance continued to bound ahead as Tuesday's reduction in interest rates, and the increased prospects for further cuts in coming months, reduced the expected impact of domestic mortgage indemnity losses. Royal closed 13 higher at 184p. Sun Alliance, also heavily involved in the mortgage indemnity business, rose 7 to 303p. Dollar considerations helped some of the leading media and publishing stocks. Pearson appreciated 29 to 398p and Reed International 13 to 578p. Reuters gained 30 at 1248p, helped by a buy recommendation and upgrade from US house Merrill Lynch. Strong support from Smith New Court helped shares in Rank Organisation, which strengthened 32 to 569p in 3.8m turnover. Thorn EMI, 29 ahead at 790p, continued to benefit from buy advice from Hoare Govett and County NatWest. Following news that its close season business had been better than expected, Airtours gained 9 to 232p. Owners Abroad rose 7 1/2 to 59 1/2 p. MEPC continued to attract attention on the back of its recent prime letting, with some switching out of Land Securities, in a buoyant property sector. The latter moved ahead 11 to 395p, MEPC 21 to 273p and British Land 15 to 155p. MARKET REPORTERS: Joel Kibazo, Steve Thompson, Christopher Price.

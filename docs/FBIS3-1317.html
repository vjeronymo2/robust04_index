Mr. Butime,  together with the Constituent Assembly commissioner and  officials of the UN independent secretariat and the UNDP  [National Union for Democracy and Progress], were briefing the  observers on the situation on the ground at a pre-deployment  meeting, which took place at the city hall this afternoon. Mr.  Butime told them that it is in the interests of the government  to ensure that the elections on Monday succeed, because the  stakes are high and everything has been finalized to ensure  their freedom of movement and access to the areas that they will  want to visit. He assured them that the security of Uganda is  good and that nothing will hinder the elections on polling day.  [passage omitted]</p>

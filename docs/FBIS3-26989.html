The Communist Party General-Secretary, Jiang Zemin, and  another member of the politburo are likely to visit Israel in  the first half of the year. China's ministers of power  industry, water resources and construction are also prospective  visitors, according to Israeli diplomatic sources.    Israel's Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of  Finance will visit China during the same period.    None of the visits will be officially announced until later  this month when the Israeli Ministry of Transport releases its  report on the death of the Shenyang mayor, Wu Disheng, in a  helicopter crash last November.    High-level contacts between Beijing and Jerusalem were  unofficially suspended after Wu's death. The helicopter crashed  after a mysterious explosion shortly after take-off.    The Ministry of Transport report is likely to attribute the  crash to a "grave technical fault", the source said.    Diplomats on both sides say there is no suspicion of  sabotage, although Shenyang took the precaution of hiring a  lawyer to watch its interests as the investigation proceeded.    Beijing signalled its desire to put the matter to rest last  month when it appointed the former vice-mayor of Shenyang, Zhang  Rongmao, as acting mayor.    "We had a good thing going until the accident," one Israeli  diplomat said.    "We're trying to rebuild the relationship in good taste, but  it will only be appropriate after the report is released."    Details about the visit by Wu and other Shenyang officials  remain unclear, but sources in Shenyang said Zhang Li, the head  of the city's economic development zone, who was also killed in  the crash, was there to discuss an "Israel technology centre"  planned for the zone.    Shenyang is home to one of the People's Liberation Army's  largest firms, Shanyou Industrial Company, which already has  joint technology projects with South Korea and countries in the  former USSR.    An Israeli diplomat said: "Our ideal project is to bring  Israeli technology to China. Shenyang was a good example of  where this could have happened."    Burgeoning military links between Beijing and Tel Aviv in  such fields as fighter aircraft, air-to-air missiles, tanks and  airborne radar were revealed by the United States Central  Intelligence Agency last October.    "Building on a long history of close defence industrial  relations ... China and Israel appear to be moving towards  formalising and broadening their military technical  cooperation," the CIA said.    It pointed to recently signed technology exchange deals  covering electronics and space as evidence of the growing trend  to formalise the relationship. The CIA feared this could lead  to a transfer of Western technology to China in violation of  Western bilateral pacts with Israel.    The Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was in  Beijing  when the CIA report was made public, said the estimate that  sales might amount to "several billions of dollars" was grossly  exaggerated.    In 1992, he said, the figure was about HK$470m [Hong Kong  dollars].</p>

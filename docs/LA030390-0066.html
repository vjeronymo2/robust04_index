			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : NEW PHONES SOUGHT IN BID TO CURB DRUG TRADE  </P> <P> In an effort to short-circuit the drug trade's telecommunications system,  Compton officials this week launched a campaign to get pay telephones in places  such as liquor stores, coin laundries and fast-food restaurants that are  adjusted to block incoming calls.  </P> <P> Dealers, according to police, hang around the businesses and take calls from  customers on pay phones.  </P> <P> "They use the phone booth like an office," Compton Police Cmdr. Terry Ebert  said.  </P> <P> Compton is not the first city to target pay phones. Similar steps have been  taken in Long Beach, Venice and the West Adams area of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Compton officials say they will not try to take phones away from honest  residents that need them. But, as Inglewood started doing last fall, Compton  will contact business owners and ask them to work with phone companies to have  incoming calls blocked.  </P></p>

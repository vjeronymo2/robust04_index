			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by General Humberto Ortega, commander in chief of </F> the Sandinist People's Army, at the National Unity Room of the  Presidential House in Managua; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] ...President of the Republic of Nicaragua, special  guests, national and international media, Nicaraguan people:    As the president of the Republic has said, today we are  concluding a period of hard work, during which we faced moments  of tension. Basically, however, it was a period during which we  learned a lot.    For all of us, today is a very important day. If we learned  anything from this joint effort to give Nicaragua the national  army our people have desired this century, it is that we cannot  take these steps and accomplish these goals unless we work  responsibly and with a spirit of unity and reconciliation,  despite the difficulties. I believe this was the most important  thing we learned during the period [four-second break in  reception] President Chamorro [3-second break in reception] the  commanders here present have learned.    Understanding is vital at this crucial time for Nicaragua's  future; it is vital to eliminate the climate of conflict, it is  vital to give ourselves an opportunity to show that we want to  understand each other; we must show our good faith and our  willingness to help Nicaragua. In that manner, we will bury  once and for all the climate of mistrust that prevents us from  taking the first step to build the national unity the majority  of the Nicaraguan people so earnestly need. The Nicaraguan  people are currently suffering the poverty resulting from more  than a century of underdevelopment, backwardness, war, and  misunderstandings. In sum, the Nicaraguan people have travelled  down a very difficult path [words indistinct] at this time when  other personalities such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,  Pablo Antonio Cuadra, and I have been trying to find venues of  understanding, when only a few months ago some of us were  receiving pensions.    I therefore believe these steps show that it is possible to  get together and reach an understanding; to join efforts and  attain specific results. This is what the Nicaraguan people  expect from their leaders and authorities.    Today, on behalf of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] I want  to say that soon, through the Code of Military Organization,  Jurisdiction, and Social Welfare, the EPS will become the  national army we all want. It will be an army that, based on  the necessary constitutional amendments, will have a name  consonant with the new phase, while its current name will be  historically recorded as an example [word indistinct] of its  fundamental and patriotic values.    I believe that with the steps and actions we have taken we  will truly help our fatherland move ahead. Thank you. [applause]</p>

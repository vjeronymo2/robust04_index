			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville and Jose Luis Gaona] </F>   [Text] Mexico will become an exporting power in the next  few years and will be able to take advantage of trade agreements  only if a series of measures are incorporated into the  government program for the next six-year period.    Presidents of business organizations and exporting firms are  proposing a package of measures to overcome problems of  infrastructure and bureaucracy that are afflicting the  enterprises. These measures include:     -  To establish a single  3.4-percent sales tax and eliminate other taxes.    -  To reduce  financing costs and eliminate financial intermediation for  exporters.    -  To privatize the country's railroads and ports.    -  To  extend the deadline for the construction of roads.    -  To put  together a catalog and distribute it among exporters to take  advantage of the opportunities offered by international  businesses.    -  To improve the quality of export products.    -  To stop  at the border foreign products that are subsidized or that enter  the country with prices that are below their cost to produce.    -  To  create a single document to process export documents.    -  To  integrate productive chains so that the country will export  final products instead of intermediary parts.     According to research conducted by EL FINANCIERO among  leaders of the business sector, Mexican businessmen face many  barriers in their effort to compete abroad. Too much  bureaucracy, administrative incapacity, scarce knowledge about  trade agreements and business opportunities, the lack of access  to low-cost financing, and poor infrastructure make foreign  trade a difficult task that only a few businesses can challenge.    Private sector sources noted that a program to develop trade  in the next six-year term is needed if the objectives are to  take advantage of international commercial negotiations and to  increase the flow of foreign exchange for the country in order  to balance the trade deficit.    Mexico already has a basis to increase its exports, however,  it lacks a specific support program and the difficult economic  situation a large number of firms are going through, make it  difficult to reduce the trade deficit with the United States.    According to figures released by the private sector,  Mexico's  trade has increased, especially with the United States.  Seventy-five percent of Mexican products are exported to the  United States. Trade between these two countries totalled $26  billion in 1986 and in 1993 it was $82 billion which represents  an annual growth of $8 billion in market value. It is estimated  that with NAFTA and a good dissemination of market  opportunities, however, trade with the United States could be  accelerated and increased, in the medium term, by between $15  billion and $20 billion per year.    The sources that were consulted noted that the macroeconomic  and legal conditions (agreements and commercial treaties) are  present for Mexico to increase its exports by more than 24  percent. They added that what needs to be done and what should  be done by the next government is to increase support for small  and medium businessmen, which are the ones with the greatest  export potential.    The private sector's proposals include the modernization of  the tax collection system through a "single tax" so that  businessmen will not be hindered by the red tape and, at the  same time, will not become victims of a single inspector. Over  two years ago, U.S. tax experts presented this single tax idea  to the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat. It is a tax that  works the same way as the value-added tax and they guaranteed  that it would not drop but increase tax revenues. The proposal  suggests that the single tax be set at 12 to 14 percent or  between 3 and 4 percent over sales. The advantage is that the  2-percent tax on assets, the 34 percent income tax, the  5-percent Institute of the National Housing Fund for Workers  tax, the 2-percent educational tax, the 2-percent Retirement  Savings System tax, and the 1-percent Federal District tax would  disappear thus simplifying the paperwork businessmen have to do.  The flexibility proposed for these enterprises would not affect  any of the macroeconomic variables attained during Salinas'  six-year period.    They said the fiscal surplus must be used to activate the  economy because, with liquidity, the businesses can buy supplies  to make their export products. Lowering the cost of financing  is another point they highlighted. Private sector members  complained that high-cost financing affects their costs and  eliminates their possibilities to export. Consequently, they  propose the channeling of soft loans without intermediation.    According to private sector sources, the dissemination of  market opportunities and the promotion of an exporting culture  are part of the package to foment foreign trade.    A greater deregulation will increase private investment in  the development of the country's infrastructure. Deficiencies  in transportation make goods more expensive, therefore, the  business sector proposes the privatization of railroads and  ports, as well as the extension of deadlines for the  construction of roads.    With regard to a single document, it suggested that the  government create this prerequisite and eliminate all others and  if exporters fail to tell the truth in it, an exemplary form of  punishment must be implemented. The private sector sources  concluded that Mexico will have its export boom when businessmen  engage in the terminal industry [industria terminal].</p>

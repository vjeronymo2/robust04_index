Why is it those who were not invited to the upcoming  meeting in Havana on the nation and the emigres were not  included? This is the topic Luis Sexto, a reporter for BOHEMIA  magazine, and your host, Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE  will discuss. I turn the time over to my colleague.    [Sexto] Osvaldo, we must begin by saying that we still do  not  know who is invited and who is not. We still do not have the  names of those who have been invited or of those who have said  that they will come to this meeting convened by the  revolutionary government to discuss relations between Cuba and  its emigres. I believe that by explaining the aim or the goal of  the this conference we can explain why there are many people who  have emigrated but who will not be able to attend this  conference, which will be held in April. As I was saying, by  analyzing the goal or the aim, we will be able to understand why  some, who lament or oppose the observance of this conference  from abroad, will not attend. In other words, this conference  will be held to discuss and analyze the relations that exist and  the normalization of those relations between Cuba and Cuban  emigrants.    [Rodriguez] We must specify that it is not a dialogue. That  is something....[pauses] Because some people have confused this  meeting of Cubans on the island with their relatives who  emigrated abroad, to the United States or any other place, with  the dialogue that was proposed by opponents to the revolutionary  project. We must understand that this is not a dialogue.    [Sexto] Well, the word dialogue, in a semantic sense, is one  that connotes cordiality. It is a positive word. But in the  current political language, the counterrevolution's political  language, it is a double-edged word. When you talk about  establishing a dialogue with someone, it is because you  recognize in that person a belligerency or sufficient power for  you to dialogue with him, and even to reconcile yourself with  that person. Dialogue implies establishing agreements and it  implies a certain reconciliation. That is the reason that in the  counterrevolution's political language, the language that is so  commonly used in Miami or Madrid, dialogue has that connotation  -- as if the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionary government, or  socialist Cuba, had to dialogue with its opponents abroad.    [Rodriguez] Who do not represent any political force.    [Sexto] Exactly. They represent only the forces of their own  interests. We will talk about this in a minute.    I believe Cuba is not going to dialogue with its enemies.  Cuba has called a conference where it will talk with certain  emigrants, with certain people, on relations with Cuban emigres.  You know very well that Cuban emigration has been a process. The  Cuban emigration has been grossly manipulated by the United  States of America. We must consider how, from the beginning of  this process in 1959 and in the 60's, human feelings and needs  have been manipulated to the point that they would serve the  political interests of the illegitimate sons [espurios] and  bastards -- excuse me for using such harsh words.    Therefore, the Cuban emigration process must be looked at  with certain objectivity, because emigration is a world  phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that characterizes today's world.  It has been rarefied by political interests, political interests  of interference, ambitious political interests, and illegitimate  political interests.    [Rodriguez] We are talking to Luis Sexto, a reporter for  BOHEMIA magazine on a topic that is being discussed in Havana  and other places in the world: the upcoming meeting in Havana of  the nation and the emigres. We are discussing why those who were  not included were not included.    [Sexto] In other words, why it is that those who will not be  there will not be there. That would be the appropriate term.  Because those who will not be, or those who cannot be, at this  conference are those who demand that the Revolution give up its  power. It is that group who would like to return to Cuba to  impose their vision and class interests. That is very clear.  Those who will come will be emigrants who wish to maintain good,  stable, and cordial relations with their native country. Just  recently I wrote an article in BOHEMIA in which I commented on  the phenomenon of emigration and its history in our country and  I proposed the hypothesis that emigration generally has two  sides, especially the Cuban emigration. First, a political  emigration: an emigration of people who oppose the Revolution or  who have been affected in a sense by the Revolution.    [Rodriguez] In other words, class enemies.    [Sexto] Enemies of the Revolution who went abroad to seek  support with the intent of returning. What distinguishes  political emigration from economic emigration is the urge to  return. Then we have the other side, which is the economic  emigrant.    [Rodriguez] Before you talk about the economic emigrant,  these political emigrants want to return to Cuba and occupy the  position they once had.    [Sexto] Right.    [Rodriguez] That is why they ask the Revolution to give up  its power.    [Sexto] Right. The political emigrant goes abroad to prepare  his return and with his return to reimpose his interests,  vision, and the supremacy of his class or party. For now, Cuba  has nothing to talk about with those who, from abroad, conspire  against the nation. Because, obviously, those political groups  who, from Miami or Madrid, propose or want a dialogue are  combating and harassing Cuba. What they want is to take power  from the Revolution. As a matter of fact, what do some of the  more moderate members of that political group, that political  superstructure, propose for Cuba? To solve Cuba's problems? To  solve them in such a way that would benefit the majority of the  Cuban people, that would allow the Cuban people to continue  enjoying the achievements brought about by the Revolution? No!    The least moderate of these groups asks for a multiparty  system, private property, general openings and uncontrolled  foreign investments, subordination to the United States. Those  are their demands. I doubt that any Cuban citizen with a  patriotic conscience would be able to consider the most minute  possibility of sitting down to discuss those issues with the  enemies of Cuba.    [Rodriguez] You were going to talk about economic emigrants  when I interrupted you.    [Sexto] The economic emigrant is the person who leaves to  seek better living conditions. He leaves for the purpose of  starting a new life. For the economic emigrant, what he leaves  behind does not present a conflict. He is leaving to start a new  life. He probably does not even want to return because the  economic emigrant breaks his connections with the past. He has a  different goal. The economic emigrant is sometimes nostalgic for  his roots but he does not think about returning.    Osvaldo, I am the son and grandson of emigrants. My  grandparents came from Spain to Cuba. Part of my family,  especially my parents, emigrated after the triumph of the Cuban  Revolution; I know the mechanics and the nature of the emigrant  because I learned about it from my own family. My grandparents  never talked about returning to Spain. I believe that my  relatives who left Cuba at the beginning of the Revolution have  never expressed the desire to reestablish themselves in Cuba.    Therefore, I believe that the majority of Cuban emigres  during these 35 years -- because there was emigration in Cuba  prior to the Revolution, and in the 50's there was growing  emigration -- I believe that in some years, such as 1956, more  than 25,000 Cubans went to the U.S. Interests Section to ask for  visas to enter the United States, to live and work there. The  phenomenon of emigration is a bit old in Cuba. It was not caused  by the Cuban Revolution. It reached its peak with the Revolution.    Therefore, the majority of economic emigrants who live in  the  United States and other countries around the world, those who  will come to talk with Cuban authorities, will come to converse  on how to establish a line of communication with what we could  call the Cuban diaspora. How to achieve stable and firm ties,  despite the world situation, with their native land. That is  what they will come to discuss and that is all that the  conference will allow to be discussed.    [Rodriguez] Yes, and in the political sense, I believe the  United States will no longer be able to use that portion of the  emigres as a political weapon or as a hostage to its policy.    [Sexto] The United States politicized emigration and we did  too, as a reflection or as a rejection. As an imposition of the  struggle, we also helped politicize emigration. There was a time  when we thought that a person who left the country was taking  sides against the Cuban Revolution and the country; that is not  true. Practice and experience have demonstrated that that is not  true and it is time to refocus and change our point of view.    [Rodriguez] Why is it those who were not invited to the  upcoming meeting in Havana on the nation and emigration were not  invited? Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine has spoken to us on  this topic.</p>

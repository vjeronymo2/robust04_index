			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of kiwifruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenditures of $167,862 and an assessment rate of $0.01 per tray or tray equivalent of kiwifruit. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 marketing year budgeted expenditures were $156,150, which is $11,712 less than the $167,862 recommended for this fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.01 per tray or tray equivalent is the same as last year's assessment rate. The major budget category for 1994&hyph;95 is $98,360 for administrative, staff and field salaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $110,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 11 million trays or tray equivalents of kiwifruit. The assessment income will have to be augmented by $57,862 from the Committee's reserves to provide adequate funds to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year are estimated to be $87,138. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year begins August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable kiwifruit handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 920 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kiwifruit, Marketing agreements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 920 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 920_KIWIFRUIT GROWN IN CALIFORNIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE COMPANY OF RISK-TAKERS;  </P> <P> UNUSUAL FRANKFURT BALLET GETS WARM WELCOME IN L.A.  </P> <P> "Now, this isn't 'Swan Lake,' " warned the nice publicist about the Frankfurt  Ballet.  </P> <P> It sure wasn't.  </P> <P> "Same Old Story," "In The Middle, Somewhat Elevated" and "Skinny" danced by  this company, led by "bad boy" choreographer William Forsythe, are about as far  from "Swan Lake" as hiking boots are from toe shoes. But judging from the  reaction of the members of the audience to the opening night performance  Tuesday at the Wiltern Theatre, they were grateful for the difference. Dancers  received enthusiastic bravos, a standing ovation and several curtain calls.  </P> <P> "Everybody yelled at me for wanting to do this," said choreographer and Dance  Gallery artistic director Bella Lewitzky, a sly smile crossing her face, "but I  felt Los Angeles deserved the Frankfurt company."  </P> <P> Lewitzky and the Dance Gallery were responsible for bringing Forsythe and his  troupe for a two-night-only stop in Los Angeles. The first night included a  post-performance benefit buffet supper in the theater lobby with proceeds to go  to the Dance Gallery Presentations Program.  </P> <P> When Forsythe made his entrance to the party, guests applauded, then cornered  him in the lobby to gush about his greatness, compliments he humbly accepted.  </P> <P> In Frankfurt, he said, 11% of the city's municipal budget goes to the arts;  regrettably it isn't the same here. "Obviously there is such a spirit and  support for the arts here, and the government doesn't acknowledge how important  culture is for the spirit of a country."  </P> <P> Forsythe, wearing a long black cardigan over black pants cinched in at the  ankles and displaying a light scruffy beard, was proud of the work his dancers  did that night. "I said, 'Show off.' I'm tough on them, but I love 'em."  </P> <P> Barbara Bain, co-chairwoman for both the gala and the Dance Gallery Guild, was  still on a high from watching the performance. "Bella selected the Frankfurt  Ballet," she said, blue eyes open wide, "and as she proved with the Olympic  Arts Festival, she sure knows how to pick dance companies."  </P> <P> "There was some risk-taking involved," Lewitzky said, "since people have never  heard of Billy Forsythe. This man takes dance into a new aspect of theater.  It's difficult to explain to someone, 'No, this is not a German regional ballet  company.' It takes the seeing of it. But Los Angeles is a non-prejudicial  audience, and I was not surprised (by the reaction). I feel my struggles were  worth it; everybody has made a point of coming up to me and telling me how much  they liked it. That's all I need to sigh a sigh of relief."  </P> <P> Also on hand for the party were Doug Cramer (co-chairman, along with Herbert  Ross, of the Frankfurt Ballet in Los Angeles), Shirlee Fonda, city Councilwoman  Joy Picus, Judy Henning and Richard Rosenzweig, gala co-chairwomen Patti  Amstutz and Elaine Caplow; Ruth and George Moss and Bettina and Andrew Klink.  </P> <P> The dancers, who came to the party later, were easy to spot. They were the ones  with wet hair, oversize bags slung over their shoulders and a ravenous  appetites.  </P> <P> "The reaction from the audience -- it's not like that in Frankfurt," said  dancer Thomas Stache.  </P> <P> What have the dancers been doing on their brief stay in Los Angeles?  </P> <P> "I saw the Valley from the top," Stache said, "and we went to the beach and I  put my feet in the Pacific Ocean. And it was cold."  </P></p>

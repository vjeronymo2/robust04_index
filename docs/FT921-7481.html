			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo and Shell dominate equities A HIGHLY erratic trend in the UK stock market yesterday saw share prices close firmly but well below the day's best levels, finally responding to a strong opening to the new Wall Street session. Trading was dominated by profits statements from Glaxo and Royal Dutch/Shell, as both heavyweight stocks exerted a powerful influence on the FT-SE Index, attracting buyers as well as the sellers who drove their respective share prices lower. With BP still the subject of heavy turnover, the big investment institutions clearly had a very busy trading session. Domestic factors continued to have a somewhat mixed influence on the stock market. The announcement of a 0.3 per cent fall in UK gross domestic product in the fourth quarter confirmed the bleakness of the UK recession. But hints from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, of Budget tax moves and increased government borrowing encouraged City optimism for base rate cuts ahead of the UK general election. Wall Street's strength provided a welcome surprise, in view of bearish comments on the US trade figures for December. UK markets remained nervous of the outlook for equities in New York and in Tokyo. London opened strongly, in hot pursuit of the other European stock markets, which took a favourable view of firmer performances from Wall Street and Tokyo. However, there was little genuine investment support for a UK market waiting for trading statements from Glaxo and Shell. An early gain of 18 points on the Footsie was quickly reversed as Glaxo fell sharply in spite of higher interim profits. Investors were upset by signs of poor sales growth for Zantac, the group's high-selling ulcer drug. However, Glaxo shares rallied well when Wall Street opened and US buyers appeared in London. There was little recovery in Shell Transport, which gave ground in exceptionally high turnover after announcing sharply lower profits for the final quarter and severely disappointing the market with the dividend payout. The FT-SE Index, down 5.5 at midsession, rallied as Wall Street opened. With the Dow ahead by 36 points in London trading hours, the Footsie closed a net 6.7 up at 2,543.4. At one time, losses in Shell and Glaxo share prices represented a fall of around 12 points on the Footsie index. The setback in Shell was offset to some extent by heavy switching from Royal Dutch shares. Leading oils have been sold heavily in London over the past week as first BP and then Shell have disappointed the market. With both stocks prominent in international fund portfolios, some fund managers are believed to have suffered substantial losses. Seaq volume rose to 593.6m shares from Wednesday's 561.3m. Yesterday's total was boosted by the activity in Glaxo and Shell, both of which are likely to have contributed significantly to the day's retail, or customer, business in UK equities. On Wednesday, customer business moved up to Pounds 1bn once again, indicating a more profitable level for London securities firms than in the previous week. Equity strategists were concerned yesterday that London owed so much of its recovery to a US stock market still viewed with caution by London traders.</p>

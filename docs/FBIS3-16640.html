			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter; from the "Pacific Ocean" </F> program]    [Text] Acting upon a ruling confirmed by the Maritime Kray  prosecutor, the Maritime Kray administration removed Viktor  Ivanovich Cherepkov, head of Vladivostok city administration,  for the duration of preliminary investigation of criminal file  No. 474-731. The Maritime Kray court endorses the application  of this criminal procedural measure. Viktor Ivanovich Cherepkov  is charged with accepting extensive bribes from citizen Volkov.  Kray administration decree No. 108, issued on 16 March,  nominated Konstantin Borisovich Tolstoshein as the acting head  of Vladivostok city administration for the duration of criminal  investigation of Viktor Cherepkov. When a Maritime Radio  correspondent asked Tolstoshein where he would begin, this is  what he said.    [Tolstoshein] We are taking all the necessary measures so as  to attend not to politics but to practical matters, to the most  serious questions of survival of the city of Vladivostok. In  this connection, I issued a decree nominating my deputies at  2000 hours yesterday [1000 GMT 16 March]. I have also issued a  statement on reorganization of the structure of the city  administration, and on nomination of heads of rayon  administrations. When we gathered, we all reached a consensus:  The first task of the Vladivostok city authorities is to begin  cleaning up the city immediately, beginning tomorrow. To be  more precise, it is already night time, so the cleaning will  begin today. [sentence as heard]    Our second task: I believe that we should pay the utmost  attention to transportation problems, which includes buses,  trolley buses, and trams, and of course the railroad. The dacha  season will begin very soon, and it will simply not do if the  trains do not run. They are very expensive, but how will the  pensioners and people who do not have their own transportation  commute to their dachas? Therefore we all think that this is one  of the main problems. We plan to open as many stores as  necessary for the handicapped, World War II veterans, victims of  Chernobyl, and veterans of Afghanistan. Therefore, the emphasis  will be on people. We have agreed that the dominant factor in  our work will be the person. Naturally, one of the most  important questions in our activities from the very beginning  will be the issue of preparing for the winter of 1994-1995. We  are beginning our work, and we call all residents of Vladivostok  to respond to our requests. We call on all leaders of  enterprises, commercial structures and the various forms of  property: Let us all drop confrontation, political intrigue,  and other activities that do not grace either us or our life.  Let us make Vladivostok a city which will be pleasant to come  to, which will be pleasant for our relatives or foreigners -- it  does not matter who -- to come to. We must tidy our city up,  improve its appearance. After all, we have to live in this city.    [Reporter] Konstantin Borisovich, it is 0300 in the night  [1700 GMT] now. Is it necessary for you to be here?    [Tolstoshein] Of course it is. We started serious work from  the very first minutes. I have already told you that we are  trying to solve the problems of reducing the city  administration. The city administration has been bloated out of  all proportion, and understandably, this has consequences: Every  person working here gets a salary, and a fairly large one.  However, I have to tell you that three people are responsible  for the same sphere of activity, and only their job titles are  different. And each of them gets a pretty wild salary. We are  sitting here working on this problem this very moment. I have  to tell the city residents that probably the staff bloated by  the previous administration could not handle its job because  there were too many people harnessed to specific jobs. We are  going to review all of this. In our administration, each person  will earn his pay by being responsible for a concrete sphere of  activity.    [Reporter] If this is not a military secret, could you tell  us who will head the rayon administrations? I think that  everyone is concerned about this.    [Tolstoshein] Of course this is not a secret. I signed a  decree nominating the heads of rayon administrations yesterday  at 2000 hours. Pervomayskiy Rayon: Viktor Gennadiyevich  Pletnev; Leninskiy Rayon: Sergey Semenovich Zhurmilov;  Frunzenskiy Rayon: Viktor Andreyevich Goncharov; Pervorechenskiy  Rayon: Aleksandr Vladimirovich Avdeyev; and Tamara Borisovna  Vadilyeva will be the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon. We shall  see what happens next. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Estonian vote annulled Estonia's National Court has annulled the result of last month's referendum in Narva, a Russified city which voted overwhelmingly for regional autonomy, reports Matthew Kaminski in Vilnius. The unanimous decision marks the latest act in the conflict between Estonia's government and its Russian minority, around 40 per cent of 1.6m population, over language and citizenship rights. Moscow, keeping a close eye on the 25m Russian diaspora scattered across the former Soviet Union, repeatedly denounced Estonia's aliens and election laws and similar policies in Latvia, where Russians make up 45 per cent of the population.</p>

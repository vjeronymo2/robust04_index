			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lang urged to call a referendum THE LABOUR party in Scotland yesterday challenged Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to stage a referendum on the country's constitutional future. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, made the challenge after a meeting of most of the party's 49 Scottish MPs. He was picking up on a remark by Mr Lang who on Friday said that a referendum was a 'possibility' in the continuing question of Scotland's constitutional future. For Mr Dewar, the referendum challenge is an attempt to seize the initiative in Scottish politics and to defuse the crisis which his party faces in Scotland. Once again it finds itself the largest party north of the border while its hopes of coming to power and implementing its plans for a Scottish parliament where dashed by the Tory election victory. The challenge is also a way of trying to head off an incipient revolt by some Scottish Labour MPs who at the weekend founded Scotland United, intended to be a grouping of all non-Conservative parties in Scotland, which between them won almost 75 per cent of the vote last Thursday. Last night about 3,000 people attended a rally in George Square in Glasgow organised by Scotland United. They were addressed by Mr George Galloway, the leftwing Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead who is on the wing of the party that is sympathetic to Scotland's eventual independence. Scotland United's stated aim is to campaign for a multi-option referendum, although Mr Galloway has also spoken of the possibility of civil disobedience and has echoed the Scottish National party argument that the Conservatives do not have a mandate to govern Scotland. Mr Dewar said the referendum would have to cover the constitutional status quo, the scheme for a devolved Scottish parliament devised by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, and independence. Mr Lang would have to abide be the result, Mr Dewar added. 'The Tories have always claimed that faced with the choice Scotland would vote for the status quo,' said Mr Dewar. 'They should have the courage to put the matter to the test.' If Mr Lang did not deliver, 'bitterness and instability will be the mark of his government.' The Conservative party is anyway considering what response to give to the demand for constitutional change following its election victory. But on Friday Mr Lang heavily qualified his remark about the possibility of a referendum by saying it would have to be based on a specific proposition, preferably one enshrined in law, as was the case with the 1979 referendum on devolution for Scotland. The SNP has not joined Scotland United although some prominent individual supporters such as Mr Pat Kane, a rock singer with the Scottish group Hue and Cry, were at last night's rally. The SNP is concentrating its efforts on achieving victory in the district council elections of May 7. It will fight on a platform promising to use district councils in which it wins control to organise a multi-option referendum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 15 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) has asked Bosnian Serb authorities to allow  aid convoys back on Serb-controlled territory, a UN spokeswoman  said here Friday [15 April].    Convoys from the Croatian capital Zagreb to Serb-controlled  Banja Luka in Bosnia-Hercegovina and out of Belgrade in Serbia  were stopped Monday, as Serb authorities reacted angrily to NATO  airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions around the  besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    But UNHCR officials remain in contact with Bosnian Serb  authorities in Pale, and have asked to restart aid convoys  through Serb-controlled territory next week, UNHCR spokeswoman  Sylvana Foa said.    Meanwhile, the number of casualities in Gorazde in eastern  Bosnia since the Serb onslaught began on March 28 rose to 191  dead and 797 wounded on Thursday, the UN added.    The spokeswoman said that according to reports of UNHCR  staff  in Gorazde: "People are just incredibly panicked and terrified  of what is going to happen to them."</p>

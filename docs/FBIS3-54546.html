			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri will leave London  this morning and will make a short stopover at Istanbul airport  where he will hold talks with the Turkish prime minister on  issues of common concern that were raised during his recent  visit to Turkey. The prime minister and his delegation will  then visit al-Qardahah in Syria to offer condolences to  President Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Staff Major  Basil al-Asad.    Last night, Prime Minister al-Hariri addressed the alumni of  the American University of Beirut-London branch. The prime  minister dealt with the current situation and the Lebanese  Government's stances and plans to reconstruct Lebanon. He  reiterated that his visit to London has been successful, noting  that British companies will contribute toward reconstructing  Lebanon. Prime Minister al-Hariri had the following to say:    [Begin al-Hariri recording] I believe that our visit to  Britain was successful and the outcome exceeds our expectations.  It had been a long time since a Lebanese prime minister visited  Britain, but the atmosphere of frankness and amity that  prevailed during our talks with British officials demonstrate  [words indistinct]. I firmly believe that a new page has been  turned in Lebanese-British relations.    British companies will take part in the reconstruction of  Lebanon, particularly in the realms of electricity and  irrigation. British companies could possibly participate in any  project if their quotations are competitive. The British  Government supports this trend. During my meetings with British  businessmen yesterday and today I sensed that they are quite  serious, that they respect the Lebanese people, and that they  have confidence in Lebanon. We will benefit from their  expertise and they will benefit from the opportunities.    Britain is a friendly state. It fully supports Security  Council Resolution 425, Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon,  and the establishment of peace -- a comprehensive and just peace  that safeguards dignity and honor. [sentence indistinct] We  have many friends in the world, and all our friends support us.  We hope to secure an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and that  peace will prevail in the region.    If Israel indeed wants to live in peace, the Arabs, all the  Arabs, are quite prepared to reciprocate. The Arabs are indeed  willing to live in peace. [Words indistinct] but Israel must  realize that it cannot keep the land, occupy the land, and have  peace too. If Israel wants peace, it must withdraw from the  land in the Golan and south Lebanon.    The ball is now in Israel's court. The Arabs have tried  everything to show the world that they are peace advocates. The  world has started to listen to us with open minds. Lebanon,  like the other states in the region, will benefit from peace,  therefore peace is our real objective. Peace, however, should  not be made by one side; it must rather be sought by both sides.  The Israelis are attacking us every day and 10 percent of our  land is occupied. Israel must withdraw and peace will then be  established. [end recording]</p>

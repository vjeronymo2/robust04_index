			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,100 lost again on interest rate worries - Market Report The London equity market, badly upset by weakness in US securities overnight, made only very little recovery in late dealings yesterday despite a brighter opening in both the Dow Average and New York Federal bonds. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 19.3 at 3,089.1, only three points above the day's low. London was following the closing trend in other European centres where bonds extended earlier losses ahead of the money market repo auction at the Bundesbank today. The equity market remained nervous over the outlook for inflation and for interest rates, and followed the downturn in German and French markets as they returned from the Whit Monday break to react sharply to comments from the president of the Bundesbank which had been interpreted as indicating that falls in German interest rates would now be reined in. At the same time, the tumble in New York bonds reinforced fears by many London analysts, including Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, that the Federal Reserve might still tighten credit policy further, even after last week's decisive action. Share prices hung fire at first in London, which had made its response to the Bundesbank interest rate warning on Monday when other leading European markets were closed. The Footsie clung on to the important 3,100 benchmark for the first hour but then turned sharply downwards as US trading houses began to sell the stock index future. The slide deepened as markets absorbed news that German M3 money supply had continued to grow well outside the Bundesbank preferred range in April. After a brief pause, the setback was renewed as London waited nervously for New York to open. When the Dow Average came in higher, showing a 16 point gain in early trading, London tried to rally. But shares turned down again when UK government bonds extended losses to close more than a point down at the long end of the range. Confidence was not helped by company trading reports. Shares in Marks and Spencer fell heavily despite record profits as the monarch of the UK high street retailers warned of tough competitive conditions in Europe and uncertainty over the UK consumer recovery. Trading volume was not heavy, however, with only 555.7m shares traded through the Seaq electronic network. On Monday, when London volume was curbed by the closure of most European markets, 417.1m shares traded through Seaq, returning a retail worth of only Pounds 983.6m, one of the lowest daily totals for the year. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the measuring rod of the broader market which has been falling steadily for the past fortnight, shed a further 17.9 to 3,691.4. Investors clearly remained cautious as the market moved into a week somewhat lacking in economic pointers from the leading economies. US bond markets face a series of federal fund raisings this week, but economic data will be thin until next week when US leading indicators, unemployment and personal expenditure figures are due. London analysts were hoping last night that US markets, and also the dollar, would continue to respond favourably to the resumption of the US - Japan trade talks which was announced just before London closed yesterday.</p>

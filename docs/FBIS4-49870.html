			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The remark made by the  U.S. Assistant Secretary Winston Lord at the Senate Subcommittee  of Foreign Relations is totally groundless, said a Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman here today.    At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, Spokesman  Wu Jianmin made the statement when asked to comment on a report  that on May 4, Lord indicated at the Senate Subcommittee of  Foreign Relations that China in the past possibly aided the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ballistic missile  program, and surely helped its nuclear program.    Wu said "such a remark is totally groundless and entirely  irresponsible".</p>

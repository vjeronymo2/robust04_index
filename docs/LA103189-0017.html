			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DUMPED GRAVEL SLOWS SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY  </P> <P> A truck dumped 20 tons of gravel on the Simi Valley-San Fernando Freeway in  Simi Valley on Monday, closing two westbound lanes and causing a slow morning  commute for some motorists, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> There were no injuries in the 6 a.m. accident, which occurred near the Tapo  Street overpass, said CHP Officer Jim Utter.  </P> <P> The gravel was dumped when the bottom doors of a tractor-trailer rig came open,  Utter said. The driver's name was unavailable and officers late Monday had not  determined why the doors opened.  </P> <P> The gravel spilled across all three westbound lanes, but only two lanes were  closed during the cleanup, which lasted more than an hour. Utter said traffic  slowed, but the backup was minimal because most morning rush-hour traffic in  the area is eastbound.  </P></p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: An appropriate mix of exits and entries THE EARLY new year international mergers and acquisitions included an appropriate number of exits and entries, writes Brian Bollen. UK retailing group Sears announced the disposal of its last remaining interests in the US, the Miss Erika women's fashion wholesaling business. Sears is pursuing a policy of concentrating on its core European retailing interests. Barclays said it sold its Barclays Danmark financing and leasing operation because it did not fit in with its core activities. French electronic payments concern Sligos is belatedly entering the UK for the first time with its purchase of 51 per cent of Nexus Payment Systems. Swedish furniture retailer Ikea's first acquisition in the US is a Californian home furnishings chain, Stor. German electrical and electronics group Siemens beat off its rivals to take control of a division of Skoda, Czechoslovakia's biggest engineering company. Under the deal, Siemens will acquire 51 per cent of Skoda's transport division. Grand Metropolitan's decision to buy the 75 per cent of Italian drinks company Cinzano it did not already own will give it more direct control over the international marketing and distribution of its own brands.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Key Brazil economy post filled BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco has appointed two women to run key ministries, completing his cabinet and confirming the government's centre-left slant. Ms Yeda Crusius, an economics professor from the university of Rio Grande do Sul, takes over the important Planning Ministry from Mr Paulo Haddad, who was recently named economy minister. Ms Luiza Erundina, the left-wing former mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, is to be administration minister. Both appointments have met widespread approval. A leading light of the radical Workers' Party (PT), Ms Erundina was widely respected as mayor, as well as for her no-nonsense attitude and honesty - a crucial qualification after the corruption scandal which brought down the last government. Her acceptance of the ministry has, however, angered the leadership of the PT, which is theoretically in opposition but which now has two members in the government. Ms Crusius, a member of the Social Democrats, is a friend of Mr Haddad and thus expected to avoid the usual conflicts between the economy and planning ministries. She joins the economics team amid growing fears over inflation. After more than a year of monthly inflation between 20 and 25 per cent, predictions for this month have been revised to 28 per cent and the president has summoned supermarket owners to explain basic food price rises of 40 per cent. After accepting the post on Saturday, Ms Crusius said her priorities included development and cutting interest rates. Describing the free market as 'a utopia', she said the state had a role in co-ordinating the market. Economics Notebook, Page 15</p>

This was stated at a  press conference in Moscow today by that country's ambassador in  Russia, Yusuf Abdullayev. The statement was made in light of an  accusation made against Uzbekistan by the Afghan president,  whose representative recently visited Moscow. In particular, it  was alleged that the Uzbek side was interfering in the internal  Afghan conflict by supplying weapons to the forces of that  country's rebel Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and his  allies. The Uzbek diplomat rejected such an accusation and  emphasized that what happened in Afghanistan was the internal  affair of the Afghan people. At the same time, the ambassador  confirmed that in accordance with agreements Uzbekistan was  indeed rendering aid to the northern regions of Afghanistan.  This aid, however, was purely civilian in character. Last year  electric power to a value of $14 million was supplied and about  100 joint Uzbek-Afghan enterprises were set up. This was  reported by ITAR-TASS.</p>

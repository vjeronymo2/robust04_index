			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.K. MacArthur] </F>   [Text] The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) is  currently breeding a large number of tsetseflies for a  biological control programme to check tsetsefly infestation in  the country.    The commission, at the moment, has more than 10,000 adult  females, a number of males and over 23,000 pupae in its  laboratories which are being used to reproduce males for the  project.    Dr. (Mrs.) Delphina Aba Ababie-Gomez, Head of the Department  of Animal Sciences at the GAEC, who made this known to the  GRAPHIC explained that under the programme, an irradiation  facility -- a Cobalt 60 Gamma source -- which is being installed  at the commission will be used to sterilise the insects,  particularly the males.    Sufficient numbers of the sterile males, she said, will then  be released in critically infested areas to overwhelm the  population of the insects in the wild.    When the females in the wild mate with the sterile males, no  offsprings will be produced, resulting in reduction in the  tsetsefly population.    The biological control programme, the sterile insect  technology is being undertaken by the commission in  collaboration with the Veterinary Services Division of the  Ministry of Food and Agriculture at Pong Tamale and the Animal  Research Institute of the Scientific and Industrial Research  (CSIR).    It is being supported by the International Atomic Energy  Agency based in Vienna, Austria.    Dr. Adabie-Gomez said when the tsetsefly population is  reduced, it will lead to a reduction in the incidence of  trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which affects  man and animals in the country.    She further explained that a reduction in the population of  the insect in critically infested areas would enable the country  to reclaim the land for human settlement, agriculture and other  socio-economic purposes.    She disclosed that some lands in the oncho-free areas of the  Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions are not being fully  utilised at the moment because of tsetsefly infestation.    Parts of Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern and Volta  regions are also endemic, she added.    Dr. Adabie-Gomez hinted that a limited number of sterile  females will be released for dynamic population studies in  three sites in the White Volta and Nabogo River basins of the  Northern Region from April to July next year. The releases will  be done monthly.    The release of the sterile adult males, she said, will begin  around August next year during the rainy season in the Northern  Region.</p>

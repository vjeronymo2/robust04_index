			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Country singer Johnny Cash, who underwent a double heart bypass on Dec. 19, was  released Tuesday from Baptist Hospital in Nashville. Although Cash, 56, had  suffered lung problems after the surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said the  complications were not unusual and the doctors would not have released Cash "if  everything wasn't OK." Cash described the double-bypass as "a great,  soul-searching experience" and said he'll thank God for bringing him through  the operation by making a record of Bible readings with another heart patient,  Waylon Jennings.

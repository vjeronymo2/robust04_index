			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Hungary's ruling party faces split THE GOVERNING Hungarian Democratic Forum is stretched to breaking point after the resignation of the party leader who has held the conservative and nationalist factions together. Mr Lajos Fur, who gave up his unifying role as party president late on Wednesday, said in a statement published yesterday that his efforts to resolve an 'intolerable war between brothers' had ended in 'bitter failure'. Mr Fur's departure leaves the Forum without a bridge between the moderate conservatives of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, and a smaller group around Mr Istvan Csurka, the populist writer who broke Hungary's political calm with a virulently anti-communist and anti-semitic tract last year. One party leader said the only solution was a 'peaceful divorce'. The long-awaited formal split could come next week at the Forum's national delegate meeting. A breakaway by Hungarian Justice, the party-within-a-party set up by Mr Csurka and claiming the support of 29 far-right MPs, would cost Mr Antall's government its parliamentary majority. The Forum's internal strife coincides with growing restlessness among the governing party's coalition partners and promises a rough parliamentary ride for the government's emergency budget plans.</p>

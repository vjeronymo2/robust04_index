			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Nadir tax offer will be assessed The attorney-general of northern Cyprus is to rule on the legality of a proposal put forward by fugitive businessman Mr Azil Nadir to turn over a fruit packaging business to the breakaway republic in lieu of tax debts, Jim Kelly writes. Mr Nadir has offered to give the Sunzest company to the government in a dispute about unpaid taxes which are understood to amount to Dollars 10m (Pounds 6m). The administrators of Polly Peck International say Mr Nadir has no authority to dispose of Sunzest and are anxious to be a party to any agreement to use the assets to cancel debts. Mr Ozker Ozgur, the northern Cyprus deputy prime minister, said yesterday: 'Nadir says he has the authority from the shareholders to do this, but the (PPI administrators) claiming to represent the shareholders, claim differently. So we will ask the attorney-general if Nadir has the right to do this.'</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Strict terms for Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise rouble THE industrialised nations yesterday approved in principle the setting up of a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) stabilisation fund for the rouble. The Group of 10 nations - comprising the G7 countries plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - said they were willing to activate the General Arrangements to Borrow which would provide the International Monetary Fund with the financial support needed to establish the stabilisation fund. However, successive ministers, assembled in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, made clear that the fund and other financial support for Russia and other former Soviet republics would depend on them meeting strict economic criteria. The need for a comprehensive stabilisation programme was also underlined in the statement issued after Sunday's G7 meeting. The reform programme provides for: Reduction of the budget deficit to stabilise the economy and reduce the role of government. Curbing monetary growth to bring inflation under control and stop the extension of credit to unviable enterprises. The establishment of the legal framework and contractual rights necessary to permit a market economy to be developed. Reform of the agriculture and energy sectors. A foreign exchange mobilisation system that enables the independent states of the former Soviet Union to meet their international payments. A unified and market-determined exchange rate set at a realistic level. Meanwhile, in his address to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, yesterday suggested that the stabilisation fund should boost confidence in the rouble once a sufficiently tight monetary stance in the rouble-zone countries had been established. However, he said it would be difficult to find a correct parity for the rouble. Decisions also had to be taken as to whether it should float, move in a 'crawling peg' of adjustable parities or be fixed. He suggested that the rouble should be pegged to the Ecu as part of the stabilisation programme for the currency - a proposal supported by France. However Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said later that he wanted to peg the rouble to the dollar and allow it to fluctuate within a 7 1/2 per cent margin either side of its exchange rate. He admitted that fixing an exchange rate would be difficult, partly because Russia would have higher inflation than the west, but his government intended to adopt a single rate from July 1. Mr Lamont said Russia needed a macro-economic stabilisation programme to gain control of its inflation, monetary growth and budget deficits. George Graham adds: Mr Gaidar warned US businessmen in Washington yesterday that his country was obliged to tax imports and foreign residents' incomes. He said Russia had lifted import duties temporarily during the period of price liberalisation, in order to impose the discipline of import competition on domestic producers who might otherwise have been tempted to raise their prices too much. It was now necessary, he told a meeting at the US Chamber of Commerce, to reimpose a flat import duty. 'We are not using this import tariff to protect our domestic producers, we just want to raise tax revenue,' Mr Gaidar said. Russia's new income tax, meanwhile, has worried some foreign businessmen who say they will be unable to move employees to Russia because the new top rate of 60 per cent would be so severe a cost. Mr Gaidar said the income tax was 'a sad story', but necessary to comply with IMF requirements. 'The problem is we have a strongly undervalued rouble, so when we apply our income tax to foreigners they have very high incomes in roubles.' Mr Gaidar said he hoped to introduce special exemptions or privileges for foreigners.</p>

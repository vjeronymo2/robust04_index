			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by labor correspondent Jovial Rantao] </F>   [Text] The ANC has advised most of its head office staff to  seek work elsewhere or opt for voluntary retrenchment as jobs  will be lost when the organisation begins restructuring on  October 1.    ANC sources said party secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa  held  a staff meeting yesterday -- the second in two weeks -- at which  he spelt out the situation.    Documents leaked to WEEKEND STAR show that the decision to  reorganise the party's head office, which employs more than  1,000 people, was taken on Tuesday by the ANC's national working  committee.    The committee decided that voluntary retrenchment, at the  discretion of the organisation, would be effected on July 1.  Retrenchment packages of four months' salary plus an amount for  each year of service would be offered.    Staff who did not opt for voluntary retrenchment and were  not  appointed to new positions would be retrenched on October 1 with  two months' salary plus an amount for each year of service.    Employees at the ANC's headquarters said yesterday that they  were saddened by the development. Most had hoped to be  integrated into the public service.    Ramaphosa would not comment yesterday. A news briefing would  be organised next week to outline the reorganisation, he said.</p>

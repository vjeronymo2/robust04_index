			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Radical EC job creation plan close to conclusion THE European Commission is close to concluding radical plans to tackle Europe's growing unemployment crisis, including the possibility of member states adjusting tax and social security policies to create jobs. The plan, expected to be agreed by the Commission next Wednesday, is likely to be the centrepiece of the European Community's increasingly urgent efforts to demonstrate their search for solutions to unemployment. The central idea is to find ways of stimulating a more labour-intensive pattern of economic growth. According to senior officials, the plan, which is still being refined, will draw on experience in the US and Japan where much higher percentages of the workforce are employed. Officials in Brussels say a recovery in growth will not be enough to deal with EC unemployment levels now at 17.4m, or 10.3 per cent, more than half of which is structural rather than cyclical, or to combat under-employment. 'If we don't come up with something on this we'll be in serious trouble,' one said, though he cautioned that 'we are not claiming to do more than we can deliver'. He said measures at national level would be decisive. Following its expected approval on May 26, it will then be discussed by labour and social affairs ministers on June 1 in Luxembourg, with the intention of sending recommendations to the Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government on June 21-22. Officials say the intention is to develop the strategy over the next 18 months, in collaboration with national governments, which would need to decide what measures to take. It is intended that all EC councils whose work affects jobs, ranging from finance to environment ministers, contribute to the strategy. The focus of the strategy is likely to be on: Tax and social security changes. 'We must see what can be done to shift charges away from employment costs,' one senior official says, adding that in many EC countries a heavy tax and social security burden for employers inhibits job creation. Changes in working time designed to promote more sharing out of employment opportunities. Officials argue that in the US, where around 75 per cent of the potential workforce is employed against nearer 60 per cent in the EC, household incomes have risen through work-sharing, even though income per head has remained roughly static. A review of national welfare and unemployment benefit systems to eliminate disincentives to work. Officials say the emphasis is likely to be on increasing and co-ordinating spending on 'active' manpower measures, like training, retraining and job counselling. At present, only 0.8 per cent of EC gross domestic product, out of a total unemployment benefits bill of nearly 2.3 per cent of GDP, is spent on active measures. Already member states are saying they want to be closely involved in different parts of the strategy.</p>

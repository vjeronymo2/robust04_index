			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: HE'S ONE MODEL PLAYER  </P> <P> Roger Craig, the San Francisco 49ers star running back, has had a steady stream  of modeling and acting jobs since he started appearing in Macy's California  Passport fashion shows. Now he's doing ads for Calvin Klein underwear and for  various drinks and shoes favored by jocks. And then there are his TV-host and  exercise-video careers. If you think he's ready for a starring role in a movie,  you're right: Craig plays a cop in a Roger Corman action film due out next  month.  </P> <P> NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: Guy Greengard, the genial owner of the Mr. Guy store who  left Rodeo for Canon Drive less than a year ago and recently filed a Chapter 11  bankruptcy petition, says it isn't over yet. "The location just hasn't worked  out traffic-wise," he told Listen. But he added that he will probably open  another, smaller store soon.  </P> <P> VAL'S PALS: Italian fashion king Valentino will be wined and dined Beverly  Hills-style when he arrives in town Nov. 25 to celebrate the recent opening of  his store at Two Rodeo Drive. Reported plans include Swifty Lazar's dinner at  Spago, Betsy Bloomingdale's lunch at home and Barry Diller's dinner at an  undetermined location. The capper is Valentino's own cocktail party at the new  store Nov. 28, with a cast of several hundred including "so many stars it will  look like the Academy Awards," says his new West Coast spokeswoman, Laurie  Bodor.  </P> <P> BACK TO SQWEAR ONE: Although he says he enjoyed helping pioneer the brightly  colored wardrobes the New Kids on The Block wear in their Coca-Cola  commercials, designer William Beranek, who co-founded L.A.-based Sqwear with  designer Henry Duarte, will step out on his own this holiday season. He has a  new line of contemporary men's apparel under the William B. label, to be  carried at J. C. Amber in Hollywood and Traffic in Los Angeles. He's gone  mainstream, but Beranek assures Listen his star-wardrobing days are not  numbered. Late night talk show host Arsenio Hall and singer Stevie B. have  placed orders between $220 and $600, he says.  </P> <P> THE 18-K HEDGE: What recession? Gianmaria Buccellati, designer and owner of the  Buccellati jewelry and silver company, unveiled about $20-million worth of his  latest designs, including diamonds and gold worked to resemble a delicate  Venetian lace choker ($309,000). "Yes, there is a little contraction (in  business)," he said, "but I'm a worldwide jeweler, so one day if it's not good  in the United States, it is in Japan or France or Italy."

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 9 March the French Government made two  announcements imposing new conditions on the import of seafood  and fish products from countries outside the European Union.  The two announcements have hurt Thai fish products sent earlier  to France and those that are to be exported there. The  Association of Processed Food Producers estimated that the loss  is valued at about 70.66 million baht or 17 million francs. The  does not include losses by other associations such as the  Associations of Frozen Food and Marine Animal Traders.  Government agencies such as the Fishery Department, the  Commerce Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry are keeping close  contacts with France's agriculture and fishery ministries to  solve the problem. Since the new regulations have been imposed  at the request of French fishermen dissatisfied with falling  fish prices, French agencies are reluctant to allow Thailand and  other countries to resume exporting fish products to their  market. The European Union has also expressed disagreement with  the action taken by France. The Thai private sector is  disappointed with France's sudden imposition of restrictions and  has proposed that the Thai Government resort to trade  retaliation against it if negotiations to tackle this problem  fail.    On 9 March, the Foreign Ministry summoned the French  ambassador to hear to the Thai complaint and has asked France to  allow Thai fish products to be sold in the French market as  before. Phirat Itsarasena na Ayutthaya, deputy permanent  secretary for foreign affairs, has been assigned to follow up.  The French ambassador has promised to bring Thailand's request  to French agencies for urgent consideration.</p>

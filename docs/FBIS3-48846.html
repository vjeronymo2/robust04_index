NODONG SINMUN today brands the "trinity" as a slogan of the  puppet authorities and comprador entrepreneurs to crack down on  the workers' struggle for wage hike and vital rights under the  pretext of "economic stability" and "increase of  competitiveness."    The news analyst says:    That day the traitor Kim Yong-sam preached "labor-management  harmony", saying rather "humane treatment" is necessary than  wage hike in order to make this year "the first year free from  labor-management disputes." This is quite ill-intentioned.    By "labor-management harmony" he meant that the workers must  refrain from any demand and any protest but meekly yield to the  exploitation by the employers.    Kim Yong-sam told the businessmen that he would loosen the  "regulations" obstructive to business activities to the extent  that the employers are satisfied.    Although Kim Yong-sam wants the workers to work silently  without protesting to the "government" and the employers, it is  a futile dream.    The South Korean workers and people will not be cheated by  the traitor's sermon on "labor-management harmony" and "trinity"  but rise up courageously in the struggle to overthrow the  "civilian"-veiled regime.</p>

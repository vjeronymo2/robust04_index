After consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of the expiration of DED for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside El Salvador has improved significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> December 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ronald Chirlin, Senior Immigration Examiner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Examinations Division, 425 I Street, NW, Room 3214, Washington, DC 20536, Telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 303 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, designated El Salvador for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for a period of eighteen (18) months beginning January 1, 1991, and ending June 30, 1992. Eligible nationals of El Salvador who registered under this special TPS program were required to register by October 31, 1991, and to reregister as required in order to extend TPS benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temporary Protected Status ended on June 30, 1992. However, on June 26, 1992, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced in the Federal Register at 57 FR 28700 that the deportation of eligible nationals of El Salvador who had registered for TPS would not be enforced before June 30, 1993. On June 8, 1993, the Service announced in the Federal Register at 58 FR 32157 a further extension until December 31, 1994, of deferred enforced departure (DED) for eligible Salvadorans. The two announcements were made at the direction of former President Bush and President Clinton respectively. Both these grants of DED were based on the serious negative effects that a large repatriation would have had on the then evolving situation in El Salvador. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of the expiration of DED for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside El Salvador has improved significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to ensure an opportunity for Salvadoran beneficiaries of DED to apply for an employment authorization document (EAD), the Service is granting an automatic extension until September 30, 1995, of the validity of any EAD which expires on December 31, 1994, and was previously issued to a DED Salvadoran pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(11). Affected Salvadorans should apply for their new EADs at least 3 months before the expiration of the automatic extension (that is, no later than June 30, 1995) in order to ensure continuous employment authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Employers of DED Salvadorans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employers of DED Salvadorans whose employment authorization is automatically extended may not refuse to accept, for purposes of verifying or reverifying employment eligibility until September 30, 1995, an employment authorization document (EAD), Form I&hyph;688B, bearing an expiration date of December 31, 1994, (or extension sticker punched for December 1994) and containing a notation ``274a.12(a)(11)'' or ``274a.12(a)(12)'' on the face of the document under ``Provision of Law.''

Cal. 1991) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '') affected Salvadorans will be able to maintain legal employment authorization pending a review of their asylum applications. Those  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  class members who have not filed asylum applications will have an opportunity to do so. In addition to the rights afforded under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  agreement, many Salvadorans have adjusted and will continue to adjust status to lawful permanent residence on the basis of family relationships and other grounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All Salvadorans who initially registered for TPS, regardless of whether they later registered for DED, are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  class members. As  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  class members, they are entitled to certain rights under the agreement. On or about March 31, 1995, the Service will send class members a notice advising that they must submit an initial asylum application (Form I&hyph;589) with the INS appropriate service center within 90 days, if they have not filed an asylum application previously. A previously filed asylum application may be supplemented. Class members also have the option of filing a new asylum application even if they had previously filed for asylum. Class members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum application until the date of the decision by the asylum officer. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

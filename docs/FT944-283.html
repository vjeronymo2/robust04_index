			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Reforms may prove to be a backward step - Japan If corruption means the exchange of favours for cash, it is part of the fabric of Japanese society. It has been increasing this year and is likely to go on rising in 1995. A new electoral system and elections for regional governors, mayors and part of the upper house this year suggests that the traffic in political influence, the root of most Japanese corruption, will get busier. The definition of corruption in Japan is as relative as the country's own moral code. Prosecutors tend to pounce only when they believe the behaviour of a company or politician has gone beyond the limits of public acceptability. To take only its most celebrated incident, the past year has seen the resignation of a prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, over allegations of borrowing from a parcel delivery company linked to gangsters. He was not prosecuted. It was a minor offence by the standards of the Lockheed bribery scandal of the 1970s and the Recruit shares for favours scandal of the 1980s. More spectacular than Mr Hosokawa's fall was the arrest last year and continuing bribery trial of a former construction minister, Mr Kishiro Nakamura. The case is linked to bribery cases involving 30 construction company executives and local politicians - the largest such affair since the war. On the corporate scene, there were revelations of bid rigging for overseas civil engineering contracts funded by Japanese development aid, plus insider dealing charges against 25 drug company employees. All this has corresponded with a steady rise in public aversion to politicians. The latter have sought to improve their image by a sweeping reform of the political and electoral system, which took effect on Christmas Day. Ostensibly, the change is designed to make politicians less beholden to special interests. Many believe it will, at least in its teething stages, have the opposite effect. It will make politicians fight harder for seats by replacing a multi-seat system, under which it was possible to get a seat with as little as 15 per cent of the vote, with a mixture of UK-style first-past-the-post single seat constituencies and European-style proportional representation regions. Corporate donations are to be curbed now and eliminated in five years' time, with a state subsidy for political parties, worth Y30.9bn (Pounds 198m) annually, thrown in as compensation. However, analysts believe the new system will have the effect of increasing politicians' need for cash. Vote-buying has been an important part of Japanese politics since the formation of the Liberal Democratic party in 1955, and the main reason its top people have been so frequently caught breaking the law. Under the old multi-seat system, LDP members often had to compete against one another to win seats. They were unable to offer voters a choice of policies, unless they had the good fortune to be one of the few LDP men standing against a Socialist. So an envelope stuffed with cash had to do instead; even better, a construction contract for a local company or a new swimming pool or road for an influential district. A sitting member needed to spend Y200m to Y300m in the six months leading up to an election, and Y50m to Y200m in routine annual running costs, depending on the size of the constituency, just to stay in business, estimates Mr Dan Harada, a political consultant. Under the new system, the average politician will need to collect nearly twice as many votes as before to get elected. He will have to be top of the poll, rather than in the first five or six. He or she will also be under just as much pressure as before to buy those extra votes with cash, rather than policies. The recently formed main opposition party, the New Frontier party, espouses policies largely indistinguishable from the LDP, while the Socialist party has dropped most of its left-wing baggage to forge a coalition with the LDP.</p>

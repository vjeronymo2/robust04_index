			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Grigoriy Kolodin: "The Manat Has </F> Prompted Respect for...the Ruble"]    [Text] Turkmenia -- It has been nearly five months since  the introduction of the national currency in Turkmenia -- the  manat. That is certainly long enough to consider the initial  results of the circulation of the new money and what effect this  unavoidable step has had on the country's economy. It was  indeed unavoidable, although banknotes and coins manufactured  beforehand in Britain, were ready and waiting, but the  government thought that at that time Turkmenia was not yet fully  prepared for the switch to its own currency. It was only when  it became obvious that the Russian authorities were planning to  force their CIS neighbors out of the ruble zone that Turkmenia  accelerated the introduction of the manat.    November was a month of euphoria and...empty pocketbooks.  The exchange of citizens' savings was carried out in such a way  as to drastically reduce the money supply. However, even with a  mere handful of coins in his pocket, a person felt quite  solvent. For 5 kopeks (that is what people here habitually call  the small change -- the tenge) you could buy the latest  newspaper or eat a bread roll, and for 20 you could buy a loaf  or stick of wheaten bread. With 2 chervonets, you could buy 10  eggs, some green vegetables, and a couple of kilograms of  apples. Potatoes cost 1 manat, and, just as in the good old  days of stagnation, traders would stick cardboard price tickets  into their piles of late melons, saying "1 melon -- 1 ruble."  And although, after the first pay packets were issued in the  new money, the Turkmens learned to count their small change in a  new way, for an average wage of 400 manats you could not only  feed yourself, but also buy, say, a pair of Italian shoes for  110 manats or a washing machine for 120 manats.    Alas, November and December, when the family budget was  "tight" but you could fill a bag with food products for a small  sum, are remembered here today as months of plenty and days of  bright hopes which, unfortunately, are not yet fated to become  reality. In Turkmenia it is still not the custom to publish  information on the inflation rate or to calculate the cost of  the consumer basket, but every inhabitant of the Republic can  see for himself every day how life is growing increasingly  expensive. Meat prices in the bazaars have risen from 5 to 50  manats a kilogram, the cost of fruit and vegetables has also  gone up, for the third month in succession the shelves of stores  selling industrial products are practically empty, and in the  few commercial stores the prices are certainly not suited to  people who are living only on a wage. And without the  continuing government subsidies on flour and bread for the  population, so that bread still costs 20-30 tenge, without the  free provision of electricity, natural gas, and water and the  very low cost of housing, of sending children to preschool  institutions, and of travel on public transport, things would be  very tight indeed for the Turkmens.    It is certainly not the manat as such that is to blame for  the fact that the Republic, which in all previous years had a  deficit-free budget, is today spending more than it receives.  The financial hole in the state's pocket was caused by the huge  debts of the former brothers in the Union for natural gas  supplied in the past year. It is no joking matter that  Turkmenia is owed $1.5 billion by Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan,  and the other CIS countries -- a shortfall of nearly 380  "greenbacks" for every local inhabitant. The main debtors --  Ukraine and Georgia -- asked for their last year's debt of $700  million and $200 million respectively to be classified as a  Turkmen Government loan. Their wishes were accommodated, but  the first two months of this year elapsed without either Ukraine  or Georgia keeping its promise -- to pay for gas every 10 days.  It was necessary to resort to extreme measures and close the  valves on the pipelines to Ukraine. But apparently the  Ukrainian authorities are today more worried about the purely  internal political struggle and the disastrous decline of their  own economy.    President Saparmurad Niyazov and his team are intensively  seeking a way out of the crisis situation. Preparations have  been stepped up for the implementation if the plan for a gas  pipeline which will convey Turkmen natural fuel via Iran and  Turkey to Europe. The possibility of pumping gas through  Afghanistan to Pakistan is being examined. A major reform of  the agrarian sector is under way: More than 50,000 hectares of  formerly unused land has been handed over to private ownership.    But for the moment the manat remains a sideshoot of the  dollar and the ruble. Its real rate is falling rapidly. Having  ostensibly been set as equivalent to 50 cents and 500 Russian  rubles in November, today it only runs to 1 cent and 20 rubles.  The lack of Russian currency in the banks has been a severe blow  to state and business structures, which are 80 percent "tied" to  Russia. Contracts are being broken, former links are being  lost, and business circles can be heard increasingly frequently  dreaming: "If only we were back in the ruble area! We cannot  survive without Russia yet..."    As for survival, this is, of course, a slight exaggeration.  But common sense and the example of Belorusia [Belarus]  suggests that it is not a question of what picture there is on  the banknotes, but of preventing them from degenerating into  pretty colored candy wrappers.</p>

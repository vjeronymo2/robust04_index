			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / People: Succession settled at Hammerson Sydney Mason, the most notable survivor of the post Second World War generation of property tycoons, yesterday announced that he would relinquish the chairmanship of Hammerson this summer, after 44 years with the group. He is being succeeded by Geoffrey Maitland Smith (right), chairman of Sears and deputy chairman of Midland Bank, who has been a non-executive director of Hammerson since 1990. The company also announced that Ronald Spinney (far right) has been appointed as chief executive from May 1. He will take over from John Parry, the group's managing director, who will retire at the agm in June. Spinney was a founder of Greycoat, a development company that specialises in London offices, where he was deputy chairman and joint managing director until he resigned in February 1992. He is a non-executive director of the London Docklands Development Corporation. Mason, 72, said he was stepping down at a time when the group was experiencing the worst property downturn he had seen. 'After 40 years when we have had a a sustained growth in value, dividends and share prices, to go out at the bottom is sad.' This property recession was 'much more severe and much tougher in duration' than any that had preceded it. The scale of the collapse had been 'totally unforeseeable', he said. Mason, who will become a non-executive director and life president of Hammerson, began his career as a manager at Land Securities in 1943. He joined Hammerson in 1949 and succeeded Lew Hammerson as chairman in 1958. Mason took the company into overseas markets in the 1960s, making Hammerson the most international of the UK property groups. The company's best-known project is Brent Cross, in north London, which became the UK's first regional shopping centre when it was opened in 1976.</p>

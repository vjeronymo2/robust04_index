			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Maori mover One of New Zealand's more colourful characters, Dame Whina Cooper, who spent a lifetime defending Maori rights, has died at the age of 98. Born on a mud floor in a Maori cookhouse in December 1895, she founded the Maori Women's Welfare League in the 1950s but sprang to national prominence in 1975, when - in her eighth decade - she led a protest march of 5,000 Maoris from her Northland home to Wellington's parliament. Her nightly television appearances, hobbling with a walking stick on the 650-mile trek, brought her national fame. Maori activists later clashed bitterly with her, when she accepted a string of honours; independent to the end, she ignored her critics. Prime Minister Jim Bolger plans to attend her funeral this week; a noble gesture, given that in 1991 she told him that his sacking of Maori affairs minister Winston Peters would bring him curses from Satan.</p>

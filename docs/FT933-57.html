			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela strengthens ahead of elections Venezuela showed the best performance in dollar terms last week among the world's emerging markets as investors reacted positively to comments by Mr Rafael Caldera, the independent candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections. Nevertheless, specialists in the market remain nervous about the medium term direction of equities, and forecast unsettled trading ahead of polling day, scheduled for the beginning of December. Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities says that a number of factors encouraged trading in Venezuela last week. These included comments by Mr Caldera that, in general, economic and financial reform policies initiated by the current administration would be continued; an apparent lull in the recent spate of terrorist bombings; and stability in the level of int-erest rates, currently at some 50 per cent. Access to foreign investment in Venezuela is concentrated in ADRs traded in New York, says Mr Laffan. There are around eight ADRs, a high number for the region when compared with Colombia's one and Chile's four, and this broad access has also contributed to the market's rise. Turkey featured once again last week in the table compiled by the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank. Global Securities in Istanbul comments that bullish sentiment over nine-month earnings expectations, and enthusiasm for shares in companies on the government's privatisation list, have continued to push the market forward.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Dollar terms                    No. of        Sep 24     % Change     % Change Market             stocks          1993    over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina           (11)         712.27        -2.4         +22.8 Brazil              (44)         230.36        -5.4         +84.3 Chile               (20)         441.35        +1.1          +5.5 Colombia1            (8)         471.79        +1.1         +11.0 Mexico              (57)         706.73        +0.7          +4.5 Venezuela2           (8)         535.52       +11.4          +3.1 East Asia South Korea3       (130)          95.97        +1.9          -2.2 Philippines         (11)         192.66        -1.3         +44.3 Taiwan, China4      (76)          80.23        -2.2          +8.7 South Asia India5              (61)          92.25        -1.5          -1.6 Indonesia6          (31)          93.99        -3.1         +60.1 Malaysia            (61)         237.36        +1.1         +45.1 Pakistan7            (8)         224.13        +1.8         +12.0 Thailand            (52)         271.94        -1.9         +18.0 Euro/Mid East Greece              (17)         218.98        +0.3         +12.1 Jordan               (5)         165.00        -4.4         +41.2 Portugal            (16)         105.88        -1.6         +37.2 Turkey8             (31)         177.55        +5.7        +165.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Local currency terms                    No. of        Sep 24     % Change     % Change Market             stocks          1993    over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina           (11)     437,064.89        -2.4         +23.1 Brazil              (44)  37,845,655.40        +1.7      +1,714.8 Chile               (20)         723.00        +1.6         +12.7 Colombia1            (8)         676.86        +0.9         +10.7 Mexico              (57)         946.20        +0.6          +4.2 Venezuela2           (8)       1,179.26       +12.1         +26.3 East Asia South Korea3       (130)         102.04        +1.9          +0.3 Philippines         (11)         259.02        -1.0         +60.2 Taiwan, China4      (76)          80.27        -2.3         +15.1 South Asia India5              (61)         102.02        -1.5          +6.8 Indonesia6          (31)         107.30        -3.1         +63.1 Malaysia            (61)         223.28        +1.1         +41.5 Pakistan7            (8)         303.11        +1.8         +30.8 Thailand            (52)         271.67        -1.8         +16.5 Euro/Mid East Greece              (17)         348.36        +1.5         +22.3 Jordan               (5)         234.53        -4.3         +41.4 Portugal            (16)         122.04        -0.2         +56.5 Turkey8             (31)       1,001.94        +8.1        +273.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

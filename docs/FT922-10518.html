			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / A financial stitch in Time: The world's largest media group is restructuring Dollars 7.2bn of debt. Will the strategy work? Ever since it was formed in a Dollars 14bn merger in 1989, Time Warner, the world's biggest media group, has been out of favour with Wall Street. This week, as it launches a Dollars 7.2bn restructuring of the debt taken on in the takeover, there are signs that investors are starting to warm towards the company once more. Many observers of the entertainment industry seem to have been persuaded by the company that its latest plan - being worked on by Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and others - to reschedule most of its Dollars 8.7bn of debt will ease short-term financial constraints. Debt has been the name of the game at Time Warner since its formation in a highly leveraged merger which ranked among the last hurrahs of 1980s corporate deal-making. Last year Time Warner spent Dollars 966m on debt servicing alone. The onerous debt burden has preoccupied top management, eaten up large chunks of cash flow, hindered the company's ability to make large strategic acquisitions and plunged it into the red, in spite of healthy operating profits at its main divisions. The search for a solution to the debt problem has highlighted the controversial management style of Steve Ross, the fast-talking chairman who recently engineered the resignation of Nick Nicholas, his co-chief executive. It is a story of four personalities: Ross; his Israeli-born adviser, Ed Aboodi; Jerry Levin, the new co-chief executive; and Nicholas. Many of the differences between the two camps concerned how to get the debt down. Nicholas, for example, favoured the disposal of up to 2m of the group's 7m US cable television subscribers, which could have raised as much as Dollars 4bn and stabilised the debt picture quickly. Nicholas wanted to sell off such operations, which he considered less strategic, in the same way as Rupert Murdoch disposed of assets at News Corporation or Lou Gerstner at R J R Nabisco. But Ross, as his friends note, never sells anything. He prefers complex financial mosaics such as the present debt restructuring being spearheaded by Aboodi, a friend who is part of the Ross kitchen cabinet. The heart of the Time Warner debt restructuring plan is a fresh Dollars 6.2bn bank loan that shifts debt off the main balance sheet to a newly created subsidiary, and stretches out the timetable for repayments of principal that would otherwise have started to come due next year. There is also a separate Dollars 1.1bn private placement in the works that will replace other bank loans. A closer look at Time Warner's finances suggests that the Ross-Aboodi approach, while conserving assets, is more costly to the company's shareholders, who have never seen a share price of Dollars 200, promised at the time of the merger. The rescheduled debt will probably carry a higher interest rate. Nicholas believed that Ross and Aboodi were engaged in financial pyrotechnics that would neither boost the stock price nor generate enough cash to reduce the debt rapidly. In February he paid for his disagreement with Ross when he was forced out. The elevation of Levin appears to mark the triumph of the highly personal style of management epitomised by Ross. Colleagues say Levin, who once headed Time Warner's cable division, is attuned to the entertainment side of Time Warner and especially to 'Steve's way of thinking'. The Ross style was most harshly criticised by former Senator Abraham Ribicoff, an opponent of Ross's who quit the Warner Communications board in 1987 and made a blistering remark cited recently in To the End of Time, a book about the merger by former Time executive Richard Clurman: 'I have never in my life been with a board so subservient to the chairman or the CEO,' said Ribicoff, adding: 'You have a bunch of morons on the board completely manipulated by Steve Ross, stooges to give Steve Ross anything he wanted.' One of the things Ross acquired with the Time Warner merger was a 10-year Dollars 196m compensation package, including Dollars 78.2m in 1990 and more than Dollars 70m of stock options in 1991. Substantial chunks of the package consisted of a one-off payment for his interests in Warner. Ross has been attacked fiercely by shareholders for the scale of his pay. This has been especially awkward in the current climate in the US, where shareholders are scrutinising the pay of some top executives. Wall Street has generally applauded the replacement of the cost-conscious Nicholas by the more visionary Levin. Levin's defenders maintain that this is because he has a broader view of Time Warner's future than Nicholas, who, since resigning, has been depicted by Levin and Ross's allies as an unimaginative 'bean counter'. But a certain amount of bean counting is no bad thing at a behemoth such as Time Warner, with operating earnings of Dollars 2.26bn in 1991, and debt-servicing costs that resulted in a loss of Dollars 692m. Ross has been full of optimistic forecasts for the future of his company, but with a few exceptions, such as the cable business, few new revenue streams and profit sources have been created by the supposed synergies touted at the time of the merger. In the words of Allan Sloan, the US columnist: 'As far as I can see, the formation of Time Warner resulted in one giant, high-debt company replacing two big, low-debt companies that were perfectly able to compete on their own.' As presently structured, Time Warner's debt calls for annual repayment of principal - of Dollars 2.3bn in 1993 and of Dollars 1.4bn each year from 1994 to 1997. Projections by analysts who have studied Time Warner's accounts indicate that the company will not achieve a net profit - defined as net after all interest and dividend payments costs are calculated - before 1994. The debt rescheduling now under way will stretch out maturities. Even bullish analysts such as Ms Jessica Reif of Oppenheimer, the New York investment firm, say the group's 1992 loss after preferred dividend payments is likely to be Dollars 430m. These calculations include not only the present Dollars 8.7bn debt, largely in bank loans, but also Dollars 6.3bn more of preferred stock generated by the merger. Normally such preferred stock is considered equity rather than debt, but Ms Reif says that 'nobody thinks of this as equity. It's debt.' The reason, in part, is that the stock can be converted into debt at Time Warner's option. The company's balance sheet may be debt-laden, but each of the five operating divisions - the Hollywood studio, the music business, the magazine and book publishing division, the HBO cable programming division and the company that operates cable television systems for home subscribers - has a strong underlying cash flow. The cable systems division is the biggest money spinner, and generated nearly Dollars 900m of operating income last year, followed by music (Dollars 560m), films (Dollars 390m), publishing (Dollars 246m) and cable programming (Dollars 195m). Unlike Murdoch, who sold off assets, Ross has pursued complex fund-raising ventures devised by Aboodi, who is not a Time Warner executive but who sits in company headquarters and plots company strategy. Aboodi was behind last year's controversial rights issue, which eventually raised Dollars 2.6bn, but only after a revolt from investors  - alarmed that their holdings would be seriously diluted if they did not participate - caused Time Warner to make a change in the offer terms. The 50-year-old Aboodi was also the man behind a joint venture, soon to be completed, with Japan's Toshiba and C Itoh, the trading house. The Japanese companies are putting up Dollars 1bn for 12.5 per cent of a Time Warner subsidiary that includes the company's movie, cable programming and cable operations assets and is called Time Warner Entertainment (TWE). The next step of the joint venture plan is to try to raise another Dollars 1bn or Dollars 2bn by bringing in a European partner or Chinese-language investor from Hong Kong, or even a US partner. Bankers say Aboodi's most urgent priority, which should come to fruition by June, will be to move Dollars 7bn of Time Warner's Dollars 8.7bn of debt over to TWE. The debt rescheduling, assuming it succeeds, will probably be presented as a victory by Time Warner. Yet moving debt to an 87.5 per cent-owned subsidiary does not make overall debt servicing costs, of Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m a year, go away. Stretching out billions of dollars of principal repayments, however, will at least put off the day of reckoning. There is another reason why TWE is not a panacea for Time Warner. As part of its creation of the subsidiary vehicle, TW will spend about Dollars 1bn to buy up the remaining 18 per cent it does not already own of American Television and Communications (ATC), a publicly quoted cable operating subsidiary. ATC will then be placed in TWE. 'The Dollars 1bn comes in from Toshiba and Itoh and it goes out again as new net debt to pay for the ATC shares,' says one adviser to Ross. A top Time Warner executive, with knowledge of the company's financial commitments, puts it this way: 'This company has been jumping through unbelievably complex hoops, but it hasn't really changed the debt profile.' Time Warner is very sensitive to outside criticism - from shareholders or from the media. It has argued that critics focus too narrowly on its debt burden, which masks the group's real strength in cash flow terms. In the past, Ross has always managed to confound his critics, rising from his first job at an undertakers to his present role as one of the US's best known and best paid executives. Now in poor health, he is determined to preserve his legacy at Time Warner. With Levin as his heir apparent, a debt rescheduling under way, and Wall Street warming to his cause, he has gone some way towards achieving this ambition. History's judgment of his achievements, however, are likely to rest on whether the next few years produce a lasting solution to the debt problem and some clear evidence of the synergies promised from the merger. Unless Time Warner can deliver these, Wall Street's more favourable view of the company may prove temporary.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TIME WARNER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars bn                 1988      1989      1990      1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues                   4.51      7.64     11.52     12.02 Long-term debt             1.49     10.84     11.18      8.72 Preferred shares           na      5.58      5.94      6.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

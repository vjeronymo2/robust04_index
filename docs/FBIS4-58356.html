			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Secret Kuwaiti-Iraqi Meeting in </F> Algeria for First Time Since Gulf War"]    [Excerpts] Rabat -- AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI has learned from  reliable sources that Algeria is making active diplomatic  efforts to conduct a mediation between Iraq and Kuwait. And  that a meeting was actually held in Algiers recently between  Iraqi and Kuwaiti officials for the first time since the Gulf  war.    The sources said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad's visit to Algiers during his Maghreb tour this week  was not actually made at the invitation of the Algerian Foreign  Ministry as mentioned in the joint press statement issued at the  end of the visit. It was made at the Kuwaiti foreign minister's  request and in response to the Kuwaiti Government's attempt to  break the isolation imposed on Kuwait since the Gulf war.    But Algeria, on receiving the Kuwaiti request, proposed --  or, rather, made it a condition -- that Algerian mediation  should be initiated between Kuwait and Iraq during the Kuwaiti  foreign minister's visit in return for announcing that the visit  was made at the Algerian Foreign Ministry's invitation.    Kuwait agreed to the Algerian proposal and hence the visit  took place. The Algerian Foreign Ministry believes the visit  will achieve success for it with regard to the two countries,  Iraq and Kuwait. [passage omitted]    The sources said that Kuwait's attempts to achieve  rapprochement with the Arab states that supported Iraq in the  Gulf war began not so long ago.    In this connection Kuwait sent two ministers to Algeria  before Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmad's visit. These visits  were not covered by the official media because of Kuwait's  refusal in the past to receive any Algerian official. [passage  omitted]    It is worth mentioning that the Kuwaiti foreign minister's  visit took place only two weeks after the visit to Algeria by  Barzan al-Tikriti, adviser to the Iraqi president, who delivered  a message to Algerian President Liamine Zeroual from Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn.    No information was issued about Barzan's visit. His  activities remained almost secret. Even Iraqi Embassy officials  in Algiers did not know the reason for Barzan's visit to Algeria  or its results.

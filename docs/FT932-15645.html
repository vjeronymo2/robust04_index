			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fashion: The multiples wake up to a new sense of style - Consumers are more canny about their shopping, and British chain stores are at last responding to that THERE IS, says Brian Godbold, head of design at Marks and Spencer, an inverted snobbery operating on behalf of the retail multiples. 'During the 1980s people desired the glamour of up-market designer labels; now, in the 1990s, they derive satisfaction from good-sense shopping.' To be able to say: 'Gosh, it's just good old Marks and Spencer' in response to a compliment apparently makes us feel clever and slightly smug. Being sensible does not, however, mean being dowdy. The compliments are part of the deal. Women are trading down only in terms of price and label cachet. They still want high quality and they still want good, fashionable design. There is, in itself, nothing remarkable about this information - it is what most customers would have said they have always wanted. What is remarkable is that, at last, the multiples, which have long had the largest slice of the British clothing market and a nice complacency to go with it, accept it and are acting on it. Two factors have come in to play. One is a new academic approach to market research and a readiness to believe what it says. The other is a willingness to use the information, to take what once would have been considered foolhardy risks. The multiples have found the courage to lead the market rather than follow it by employing the best designers whose instincts are so good they cannot help but innovate. And they can get the best designers because they can offer them jobs where growth and excitement can be guaranteed. 'If,' says Mike France, buying director at British Home Stores, 'you take The Gap as the doyen of the 'fashion-moderate' look, an area in which we operate, it is clear that its policy of constantly up-dating its classic merchandise is what keeps its customers coming back. For the designer, that is a tough and endlessly stimulating project.' Maintaining the perception that freshness and novelty are constants in a store is even more important than before, says Diane Grant Davidson, of C &amp; A. 'It is not a question of multiple purchases any more. The customer is carefully buying one item and then returning the following week for something to go with it. She must not feel bored when she comes back. There must be excitement and amusement. We have always had to be very nimble but now we are dancing a very intricate dance.' All the multiples have developed similar policies in order to do more than merely survive the new recessionary era of padlocked purses and cut-up credit cards. They intend quite aggressively to increase their market share. 'We are,' says Brian Godbold of M&amp;S, 'chasing names like Joseph and Whistles. While satisfying our traditional customer, we have widened our appeal to scoop up the money which younger customers spend on fashion basics  -tights, leggings, bodies, jeans, polo-neck sweaters, blazers, stretch jodhpurs. These and other fashion basics are among our top-selling 25 items and those top 25 items make up 10 per cent of our business. We had basic, well-cut bell-bottoms in almost as soon as they were seen on the catwalks of the international designers - and at Pounds 19.99. Once the fashion-conscious customer knows she can get the foundation of the latest look from us, at that price, why should she go anywhere else?' If M &amp; S is chasing the smart, price-conscious independents, BhS and C &amp; A are, in different respects, chasing M &amp; S. C &amp; A, a specialist in throw-away young fashion, has for many years been developing the older, higher quality working-woman Yessica range. 'The little suit, the workplace uniform was a wonderful formula for women. But that well is drying up,' says Diane Grant-Davidson. 'Currently, the impetus, the excitement is coming from street fashion, the youth-cult, seventies revival grunge look. Our designers have gone with that direction, reproducing the look and providing all its basic elements for our youngest customers and allowing its softening influence to affect the fabrics, proportions and details of the rest of the merchandise.' BhS, on the other hand, a company which three years ago was suffering severe financial difficulties, has significantly increased its share of the market by, in the aftermath of his frustrated departure from the Storehouse group, accepting Sir Terence Conran's legacy and adopting the policies so doggedly resisted by management during his tenure there. It has discarded the dull and banal and embraced both fashion and good design. Its clothes for teenagers are at the cutting edge of youthful fashion, while its grown-up basic wardrobes for women and men are stylish and fashion-influenced. 'Our customer,' says Liz Broughan, BhS buying director of womenswear, 'was into long skirts so fast you would not believe it. After the 1980s the customer has become very confident. She is educated in fashion, in what suits her, in the appearance she wants to present. And she is very independent-minded about it. Many remember the long skirt from the mid-eighties, of course, and know that it need not look 'frumpy', merely pretty - like the Ralph Lauren prairie skirt, for instance.' When ex-Next boss George Davies first mentioned demographics and the needs of baby-boomers as the platform for the launch of Next, many arthritic mass retailers mocked it as a gimmick. They, with their years of experience, knew better. Heedlessly, they continued to patronise their customers. They have been made to eat their dismissive words. 'Information is the most important tool we have,' says Brian Godbold of M &amp; S. 'The fact that the population is ageing - by the turn of the century more than half the adults in Britain will be over 50 - is on our side. Those are our customers. But we have to be aware that the new 50-year-olds are not like the old ones. They are much more demanding, much more fashion-aware, much more critical of quality.' 'Most of our customers,' says Helena Packshaw, marketing director of BhS, 'work full or part-time. The typical customer has children and they are her first spending priority; she finds it easy to justify spending on them. But, on a shopping trip, she likes to give herself little treats: a cup of coffee or a new sweater. If she wants it, she will rationalise the purchase in terms of need. 'She also buys 80 per cent of the menswear we sell because she is very style-conscious and wants to upgrade the appearance of the man in her life. She wants him to look as if he is with her. Price might be critical in her choices but it is also secondary. First, the product must meet her fairly exacting standards of style and quality. 'The customer has money but she feels bruised and burned by the recession, cheated and apprehensive. There is a feeling that no job is safe, that any promises of recovery are not to be trusted and caution is the wisest course. To persuade her to part with her money we have to meet all her criteria.' The policy is easy to formulate; the merchandise is much harder to provide. Only the designer can do that. Belatedly, managers and accountants have learned to trust those exotic creatures whose thought processes always seemed alien, more like instinct, whim and vague feeling than an exercise in logic. 'It has,' says Brian Godbold, 'been a long struggle to be taken seriously but now we have a terrific working relationship between design and business, a rare confidence in each other.' His department at M &amp; S employs 25 designers led by Sheilagh Brown, one of the best-known and most respected designers of her (babyboomer) generation. 'We have no problem recruiting the best people because they can see the potential in the business,' says Godbold. In addition, he uses designers such as Paul Smith and Betty Jackson as consultants. The department's function is to provide a design brief for each buying group within the company and to work closely with the designers employed by Marks and Spencer's suppliers. 'It means that, at last, we have consistency across the business, a coherent point of view, and the trust of the management when we move into the more risky fashion areas.' For the last year or so, Godbold has been allowed to leave part of his budget uncommitted so that he can respond quickly to a hot fashion trend. 'For example, last spring we bought Pounds 2m worth of gingham from a standing start and had it in the stores fast. It sold out. We did another Pounds 5m and then, when that sold out, went to Pounds 10m, which also sold out, and then got out. The secret is to get in fast and get out fast. Last autumn we did the same with Pounds 7m worth of animal print and at Christmas we shifted Pounds 15m worth of tartan in a matter of weeks.' The current revival of 1970s styles represents another area of high risk for the multiples. They know that a fashion swing like this is so powerful that virtually all the young will adopt it - but do the multiples, with their vast floor spaces and their need to please all of the people most of the time, have the 'street cred' to convince the young that their bell-bottoms and crocheted singlets should come from the place where mum buys her knickers? On the strength of their phenomenal success with leggings, polo tops and bodies, they are sure that they do. 'All you can say,' says Helena Packshaw of BhS, 'is that the sharper and more fashion-conscious we have become, the better our sales figures. We are growing and gaining market share. We are 9 per cent up this financial year; it was 10 per cent last year.' Adds her colleague, Mike France: 'The present economic conditions will prevail for a long time yet and the psychological effects of this recession will be felt for a lot longer. Lazy retailers will not survive. You must be innovatory. You must lead.'</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILKEN MAY GET $100-MILLION PAY FOR 1988  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors are considering whether to reverse course and allow Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc. to pay Michael R. Milken more than $100 million for work  he did last year, sources said today.  </P> <P> The provision barring Drexel from paying its indicted former junk bond trader  his 1988 compensation was included in the investment firm's formal settlement  of criminal securities fraud charges with the government.  </P> <P> The withholding has been controversial because Milken has not been charged with  any wrongdoing in 1988. Milken has challenged the provision in U.S. District  Court in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be named, said prosecutors  have not made a final decision on whether to pay Milken his compensation,  estimated at more than $100 million.  </P> <P> But they indicated that a reversal may be made because legal experts have  criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and that the  government may not want to start its case against Milken off on the wrong foot.  </P> <P> They said that ending the lengthy delay in Drexel's plea in the case was not a  factor in reconsidering the payment provision.  </P> <P> Drexel, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carroll and a Milken spokesman all declined  comment.  </P></p>

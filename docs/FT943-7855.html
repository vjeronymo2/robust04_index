			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Solid sales growth at Reliance Industries Reliance Industries, the textiles and petrochemicals conglomerate, boosted first-quarter sales by 25 per cent, and is confident of improved results for the year. Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, chairman and managing director, told the annual meeting yesterday that sales rose to Rs16.48bn (Dollars 525.3m) compared with the first quarter of last year. 'Reliance has emerged as India's largest corporation in terms of sales, gross profit, net profit, net worth and assets,' Mr Ambani said. He added that India's liberalisation programme had given the company 'unprecedented freedom to set new and even more ambitious goals', meaning there had been 'an all-round improvement' in the group's performance. Reliance achieved a record total income of Rs54.61bn last year, with a net profit of Rs5.75bn on sales of Rs53.45bn, compared with last year's profit of Rs3.22bn on sales of Rs41.06bn. Mr Ambani said the Rs50bn expansion programme, most of which was dedicated to the construction of new plants at Reliance's Hazira petrochemicals complex, could allow the the company to emerge as a 'world ranking player'. The first of the new plants is expected to commence production from early 1995, increasing the company's production capacity to 6m tonnes from 1.4m tonnes. Reliance's capacity for the production of polyester will increase to 550,000 tonnes a year from 200,000 tonnes, making it one of the top 10 polyester producers in the world. The company's petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat will house the world's largest paraxylene facility. Production capacity of this feedstock material will rise to 1.38m tonnes a year.</p>

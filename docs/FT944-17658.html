			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Cardoso pledge on Brazil social problems Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso claimed victory in Brazil's presidential elections yesterday, promising to tackle the country's huge social problems and seek a higher profile in international affairs. Mr Cardoso, a former academic turned social democrat politician, was speaking for the first time since Monday's poll, which, with more than half the votes counted, he appears to have won easily. Sitting in front of an enormous Brazilian flag, Mr Cardoso said: 'The biggest task is to overcome our social injustice. We are no longer an undeveloped country, we are the 10th largest economy in the world, but we have huge social problems.' He promised especially to improve education, where Brazil lags behind many other developing nations, and basic health services. Mr Cardoso said Brazil's new economic stability, brought by the Real currency which he helped launch this year as finance minister, gave the country the opportunity to be more involved in regional and international affairs. Brazil wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and Mr Cardoso said the country needed to recognise that such claims demanded a 'very active' role in the world. Mr Cardoso said he was committed to private sector investment in areas of state monopoly and wanted to make private-sector joint ventures in oil and petroleum more flexible. However, state-owned Petrobras would not be privatised. Private sector investment would also be allowed in areas such as telecommunications and energy generation. Mr Cardoso favoured privatising Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the biggest state-controlled mining company. Mr Cardoso made some tough comments on Brazil's state-owned banks, many of which are in difficulty because of politically-inspired lending. Loss-making banks should be cleaned up rather than supported with government money. 'If a bank is doing badly it needs to be turned round,' he said, irrespective of whether the bank was controlled by a political ally or enemy. 'Brazil cannot postpone this decision any longer.' Some reforms, in areas such as tax reform and wage legislation, were needed to guarantee the continued success of the Real. He said these matters would be discussed with Congress and doubted any significant changes would be made before he becomes president on January 1. Mr Cardoso said he expected his victory would lead to greater foreign investment in Brazil. Some foreigners had delayed investments in case he lost to his main opponent, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. According to election authorities, with slightly over half the votes counted, Mr Cardoso leads Mr da Silva by 54 per cent to 25 per cent. Mr Cardoso said no 'radical measure' would be used to stop foreign investment flows if the Real continued to rise against the US dollar. Brazil holds back, Capital Markets page</p>

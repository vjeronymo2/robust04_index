			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (9): Product innovation is price of survival  -Research and development DESPITE the air of gloom now fashionable in Japanese industry, the search for new products still goes on. Nowhere is this more true than in the electronics industry, where product innovation is the price of survival. Severe though the latest downturn has been, it is not without precedent. Matsushita, for instance, saw its profits drop 39 per cent last year. But in the last two downturns, in the crisis years of 1975 and 1986, profits fell by 40 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. This year, like most Japanese manufacturers, Matsushita will be cutting its capital expenditure heavily. But research and development spending will actually rise slightly to Y430bn (Dollars 3.5bn). In the field of consumer electronics, products in development by the industry at large include wall-hanging flat screen TV sets, digital VCRs, digital compact cassettes and - above all - high definition television, or HDTV. Mr Frank Ohgai, planning director of Matsushita's audio-visual division, says: 'HDTV is the one key to growth in our business. By 1995-6, that's going to be a very popular market. Then people are going to need everything else to go with it - camcorders, VCRs and so on.' The other key development, he says, is in the combination of audio-visual and computer equipment for use in the home. 'But everyone is interested in that: the computer people like IBM, Apple and Microsoft, video games producers like Nintendo, movie software producers, educational publishers, manufacturers like ourselves. 'So we're still in a period of transition. The big question is what format will become the international standard and who will get there first.' It is only fair to point out that not everyone in Japan shares Mr Ohgai's confidence about the outlook for these products. On the subject of HDTV, Mr Masanori Moritani, a specialist writer on technology, is downright pessimistic: 'The question for HDTV is one of software - that is, the programmes people actually watch. The popular TV programmes in Japan are quiz shows, chat shows and programmes about eating out. What's the point of watching that kind of thing on high definition?' A more serious fundamental problem, he argues, lies in the size and cost - about Dollars 10,000 - of the HDTV set itself. 'In the past, Japanese companies have worked on miniaturisation. 'Whether that works for HDTV is an open question. 'Besides, earlier products like calculators or video recorders were genuinely new. People bought the earlier versions regardless of expense, and that helped to fund their development. But if you already have a TV, a VCR and a camcorder, where's the incentive to buy new versions which are three times as heavy and very much more expensive?' Mr Moritani is equally pessimistic about developments involving home computers. 'The trouble about home computers is that people don't know how to use them. At present, PCs are used for enjoyment by enthusiasts. Will housewives behave like computer freaks? 'If you can produce a computer on which you push two or three buttons and it does something really interesting, that could be feasible. But what are the interesting things a computer can do, and can we find them?' Mr Ohgai of Matsushita does not deny that the technological risks are enormous. His conclusion, though, is not that they should not be undertaken, but that they need joint funding to spread the risk. 'To create these huge markets needs so much investment that individual companies can't afford it. What is needed is international consortia, with the manufacturers getting together to establish agreements on formats and technical standards and to spread the investment risk.' In these consortia, he believes, each geographical region should play to its strengths. 'The hardware and software have to proceed in parallel. On into the 21st century, the computer and entertainment will still be handled by the US. The hardware will be in the hands of Japan or maybe other Asian countries, which are catching up fast. 'As for Europe, we respect the fact that the basic R&amp;D and technology is still in European hands. Japan's role here is its traditional one: to popularise the product and make it at an acceptable price'.</p>

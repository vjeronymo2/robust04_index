			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Dean &amp; Bowes trade warning Shares in Dean &amp; Bowes fell 2p to 8p after the contracting and construction group warned that its financial and trading position had 'materially worsened' and that it was only able to continue trading with the support of its bankers. The group which in February sold the pub refurbishment business to Mr Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief executive, said it had now negotiated the sale of the Plantonoff and Harris joinery business to Mr Dean for pounds 120,000 in cash. Further disposals might be necessary and there were plans to change the name of the business to Chequers Group.</p>

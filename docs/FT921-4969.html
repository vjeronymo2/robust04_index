			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Norway 'ready to force bank mergers' NORWAY may intervene to force the much-needed restructuring of its troubled banking system, Mr Tormod Hermansen, the chairman of the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) warned yesterday. Mr Hermansen said the state would implement a bank restructuring, including mergers, if the banks do not show signs of stabilising their finances and returning to profitability during 1993. The BIF was established last year and since then has seen NKr11bn in state cash go to Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, Norway's top three banks. Under the state's rescue programme it became the sole owner of Christiania and Fokus and majority owner of DnB. Mr Hermansen said the state did not want to keep its shareholdings in the banks any longer than necessary but that it may take three to four years before the banks make sufficient earnings to service their equity capital on a stable basis. Christiania warned on Wednesday that it needed at least NKr2.5bn in fresh state funding to meet new capital adequacy requirements. Fokus Bank has also said it needed additional cash. Mr Hermansen said that Christiania would get sufficient state funding to allow it to operate within legal requirements. Earlier this week the government warned the banks to do more to improve earnings and efficiency and cut costs. To this end, Christiania and Fokus said they would raise interest rates on loans and increase fees for services and products. DnB said that it was not planning to raise interest rates but would increase fees.</p>

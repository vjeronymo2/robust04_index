			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Rail companies may have to honour most tickets of rivals A potentially significant barrier to the smooth operation of ticket sales on Britain's newly-privatised railways could be lifted under proposals being considered by the railway franchising director, Mr Roger Salmon. One option being studied would oblige the private train-operating companies which take over British Rail franchises to accept most of the tickets issued by other train companies. Under the original rules governing rail privatisation, the new train operators would have only had to accept other full-fare and season tickets. These would account for just 20 per cent of all tickets issued. Many travellers could have been forced to buy more than one ticket if their journeys involved services operated by more than one train company. On routes with services provided by competing companies, travellers might not have been able to use the most convenient onward or return train. The 'interavailability' of tickets threatened to become a significant barrier to the smooth operation of the network after privatisation. But Mr Salmon, who has responsibility for selling off BR's operations, is now considering ways of increasing interavailability. One would be to make rail companies accept each other's tickets for most journeys. This would avert possible disruption to travellers if tickets were not accepted across the new network. Mr Salmon has faced complaints from passenger groups concerned about inconvenience to travellers. He wants train operators to accept most of each other's tickets. However, they could opt out if they proved that by not accepting the tickets of a rival, competition would be increased and the traveller would get a better deal. Mr Salmon is understood to want to extend 'interavailability' to cover Saver and Supersaver discount fares. Season and full-fare tickets would be valid across the network under the original rules. But the cheapest fares, Apex tickets which must be bought at least seven days in advance and which apply to a particular train, would not be covered by the new arrangement. However, Mr Salmon estimates that more than 80 per cent of journeys would now be included. Fears about this issue were fanned earlier this year with the publication of an internal BR memo by a senior manager. The document described the government's promise that rail companies would honour each other's tickets as 'a bit of a con' because discounted fares were excluded.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Baltica Holding winds up assets after loss BALTICA HOLDING, the troubled Danish insurance and financial services group, yesterday reported a DKr4.4bn (Dollars 699m) net loss for 1992 and said it would change its name and sell off all assets for the best price it could get, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. Baltica Holding last week announced a restructuring plan, under which it divorced itself from its healthy Baltica Forsikring insurance unit. A statement with Baltica Holding's annual result confirmed a widespread belief that the purpose of the holding company would now be to wind up all remaining assets and operations for the benefit of shareholders and creditors. The statement said the holding company and all units other than Baltica Forsikring would be given new names at the group's annual meeting in late April. It said the new holding company's aim was to 'divest its activities at a time and price which are deemed most suitable from a financial point of view'. Its remaining units include Baltica Bank, finance company Baltica Finans and brokerage firm Baltica Boers. Baltica Holding said its net losses included DKr1bn in unrealised share portfolio losses and DKr3.2bn in the real estate sector. Baltica Holding said its own capital had shrunk to DKr2.97bn at the end of 1992, against DKR7.4bn a year earlier, when the group made a modest DKr128m profit. Baltica Holding has suffered a string of disastrous real estate projects, including an offices and hotel complex in Gibraltar and the refurbishment of Denmark's national soccer stadium, Parken.</p>

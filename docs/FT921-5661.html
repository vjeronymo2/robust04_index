			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Philippine bank defers GDR plan THE state-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB) yesterday deferred a plan to issue global depository receipts (GDRs) for foreign investors. Instead, it announced a 2.27bn pesos public offering of 10 per cent of its outstanding capital, or 8.03m shares, under the government's continuing privatisation programme. The offering, which will reduce the government's holding in the bank to 57 per cent, is set for a March 16-27 roadshow. The shares will be listed on the local stock exchanges on March 30. Mr Edgardo Espiritu, president of PNB, the country's largest commercial bank, said the proposed GDR offering had been deferred until after the national elections in May, or 'until perceptions by foreign investors regarding Philippine stock issues improve. 'We feel it more advantageous to concentrate on the local market for the time being,' Mr Espiritu said. The GDR issue, which was to have been sold in Europe, the US and Japan, was expected to represent about 10 to 11 per cent of the bank's outstanding shares. At present, foreign ownership in PNB stands at about 15 to 17 per cent, according to Mr Espiritu. Philippine laws limit foreign holdings in local commercial banks to 30 per cent. The public offering follows the successful sale on January 27 of 67 per cent of Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, to a group of prominent local business groups. It is part of a privatisation programme launched in 1987 by the government of President Corazon Aquino. The programme has proceeded at a pace much slower than earlier expected. A feature of the PNB offering is a so-called 'greenshoe option'. A first in the local capital markets, the greenshoe option allows the underwriters to compensate for any variance in the offering's price, to be announced only at the end of the offer period, and the market price to which the underwriters are committed. The underwriting syndicate, composed of member-firms of the Investment Houses Association of the Philippines plus universal banks that do not own investment houses, may buy additional shares at the offer price from PNB or at market prices from the stock exchanges to offset any big variance, PNB officers said. PNB is setting aside up to 15 per cent of the offer for underwriters who may avail of the greenshoe option. A similar volume is also being allocated for existing shareholders. Including these latter allocations, the total public offering is expected to amount to 13 per cent of outstanding capital, or about 10.4m shares, bank officers estimate. PNB recently reported 1991 net profits of 4.02bn pesos, an increase of 21 per cent over the previous year. Gross revenues rose 29 per cent to 13.8bn pesos. PNB shares, which have a book value of 146 pesos each, currently trade on the local stock exchanges at a range of 285 pesos to 290 pesos, or a price/earnings ratio of nearly 6.</p>

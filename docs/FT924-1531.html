			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Argentine insurer's issue cleared THE ARGENTINE parliament has given the go-ahead for the privatisation of the Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro. The Caja, the largest insurance company in Argentina with a 13 per cent market share, is the latest of a number of companies to be offered for sale by the government since it began an ambitious privatisation programme in August 1989. Kleinwort Benson, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, together with its local partner, Harteneck Lopez, have been retained to advise on the sale, which is expected to go ahead as soon as March next year. Kleinwort has been involved in other Argentine privatisations in the energy sector including the sale of Gas del Estado, but this is its first venture in the financial services area. Mr John Williams, of Kleinwort Benson, said that the government was seeking to sell a majority stake of between 50 and 60 per cent of a new holding company, which would in turn own the Caja's insurance and banking businesses. The government is likely to be looking for possibly as much as one-and-a-half times the these assets, added Mr Williams. Caja's net assets are currently estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. Companies in North America, Germany, and France had already expressed signs of interest, said Mr Williams. NCM Holding, the Dutch trade credit insurer, yesterday announced a joint venture with The Fidelity &amp; Deposit Companies, a leader in the US domestic bonding and insurance industry. The new insurer, Maryland-Netherlands Credit Insurance, will underwrite commercial export credit risks. Maryland-Netherlands will be chartered as a composite insurer and will file for licences in all 50 states. F&amp;D will hold 51 per cent of the new company.</p>

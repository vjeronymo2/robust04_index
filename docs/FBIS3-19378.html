The need to coordinate employment was, in fact, stressed by  United States President Bill Clinton, in his keynote speech,  and, later, by Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who  represents Italy at the summit along with Labor Minister Gino  Giugni. [passage omiited]    This theme [cooperation] was reiterated by Italian Treasury  Minister Barucci who, in his address, agreed that the  coordination of employment strategies was the only path which  could be followed. "One cannot just rely on the development of  world trade," he said, "or only on economic recovery, on the  progressive liberalization of the job market or only on the  revision of the welfare state. A blend of these instruments is  necessary to combat unemployment."    "Aside from keeping inflation under control, exchange rates  stable and fully applying free trade agreements" the treasury  minister continued, "what is necessary is economic  decentralization with a growing role for the economy,  information and an ambitious infrastructure investment program."    In full support of the European Commission's white paper on  employment, Barucci underscored how the problem of coordination  was not only on an international level, but also on a domestic  one. "We must commit ourselves to giving coherence to policies  adopted on a national level," he said.    The Italian treasury minister then went on to suggest "A  coordination authority, which operates with the government chief  of each nation, could ensure internal coherence and greater  international cooperation, even by promoting proposals and  support actions for the part of the OECD," the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development. "To paraphrase a military  theory" Barucci observed, on an ironic note, "I would say that  unemployment was much too serious a problem to be left to the  ministers for the treasury and labor. It is a problem for prime  ministers."    "This conference" Barucci continued, "was organized at the  right time and with the right mixture of experiences. It has  forced finance ministers not to just focus on fiscal  convergences, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. It  has forced labor ministers to look beyond the pain effects of  employment."    Turning his attention to the effects privatization is having  on employment, Barucci underlined how "privatization, at least  in the short-term, will create new unemployment. But its value  will be relatively modest overall. Europe's objective must be  to over-turn the ratio between created in the public sector in  respect to those in the private sector."    The Italian treasury minister then reiterated Rome's  opposition to protectionism and argued how "if world trade  continues to develop despite the recession, this is because the  objective of liberalizing trade has been followed up with  determination both on a multi- lateral level through GATT (the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and through the creation  of regional organs."    The problem of employment, Barucci observed, has so far been  tackled paying more attention to the creation of jobs rather  than of working hours. "It is of the utmost importance that new  employment fully corresponds with the expansion of the market  which can only be achieved through new productive investments.  Once new work hours have been created, each country can then  decide how to best translate this into new jobs."    Barucci also stressed the importance of investment in  workers, in training and research and the need to support small-  and medium-size business, as done in Northern Italy.</p>

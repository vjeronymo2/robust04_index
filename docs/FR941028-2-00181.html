			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Health-care facilities and health departments should coordinate their efforts to perform appropriate contact investigations on patients and HCWs who have active TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, results of all AFB-positive sputum smears, cultures positive for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and drug-susceptibility results on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  isolates should be reported to the public health department as soon as these results are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The public health department may be able to assist facilities with planning and implementing various aspects of a TB infection-control program (e.g., surveillance, screening activities, and outbreak investigations). In addition, the state health department may be able to provide names of experts to assist with the engineering aspects of TB infection control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> M. Additional Considerations for Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities and Other Health-Care Settings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains additional information for selected areas in health-care facilities and for other health-care settings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Operating rooms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Elective operative procedures on patients who have TB should be delayed until the patient is no longer infectious. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If operative procedures must be performed, they should be done, if possible, in operating rooms that have anterooms. For operating rooms without anterooms, the doors to the operating room should be closed, and traffic into and out of the room should be minimal to reduce the frequency of opening and closing the door. Attempts should be made to perform the procedure at a time when other patients are not present in the operative suite and when a minimum number of personnel are present (e.g., at the end of day). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Placing a bacterial filter on the patient endotracheal tube (or at the expiratory side of the breathing circuit of a ventilator or anesthesia machine if these are used) when operating on a patient who has confirmed or suspected TB may help reduce the risk for contaminating anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle bacilli into the ambient air. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;During postoperative recovery, the patient should be monitored and should be placed in a private room that meets recommended standards for ventilating TB isolation rooms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW must protect the field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW and protect the HCW from the infectious droplet nuclei generated by the patient. Valved or positive-pressure respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the criteria in Section II.G should be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Autopsy rooms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Because infectious aerosols are likely to be present in autopsy rooms, such areas should be at negative pressure with respect to adjacent areas (Suppl. 3), and the room air should be exhausted directly to the outside of the building. ASHRAE recommends that autopsy rooms have ventilation that provides an airflow of 12 ACH ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), although the effectiveness of this ventilation level in reducing the risk for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transmission has not been evaluated. Where possible, this level should be increased by means of ventilation system design or by auxiliary methods (e.g., recirculation of air within the room through HEPA filters) (Suppl. 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Respiratory protection should be worn by personnel while performing autopsies on deceased persons who may have had TB at the time of death (Section II.G; Suppl. 4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within the room or UVGI may be used as a supplement to the recommended ventilation (Suppl. 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Laboratories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Laboratories in which specimens for mycobacteriologic studies (e.g., AFB smears and cultures) are processed should be designed to conform with criteria specified by CDC and the National Institutes of Health ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 59 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Other Health-Care Settings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TB precautions may be appropriate in a number of other types of health care settings. The specific precautions that are applied will vary depending on the setting. At a minimum, a risk assessment should be performed yearly for these settings; a written TB infection-control plan should be developed, evaluated, and revised on a regular basis; protocols should be in place for identifying and managing patients who may have active TB; HCWs should receive appropriate training, education, and screening; protocols for problem evaluation should be in place; and coordination with the public health department should be arranged when necessary. Other recommendations specific to certain of these settings follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Emergency medical services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When EMS personnel or others must transport patients who have confirmed or suspected active TB, a surgical mask should be placed, if possible, over the patient's mouth and nose. Because administrative and engineering controls during emergency transport situations cannot be ensured, EMS personnel should wear respiratory protection when transporting such patients. If feasible, the windows of the vehicle should be kept open. The heating and air-conditioning system should be set on a nonrecirculating cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

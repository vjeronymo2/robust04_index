			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / British Gas decision today THE BOARD of British Gas meets today to decide whether to submit to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation. British Gas agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to cut its industrial market share from 90 per cent to 40 per cent and hive off its transport division. In return, it expects Ofgas, the industry regulator, to review a tough formula for domestic prices which is due to come in force in April. It must tell the OFT by tomorrow if it will go ahead with changes to the industrial market without conditions attached or face an inquiry into its dominance of the industrial market.</p>

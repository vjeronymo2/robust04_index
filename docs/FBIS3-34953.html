Meanwhile, the opposition's National Front  for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL], which these POW's  subsequently joined, has decided to appoint Colonel Salih  Muhammad al-Habbuni commander in chief of the Libyan National  Army [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm) in place of Colonel  Khalifah Haftar. [passage omitted]    Yesterday the NFSL leadership issued a statement saying it  had decided to appoint al-Habbuni commander in chief of the  opposition army and Staff Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah  al-Shaykhi deputy commander in chief. The statement said that  the army represented the "NFSL's armed forces and was  established by a decision of the Permanent Bureau 21 June 1988  after a large number of Libyan senior officers, warrant  officers, and soldiers deployed in Chad announced that they were  joining the NFSL." The statement also said that "Col. Haftar  had held the post of commander in chief of that army by a  decision of the NFSL's Executive Committee, until he announced  his withdrawal from the NFSL" on 11 February 1994.</p>

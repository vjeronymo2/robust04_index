At present, Petrobras is keeping three probes busy  drilling wells in the Santos basin, and a fourth will be  installed next week.    "The goal of this effort is to find alternatives to the  Campos Basin in Rio (the company's main drilling site). The  potential for new offshore petroleum discoveries in the Santos  basin is very high," said Dimas Dultra Simoes, assistant  superintendent of operations for Petrobras's exploration  department.    According to Simoes, the Santos basin has an estimated  potential of 200 million barrels of oil equivalent. The fields  already discovered in that basin are Tubarao, Coral, Estrela do  Mar, Merluza, and Caravelas. One of the producing wells in the  Caravelas field, 1-BSS-64, has the highest flow rate of any in  Brazil, contributing about 10,000 barrels of petroleum a day.    Of the three wells now being drilled, the 1-BSS-74, located  180 km off Sao Sebastiao, on the Sao Paulo coast, is the first  deepwater well in Sao Paulo. It is 1,140 meters deep. "That well  is in the final drilling stages. Within the next several days,  we will find out if there is oil there," Simoes said. The other  two wells are the 1-BSS-72 and the Caravelas, an extension of  the Caravelas field.    The Santos basin has also shown good prospects as a source  of  natural gas. The Merluza field has an average production of  600,000 cubic meters of gas per day and a potential to reach the  2 million cubic meter/day level. The field has proven reserves  of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas.    According to Simoes, interest in exploiting the Santos basin  increased after the seismic data survey done by ship from 1992  to early 1993. In that effort, which involved an investment of  $15 million, a radiography was made of the subsoil, surveying  the best sites to drill wells. "At the moment, Petrobras is  studying an integrated project to boost production in the  basin," he said.</p>

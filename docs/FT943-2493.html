			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Telekom It may look like an excess of Teutonic efficiency that Germany has set today as the deadline for investment bankers to apply for a role in Deutsche Telekom's privatisation. After all, the first shares are not due to be sold until 1996. Nevertheless, there is much to be said for Germany's forward planning. Many questions need to be answered before a sale, including how Telekom's balance sheet should be restructured and when its markets should be opened to competition. It makes sense to take such decisions in the light of how potential investors might react. Telekom's balance sheet is a mess. The burden of building a network in east Germany has pushed gearing over 300 per cent. As capital spending drops, gearing will fall too. But massive depreciation charges will continue to weigh down profitability for years. This suggests that earnings could be tarted up by writing down Telekom's east German network. The snag is that a substantial write-down could destroy an already ropy balance sheet. There is, though, a way of squaring the circle: at the same time as overvalued equipment is written down, Telekom's undervalued property assets could be revalued. Ministers will also need to decide when Telekom's infrastructure monopoly should go. The company itself wants to cling to it for as long as possible. But, paradoxically, this may not be best for potential investors. The sooner the monopoly goes, the sooner Telekom will come under pressure to improve efficiency and the sooner it can expect to be freed from the obligations that come with holding a monopoly.</p>

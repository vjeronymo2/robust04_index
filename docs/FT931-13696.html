			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Ralph resurfaces at Glynwed Bruce Ralph, chief executive of Dowty until its acquisition by TI Group last year, is to join diversified UK engineering group Glynwed International. A former student in the Hanson mergers and acquisitions school, Ralph, 53, has been appointed managing director and chief executive designate. He will be responsible for a reorganised management structure, overseeing six new operating divisions. Ralph joined Dowty in 1983 and became deputy chief executive beneath Tony Thatcher in 1985. Following a shake-up in the board triggered by Dowty's debilitating move into information technology and mobile communications, Ralph became chief executive in 1991. He then began to try to sell the IT division but Dowty's profits and defences continued to suffer. Unable to make the disposal at a price that would not damage the balance sheet, Dowty fell prey to TI less than a year after Ralph assumed the top job. During the TI bid, however, Ralph was not able to distance himself entirely from decisions taken by his previous boss. TI claimed that as a member of the Dowty board he was on watch when the decision was taken to diversify from Dowty's core aerospace and polymer business. Since the takeover, TI has retained Ralph in a consultancy role. That position will end just before he begins with Glynwed on February 1. Gareth Davies had combined the posts of chairman and chief executive at Glynwed. ***** David Sandford, formerly director of finance and administration of Sulzer (UK) Pumps, has been appointed to the boards of SULZER (UK) HOLDINGS and SULZER (UK). ***** James Elsner, formerly vice-president engineering systems and capital development at Campbell Soup, has been appointed ceo of SEVERN TRENT WATER's US subsidiary, Capital Controls Company Inc. ***** David Favre, formerly marketing director, has been appointed md of Marinet Systems, part of TRAFALGAR HOUSE. ***** Howard Brookman, formerly European manufacturing planning director of McVitie's, has been appointed production director at DAIRY CREST. ***** David Yellowlees, marketing director for Asia/Pacific, has been appointed marketing director of REEBOK UK. ***** John Bowater has been appointed finance director of TARMAC Quarry Products in succession to Peter Davenport who retires in June; he joins the board together with George Cliffe, md of Tarmac Roadstone Eastern, John Glaves, md of Tarmac Roadstone Central, and Malcolm Whittle, md of Tarmac Roadstone Southern. Glyn Cartwright, previously sales director at IG Lintels, has been appointed sales director of Tarmac Roofing Systems. ***** Kevin Johnson, formerly operations director of John Hine, has been appointed md of SPRING RAM's kitchen products subsidiary, Next Dimension. ***** John Gibson, formerly md of Grand Metropolitan's Peter's Savoury Products Group, has been appointed md of UNIGATE DAIRIES. ***** Charles Koppelman has been promoted to chairman and ceo of EMI Records Group, North America; Joe Smith is leaving when his contract expires at the end of March.</p>

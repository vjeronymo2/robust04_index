			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> TRIAL SET IN PALME SLAYING  </P> <P> Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a record of crime and drug abuse,  was charged with the premeditated 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and  will go on trial on June 5. Pettersson, under arrest since Dec. 14, has denied  killing Palme, and the material presented by prosecutors to the Stockholm  district court made clear their case is based almost entirely on circumstantial  evidence. Pettersson was also charged with the attempted murder of Palme's  wife, Lisbet, who was grazed by a bullet. The Palmes were walking home at night  from the movies when an assassin opened fire from point-blank range before  fleeing up an alley. Lisbet Palme, who said she saw the accused at the scene,  is expected to be the key witness. Officials concede no one actually saw  Pettersson with a gun in his hand.  </P></p>

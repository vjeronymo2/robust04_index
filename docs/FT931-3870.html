			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Discrimination is a disgrace Sir, Re Adriana Pulido's defence of the Venezuelan Embassy's lunches at the Garrick (Letter, March 11), it is nice of the Garrick to do women the favour of accepting their presence, when it sells space for special occasions. Nevertheless, the discrimination against women which the Garrick represents is a disgrace. Neither Ann Coffey, the Labour MP, nor the Venezuela government, should be seen grovelling to the Garrick. Onesimo Alvarez-Moro, Pontejos 2, 2 puerta 6, 28012 Madrid, Spain</p>

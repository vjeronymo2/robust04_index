			<p>CSO     [Text] Prime Minister Hata on the afternoon of 30 April  called for an emergency conference of cabinet members concerned  with economic matters in response to the continued rise of the  yen on foreign exchange markets in New York on 29 April. The  conferees agreed to: 1) Establish close ties with concerned  nations and strive for stabilization of foreign exchange rates;  2) Work for early passage of the fiscal year 1994 budget; 3)  Expedite completion of plans for deregulation; and 4) Strive for  implementation of tax system reform within the current year.    The conference was attended by the prime minister and four  cabinet members, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai as  substitute for Minister of Finance Fujii who was traveling  overseas, Minister of International Trade and Industry Hata,  Economic Planning Agency Director General Terasawa, and  Management and Coordination Agency Director General Ishida. A  briefing was given by the Ministry of Finance on the current  foreign exchange rates and discussions were held on measures to  be taken in response to the strong yen and its impact on the  economy.    As a result, the conference affirmed maintenance of  sustained  growth centered on domestic demand and implementation of reforms  such as deregulation as basic policies for management of the  future economy. Among the four items agreed upon, according to  Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, the conferees agreed that  "Japan would maintain close liaison with concerned nations and  take appropriate and timely actions," to cope with trends in the  foreign currency markets. The conferees also confirmed plans to  reinforce foreign exchange stabilization measures by taking  actions such as cooperative intervention involving yen-selling  and dollar-buying with Europe and the United States if the yen  should rise further.    The conference also agreed to expedite work on deregulation  plans that will be a principal feature of international economic  countermeasures to be compiled by June and that the plans will  be "substantive in nature." They also affirmed that work on tax  reform--consisting primarily of an income tax cut and  consumption tax increase--will include thorough consideration of  public opinion and the understanding and cooperation of the  respective parties and factions, completion of a draft plan in  June, and implementation during the current year.</p>

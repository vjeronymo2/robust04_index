			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Chile copper loss may reach Pounds 109m Losses made by Codelco, Chile's state copper company, on the London Metal Exchange could rise to Dollars 165m (Pounds 109m), a senior Codelco executive admitted yesterday. Original estimates, revealed on Wednesday, had been in the range of Dollars 100m, reports David Pilling in Santiago. The Chilean Supreme Court, in response to a call from President Patricio Aylwin, has appointed a special judge to investigate losses at Codelco, the world's biggest copper company. The mining commission of the federal Chamber of Deputies, accountants Price Waterhouse and Codelco itself will run parallel investigations. They will be trying to discover how strict controls on futures and options trading were circumvented by one Codelco trader who is said to have kept his rising losses secret for four months. Three Codelco executives resigned this week. President Aylwin, who did not rule out the possibility of further resignations, said it had come as a 'surprise' to him to learn that Codelco took part in futures transactions. 'It strikes me as a delicate matter in a state company,' he said. The National Federation of Copper Workers called for all top Codelco executives to resign, contrasting losses on the futures market with the management's continual insistence on cost-cutting measures.</p>

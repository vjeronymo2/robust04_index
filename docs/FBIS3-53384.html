They issued a  statement, inviting brother Presidential Council Chairman  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Presidential Council  Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid to a meeting at the Mu'ad  Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira  [10 January 1994], because they were convinced that the meeting  between the brother president and the brother vice president is  the first step toward a reconciliation, which would help heal  the rift and rid us of the crisis.    Because the ulema were concerned about the success of the  meeting, they dispatched delegations to the brother president  and the brother vice president, inviting them to the meeting,  and asking them to be on time. That is why the ulema met at the  al-Janad Mosque on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira. The meeting continued  until 30 Rajab 1414 Hejira [13 January], because they were eager  to safeguard unity, contain the crisis, and identify the  solutions that would spare the people calamities, to relieve  them of the sufferings they are experiencing, and to thwart the  efforts of Yemen's enemies to fragment it, undermine its unity,  and push it into the abyss of the conflict that would confuse  the population and the country.    Presidential Council Chairman brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih showed up at the agreed upon mosque on schedule. He  informed the ulema of the reasons and ramifications of the  crisis as he sees them. He also informed them that he is  willing to accept the solutions the ulema deem fit. The ulema  regret the failure of Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali  Salim al-Bid to show up on schedule. And because the ulema were  concerned about his participation in the meeting, they remained  in touch with the competent agencies to remind him that the  ulema were continuing to wait for his attendance. They  continued to await his attendance until the time this statement  was issued.    The ulema hold the brother Presidential Council vice  chairman  responsible for the consequences of his failure to attend, for  his failure to respond to the ulema's letter, and for his  failure to receive the delegation they sent from the al-Janad  area. This is regrettable, particularly since the people are  being crushed by the crisis, the hellish price hikes, and the  decline in the exchange rate of the national currency.    The ulema continued their meetings in accordance with the  itinerary of their meetings. During these meetings, they  addressed the crisis and its repercussions, as well as the  security violations and the stifling economic crisis it created.  Hence, and inspired by the teachings of our true Islamic  religion, which is the nation's creed, its sharia, and its way  of life, the ulema underscore adherence to the following  constants:    First, adherence to Yemeni unity as a religious duty and  national necessity that must be safeguarded and defended. It  must not be abandoned. [passage omitted]    Second, adherence to constitutional and legal legitimacy in  all that does not violate the Holy Koran and the prophet's  traditions. There should be no efforts to circumvent it or act  against its institutions.    Third, the Holy Koran and the traditions of Prophet  Muhammad,  may God's peace be upon him, must be used as arbiters in all  disputes and conflicts. [passage omitted]    Proposed solutions: Based on all that has been mentioned,  and after a study of the manifestations, reasons, and  repercussions of the crisis, the ulema view the following as  solutions to the crisis:    First, the return to Sanaa by Presidential Council Vice  Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid in response to the appeal of the  House of Representatives so that he may perform his  constitutional duties. For, this is the first step toward a  resolution of the current crisis.    Second, ending the manifestations of fragmentation at all  government and popular facilities, and merging the armies,  currencies, and aviation corporations, as well as all economic  institutions.    Third, halting the media and military escalation and  returning the camps to where they were before the eruption of  the crisis.    The Yemeni ulema urge all Armed Forces and Public Security  personnel to observe neutrality in the dispute between the two  parties to the crisis, and to place Yemeni interests above all  partisan and personal interests.    Fourth, fighting all kinds of corruption and the corrupt,  wherever they may be, as well as their supporters, and not  allowing any solutions outside the context of legitimate  institutions.    Fifth, the efforts made by the House of Representatives, the  Yemeni ulema, and domestic and external mediators to contain the  ongoing crisis and effect a reconciliation between the two  parties to the crisis have failed. There has been a daily  escalation in this crisis. Hence, the ulema urge the  influential people in the country to convene a general Yemeni  congress in which Yemenis of all governorates and sectors will  be represented. In this congress, the people must be able to  decide their future. The conferees have entrusted His Eminence  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 'Aziz al-Zandani and the religious scholar  Judge Muhammad Bin-Isma'il al-Hajji with the task of forming a  preparatory committee for the congress. They have also asked  them to set a date and a venue for the congress.    Sixth, the Yemeni ulema meeting at the al-Janad area have  asked the Higher Committee which prepared their meeting to  follow up on the implementation of their decisions, and to  inform them of new developments.    Seventh, the Yemeni ulema urge that the public be made aware  of the dangers posed to their unity, security, and stability.    Concluding, the Yemeni ulema appeal to all Yemenis to  demonstrate vigilance and awareness, and not to allow themselves  to be dragged behind the rumors and lies promoted by domestic  and foreign media, and to act upon the words of Almighty God: O  Ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news,  ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and  afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.  [passage omitted]    Issued at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area on  30 Rajab 1414 Hejira, corresponding to 13 January 1994</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News Round-up Taiwan Taiwan's proposed stock capital gains tax is expected to have only a limited impact on the bull run which saw the market rise by 80 per cent in 1993. Mr Lin Chen-kuo, finance minister, has proposed a complex tax with different rates for institutions and individual investors. If approved it would take effect on July 1. Pakistan The privatisation commission is to offer 'a substantial number' of state industrial enterprises for sale in the next two months and is also examining the feasibility of privatising all public firms through the stock market. South Korea The Economic Planning Board has drawn up a reform plan to streamline management of dozens of state companies through privatisations and mergers. The EPB said 42 state-run and funded companies would be privatised between 1994 and 1997. Indonesia Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, investment minister, has said that domestic companies can go overseas to list shares, selling up to a maximum of 30 per cent of their stakes, as long as proceeds are to be reinvested in Indonesia. Philippines The merger of the rival Manila and Makati stock exchanges should be completed this month, in spite of a sharp disagreement in financing a single equities market. Hong Kong The Stock Exchange has said it will be more strict in enforcing rules requiring stock issuers and their advisers to submit documents on time. The exchange did not set new penalties for tardy compliance, but warned that listings could be delayed.</p>

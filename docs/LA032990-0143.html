			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> VALLEY BLVD. PLAN ADVANCES  </P> <P> A 14-month effort to draft a development plan for Valley Boulevard entered its  last phase Monday night as the City Council voted unanimously to give the plan  preliminary approval.  </P> <P> The plan designates what types of developments -- hotels, offices, restaurants,  apartments -- would be permitted along the boulevard's three-mile stretch  through Alhambra.  </P> <P> The council also approved four amendments recommended by the Planning  Commission, including one that would exclude a residential area near Fremont  Avenue and Shorb Street from the plan. Homeowners there had told the council  that they wanted to protect their neighborhood from being rezoned for  commercial use.  </P> <P> During the preparation of the plan, the city imposed a building moratorium  along the busy commercial corridor. If the plan receives final approval next  month, the moratorium, which was supposed to last until January, 1991, would be  lifted, Councilman Boyd Condie said.  </P> <P> A final vote is scheduled for April 9.  </P></p>

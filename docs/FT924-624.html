			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Heavy weather for BA's ambitious global strategy: Paul Betts and Nikki Tait on why the airline's proposed partnership with USAir was grounded BRITISH AIRWAYS has fulfilled two of its three strategic goals this year to become the world's biggest global airline. But the most significant component of this strategy collapsed yesterday when the UK flag carrier announced it was pulling out of its proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m) deal to buy a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. Last week, BA was chosen by the Australian government as the preferred international airline partner for Qantas. Earlier this year, BA consolidated its position in the European market by acquiring Dan-Air, the ailing UK regional carrier, taking large minority stakes in TAT, a French regional carrier, and in a new German airline venture called Deutsche BA. In Russia, it launched a new international joint airline venture with Aeroflot called Air Russia. But the biggest prize was always a partnership with a US airline to strengthen BA's reach into the world's single biggest aviation market. After failing two years ago to forge a strategic alliance with United Airlines, BA last year sought to form a strategic alliance with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest Airlines, KLM's US equity partner. That deal also collapsed and BA turned its attention to USAir. For USAir, BA provided a financially strong partner giving it access to the international market. For BA, USAir provided the passenger feed it was looking for to boost its transatlantic operations. The pressure to secure a ally in the US had been increasing for BA following the takeover of the old Pan American and TWA transatlantic routes two years ago by the big three US carriers American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Since their multi-million dollar route acquisitions, these three airlines have launched an aggressive offensive into the European market. But suddenly faced with a direct challenge by BA into their own back yard, they ganged together to put intense pressure on their government to block the BA-USAir deal unless they were granted greater access into the UK market, especially BA's home base of Heathrow. Lord King, BA's chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, the UK airline's chief executive, argued strongly against any further opening of Heathrow to US carriers unless the US government eased its tight regulations on foreign ownership of US airlines and granted UK carriers more access into the US market. The deadlock intensified with neither side prepared to give ground on the basic issue: greater access to Heathrow for US carriers in exchange for the BA investment in USAir. However, the UK carrier has not given up the possibility of negotiating a revised deal with USAir in the New Year. If the collapse of the deal is a strategic set-back for the British carrier, it presents a more immediate problem for the US one. Quite simply, USAir could have used the cash. Ever since the BA proposal was announced last July, USAir has walked a lobbyist's tightrope. On the one hand, it has proffered its ailing financial condition and the fear of future job losses as reason for politicians to support the BA transaction. On the other, it has been anxious not to alarm the financial community, nor US travellers who have grown wary of distressed airlines. But USAir's financial statements show that between the beginning of 1990 and the end of September, 1992, the company lost almost Dollars 1bn after tax. It is also carrying around Dollars 2bn-worth of long-term debt on its balance sheet - in part, the product of operationally-troublesome mergers with Pacific Southwest Airlines and then Piedmont Aviation in the late-1980s. These borrowings cost over Dollars 200m a year to service, while USAir last made an operating profit - a flimsy Dollars 21m  - in 1989. So how has the Arlington-based carrier stayed afloat? Like many of its competitors, USAir has become adept at collaterising assets and rescheduling aircraft deliveries. The carrier has also held a series of negotiations with its bankers. More fundamentally, however, USAir has reorganised its flight schedules, pulled out of some Californian markets, and wound down its presence at the former Dayton, Ohio, hub. It has secured wage concessions from its main employees - flight attendants excepted  - said to be worth Dollars 400m a year. Whether the overall result of these moves adds up to profits in 1993 - let alone profits which meet the debt service requirements - depends to a considerable extent on the business environment which the carrier faces. This looks a little brighter on the back of the improving US economy, but a year ago, few would have predicted the savagery with which price-cutting gripped the industry in 1992. 'I don't think there's a short-term crisis right around the corner, but the environment is still very difficult,' said Mr Robert Ray at Moody's, the US credit rating agency, which now has USAir debt ratings under review with direction 'uncertain'. What appears clear is that USAir does not intend to remain a regional carrier. And since the company's main attraction is its strong East Coast-based route network, a Transatlantic partner is the obvious fit. As for BA's own future, it clearly intends to try once more to forge a working partnership with a US carrier to complete its global strategy. If USAir remains elusive, the UK carrier is likely to scour the US for another suitable match. The list of candidates, however, is becoming worryingly short.</p>

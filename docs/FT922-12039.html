			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: Row erupts over Japanese ban on wines from Italy A ROW has erupted between Japanese government officials and Italian wine importers over a sales ban imposed for health reasons on 27 types of Italian wine. The importers believe Tokyo is over-reacting to a problem limited to a few rogue producers. The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare says it must act cautiously to protect consumers. The arguments began last week when the ministry banned sales of eight kinds of wine, after the US authorities found some wines shipped to America contained traces of methyl isothiocyanate, a banned insecticide. This week, the ministry added a further 19 wines to the list on the basis of reports from the Italian authorities after additional laboratory checks carried out in Italy. The sales bans will stay in place until the ministry has completed checks on the wines. The ministry has also advised importers of other wines to test their wines before selling them to the public. The importers' main complaint is that as well as containing the names of 24 individual, mostly small-scale, producers, the ministry's list names a whole region and two grape types grown in many parts of Italy. The importers say it is unfair to blacklist the wines simply because they come from the same region, or are made of the same grape, as wines from the offending wineries. Mr Mark Bedingham, president of Jardine Wines and Spirits, a major drinks importer, said yesterday: 'This is over-reaction by the Japanese authorities'. Italian trade officials said they were meeting the ministry every day to provide information and ask for the general sales ban on the wines to be lifted. It was wrong to penalise thousands of Italian wineries, they said. A ministry official said tests had to be carried out on all the wines because no guarantee could be given they were safe. Importers said the ministry's checks might not be complete until mid-May. The ministry's action is already affecting all Italian wines. At Isetan, a leading department store, officials said all Italian wines had been removed from the shelves. At Sabatini, a top Italian restaurant in central Tokyo, a manager said some older customers were double-checking the type of wine they were drinking. Inaccurate reporting had spread confusion, he added. 'On television a story about the problem was illustrated with a bottle of a different Italian wine.' Methyl isothiocyanate can be used to control fermentation but is banned from use in food in several countries, including the US, Japan and Italy.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Japan's rulers set to boost economy JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday began clearing the way for an additional stimulus to the ailing economy. The party agreed to set up a task force to consider plans to revive an economy only being saved from outright recession by expansionary public spending. The task force, the LDP's response to mounting business pressure for tax cuts, is expected to propose new measures to be implemented after the 1993 budget is approved in early April. The group is to be headed by Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, who recently made outspoken attacks on official complacency over the state of the economy. The group will provide a powerful counterweight to the influence of the finance ministry which is opposed to higher government spending to finance tax cuts, and the Bank of Japan, which insists another interest rate cut must follow in the wake of a further fiscal stimulus. The task force will focus on plans for a supplementary budget to augment the Y72,400 (Pounds 383bn) draft budget which will provide only a 0.2 per cent rise in general public spending. Top business organisations are pressing for a tax cut package to revive consumption and investment. Japan's international trading partners are likely to call on it to stimulate domestic demand to cut its ballooning trade surplus. Demands for tax cuts will intensify with the traditional spring wage negotiations in which employers will insist on a low increase. The Japan Federation of Employers' Associations has urged its members to award no more than 2.3 per cent rises, in guidelines for bargaining agreed this week. Rengo, the largest trade union federation, has called for a 7 per cent rise. Low wage rises will dampen consumption which ended the year badly depressed, figures published yesterday show. Tokyo department store sales in December were 11.2 per cent down on the year before, the largest ever annual fall. Sales in Tokyo department stores, for the past year as a whole, were 5.7 per cent down on 1991.</p>

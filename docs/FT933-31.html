			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (16): A Raj relic for sale - Privatisation and the steel industry BURNPUR CLUB, like the rest of this once vibrant steel city, is having a hard time. Its gardens have withered. The steel executives, unsure of their future, no longer turn up for lunch and only a few come in the evening. The Indian Iron &amp; Steel Co (IISCO), which owns the Burnpur steelworks, is woefully short of funds to maintain the city with its elegant bungalows built during the days of the Raj. IISCO, deeply in debt, has let the plant decay. Parts date from the 1920s and its productivity is the lowest in the Indian steel industry. In the year to March 1993 it produced 860,000 tonnes of hot metal. But its outworn melting shop converted this into only 363,000 tonnes of steel. Mr KV Pai, managing director, says: 'Though we have learnt to run a dilapidated steel plant, the Burnpur works as it is will not survive very long. Modernisation cannot be postponed any longer.' But comprehensive modernisation and capacity expansion, which finally will claim an investment of Rs60bn will have to await IISCO's privatisation. And that means job cuts. When India's public sector was treated as a holy cow by the federal government, the 33,000 jobs at IISCO were safe. However, the economic programme of the Narasimha Rao government does not permit indefinite bankrolling of the company's losses. In a last-ditch rescue effort, New Delhi has decided to privatise it. The move has raised the unions' hackles. Anxious to protect jobs, the five unions have responded by forming a committee to fight privatisation through mass meetings and strikes. More than 1,000 IISCO officials have made common cause with the unions. Mr Chandrasekhar Mukherjee, the local president of the Marxist union who was fired from IISCO 40 years ago for leading a strike, says: 'IISCO is the major employer in the Burnpur city which has a population of nearly 200,000. 'We know for certain that privatisation will lead to contraction in employment at IISCO. That will spell ruin for the city.' According to Mr Mukherjee, trade unions allied to different parties are united against selling IISCO which they fear will lead to privatisation of other government undertakings. Mr Santosh Mohan Dev, steel minister, has told the unions that the government is bent on transferring IISCO to the private sector. Mr Mukherjee, hero of many a union battle, is no longer confident about his present campaign. Its prospects have not been helped by Mr Jyoti Basu, the pragmatically minded Marxist chief minister of West Bengal. Mr Basu believes that the steel plant, which has run up a loss of Rs7.58bn, cannot be saved unless it is modernised with private finance. Mr Basu wants to have a say in choosing a buyer for IISCO. He has already invited Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the UK-based Caparo Group, to rescue IISCO. At first Mr Paul seemed keen to accept the challenge but then backed out because he did not like the conditions set by the government. But the ever-pragmatic Mr Basu has also supported a bid for IISCO by Mukand whose chairman, Mr Viren Shah, is a prominent member of the right-wing BJP - the Hindu Bharatiya Janata party . The power of IISCO's large workforce was a factor in influencing the Mittals and the Tatas, India's two leading industrial groups, not to bid for the company. The Mittals had thought of re-equipping Burnpur with a second-hand, but relatively new steel plant to be imported from the UK. They dropped the idea because of doubts about winning co-operation from the labour force. For the Tatas, involvement in IISCO would have been a distraction from plans to expand their steel plant at Jamshedpur. Finally, to the disappointment of the federal government, there were only two bidders for IISCO - Mukand and Usha Rectifier. The committee of experts on private participation in IISCO headed by Mr PL Shankar reported that it found the Rs32bn Mukand proposal to rehabilitate the steel plant 'more confidence inspiring'. Mukand has a technical agreement with Hoogovens of the Netherlands. Usha Rectifier, however, claimed that it offered a better price and that its Rs52bn modernisation programme, unlike that of Mukand, included a dedicated power station and a new blast furnace. It had also secured MAN of Germany as a partner. One committee member, Mr KC Khanna, former chairman of Steel Authority of India (SAIL), offered a minority opinion, which is being canvassed by the unions. He said that SAIL should be given the responsibility for modernising IISCO, which is a subsidiary of SAIL. But SAIL, which is busy modernising its bigger and newer steel plants at Durgapur, Rourkela, Bhilai and Bokaro, would find it hard to devote resources to IISCO as well. Meanwhile, time is running out at Burnpur.  --------------------------------------------------------------- PRODUCTION OF SALEABLE STEEL BY SAIL AND TISCO (000 TONNES)  ---------------------------------------------------------------           1988-89   1989-90   1990-92   1991-92   1992-93  --------------------------------------------------------------- Sail        6,819     6,731     7,035     7,641     7,937 Tisco       1,944     1,913     1,900     1,978     2,084  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

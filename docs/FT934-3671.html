			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Hume sees threat to Ulster talks The leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party has warned against setting up a Northern Ireland select committee, saying it could endanger the Northern Ireland talks process. Mr John Hume delivered the warning in a letter to Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the Commons procedure committee. A decision by ministers to press ahead with a select committee for the province would be seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to its unionist majority. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, offered encouragement to select committee supporters in the Commons just six days ago by acknowledging - in response to a question from Mr Hume - that the idea could have 'some value'. Confirmation of Mr Hume's letter emerged as British and Irish officials continued concerted efforts to bridge differences between London and Dublin over their planned joint declaration aimed at securing peace in Northern Ireland. Officials are striving to narrow the gap between the two sides ahead of the next scheduled meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels on Friday or Saturday. Questioned in the Dublin parliament yesterday, Mr Reynolds was upbeat about the pace of progress while admitting that 'a number of important outstanding issues' had still to be resolved. In a fresh attempt to reassure unionists, the Irish premier declared for the first time in the Dail that Dublin was prepared to make a written pledge to hold a referendum on its territorial claim over Northern Ireland. Speaking as Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, warned he would 'never accept' any further dilution of the unionist position, Mr Reynolds said Dublin was relying on Mr Major to keep unionists informed about the peace process. Mr Hume is understood to believe any discussions about a select committee should involve the province's non-violent political parties. An agreement reached elsewhere would amount to a private deal. Adria, the Ulster textile company, is creating 400 jobs in two projects in the north-west of the province. Some 250 jobs will arise from the expansion of Adria's Campsie factory, near Londonderry. The others will be at a new factory at Strabane.</p>

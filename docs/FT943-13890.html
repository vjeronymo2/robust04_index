			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Joint effort is warning to others The European Commission yesterday said its co-operation with the US Department of Justice in stopping alleged anti-competitive practices by Microsoft was a warning to other large businesses. 'It serves as an important model for the future, as it shows how the two authorities can combine their efforts to deal effectively with giant multinational companies,' the commission said. 'The success of this joint approach sends a strong signal to all multinational companies, including those in other sectors.' The Justice Department and the commission announced a joint deal under which Microsoft agreed to stop certain licensing practices in exchange for the two authorities dropping anti-competition actions against the software company. The Microsoft settlement with US and European competition authorities marks the first time that the US and the EU have co-ordinated their efforts in formulating antitrust charges and a settlement. The precedent-setting case 'sends a powerful message. . . that the antitrust authorities of the US and the EU are prepared to move decisively and promptly to pool resources to attack conduct by multinational firms that violate the antitrust laws of the two jurisdictions,' said Ms Anne Bingaman, head of the US Justice Department antitrust division. The US and EU treaty allows the exchange of information in multinational antitrust cases. However, that treaty is under review by the European Court of Justice and was not used as the basis for collaboration in this case. Instead, the department's antitrust division sought Microsoft's approval before sharing information with its European counterparts. The commission said the two sides had a number of meetings to prepare a co-ordinated approach to dealing with Microsoft, then held joint meetings with the company in both Washington and Brussels.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Watanabe Suffering From Serious </F> Aftereffects"]    [Text] Former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is suffering from  the aftereffects of the withdrawal of his plan to secede from  the LDP and run for the premiership. His plan created a stir in  the political world, and eventually the political confusion not  only seriously damaged Mr. Watanabe's dignity, but his own  faction is about to split. Mr. Watanabe, who is eager to make a  comeback to the political scene as a key player, recently said:  "The proverb says, `If you fall down seven times, get up eight.'  But, in my case, I get up 11 times if I fall down 10 times."  In this way, Mr. Watanabe, without pausing to feel the  heartbreak, is busy trying to maintain his influence. However,  the prospect of him regaining influential power is dim.    Speaking at a news conference in Utsunomiya City on 23  April,  Mr. Watanabe indicated his intention to dissolve the Watanabe  faction in the near future, saying: "Factions are unnecessary in  the single-seat constituency system. I want to dissolve my  faction when the law on districts within constituencies is  adopted." He went on to say, "From now on, I want to come to  grips with drastic reform within the LDP and, at the same time,  study the possibility of changing the name of the party," thus  showing his intention to remain in the party and make a fresh  start.    The recent political turmoil caused by Mr. Watanabe has  further deepened conflict within his faction between a group of  young members who joined after Mr. Watanabe took over the  faction which had been headed by former Prime Minister Nakasone,  and senior faction members who joined the faction before Mr.  Watanabe took over the faction. In addition, Mr. Koji  Kakizawa's secession from the faction must have caused a crack  in relations between Mr. Watanabe and his close  associates--including Taku Yamazaki, Bunmei Ibuki, and Kabun  Muto--who have so far supported Mr. Watanabe.    Although a general meeting of the Watanabe faction was held  on 22 April, 16 faction members who are upper house members  refused to attend the meeting. This was because they were  getting tired of interfaction confusion caused by Mr. Watanabe's  decision to run for the election, so they decided to hold their  own meeting. They expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership  of the faction, saying, "We upper house members were not kept  well informed of how the situation was proceeding." With such  dissatisfaction in the background, some of them say they will  leave the faction if the situation requires it.    So far, Mr. Watanabe, in his political activities, has  placed  emphasis on his faction. However, he is now required to review  his activities because of the faction's instability and the fact  that the next election will be held under a combined electoral  system of single-seat and proportional representation  constituencies for the House of Representatives election.  Within the faction there is a move toward concentrating  pro-Watanabe groups through the possible formation of a policy  study group like "Onchi-kai," once headed by Mr. Watanabe, or  some other study group.    However, within the LDP, there are those saying: "Mr.  Watanabe has to take responsibility for his decision--which was  later withdrawn--to leave the party, because he is leader of his  faction. His political career is now at an end" (according to a  senior member of the Obuchi faction). In this way, there is a  growing frosty atmosphere within the party regarding him. Mr.  Watanabe sought a tie-up with Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa,  who is notorious in the LDP, even though he knew that such a  move would lead to his secession from the LDP. Such an attempt  must have accelerated the anti-Watanabe mood in the LDP.    Being conscious of such a mood, Mr. Watanabe has recently  refrained from approaching Mr. Ozawa. At a meeting with faction  members who have been elected three or four times at a Japanese  restaurant in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe reportedly criticized Mr.  Ozawa's political methods, saying "he has gone a little too  far." Moreover, he has reportedly told a leader of another  faction that "we have to watch out for Shinseito's attempt to  win our faction members over to their side."    Meanwhile, Mr. Ozawa recently said, "I still want to work  with him if he leaves the LDP," thus sending a signal to Mr.  Watanabe. Although it is reported that Mr. Ozawa and Mr.  Watanabe share common policies, including the theory of the  nation, and have an affinity for each other, it is extremely  uncertain whether relations between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Watanabe  will continue to have an impact on moves toward regrouping  political parties.</p>

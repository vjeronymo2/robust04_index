			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan debt slips on secondary market VENEZUELAN debt slid sharply on the secondary market yesterday as news of an attempted coup spread, but recovered some of its lost ground later as the threat to the government of Mr Carlos Andres Perez appeared to have been overcome. That left Venezuelan debt yielding around 30 basis points more than comparable Mexican instruments by the close of London trading - a reversal of the position during most of the second half of last year. Venezuelan par bonds, the most liquid of the bonds issued as part of the country's Brady-style debt reduction plans in 1990, fell from around 66 cents in the dollar to below 62 at one stage. However, later the price of the bonds, of which Dollars 6.7bn have been issued, rose to 64 1/4 . The country's Debt Conversion Bonds, of which Dollars 5.3bn are in issue, fell by a similar amount, from around 71 1/2 to 68. Reports varied over the volume of trading that took place, although most traders said the bulk of activity was between dealers. This left the market unsure about whether prices will weaken further. In the Eurobond market, the price of bonds issued recently by Bariven, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, weakened, though they remained above their re-offered price. But news of the attempted coup helped to undermine hopes that Eurobonds issued by Venezuelan borrowers would return to investment grade this year.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers try to avert revolt on post offices THE GOVERNMENT yesterday ruled out making compulsory the payment of state benefits direct into bank accounts, in an attempt to calm a threatened Tory revolt over the impact on rural post offices. Mr John Major signalled to MPs that in spite of Treasury pressure, the government would not try to cut public spending by forcing pensioners and others to be paid via their bank accounts. 'It is not the government's policy to remove the right of pensioners to receive their pensions from the Post Office,' the prime minister said. His comments came ahead of a Labour-initiated Commons debate today on Automatic Credit Transfers, when Conservative MPs are expected to voice alarm at the threat to rural communities if local post offices are hit. Yesterday a succession of Tory backbenchers, including Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, Mr Jacques Arnold (Gravesham) and Mr Robert Spink (Castle Point) expressed concern in the Commons about the impact on post offices if social security benefits were paid by ACT. Ministers blame a lobbying operation by sub-postmasters for creating unnecessary concern, but ministers and loyalist MPs are prepared to admit that the government could have made its policy clearer earlier. Now the government is working hard to quell any revolt. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, met backbench MPs yesterday and will today reiterate the Conservative manifesto commitment to 'a nationwide network of post offices'. Mr Lilley, however, will say that the government is eager to encourage the use of ACT, which results in substantial cost savings. On some benefits, payment via post offices can be 14 times as expensive. Ministers could offer the prospect that future privatisation would allow rural post offices to compete with banks and other businesses. Senior Tories said Labour had spoilt its chances of splitting off possible Conservative rebels by tabling a motion linking the threat to post offices to the government's 'mismanagement of the economy'. The government amendment stresses a commitment to 'freedom of choice in the means by which social security benefits are paid while reducing fraud and unnecessary costs by extending the availability of ACT to all benefits'. Sir Fergus Montgomery, Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale, criticised a pilot exercise launched by the Department of Social Security on ACT. He said insufficient emphasis had been given to the fact that benefits would continue to be paid through post offices. Mr David Nicholson, Conservative MP for Taunton, urged ministers to accept that the 'malaise' experienced by the party during the recent county council elections should make proposals to privatise the Post Office 'a dead duck'.</p>

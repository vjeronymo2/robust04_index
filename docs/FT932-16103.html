			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Platon decides to recommend Wills bid Platon International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group, has decided to recommend the Pounds 2.9m bid from Wills Group after the industrial, electronic and automotive products company agreed to introduce a cash alternative. The alternative is 25p per share, which compares with Wills' offer of five shares for every four Platon, valuing the latter at 27.9p per share. The offer has been declared final in the absence of a competitive situation. The company already owns or has announced valid acceptances in respect of 1.8m shares (16.91 per cent) and after taking into account anticipated acceptances will control 40.32 per cent. If the offer is declared unconditional, Mr Robin Bromley-Martin, Platon's chief executive and Mr Jean Claude Andre, managing director of its French operations, will be invited to join the Wills board.</p>

Two radio stations were considering taking legal action  against the head of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia after  he failed to pay for more than four hours of radio time, priced  21,000 dollars, the reports in SEVODNYA and MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS newspapers said.    During the campaign, the state picked up the tab for three  hours of radio time and two hours of television time for each  party. Additional time was meant to be paid for by the  candidates themselves.    The newspapers published copies of payment orders signed by  the Zhirinovskiy party for two banks. However the papers quoted  the head of one of the banks as saying the documents did not  belong to his bank.    A spokesman for the Liberal-Democratic party told AFP it was  "up to the banks to pay the bills they were told to and that it  couldn't possibly be a question of financial fiddling by  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy."    Various reports have estimated the cost of radio and TV time  used by the ultra-nationalist leader, who won 23 percent of the  vote, at between 70,000 and 650,000 dollars.    Russia media charge up to one million rubles (6,500 dollars)  for a minute of time.    Last month a rival candidate in Zhirinovskiy's suburban  Moscow constituency of Shelokovo lodged a formal complaint of  violations of the electoral law during the December 12 vote  which the ultra-nationalist leader won.    Zhirinovskiy's election could be invalidated by a court if  the charges are substantiated.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN BUSINESSES SHOW INTEREST BUT MOVE CAUTIOUSLY IN EASTERN BLOC;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE: PREDICTIONS OF AN IMPENDING INVESTMENT BOOM ARE EXAGGERATED,  EXPERTS SAY. BUSINESSMEN ARE WARY OF PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL  INSTABILITY.  </P> <P> The great foreign investment rush to Eastern Europe is off to a slow -- and  decidedly cautious -- start.  </P> <P> As country after country has broken away from Communist domination, headlines  have trumpeted a flurry of new ventures in what used to be the Eastern Bloc.  Japan's Daihatsu Motor has proposed a plan for producing compact cars in  Poland. West Germany's Volkswagen is teaming up with an East German auto maker.  And just this month, America's General Electric completed a deal for a majority  stake in Tungsram, Hungary's state-owned lighting maker.  </P> <P> "There are hundreds of foreign investors running around the country," exulted  Kalman Meszaros, managing director of Hungary's international investment  agency.  </P> <P> But appearances may be deceptive. Despite the headlines, analysts say, the  overall volume of foreign-backed ventures is modest.  </P> <P> That is bad news for the emerging East European democracies, which are counting  on heavy investment from abroad to help provide the resources needed to  modernize their economies and push them toward prosperity.  </P> <P> Hungary, which has revamped its foreign ownership laws and is several years  ahead of its neighbors in overhauling its economic institutions, has received  the lion's share of foreign investment to date. Poland is a distant second, and  Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria remain virtually untouched.  </P> <P> Moreover, U.S. businessmen who have surveyed the prospects in Eastern Europe  say predictions of an impending investment boom are greatly exaggerated.  </P> <P> "People think there is a gold mine there, but there isn't," said Jenik Radon, a  New York-based lawyer who has helped arrange East European ventures for U.S.  and other Western businesses. "There are opportunities in Eastern Europe, but  you have to have patience."  </P> <P> As many firms have, Monsanto, the St. Louis-based chemicals manufacturer, has  passed up investing in Eastern Europe in favor of exporting there from its  Western European plants.  </P> <P> "Sure, you are likely to see increased investments over the next five years,  but they'll be prudent and selective," said Michael A. Petrilli, Monsanto's  director of international development. "You're not going to see any company bet  the ranch on investment in Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> With Western aid likely to be limited and borrowing from commercial banks  almost impossible, Hungary's Meszaros calls foreign investment "by far the best  way" for cash-short East European economies to obtain badly needed financing,  marketing skills and technology.  </P> <P> "We cannot reform our old system within our own means," Lech Walesa, leader of  Poland's Solidarity Union, said recently. "This is impossible without outside  help."  </P> <P> At least on paper, Eastern Europe is a tempting prospect. It has a virtually  untapped market of 120 million consumers, nearly bursting with pent-up demand.  It is laden with natural resources and heavy industry. Its work force is  reasonably sophisticated. Wage levels are low. Its governments openly welcome  foreign ventures. And most Western governments -- including that of the United  States -- are willing to guarantee investment loans.  </P> <P> The Eastern European countries are moving rapidly to revamp their laws to  encourage more foreign investment. Poland and Hungary allow private ownership  of property and corporations, and they permit foreigners to own 100% of any  businesses that they buy or start. Earlier this week, East Germany joined the  move by announcing plans to liberalize its own foreign investment rules.  </P> <P> "I'd tell (businessmen) to start looking into it right now," said U.S. Commerce  Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.  </P> <P> Some businessmen are taking Mosbacher's advice. Mark Palmer, U.S. ambassador to  Hungary, is resigning to head a new consortium of U.S. and Canadian financiers  that is planning a series of investments in the region. Their first venture was  the purchase of one of the oldest banks in Hungary.  </P> <P> But companies that invest in Eastern Europe also face daunting challenges.  After 40 years under communist domination, Eastern Europe suffers from an  infrastructure that is primitive by Western standards. The banking system  barely functions. Hard currency and foreign goods are difficult to find.  Competent managers are almost non-existent. Worker productivity is substandard.  Technology is outmoded. Ownership rights are muddled. Shortages abound.  </P> <P> Even more stultifying, the political situation is still too uncertain for  investors' comfort. Not only does the situation in the Soviet Union remain  unsettled, but most non-communist East European countries still lack basic  stability. Even Poland, which has taken the boldest steps toward creating an  attractive investment environment, concedes that its reform efforts could  collapse.  </P> <P> As a result, said William T. Archey, vice president for international business  at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, "contrary to everything that you read in the  papers, business is taking this one a little more cautiously."  </P> <P> The companies that are most likely to make it in Eastern Europe "are the ones  that have the resources to be patient," Archey said. "There is going to be no  such thing as an overnight payoff."  </P> <P> Western managers who have started ventures in East Europe echo Archey's  warning.  </P> <P> Zbigniew Puzio, Warsaw-based representative for A. M. Dan, an Australian  entrepreneur, recalls the difficulty that he had trying to launch a simple  construction project to build homes for senior citizens. Because Poland had no  private property, simply obtaining the necessary land took weeks of  negotiations, Puzio said. Shortages were so severe that it took months to get  needed materials. And workers were so sloppy that he had to rip up some  apartments and rebuild them.  </P> <P> Donald J. Mucha, chairman of Unitronex Corp., a Chicago-area trading company,  ran into similar problems when he considered starting a fast-food chain in  Poland early last year. With almost all real estate owned by the state,  obtaining sites for pizza and chicken stands seemed likely to take years. The  state-owned printing monopoly would not provide the logo-embossed cups and  plates that he wanted. Ensuring a reliable supply of chicken was all but  impossible.  </P> <P> Although Mucha has launched half a dozen successful joint ventures in Poland,  this time the obstacles seemed just too formidable, and he shelved the proposal  entirely. "I decided it just wasn't the time," he said.  </P> <P> Those who are familiar with the East European economies are advising would-be  investors to stick to Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and -- eventually -- East  Germany.  </P> <P> They also urge investments in manufacturing operations that are labor-intensive  and relatively simple. Archey recommends industries such as food processing,  farm-implement manufacturing and "infrastructure" development -- such as the  establishment of delivery and distribution facilities.  </P> <P> Charles Movit, an analyst at PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting firm, said  some bargains are out there, particularly among the relatively few  internationally known East Bloc firms that have reasonably good reputations --  Tungsram is one example -- "that could be turned around relatively quickly"  with an infusion of Western management, capital and some technology.  </P> <P> Although there is a wide opportunity for selling Western-made  telecommunications equipment -- the telephone systems in all East European  countries are shockingly out of date -- PlanEcon recommends avoiding  high-technology manufacturing because it is too sophisticated for the East  Europeans to undertake competitively.  </P> <P> Also wide open is the market for building luxury hotels that are capable of  serving Western visitors -- a natural for emerging East Bloc economies because  the hotels employ local workers, earn their own hard currency from the West and  help attract still more foreign investment. U.S.-based Marriott Corp. recently  opened such a hotel in Warsaw.  </P> <P> Nick Ward, senior vice president in Marriott's Bethesda, Md., headquarters,  said the Warsaw venture has been successful enough that the company is eyeing  "potential projects in most of the capitals of Eastern Europe and the Soviet  Union," as well.  </P> <P> Western governments are doing what they can to promote foreign investment in  the emerging East European democracies. Along with the guarantees that the  United States is providing for investment loans, Mosbacher has led two  government-sponsored missions to interest corporate executives in investing in  Poland.  </P> <P> But U.S. officials concede that neither mission bore much fruit. "The interest  level has picked up substantially, but no one is ready to move yet," one  strategist said.  </P> <P> European firms, while visibly more active in Eastern Europe, are still playing  a limited role, according to analysts who are tracking their ventures there.  West German firms have a special interest in branching into East Germany, and  Austrians have begun channeling investment money back into Hungary, where they  have longstanding ties. But even they "are being cautious," PlanEcon's Movit  said.  </P> <P> All sides agree that not much is likely to happen until East European countries  guarantee Western-style property and ownership rights, work rules and access to  capital. They also must provide the infrastructure that today's businesses need  to function. And the transition to democracy and a free-market economy must  proceed far enough along to win investor confidence.  </P> <P> Estimates for that range from two to 10 years, depending on the country. "The  differences among the various East European countries are dramatic," lawyer  Radon said.  </P></p>

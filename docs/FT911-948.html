			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Pirelli seeks further talks with Continental CONTINENTAL, the German tyremaker, is to hold a hurriedly-called meeting of its supervisory board today to discuss a renewed request from Pirelli of Italy for further talks after the rejection of its initial merger proposal. Normally, the supervisory board, headed by Mr Ulrich Weiss, an executive director of Deutsche Bank, meets only a few times a year. The fact that today is a public holiday in Germany adds a note of urgency. Neither company would make any official comment on the meeting. Pirelli has made clear it remains keen on an amalgamation and wants further discussions. Continental has said it is only interested in talks about co-operation and not about merging, or at least not on Pirelli's terms, which would have left the Italian company in control. It was unclear yesterday whether the non-executive supervisory board would itself back a revised approach by Pirelli. Mr Weiss has previously supported the idea of discussions in principle, but has backed Continental's chief executive, Mr Horst Urban, in its outright opposition to Pirelli's original proposal.</p>

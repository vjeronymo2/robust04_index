			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Personal View: Boards with backbone Corporate governance in the US is not working the way it should. The problem is not the system of laws, regulations and judicial decisions which are the framework of corporate governance, but the failure by too many boards of directors to make the system work properly. Chancellor William Allen of the Delaware Court of Chancery, a leading judicial scholar on corporate law, argues that boards too often ignore a basic responsibility: 'the duty to monitor the performance of senior management in an informed way'. To do this, he says, board members should play an active role in formulating the company's long-term goals. 'They should as well engage in the periodic review of short and long-term performance according to plan and be prepared to press for correction when in their judgment there is need.' Our proposal, along similar lines, does not require big changes in what well-advised companies are already doing. It would not require any changes in laws or regulations. Nor does it require institutional investors to become patient, long-term shareholders, participating in corporate governance - however desirable that might be. The key elements are: Board size and composition. We recommend a smaller board - no more than 10 directors - with a ratio of at least two independent directors to each management director. An independent director is someone who does not have a substantial business connection with the company and is not an executive of another company which has an executive of the first company serving on its board. There should be term limits and a mandatory retirement age for independent directors. Audit, compensation and nominating committees should consist only of independent directors. Meetings. Boards should meet at least every two months, with one meeting each year being a two or three-day strategy session. Directors should undertake a day of additional preparation for each meeting. Directors' compensation should be increased and most should serve on no more than three boards. Lead director. Where one person is chief executive and chairman, the independent directors should choose a lead director from their ranks. The lead director should consult with the chief executive on the selection of board committee members, setting agendas, the adequacy of information furnished to directors and the board meeting process. The lead director should also co-ordinate an annual assessment of corporate performance and an evaluation of the chief executive. The lead director would chair the board if the chief executive were absent or if the independent directors were meeting alone. Information. To monitor the company's performance in relation to its long-term strategic, financial and organisational goals, directors need a broader array of data than the financial reports they typically receive. We recommend that boards consider a range of measures of performance such as profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel development, employee attitudes, public response and balance between short-term and long-term goals. Performance evaluation. This falls into three parts. First, there should be an annual assessment of the company's long-term financial, strategic and organisational performance in relation to the goals established by management and the board. Second, there should be an annual evaluation of chief executive performance, which might include extraordinary initiatives such as: developing and selecting a successor; international expansion; acquisitions; and joint ventures. The assessment and evaluation would be done by the independent directors and co-ordinated by the lead director. Third, there should be an annual evaluation by the board of its own performance. The board and shareholders. Companies should provide an annual informal setting in which the larger shareholders can meet directly with the board of directors. This meeting is intended to improve understanding between institutional shareholders and directors. We also recommend that, if in three of the past five years a company failed to meet its plans or goals, suffered losses or underperformed the market or its peer group, a special section of the annual report describing the causes of the problems and the actions taken to deal with them should be prepared under the supervision of the independent directors. When a company's underperformance triggers such a special report, we would permit big shareholders to communicate to other shareholders their views through the proxy statement. All of our proposals can be adopted by individual boards of directors with no more than changes in bylaws and boardroom procedures. We believe they provide an effective means for improving corporate governance, and strengthening the performance and the competitive position of US companies.

			<p>Summary--Despite      closure for nearly one month last December-  January, the Iraqi Youth Television (IYTV) station has become  another arm of media influence for Saddam Husayn's son, 'Udayy  Saddam Husayn.  Indeed, IYTV's resumption of broadcasting following  strong support from leading Baghdad dailies appears to have  solidified the station's status as an alternative to state-run  Iraqi Television (ITV).  The hardcopy version of this Foreign Media  Note contains a picture and name.      Like his radio station and the daily BABIL, flagship of his media  empire, IYTV has become a prominent part of 'Udayy's expanding  commercial, political, and cultural empire and a vehicle for  promoting his own interests. 'Udayy's adventure with electronic  media began on 28 April 1993, President Saddam Husayn's 56th  birthday, when he launched the radio station known as "Voice of  Youth from Dar al-Salam."  London's AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT noted on 12  May that the station quickly became known for "stinging criticism"  aimed at ministers and senior officials and their performances.      Meanwhile, 'Udayy began preparations, according to Paris' AL-  WATAN AL-'ARABI on 30 July, for starting a television station also  targeted at Iraqi youth, which together with the radio station, were  called by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI as signs of 'Udayy's "rising star" in  Iraq.  The first report of broadcasting by IYTV was monitored on 31  July on Iraqi radio.  Within a few months after IYTV began  broadcasting, AL-THAWRAH, a powerful Baghdad daily, praised 'Udayy  in its 12 September issue for "establishing a sound and healthy  democratic atmosphere, an atmosphere ... through which the citizen  smells the fresh air, vents his anguish, submits his complaints, and  exposes the corruption of those who exploit their position to  harass, exhaust the people, lie to and unjustly treat them."  It  continued: "'Udayy in his relations with citizens adopts the style  of the son who emulates his father, a style based on facts and love  for Iraqis."  It characterized IYTV, in the same rave review, as  representing "a course of action that restores hope to those who  lost it, and fulfills the dreams of those who stopped dreaming a  long time ago .... a course that will be a haven for those unjustly  treated by officials, who only care for themselves."      Despite the apparent success of this high profile media empire,  both of 'Udayy's radio and television stations were abruptly  shutdown in mid-December.  Iraqi officials and media sources gave no  reason for this sudden move, which amounted to a public thrashing  for 'Udayy, but it may have been caused by IYTV's penchant for sharp  criticism directed against high officials in Saddam's regime. For  example, on 4 August, the day a bomb exploded in Baghdad, IYTV  interviewed some Interior Ministry officials and aired what Interior  Minister Watban Ibrahim called, in an article published in BABIL on  10 August, an attempt "to belittle the efficiency of our Ministry's  officials."  Watban Ibrahim, a maternal half-brother of Saddam  Husayn, criticized IYTV, in the same article, for breaking "all  security restraints applied to cases concerning the security of the  State and society."  He said that IYTV "pretends" that it is  interested in truth, but in reality, it is engaged in an  "irresponsible" act "disguised as democracy."  He called IYTV's  conduct "arbitrary, moody, and undisciplined" and charged that IYTV  is "destructive" and provides a "weapon in the hands of our  enemies."--charges obviously directed against 'Udayy.      However, a few weeks after the shutdown of IYTV, two major  dailies came to 'Udayy's help and strongly appealed for the  resumption of IYTV broadcasts.  An article in AL-THAWRAH on 8  January called the interruption "an irreplaceable loss" and  expressed hopes that transmission would resume, because the  programming had been "well received by the various sectors of the  people."  AL-THAWRAH showed even greater solidarity with IYTV by  ceasing to publish ITV program schedules around the same time.  AL-  JUMHURIYAH, another Baghdad daily, also wrote on 8 January: "This  honest voice should resume transmission as soon as possible."  Two  days later, on 10 January, the Radio Baghdad announced the  resumption of IYTV broadcasting. As BABIL now resumed publishing  IYTV's daily schedule, the station became the only television  channel with program schedules published in the Iraqi press.      AL-THAWRAH continued to defend IYTV and attack its enemies,  saying on 19 January: "One cannot ask the Youth Television to please  everyone .... it should not appease the public by appealing to its  whims, shallow feelings, and low instincts because it will then turn  into an instrument for destruction and corruption .... Youth  Television is loved by the viewers, who have given it the right to  represent them.  It is now unacceptable to violate such a right."      PROGRAMMING      The following analysis is done based on published program  schedules for the two stations rather than actual programs, which  are not available to FBIS at this time.      Comparison of IYTV and ITV program schedules reveals that IYTV is  more interactive with its viewers, as it has a viewers' requests  segment.  IYTV may also appeal to a younger audience through  programs like fashion shows and sports segments. Furthermore, it  broadcasts commercial advertisements, which identifies IYTV as a  private rather than a government station.  In contrast, ITV clearly  presents the government's official line and has programs like  provincial reports, presentations by government officials, and  government educational programs. ITV broadcasts Friday prayer  sermons and has more than an hour of religious programming every day  (2 hours on Fridays), while IYTV has less than 10 minutes of  religious programming each day.      IYTV begins broadcasting each day at 1445 local time.  Programs  generally begin with the national anthem and a Koranic reading,  although at times commercial advertisements will open programming.  Among the programs, it has a political report segment, which may be  intended for presentation of independent news and analysis reports.  It gives weather reports, something that ITV has never done,  possibly because it is considered not important by ITV or because of  security reasons. The last feature of the day is always the national  anthem, which is preceded by a serial or a movie that begins any  time between 2300 to 0200.     Following is a typical example of IYTV programs:   IYTV:  Monday, 16 April 1994   14:45--Advertisements  15:00--National anthem &amp; Koranic reading  15:10--Pictures from the battle  15:15--Iraq: The Cradle of Civilization  15: 25--Cartoons  15:45--Variety cartoons  16:00--Sports section  17:00--News  17:10--Fashion show  17:25--New songs  17:45--Variety news report  18:00--News  18:10--Viewers' requests  18:55--Advertisements  19:00--Hourly news &amp; review of programs  19:10--Foreign serial "Manuela"  19:45--Variety songs  19:55--Advertisements  20:00--News  20:05--Charity program         Weather Report  20:15--Aspiring to the summit  20:55--Advertisements  21:00--Political reports  21:10--Sports section  21:30--Unforgettable songs  21:55--Advertisements  22:00--News &amp; Leader's speech  22:10--Arabic serial "The Man in Our Home"  23:00--News  23:15--Arabic movie "All of Them in Hell"         National anthem      A review of ITV program schedules when they were published by AL-  THAWRAH, shows that they consist of religious and Koranic lessons,  children's programs, TV magazine reports, provincial reports, both  Western and native serials, programs on farming, news in both Arabic  and English, musical, educational programs, presentations by  government officials, and foreign and Arabic movies.  Programming  begins every day, 1400 to 1500, local time and continue after  midnight.  ITV also carries Friday prayer sermons on Fridays.  Friday program begins at 1000 local time.      Following are two typical examples of ITV program days.   ITV Program: Thursday, 4 November 1993   15:00--National anthem  15:02--Readings from Koran &amp; religious lessons  15:20--Report on the fifth national celebrations from the province  of Babil  16:00--Religious lessons  17:00--Children' s program/cartoons  19:00--Evening newsmagazine  20:05--Part 8 of the Iraqi serial "Stories From the Days of  Tribalism"  21:00--News  22:10--Part 2 of the serial "Concrete Jungle"  23:00--News summary  23:10--Our shows and viewer responses  23:40--New Arabic movie "Doctorate With Honors"         Religious lessons ending with national anthem  ITV Program: Friday, 12 November 1993   10:00--National anthem and morning program  11:30--Switching to foreign broadcasting (system) for reporting on  Friday prayer events and sermons  13:20--Magazine program on the activities in the province of Ninawa  15:00--New Arabic movie "The She-Devil Who Loved Me".

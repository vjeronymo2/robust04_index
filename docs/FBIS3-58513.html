			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The European Publishers  Council (EPC) said here Monday [17 January] that a proposed law  to limit media concentrations would cripple the ability of  European companies to compete in new global information  technology.    It said that a resolution to be debated in the European  Parliament at Strasbourg on Thursday was aiming at new  restrictions at a time when U.S. media companies were being  freed to face up to a technological media revolution.    EPC chairman Sir Frank Rogers said the threat of new  regulations came "at the very moment when media companies are  attempting to ensure that the European Union is a major player  on the global information superhighway."    Rogers, deputy chairman of Britain's Telegraph group, said  the resolution was dangerous because recent developments in  global information, communications and media technology required  a less restrictive approach.    The resolution, sponsored by Euro-MPs Ben Fayot of  Luxembourg  and Dieter Schinzel of Germany, would give the European  Community power to limit European-wide print and audiovisual  concentrations which "threaten diversity of opinion and  pluralism."    The Fayot-Schinzel motion says that multimedia concentration  should be "assessed more effectively and, if necessary, limited."    But Rogers said the motion ignored evidence presented by the  EPC, which represents 27 European publishers and is pushing for  less, rather than more, control on cross-border investment and  ownership of media companies. He said the current revolution in  digital, interactive media technology required that media  companies should be free to join forces in order to exploit  these new developments.    "Yet Europe could be left on a side road while American and  Japanese media companies are freed to dominate the new global  opportunities," he said.    The EC's executive European Commission is expected to make  formal proposals on framework policies for the media industry in  three or four months.    The industry has been lobbying fiercely for several years  against any regulations or even policy guidelines from Brussels.</p>

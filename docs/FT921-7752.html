However, with the core companies reporting 'an improved outlook' and 'in the light of the sound financial strength of the group' the dividend for the year is maintained at 4p via a proposed same-again final of 2.25p. The shares rose 7p to 65p. Turnover fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 40.5m. A 93 per cent increase in exports to Pounds 5.31m partially offset a 14 per cent reduction in UK turnover.

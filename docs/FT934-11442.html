			<p>931101 FT  01 NOV 93 / British Steel in Indiana contract BRITISH STEEL has won its first overseas contract for a pioneering technology that reduces the amount of coke needed in blast furnaces, writes Andrew Baxter. Bethlehem Steel, one of the largest US steelmakers, is to install a system for injecting granular coal into the two blast furnaces at its Burns Harbor plant in Indiana. The technology has been in use at British Steel's Scunthorpe works for about 10 years. Cokemaking is a capital-intensive and environmentally sensitive process, but granular injection reduces the amount of coke required for iron-making by up to 40 per cent. Simon Macawber, the Doncaster iron and steelmaking equipment supplier, will make and install the equipment at Burns Harbor. British Steel will provide training, operating and technical assistance in the early production phase and will receive royalties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that  the American mindset, which accepts the unhesitating and hasty  killing of the children of other peoples, is behind the shooting  down of the two U.S. helicopters in northern Iraq.    In an article today on the downing of the two helicopters,  the paper adds that deteriorating morale among U.S. officers,  which is a traditional flaw in U.S. national security, makes  them panic and act irrationally whenever they have doubts about  the existence of an enemy force. U.S. propaganda and media  incitement against Iraq added to the U.S. officers panic, thus  making them act hastily, killing 26 Americans and Europeans, who  they mistook for people of another nationality -- which would  make it okay to kill them.    The paper adds: As in previous cases when he lied to  Congress, Clinton this time tried to peddle another lie among  the U.S. public to justify this incident and to contain any  negative repercussions. He claimed that the dead were on a  humanitarian mission assigned to them by the United Nations.  However, the United Nations did not wait long to answer,  immediately responding that it had nothing to do with the  mission nor had it asked anybody to undertake this mission.  The United Nations also said that the two helicopters received  orders from the United States.</p>

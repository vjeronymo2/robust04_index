			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Tube plans restart of tunnelling: Austrian method guidelines listed London Underground has submitted plans for restarting work on part of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee line extension using the controversial New Austrian Tunnelling Method. Work was halted as a precaution on two Jubilee line stations after a tunnel being excavated using the method collapsed under Heathrow airport in October. Plans for restarting work on the Jubilee line stations have been submitted to the Health and Safety Executive which is conducting an investigation into the Heathrow collapse and the suitability of using the method in London clay. The executive has asked contractors working on the Jubilee line extension and the Pounds 300m rail link from Heathrow to Paddington station in central London not to use the method until they are satisfied that proposed designs and construction procedures are safe. Mr Hugh Doherty, project director for the Jubilee line extension, said yesterday: 'We would hope to resume work as soon as possible but cannot say whether this will be before or after Christmas. The stoppage only affects two out of 11 stations on the extension. The bulk of work is continuing normally.' The Health and Safety Executive yesterday published a discussion paper which included a proposed checklist of procedures which it recommends should be adopted by designers and contractors opting to use the method. The Austrian technique, which has been used internationally for about 40 years, encourages engineers to utilise the strength of the ground surrounding a tunnel to minimise the extra strengthening required to prevent collapse during construction. The technique can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than conventional tunnelling methods. The executive said the success of the method depended upon precise predictions of ground responses to excavation together with sophisticated measuring procedures to allow engineers time to strengthen the tunnel if there were unexpected movements. Investigators into the Heathrow collapse are concentrating their inquiries on the possibility that it may have been caused by human error or design problems. The use of NATM in the UK.

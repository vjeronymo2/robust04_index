			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Minister's call on VAT highlights Tory tax splits Splits inside the Conservative party over the government's taxation policy seem to be intensifying, with a junior minister urging the Treasury to abandon the next phased increase in value added tax on fuel. Mr Allan Stewart, a Scottish Office minister, has told colleagues that the planned increase in VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent, due next April, should be withdrawn. Friends of Mr Stewart say that his call for VAT to remain at 8 per cent has received encouraging support from other junior ministers. Those arguing for the move believe that the upswing in the economic cycle is strong enough to diminish concern about public finances, and that the government now has the scope to reduce the tax burden without endangering the deficit. With the Tories at historically low levels in opinion polls, a number of Tory backbenchers have also argued that the government must set about reducing taxes if it is to have any chance of winning the next election. Mr Stewart is being careful not to intensify the issue by insisting on meetings with Treasury ministers. Instead, he merely wishes to reflect the views of senior Scottish Tory councillors to whom he has spoken in recent weeks. They believe that their poor performance in the Scottish regional elections was largely due to the increase in VAT on fuel. Treasury insiders caution that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is unlikely to have the scope to abandon the VAT increase next April unless the public sector borrowing requirement comes down unexpectedly quickly by November. But they also admit that, if there is a windfall, the permanent pegging of VAT is likely to be at the top of the chancellor's list of measures, ahead of other possible tax cuts. In political terms, a U-turn over VAT would leave the government vulnerable to opposition charges that it is weak and indecisive.</p>

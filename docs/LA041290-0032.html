			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED CARS  </P> <P> The demise of the Red Cars back in the early 1960s was the beginning of our  current transit woes; that was when mass transit began falling on hard times  and the one-person auto began flooding the streets and highways.  </P> <P> It's unfortunate that we've had to spend millions in taxpayer dollars on  research that keeps bringing us back to square one -- a light-rail network  retracing the routes of the old Red Cars.  </P> <P> Because of our failure to act, the inflated cost of the rail system is far more  now than it was in 1985.  </P> <P> While the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's recent action to  approve a plan to build three new light-rail lines is welcome news, it is  unfortunate that it has taken bureaucrats this long to act.  </P> <P> Let's bring back the Red Cars. They worked. They got us to where we were going.  And they were fun.  </P> <P> JOHN FERRARO  </P> <P> Councilman, 4th District  </P></p>

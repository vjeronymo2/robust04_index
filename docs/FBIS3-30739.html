			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, Feb 7 (TANJUG) -- Moslems from Tesanj,  in the north of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, publicly expressed their opposition to the  policy of the Bosnian Moslem fundamentalist leader Alija  Izetbegovic after a six-month silent resistance.    In a local radio programme monitored in the neighbouring  Serb  town of Banja Luka a proclamation was read accusing Izetbegovic  of a policy of war with the creation of an Islamic state, a  jamahiriya, in Bosnia-Herzegovina as its main objective.    "The policy carried out by Izetbegovic so far has brought us  to the verge of a catastrophe ... we could have separated from  each other and remained in peace with the Serbs and the Croats,  but they started to stir us up, to teach us that we are of  Moslem origin and that particularily the Serbs have been our  century-old enemies", the proclamation reads.    Emphasizing that they wanted neither an autonomy nor a  jamahiriya the Moslems from Tesanj called on their countrymen in  Bosnia- Herzegovina to stand up against those who are for the  continuation of bloodshed which will result in their eradication.    "Do not let them push us into a prolonged war against the  Serbs", the proclamation states calling on the Islamic  fundamentalists to leave the Tesanj area and to let the local  Moslems continue to live in peace with or besides the Serbs and  the Croats.    "We shall reach an agreement with the Serbs, let us not  allow  the fundamentalists to change our language and our culture", the  Moslems from Tesanj said adding that they did not wish to  prevent those who wanted to continue fighting for the "crazy  ideas of a state founded on Islam".    The proclamation is the most direct confirmation of numerous  indications in the last few months about the resistance of the  local Moslems from Tesanj to Izetbegovic's policy.    There are also reports about agitations within the 110th  Brigade of the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO), stationed in the Tesanj  area, whose representatives contact units of the Bosnian Serbs  more and more frequently with the aim of reaching a peace  settlement.    These efforts have so far not yielded results because of the  resistance of the Islamic fundamentalists dominating the Moslem  units, loyal to Izetbegovic in the Tesanj area.</p>

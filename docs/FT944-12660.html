			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Nations queue to join WTO Three countries have formally applied to join the World Trade Organisation, even though it has yet to come into existence. This is in addition to the 125 nations which took part in the Uruguay Round global trade negotiations. Slovenia, which became the 124th member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the weekend, has already opened negotiations to join the WTO, which is due to start work on January 1 next year. Gatt will be absorbed by the new organisation. Croatia, which applied for Gatt membership last year, now says it wants to join the WTO directly. And Sudan last week became the first country not to apply for Gatt membership at all, but to aim straight for WTO entry. WTO membership requires applicants to sign up to fair trade rules covering not only goods, as Gatt does, but also services and intellectual property. In addition, members must submit schedules of market opening commitments for goods and services agreed after bilateral negotiations with trading partners. Some 19 nations are continuing to negotiate Gatt accession, including China and Algeria which took part in the Uruguay Round. The assumption is that they will all apply to join the WTO in due course. China and Taiwan are already negotiating on services and intellectual property in readiness for WTO membership. Among the others, the most advanced is Mongolia, where agreement on Gatt membership terms is close. A four-day meeting of the working party considering Mongolia's draft protocol of accession starts today. Ecuador has also begun tariff negotiations marking the final stage of the Gatt entry process.</p>

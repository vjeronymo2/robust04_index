			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRIS CONSECRATED IN EPISCOPAL RITES;  </P> <P> CHEERS, PROTESTS GREET 1ST WOMAN BISHOP  </P> <P> The Rev. Barbara Harris, with the voices of dissidents overwhelmed by cheers  from thousands of fellow Episcopalians, on Saturday became the first woman  elevated to bishop in a 2,000-year succession dating back to the apostles.  </P> <P> Harris was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8,000 people when she  walked down the aisle for a consecration that has drawn world attention because  she is female and because of her background and liberal views.  </P> <P> "I felt during the laying on of hands that I was part of the ongoing history of  the church," Harris said. "I felt a part of the apostolic succession at that  moment."  </P> <P> Harris assumed the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop in the Boston  Episcopal diocese.  </P> <P> The bitter controversy over the ordination of women that has simmered since  Harris' election in September boiled over Saturday. But objections were met by  boos from many of those in attendance.  </P> <P> During a period in the ceremony allotted for protest, John Jamieson of  Evanston, Ill., chairman of the conservative Prayer Book Society's Chicago  chapter, appealed to the Most Rev. Edmond Browning, chief consecrator at the  ceremony and presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States.  </P> <P> "Bishop Browning, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding with this  pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious imposture. . . . "  Jamieson said.  </P> <P> A second dissident -- the Rev. James Hopkinson Cupit Jr. of New York -- said  Harris' election has "caused grievous division" in the Anglican Communion,  churches that follow the tradition of the Church of England, including the  Episcopal Church in the United States.  </P> <P> Browning responded that the issues raised had been considered by the church and  that the majority of bishops and diocesan standing committees had approved  Harris' consecration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Standing Ovation  </P> <P> "In this circumstance, we shall proceed with the ordination," he said. The  crowd responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes.  </P> <P> Opponents included traditionalists who believe that because the apostles were  men, the position of bishop must be reserved for men. Others objected to Harris  because of her lack of a college degree and formal seminary training and  because of her relative inexperience in parish ministerial work. Still others  objected to her strongly liberal writings on gay rights, U.S. policy in Central  America and internal church matters.  </P> <P> Harris, who is black, said she believes that some of the opposition to her  elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex.  </P> <P> Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Los Angeles diocese, was among those taking  part in the ceremony, said Bob Williams, a church spokesman. Also present were  assistant bishops Daniel Corrigan and George Barrett of Santa Barbara and  assistant bishop John R. Krumm of Tustin, he said.  </P> <P> The three-hour service was filled with pomp and circumstance. Six choirs sang  Mozart and spirituals. There were three separate ecclesiastical processions.  </P> <P> As Harris entered the hall near the end of the third procession, the hall  erupted into a twinkling of camera flashes. People climbed on their chairs for  a better view while others pressed close. When the new Bishop Harris, garbed  for the first time in the vestments and symbols of her office, was presented to  the people, they clapped, jumped up and down and hugged each other.  </P></p>

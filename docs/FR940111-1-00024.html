			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 228 reports of cracks in the left compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold, lower CDP tube, and compressor rear frame (CRF) bleed port struts. Of these 228 reports, 24 have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns, and 24 in rejected takeoffs. The current type design hardware has been found to crack, allowing hot air to leak into the core cowl area, resulting in false fire warnings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cracks in the current type design hardware are the result of high cycle fatigue (HCF). The excessive stress is the result of both thermal and airframe installation loading factors. New hardware exists which decreases operating stresses, therefore reducing the chance of cracks due to HCF. This condition, if not corrected, may result in cracks in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to the engine nacelle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 75&hyph;065, Revision 1, dated March 26, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the CRF bleed port struts; GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 75&hyph;067, dated March 15, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the stage 14 turnbuckle; and GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 75&hyph;064, Revision 2, dated July 23, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks, and if found cracked, rework or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the CRF as a terminating action to the inspection program. The compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, is proposed to ensure timely compliance. Based upon engine shop visit rates, a compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, will ensure timely compliance while minimizing the number of forced engine removals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 2202 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 223 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed inspections, 32 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed terminating action, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $27,500 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $6,549,510.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jun (EFE) -- According to Japanese Foreign  Ministry sources, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori reiterated  his country's desire to join the Asian Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC).    Fujimori, who is on the second day of his private visit,  expressed this desire during a dinner given in his honor by  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Hata explained to Fujimori that the APEC decided last  November to freeze accepting new members for three years. He  also said that the Japanese proposal to the other APEC members  to allow Peru to attend its working meeting did not receive a  consensus.    Fujimori plans to meet Emperor Akihito and visit the NEC  electronics factory in Yokohama, near Tokyo, today.</p>

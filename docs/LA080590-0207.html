			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DUTCH TREAT;  </P> <P> U.S. BASEBALL TEAM WILL SWING ALONG WITH MITCH MILLER TO EUROPE AGAIN  </P> <P> Mitch Miller's teams apparently are trying to hit to all fields.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, Miller and a team that includes several  Valley-area high school and college players are venturing to Europe to tutor  and compete against would-be adopters of America's national pastime.  </P> <P> Last summer Miller took a contingent to France to help prepare the French  national team for the European championships.  </P> <P> Today, a Miller-led team, sponsored in part by the West Coast Baseball School  in Agoura, will leave on a 10-day trip to the Netherlands where it will compete  against the Dutch junior national team that is preparing for the junior world  championships later this month in Havana.  </P> <P> The Americans will play six or seven games in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Haarlem  and also conduct clinics for youngsters.  </P> <P> "We're going to approach the games trying to win, but we're going over there to  prepare the Dutch," said Miller, a junior high school teacher and scout for the  Kansas City Royals who has coached several teams in the Valley. "They don't  have the luxury of turning on a TV and getting a baseball game every night like  we can here. Their only instructional aids are videos and tapes of games.  </P> <P> "They like teams to come over and demonstrate how to play in person."  </P> <P> Eighteen players, drawn primarily from the Valley and the West Side, were  recruited by Miller and co-coach Bryan Maloney for the tour.  </P> <P> Valley-area players making the trip include former Chatsworth High infielder  Nick Simpson, pitcher John Levine of Oakwood, infielder Eric Berger of  Crescenta Valley, catcher Mike Wisenberg and outfielder Kevin Egan of Glendale  College, and catcher Mike Sims of Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Sims, who started for Northridge last season as a freshman, had planned to  relax this summer after helping lead the Matadors to a second-place finish at  the NCAA Division II World Series in Montgomery, Ala.  </P> <P> But he jumped at the opportunity to travel overseas and is hoping to use the  tour as preparation for Northridge's step up to Division I next season.  </P> <P> "I hear it's a beautiful country," said Sims, who graduated from Alemany High.  "I've been looking up things about it and I'm anxious to go out and see how  they play baseball there."  </P> <P> One thing is certain: The Dutch team and facilities figure to be far better  than those offered by the French, who did not compete in the 1984 or 1988  Olympic baseball exhibitions but are shooting for the 1992 Games in Barcelona.  </P> <P> The U. S. team took seven of eight games against its inexperienced opponents  during a two-week stay in and around Paris last August.  </P> <P> Denny Vigo, a junior-to-be third baseman at Northridge, was among the  contingent that visited France.  </P> <P> "It was a good experience just to see the way other people live," said Vigo,  who is recovering from a torn hamstring suffered in the Division II national  championship game at the end of May.  </P> <P> "Baseballwise, I think the team that is going this year will see better  competition than we experienced."  </P> <P> Unlike the French, the Dutch are not novices when it comes to baseball. Several  Americans play in professional leagues on teams sponsored by private  corporations such as Philips Electronics, and at least one Dutchman has signed  a contract with a major league organization in the U. S.  </P> <P> Although the Americans practiced only informally a few times before departing,  Vigo said unfamiliar teammates become close once they take the field in Europe.  </P> <P> "The best thing about it is all the guys on the team got along," Vigo recalled  of last year's squad. "We didn't know each other before we left, but being over  there for two weeks, we became a team pretty quick."  </P> <P> Both on and off the field.  </P> <P> In addition to touring the cathedral of Notre Dame and the Louvre Museum as a  group, the Americans displayed their unity by rallying together during a row  with surly restaurant workers in a cafe along the Left Bank.  </P> <P> Miller said he hopes to avoid a repeat of that kind of incident, but added that  his players will have free time to explore the sights of the cities they visit.  Among the attractions: the van Gogh and Rembrandt museums, Anne Frank's house,  and the Heineken Brewery.  </P> <P> "It's an educational experience. For a lot of these kids it will be their first  long trip away from home," said Miller, who has coached at Mission College and  also was an assistant for the Valley Dodgers, who finished seventh at the  National Baseball Congress World Series in 1988.  </P> <P> "But we're also going over there to work on some skills and prepare these  players for their seasons next year."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock today said there  had been no attempt by any of the parties in South Africa's  general election to interfere "in any malign way" with voting  procedures.    Asked if there had been any fiddling Mr. Kinnock, who is  leading some 20 British parliamentarians acting as monitors and  observers, said: "We have seen no evidence. Any problems have  been inadvertent problems of distance or supply or simply  inexperience. There has been no attempt by any of the parties  to interfere in any malign way with voting procedures."    Mr. Kinnock, whose group has visited 19 polling stations  over  several hundred square miles, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme  that an extension of voting to midnight tonight would be very  sensible.</p>

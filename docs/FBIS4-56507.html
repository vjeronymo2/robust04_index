			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman has  said that Guatemala is waiting for the United States to  establish the criteria for it and the other Central American  countries to join NAFTA, which also includes Mexico and Canada.    She said Guatemala could easily meet any prerequisites those  countries might impose in order to participate in the trade  bloc, considered one of the largest in the world. She said it  is plausible that our country could be given "parity" treatment,  even though the criteria for eligibility to receive this  preferential treatment has not been established, because  Guatemala meets the technical and quality prerequisites to  expedite its inclusion into NAFTA.    "Last month I was in Washington, and I held some talks  regarding this possibility, which is why I am optimistic and why  I believe Guatemala will be among the first countries to receive  parity," she said.    She explained this procedure meant receiving the benefits  derived from NAFTA, but she clearly stated this is a unilateral  step taken by the United States and not by the other NAFTA  members.    Ruiz de Vielman said there was no deadline set to achieve  "parity." Everything concerning this issue is subject to U.S.  approval, although she emphasized that the U.S. authorities are  "very sympathetic" toward Guatemala's case.    At any rate, she said, in the future any negotiation or  petition regarding NAFTA must be conducted on a regional, not  individual, level in order to guarantee a swift and firm reply  to Central American proposals.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Don't play into the hands of Burglar Bill - Soaring crime means higher home insurance premiums / What householders should look for IT WAS Hurricane Andrew in Florida but it is more likely to be Bill, your neighbourhood burglar, in the UK. Whatever the disaster, if you do not have insurance for damage or loss to home contents, you may regret it. The insurance company Top-UK estimates that around 40 per cent of homes are either not insured for loss to their contents or are underinsured. One reason may be the rise in premiums over the past year because of the increased number of claims. This is caused by the substantial rise in crime, but insurance companies also believe that there has been an increase in fraudulent claims, with victims of theft exaggerating the value of their missing goods. The Association of British Insurers estimated in June that the cost of domestic crime claims had risen by up to 75 per cent last year compared with 1990. As homeowners face up to heavier premiums, it becomes more and more important to obtain more than one quotation. Many people are happy to buy a home contents policy through their mortgage provider - but they may be paying over the odds for the convenience. As the table shows, quotes vary widely between companies, because the cover they provide, while similar, is not identical. Many companies offer the incentive of reduced premiums to those householders who fit security devices to windows and doors, or who are part of a Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Usually, the older you are, the lower the premium. Some insurers also offer no claims discounts, similar to motor insurance. Type of policy The policy you choose depends on the type of cover you need and the amount that has to be insured. There are two basic types of policy: bedroom-rated cover, which is the more common, and sum-insured. The first often represents better value for those needing larger amounts of cover, typically Pounds 30,000. 'Insurers offering bedroom-rated policies know that the average person has not got Pounds 30,000 worth of goods to cover but around Pounds 16,000 instead,' says Charles Stollery of Directline Insurance, which provides sum-insured cover. 'For those with Pounds 30,000 of goods it is a very competitive deal, but those with Pounds 16,000 can do better elsewhere.' For many people, the drawback with sum-insured policies is that they are cumbersome. The homeowner has to estimate the value of all the home's contents, often needing to seek professional advice regarding the value of items and running the risk of underestimating. It was partly for these reasons that bedroom-rated policies took off in the 1980s. Countrywide Insurance says that premiums for bedroom-rated policies have been low for the amount of cover provided and an increase in premiums in this area may revive interest in sum-insured policies. What the policy should cover All policies should insure your possessions against disasters such as storm, flood, fire, earthquake, theft, vandalism, falling trees, riot/political disturbance and subsidence. In addition, you should ensure the policy offers new for old cover and not simply indemnity, which only replaces the cost of the item with deduction for wear and tear. Note the exclusions to the new for old cover - some insurers will not extend this to carpets and curtains and most exclude clothes. Accidental damage. Most companies provide cover for accidental damage to hi-fis, videos and home computers but you are likely to pay more to have accidental damage cover extended beyond those products. Good policies should also pay for new locks if you lose your keys and temporary accommodation if your house is made uninhabitable. You should also be covered for legal liability. For example, if a visitor to the home sues you because the chandelier fell on his head, you would be covered for the claim, usually up to Pounds 1m. Check that the policy has inflation protection and is adjusted in line with the Retail Prices Index every month. Optionals: You can pay more to take out all-risks cover to cover your belongings outside the home. Extra insurance can also be taken out to cover cash in the home, which is usually insured to Pounds 250. Where claims can fail Note the exclusions to the policy. Many insurers have come up with user-friendly policies, stating clearly what is and is not covered. Vagueness on the part of the insurer can sometimes be to your advantage. The Insurance Ombudsman said in his 1990 annual report that in cases where the phrase 'personal effects' is not clearly defined, 'any uncertainty in construction must benefit the policyholder.' Most policies will not cover you if the house is left unoccupied for more than 30 days. Colin Taylor of Frizzell Insurance says that people insure their basic contents but forget about their personal valuables, such as spectacles or watches. Another common failing is to forget that most insurers have a single article limit (usually around Pounds 1,000) and neglect to insure high value single items separately. The Consumers' Association warns homeowners not to undervalue their possessions because insurance companies will pay only a portion of your claim and may not pay at all. By the same token, if you have overvalued your possessions, you will only be paid what the insurance company calculates they are worth. If you take in lodgers or rent out your home you must inform your insurance company as your cover will be affected.</p>

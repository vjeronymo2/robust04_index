			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Chairman expects Stefanel to maintain profit STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing group best known for its brightly-coloured knitwear, is likely to report static earnings when it publishes full figures shortly. Mr Giuseppe Stefanel, chairman, said the company had experienced a year of 'consolidation' in 1991. Stefanel's earnings recovered strongly in 1990 after being depressed by a variety of factors the previous year. Last year's earnings were also hit by the fact that group sales were virtually unchanged from the L434bn (Dollars 350.28m) in 1990, rather than reaching about L460bn, as targeted. Turnover for 1991, which will be between L435bn and L436bn, was affected by the decision not to bid for certain brands which had been produced by the group's CFM subsidiary. The move had reduced group sales by some L30bn last year, according to Mr Stefanel. He remained cautiously optimistic about the dividend, which he said would at least match that paid in 1990. Mr Stefanel argued that it had been a considerable achievement to maintain the group's earnings and sales performance during a very difficult year. Looking ahead, he expected sales to reach L500bn this year, thanks to continuing geographical expansion and the steady upgrading of the company's core Italian outlets. However, he recognised that achieving the group's target of 15 to 20 per cent growth in sales annually would not be easy 'at a time of virtually static prices'.</p>

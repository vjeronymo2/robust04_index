			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Arts: Moving Hugh Leonard's new play examines the changes which have taken place among the plain people of Ireland in the course of his long career as a dramatist, a career which started in 1954 and has given us 31 stage plays to date. As Moving opens in 1957, Tom and Ellie Noone have finally become the occupiers of 'a house with stairs in it', even though the fact that they will have to pay Pounds 4 a week to the bank for the next 20 years fills Ellie with dread. The Noone family has four children, the eldest of whom are typical Fifties teenagers, rebelling against the religiosity and nationalism, of their schooling, and the heavy censorship of their films and books. Ellie's mother, an unsober working-class granny - 'She'd steal the pattern off a willow plate' - lives with them, causing tension. Tom and Ellie retain family loyalties while priding themselves on a modern outlook. When Tom Noone's schoolteacher friend, Turvey, feels obliged to feel concerned that Tom's son no longer attends Sunday Mass, Tom Noone is determined to talk it through, and not to play the heavy-handed paterfamilias. In the second act, instead of presenting the same Noones, timeworn and disillusioned, the clever Mr Leonard presents us with a totally new set of Noones. Tom and Ellie (their essential ordinariness once again brilliantly captured by John Olahan and Anita Reeves) married in 1969 and have two children aged 16 and 18. The same removals man, played with comic brio by Johnny Murphy, acts as a king of on-stage chorus, pointing out that although the Noones' moving day in 1987 is supposed to be roughly the same as it was in 1957, it keeps coming out differently. One difference is that granny has her own 'bijou home', and in contrast to the earthy survivor of Act One, is a pretentious hypocrite. The inimitable veteran of Irish comedy, Maureen Potter, no longer lurches about in wrinkled stockings, but minces along in a chain-store floral frock. The teenagers are lovable middle-class 'punks'. Turvey, the bachelor teacher, is now overtly gay. Leonard's observation of the foibles of suburban Dublin remains sharp, as does his concern with the ways in which people relate to their own past. Moving is more than another comedy of manners. It is Leonard's contribution to the debate on Irish identity, a debate which seeks to discover whether Ireland's long overdue adoption of the values of the developed world is a good thing, or whether something irretrievable has been lost. His answer seems to be that as long as people like Tom Noone do not let material wealth swamp their natural optimism, the new Irish will be all right. Would that it were that simple.

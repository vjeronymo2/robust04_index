He  noted that being in a very important geo-strategic zone at the  intersection of numerous interests, by the help of the program  the Republic of Moldova will strive for consolidation of peace  and good will and for the solution of the various and  complicated problems it presently faces, based on international  principles and rights. "We are also ready to elaborate as soon  as possible the document of attendance for the signing of the  bilateral agreement of partnership that will define the  character and degree of Moldova's cooperation with corresponding  NATO structures," said Snegur. He declared that Moldova is  interested in an effective participation in the program, "with  the certainty that it will offer us favorable opportunities for  the creation of a professional army, in accordance with  requirements, democratic principles and international  standards." Mircea Snegur stressed that the Republic of Moldova  pays special attention to the consultations on security  stipulated by the program, especially in the case when a member  state deems its territorial integrity, political independence or  national security threatened. According to President Snegur,  "today these principles are violated by the presence of foreign  troops on Moldovan territory. This fact is in our opinion the  biggest obstacle for the final political solution of the  conflict in Moldova's Eastern regions."</p>

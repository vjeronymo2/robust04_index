			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Still a macho nonconformist - A drink or two with actor, raconteur and mimic Robert Mitchum MEETING Robert Mitchum requires an appetite for wild anecdotes and a cast-iron liver. We met at 11. By 12.40. pm in his up-market local bar  - the Biltmore Four Seasons Hotel in bougainvillaea-clad Montecito, 80 miles up-coast from Los Angeles - the star had knocked back five double Martinis and I had made my frail attempt to keep up with four dry sherries. (I had to drive back to LA) The lunch gong had not yet sounded and Mitchum, casting his narrative line and hook, had already reeled in a screaming-and-kicking Otto Preminger, a tyrannical Josef Von Sternberg, a river-soaked Marilyn Monroe, a storm-tossed Sir David Lean and a squealing, swooning Michael Winner. These celebrities struggled in the reminiscing grasp of the 74-year-old actor with the hooded eyes, the basso voice and - first thing I noted as he walked through the door - that indelible chest-first perpendicular walk. To be Robert Mitchum is to be an immortal lining up for a place on cinema's Mount Rushmore. He is one of those rare actors who define the line between movie and theatre acting. In theatre you use vocal and gestural technique to travel the imaginative distance between yourself and the role. In cinema, where impersonation is seen through at the first close-up, your own personality must be strong enough, magnetic enough to make the role come to you. Mitchum was supposed to be talking to me about his new film Cape Fear, opening in Britain on March 6, in which he makes a dry-witted cameo appearance as a Southern sheriff. The film is Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 hoodlum-at-large thriller in which Mitchum starred with Gregory Peck. But we left the new film after a few dutiful burblings: 'It was pleasant enough, three days in Fort Lauderdale, free lunch . . .'. And why had Scorsese cast him? 'I guess just to add a little panache to the cast list, you know . . .' Two minutes of this and we pressed the rewind button. Mitchum has had an amazing career. Not just on the screen, where his nonchalant approach to acting in films like Out of the Past, Macao, The Sundowners and Heaven Knows, Mr Allison has led critics to talk of sleepwalking buzzards or sharks on sleep-cure, but off the screen. His professional life began with arrest and scandal, though Mitchum now claims he was 'set up' for the famous 1947 marijuana bust that put him in jail and would have finished most actors' careers. Instead it enhanced Mitchum's reputation as a macho nonconformist. He attained pack-leader status among the stars of the deglamorised postwar era. 'It was the age of ugly leading men,' he recalls. 'Before that you had the Tyrone Powers and Robert Taylors. Suddenly the Bogarts came in and you had these ordinary, protean heroes.' The stars playing them were not ordinary, though, even if Mitchum today makes a signature tune out of self-deprecation. He sort of, well, drifted into stardom in the early 1940s; after jobs as a Lockheed factory hand, a radio continuity writer and a Hopalong Cassidy stunt player. 'Jimmy Stewart had won an Oscar around that time and his wife said to my wife, 'Look, if that tall lean drink of water can do it, your man can do it.' So I took a shot.' The Mitchum I was with took the occasional shot too. When Martini number three was handed to him, he returned the stickful of olives to the waitress with the single censorious word 'Displacement]' Mitchum in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s was one of the wonders of the movie business. He was not the only star who auto-piloted through roles; think of Alan Ladd, Glenn Ford or Dana Andrews. But he was the only one who was never dull doing it. He brought a lordly contempt to bad films and a slight but electrifying increase in voltage to good films. After crossing swords with Tinseltown's Third Reich - including the quarrelsome Otto Preminger ('The crew were gonna drop a lamp on him') and the Macao-directing Josef Von Sternberg ('He couldn't get the script right, I'd keep meeting myself coming through a door') - he secured the role of his career in 1955 in Charles Laughton's sole directing foray The Night Of The Hunter. Grown cinephiles are known to weep with joy at this film. Its spooky tale of a wandering preacher (Mitchum) and the two children he terrorises is like Hansel And Gretel crossed with L'Atalante. Mention the film to Mitchum and a lightbulb goes on behind his eyes. 'Charles was beautiful. I remember he called me up and said (purse-mouthed Laughton impersonation) 'I've got a story here, Bob, about an unremitting shit.' I said, 'Present.' And he said, 'Well, I'm not really suited to this, you know. I'm earning my living now reading the Bible.' 'Anyway, he did the film and he wrote the script, even though James Agee is credited. Agee just wrote the treatment, all eighteen pounds of it. Charles came to my house and he'd work on the screenplay at the same time as he was staging The Caine Mutiny up in Santa Barbara. And he was marvellous. Marvellous with the camera too. He would invent these Toytown effects, like the frog and the owl in the foreground of scenes. And in that shot through the barn window, when you see the preacher ride across the horizon, he did that on a soundstage, you know] With a midget actor on a miniature pony to evoke the distance.' The Night Of The Hunter was Mitchum's best role and best film. He drew from experience - 'I knew those guys, those itinerant psalm-shouters from the South' - and he drew on his own resources of blackhearted Irish charm. Indeed the jaded, droop-lidded Mitchum we often see on screen, when a movie's pay packet is too large and its acting challenge too small, has no resemblance to the Mitchum I was meeting now. Inside the star is a raconteur; inside that, a mimic. He gave me Marilyn Monroe mouthing superstitious mantras before taking a dash into a torrent on Preminger's River Of No Return. (She broke her leg. Mitchum had warned her.) He gave me Michael Winner squealing with terror and fainting on the set of The Big Sleep when Mitchum gave the British director a 'friendly' bear hug. And he gave me David Lean, exasperated and Etonian as the Irish weather wrecked his shooting schedule on Ryan's Daughter. Mitchum is no respecter of reputations and that includes his own. 'Any time a director ran out of script,' he says when I ask him to define what Hollywood saw as the Mitchum star quality, 'he'd cut to me having the bejeesus beaten out of me.' No actor has fallen off horses, dragged himself through swamps or been pummelled by passing pugilists as much as he. 'It's because for years I had no stunt double. So when the studio wanted an actor to throw around they knew I'd been through it all before.' No wonder his favourite role is the bedridden Admiral in The Battle Of Midway; the third part offered to him in that movie after he turned down two other Admirals who would have been required to stand or walk. Mitchum could also turn down roles for less frivolous reasons. He rejected two films that later gained Oscars for his replacements. The script of In The Heat Of The Night, in which Rod Steiger would triumph, had a man being thrown out of a bar in the first scene. 'They don't have bars in that state] It was a dry state. If they got that wrong, what else would they get wrong?' And he handed the role of Patton to George C. Scott even though - or because  -Mitchum passionately admires the Second World War General. 'We'd be shooting in Spain and all that artillery would be paraded and there'd be a wide screen and Patton's character would just disappear. So I recommended an actor who I thought would fight for it. And he did.' Mitchum himself could fight when he wanted to and for some surprising characters. He fought to inject real menace into the first Cape Fear. Playing a darker variant on his Night Of The Hunter hoodlum, he gave the best performance of his middle years: sombre, insolent, witty, with reserves of frightening dementia kept till the final showdown. In the new Cape Fear Mitchum gives the best performance of his late years. In a tiny role he wins the movie's two biggest laughs: for his mordant delivery of lines I shan't spoil your fun by revealing. Surrounded by younger actors going ape in a plot that encourages them to - Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange - Mitchum stands back and shows us why he has been a star for 50 years. He is above it all. He twinkles placidly in a firmament where, if you have the right personality wattage, doing nothing can be as luminous as doing everything. Would he change anything in his career? 'No. I sometimes think I should have kowtowed to the system more . . . but no, I couldn't have done it. You have to smile at all those prize nights, go to all those film festivals to get some statue they've knocked up. And you know what they're thinking: 'Let's invent an award and present it to some freak.' I was in Italy once and they wanted to give me a Rudolph Valentino award. I thought about it. A few days of pasta and red wine. But then I thought no, let them give it to some other guy. So they gave it to Steve McQueen who happened to be passing through town.' And what about a second life behind the camera? Would he have liked, like his hero Laughton, to direct? This gets an interested pause but the same eventual answer. 'Well, you gotta get there in the morning before everybody else. You gotta spend all night doing your homework. You gotta see the rushes. Uh-uh' (shake of the head). 'No-o' (reasonable man's sigh). 'Just say the lines, kiss the girl, take the money, and run.'</p>

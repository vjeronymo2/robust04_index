			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm as auction goes well US bond prices were flat-to-firmer across the maturity range yesterday after a moderately successful auction of 10-year notes - the second leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding round. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 84 1/2 , yielding 7.569 per cent. The two-year note was firmer, up 3/32 at 99 29/32 , to yield 6.158 per cent. After Tuesday's disappointing three-year note auction, there were worries yesterday that the sale of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes would also attract weak demand from retail investors. This kept most investors on the sidelines in the morning, leaving prices moderately lower in early trading. The auction subsequently passed off without a hitch, with retail demand proving stronger than expected. The 10-year notes were sold at an average yield of 7.33 per cent. But the market remained subdued, with dealers and investors apprehensive about the July inflation data, due for release today and tomorrow. European government bond markets experienced one of their quietest days this year as the summer holiday season got into full swing. Dealers said yesterday's testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan before a House Commerce subcommittee had no impact but results of the US auction of 10-year paper later in the day could give markets a fresh direction. Some analysts expect next week's heavy programme of supply in Germany, France and Italy to put renewed downward pressure on those markets, as dealers bidding for the paper hedge themselves by taking out short positions in the futures market. The only market to offer any signs of life was Spain, where investors gave a favourable reception to the latest auction of one-year treasury bills. This means the Bank of Spain has now raised three-quarters of this month's funding requirement. Yields on the Treasury bills fell to 8.08 per cent from 8.18 per cent while at the longer end of the curve, yields on 10-year bonds eased three basis points to 10.39 per cent. The September bond future rose to 91.07 from 90.58. The weakness in the lira and the continual political concerns kept the Italian market under pressure, which caused the spread between Italian and German 10-year bonds to widen to more than 400 basis points from around 380 basis points a week ago. The German market was little changed with yields on 10-year bunds staying at 7 per cent. Dealers detected some switching out of Dutch bonds into bunds, reflecting investor uncertainty over the delay in forming a government. This caused the spread between 10-year Dutch bonds and bunds to widen to five basis points from three basis points. UK gilts were unmoved by the publication of minutes of a meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Bank of England governor, Mr Eddie George. On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose 13/32 to 102 1/4 in thin volume.</p>

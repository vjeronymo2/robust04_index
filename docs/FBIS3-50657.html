			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, Dec 28 (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today renewed his attacks against the UCR [Radical Civic Union]  and some newspapers. He said the Radicals "are totally wrong and  their arguments are groundless" and charged that the press was  "indulging in press terrorism."    This was the president's answer to a document on regional  economies disseminated by the UCR and information published by a  Buenos Aires newspaper saying that the government was seeking to  promote Navy officers accused of torturing French nuns.    The UCR "is again swallowed by a sea of contradictions," the  president said, because at the same time UCR politicians were  releasing the document criticizing the government, economists,  including Ricardo Lopez Murphy, were asking it to increase the  depth of the adjustment program and speed up things.    The UCR document says the economic plan "has increased the  gap" separating the poor and "the economic model implies an  irresponsible trust in the spontaneous market capacity to  correct inequalities."    The head of state said the provinces "are not at a boiling  point" even though some people "would like to create that type  of climate." The president stressed that the provinces "will  continue to receive the funds due them according to the  co-participation program, without ruling out some type of  additional help in emergencies."    Menem made these statements during an impromptu news  conference at the Olivos residence today.    In an interview that appeared in today's issue of a Buenos  Aires paper, Menem says the election of constituent delegates  would take place, in principle, on 20 March. He added that his  ideal running mate for 1995 would be Buenos Aires Governor  Eduardo Duhalde.    The president said he favors a "limitless reelection" of  presidents. He recognized, however, that the projected  constitutional reform will only allow him to continue as  president until 1999, that is, if he is reelected next year.    Menem expressed the wish, however, to run again in 2003.    "I am not Matusalen, but I can wait four years and then run  again. I will be 73 by then and I will still be fit" to do it,  Menem said. The president said he was sure he would be able to  extend his mandate until 1999.    Menem minimized the importance of the chief of cabinet, a  position that will be created with the reform, by saying that it  "will not mean any reduction of presidential powers."    Menem did not mention any possible candidates to occupy that  position but admitted that he already had a candidate "in mind."  [preceding two words in Latin]    Menem said there are "indications" of the presence "of  leftist militants such as MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]  followers among the agitators that provoked the disorders in the  northern part of the country." The president was referring to  the incidents in Santiago del Estero.    The president said he favors increasing the number of  ministries from eight to 12 when the new Constitution takes  effect. Menem said the new portfolios might be Science and  Technology, Environment, and Production.    Regarding the Senate discussion on the constitutional  reform bill, Menem warned that if the bill is approved without  reducing a senator's mandate to four years "it will have to  return to the Chamber of Deputies for a revision." Menem  admitted, however, that the issue "is no longer in the hands" of  those who signed the pact: Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin.    "We will try to make it stick, but we cannot do anything  else. A pact between political parties is important but it  cannot go over congressional authority," the president  emphasized.    Menem dismissed "the possible danger" of constituent  delegates going beyond what was agreed with Alfonsin "as long as  the essence of the pact is respected."    Regarding the crisis in the provinces, Menem reiterated the  need for "a rational transformation," stressing that the private  sector "will be able to absorb dismissed public servants even in  the poorest districts such as Santiago del Estero or La Rioja."    In his renewed attack against the press, Menem said  journalists "indulge in press terrorism" when commenting on a  report published by the Buenos Aires newspaper PAGINA 12. The  newspaper article said the government intended to promote Navy  officers accused of having tortured French nuns.    "There are no chances of a promotion," the president said  after characterizing the article as "a coarse lie" and an  "aberration."    The new presidential attack against the press included the  media that reported the government intended to build a  "ring-side" [preceding word in English] over the destroyed  Olivos mausoleum where the remains of Juan Peron and Eva Duarte  used to lie.    "You can only doubt a journalist's honesty when he lies so  shamelessly," Menem said, admitting that the issue "really upset  him."    "On top of all that, CRONICA on 27 December used the  information to build up a petty scandal based on something that  is not true," the president stressed.    Menem said the report saying that he and UCR President Raul  Alfonsin would campaign for the reform was "inaccurate."    The president categorically denied that groups of activists  linked to Julio Cesar Araoz, former health and social action  minister, had participated in the incidents in Santiago del  Estero.    Menem accused legislators of acting "from behind curtains  and  at midnight" for including a 120 million peso increase for  national universities that previously had been vetoed by the  government in the 1994 budget.    "They did not take into account how that spending would be  defrayed. They acted without thinking," Menem said, adding that  the Federal Law on Education already includes a 20 percent  increase for education in 1994.    The president also criticized the approval of the 120  million  pesos as "a strictly political and demagogic maneuver."    "Of course when we veto this type of legislation we are the  bad guys and those who arbitrarily or carelessly included it in  the budget end up receiving laurels and a crown," the president  complained.    Menem said public employees who lose their jobs as a result  of "transformations" in the public administration "will collect  compensation and will be able to seek a more profitable job in  the private sector."    "As long as we continue insisting on reducing production  costs, what is called the Argentine cost, the possibilities for  the establishment of new companies in Argentina, which is  called, within quotes, poor, will increase," the president  stressed.    Menem concluded by reiterating that he plans to meet with  the  governors, possibly at the Chapadmalal summer residence,  "between 18 and 20 January."</p>

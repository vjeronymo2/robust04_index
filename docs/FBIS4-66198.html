			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Special Correspondent Xiao Siru (5135 0934 1172) </F> and Staff Reporter Liao Guoliang (1394 0748 5328): "Difficulties  and Countermeasures In the Macroscopic Basic Mix: An Interview  With Zheng Yuliang"]    [Text] Zheng Yuliang was born in 1934 in Shanghai.  After graduating from China People's University in the History  Department's undergraduate course in July, 1961, he studied  Western European economics at Fudan University, Shanghai, and  for eight years studied Western economics at Fudan University's  Capitalist Countries Economic Research Institute. In October,  1985, he was appointed as CP General Secretary in Xuzhou City,  and in March, 1990, he was appointed Mayor of Shenzhen. In  October, 1992, he was appointed Deputy Governor of Jiangxi  Province. He now holds concurrent appointments as Professor at  Fudan University and the China People's University.    Question: In a market economy, self-operated  enterprises and consumers making consumption choices of their  own free should be the microscopic foundation of the entire  market economy. With the cancellation of commodity supply  licenses and development of a consumption area, consumers'  sovereign rights are being fulfilled. Therefore, the most  prominent feature of China's microscopic structural foundation  is this point of self operation and vitality problems for  enterprises. What do you think are the difficulties and problems?    Zheng: The greatest success of the past more than  a decade's reform has been the breakthrough in the situation of  state-owned enterprises dominating the economy, enlivening the  nonstate-owned economy (especially the privately owned economy)  encouraging it to survive through market competition and to  develop. Contrasted to this, the achievements of reform in the  key area of state-owned enterprises have turned out to be not  very satisfying. For many years, cities which centered their  reform efforts on state-owned enterprises tried out many reform  plans: these range from invigorating self-operational rights,  implementing multiple pattern responsibility systems, converting  profits to taxes, reorganizing the external environment for  industries by making price reform breakthroughs, down to the  present contracting system and joint stock system experiments.  Although the production and operations system in state-owned  enterprises has improved, the problems of sluggishness, low  efficiency, lack of ability to self-adjust and a slow pace in  adjusting the mix are still very prominent.    The key to integrating the socialist system with the market  economy lies in finding a way to fulfill state-owned property  rights under the market economy. And this is also the  difficulty. In a market economy situation, some enterprises  become bankrupt, but more enterprises are started and develop.  becoming the motive power for adjustment of the industrial mix  and technological progress. The state-owned enterprises we have  now are hard to match up with this sort of adjustment procedure.  This is most prominent in the two features of administrative  restrictions brought on by social restrictions and the twisting  of government's role because of enterprise adjustment under the  old pattern of distribution.    In the first place, the state-owned enterprises that we have  built up over several decades are at the same time a society.  Employment of family members, education of the children,  housing, providing for the elderly, and cultural life all became  a part of enterprise management. This is determined once an  enterprise is formed, it must develop steadily, it is difficult  to bankrupt and clear accounts. Although we have come a long way  in invigorating enterprises since implementing reform and  opening, a tendency to be short of revenue has meant that  matters which should have been handled by society have continued  to be left to enterprises. Financial pressures and social  burdens on enterprises grew constantly, and certainly placed  obstructions in the path of reform moving on to free  competition. Therefore, 1) enterprises bear heavy burdens with  low ability to self-develop, and with old facilities and  technology. They lack the ability to adjust themselves to suit  market competition, referred to as being "old, weak, and  frequently ill." If this fact is not taken into account, it  will be hard for any kind of measures for converting the  operational system to work. 2) Employment: since we chiefly  consider it from the standpoint of social stability, pursuing  the employment rate becomes our objective, and we often put two  and even more people in a single job; staff and their family  members have a relationship with enterprises which cannot be  severed. 3) State-owned enterprises have very little capital of  their own: their production and operations are dependent for the  most part on loans from state-owned banks, and for some  enterprises which lack sufficient capital to repay their loans,  banks are their biggest creditors, so that bankruptcy means  bankruptcy for the bank too. Although the laws governing  dismissal of staff and enterprise bankruptcy are clearly  defined, they are very hard to implement.    A second point is that it is currently impossible to sever  the relationship that exists between government and the  development of enterprises: first, because the government relies  on enterprises to resolve social problems, so that when losses  by enterprises harm the staff's social lives, they will  definitely turn to the government to resolve their difficulties.  Second, the government still has the right to review and approve  projects, and can influence bank loans. Three, the government  holds allocation rights for energy, transportation, and  important good resources. Fourth is the subjective relationship  that exists between operators named by the government and  government at higher and lower levels, a situation where  organizational reform lags behind the conversion of governmental  functions. This is a long-standing problem with state-owned  enterprises, and it has to a considerable degree restricted  enterprise reform and the pace of converting the operational  system.    Question: In these circumstances, how do we speed  up converting the operational system in state-owned enterprises?    Zheng: The key to speeding up converting the  operating system of state-owned enterprises lies in fulfilling  state-owned property rights. The way to do this is to reorganize  state-owned enterprises into a modern enterprise system. All the  regulations and laws of market economics are based on clear  property relationships; strictly speaking, they are all property  laws and regulations. The separation of ownership rights and  operating rights should be a separation which is founded on  clear property rights and under the condition of property  restriction. The state-owned enterprises should have not only  the operators' initiative power system, but also a system of  balances; this is not just to invigorate the enterprises, but  also to maintain the state's restrictive function as the owners'  representative. So, it can be implemented on two levels of  separation: separation between final ownership rights and legal  person ownership rights; and separation between legal person  ownership rights and enterprise operational rights.    The ultimate owners will become enterprise shareholders,  owning stocks, and the enterprises will have legal person rights  as independent legal bodies undertaking civil responsibility. In  this level of separation, enterprise boards of directors act as  legal owners responsible for ultimate ownership, having the  occupational rights to enterprise property, rights of use and  handling, while the ultimate owners have the right of ultimate  profit income. The ultimate owners only undertake responsibility  for debts of enterprises limited by the amount of pledged assets  in that enterprise; based on the shareholders trust in them, the  board of directors will have full powers to run enterprise  property and undertake operational responsibility. This forms  the property organizational system in modern enterprises. The  second level of separation of two rights is appropriate  separation of operating rights and ownership rights. This means  that the enterprise management is nominated by the board of  directors, and production, supply and sales, personnel,  property, and goods are managed in detail by managerial staff,  and they are responsible for implementing operating policy,  having enterprise operating rights. The ultimate ownership  restricts operations and management in enterprises by means of  the modern enterprise organizational form, letting them endeavor  to make maximum profits and in the end continue to both the  state's and the individual's property.    In China, enterprises are going in the direction of system  reform which will establish a new type of enterprise system in  which the modern joint stock corporation is the substance,  realizing a separation of property rights under value formation  and material object formation and unification of socialization  of property and clarification of enterprises' property rights.  This direction for reform of the enterprise system in China  shows that reorganization of joint stock enterprises should  become a major content of enterprise reform.    In reorganizing state-owned enterprises into a modern  corporate system, the key is to accomplish the separation of  ownership rights and legal person ownership rights restricted by  the state-owned property rights responsibility. In corporations,  the state acts as the stockholder or one of the stockholders,  entrusting the directors to act as its agent, participating or  forming the board of directors, while the board of directors  independently assumes civil responsibility for enterprises'  property. Having the right of property handling, they can pay  off debts with their property and make up losses. As the  ultimate owner, the state assumes only limited responsibility  for enterprises, which completely removes the enterprises from  the state's "big iron pot." The state reviews the performance of  the board of directors and makes decisions on its members'  appointment and dismissal on the basis of value preservation and  value added to assets authorized by the state and profits gained  from the property; the board of directors makes the decisions  concerning the selection and appointment of managers. A system  of mutual encouragement and balance among owners, operators, and  workers will be established inside enterprises. To form an  association between property rights and responsibilities,  actually pushing the state-owned enterprises to market will not  only protect the state-owned property rights, and restrict  enterprises' short term activities, it will also not directly  interfere with enterprises, completely implementing their  self=operating rights.    Question: What are the difficulties involved in  converting the state-owned enterprises in accordance with the  modern enterprise system?    Zheng: Besides having to resolve the social  restrictions on enterprises, there are many complex problems  involved with running the enterprise which must be resolved. The  first of these is, how to form the state-owned assets property  rights representatives (members of the board of directors)? The  problem here lies in the operational system which produces  cadres: can the current personnel system guarantee the selection  of talent who are not only responsible to the state but also  good at operations in leadership positions in enterprises? The  second is, how do we delineate quantity and quality of property  rights? Meanwhile we must reject nonmanagement factors concerned  with enterprises' achievements. There is a question here  concerned with perfecting the information and evaluation system  and making it fair. The third is, how to establish relationships  of responsibility, rights and profits between members of the  board of directors and losses or profits of state property  rights: by what means do state property rights management  departments restrict them? These three questions are unavoidable  for us in the joint stock system trial, and must be resolved  after thorough study. From this, we can see that reform of the  state-owned enterprises is actually involved with reform in  every aspect of the political and economic systems, and relies  on perfecting the market system.    Question: What points should we work on in order  to speed up converting to the new enterprise system?    Zheng: The reform practice of making the state  ownership system match up with the market economy both overseas  and in some parts of China has provided us with experience for  probing into the problem of accomplishing state-owned property  rights in the market economy.    1) Continue to encourage development of the nonstate-owned  economy (including the nonpublicly owned economy), thereby  putting the state-owned enterprises increasingly into the  environment of nonstate-owned economic market competition. The  leading role of the public economy cannot be judged simply on  the bases of its proportion and quantity; even more important  are territory, quality, its status and role in the joint stock  economy.    2) We should first of all do a good job of perfecting  state-owned asset increments. One, have state projects raise  capital by floating shares, which means that the state pledges a  part of its assets and other economic component parts to form  joint stock enterprises under the management of joint stock  system regulations; two, manage newly invested production lines,  workshops, and branch plants of enterprises through the new  operating system implement a contractual system and hiring  system for staff and cadres, protecting socialization. Three,  encourage joint mutual stock among enterprises to build up new  enterprises or workshops, under joint stock system management.    3) On the basis of delineating property rights for large and  medium scale state-owned enterprises, through the gradual  distribution of property rights, gradually change over to  multi-patterned enterprise structures with the state owning  property rights, the state holding shares, and the state  participating in stocks. In the present situation where the  state has a bigger portion of the capital for running  enterprises, we can go the way of dispersing it into the  different main parts of property rights profits; for example,  exchanging some of a creditor's rights for stock equity,  breaking down the state capital enterprise into joint stock  enterprises in which shares are held by the central government,  localities, commercial banks, industrial departments or  enterprises, with the different profit groups assigned members  of the board of directors by the amount of shares they have, and  the enterprises managed by joint stock system regulations.    4) As for small scale state-owned enterprises, it would be  inappropriate to adopt the enterprise system as their property  organization system. They can adopt such forms as "state  ownership, run by local people" or sell the state-owned property  rights, transferring the operating system. Lease the legal  person ownership to local people (natural persons or operational  bodies of a joint stock cooperative system) and let them run the  enterprises. Some small scale state-owned enterprises which are  unsuitable for state joint stock system management can go the  way of auction, selling and transferring property rights with a  charge as one sort of direct and effective means. We should  realize that auctioning state-owned enterprises is not a  reduction, and still less a loss, but rather a transformation of  state-owned assets from material objects to a form of value;  indeed, it is a kind of structural adjustment, a means of  perfecting the distribution of assets.    5) For basic industries and public utilities which must be  jointly managed and operated by the state, such as posts and  telecommunications, railways, water conservancy, etc., and for  large scale resource industries, the key lies in improving their  operating model. The state controls management staff by clearly  defined regulations concerning responsibilities, rights and  profits, appointing and dismissing managers according to their  operational performance, while management of internal personnel  and property must suit the market, to form a competitive  initiative system.</p>

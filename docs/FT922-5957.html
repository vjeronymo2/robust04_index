			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / New limit boosts unit trust Peps A CHANGE in Personal Equity Plan rules has led to a record inflow into unit trust Peps. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that Pounds 6,000 could be invested in a unit or investment trust Pep from the start of the 1992-93 tax year. The previous limit - except for investment trust new issues - had been Pounds 3,000. Income and capital gains from Peps are tax-free. About 230,000 unit trust Peps were opened between April 6, the start of the tax year, and May 1, according to the Unit Trust Association. The Pounds 151m invested in April was a record monthly figure, pushing the total invested in unit trust Peps to Pounds 2.3bn, spread across 996,000 accounts. That is encouraging news for the unit trust industry, which has suffered from poor performance in recent years. Over the past five years, a building society high-interest account has produced a better performance than the average unit trust. Mr Gavin Grant, director of public affairs at the Unit Trust Association, said: 'These figures prove we were right to argue there was a pent-up demand for Peps and that the government was right to raise the limit for unit trusts to Pounds 6,000.'</p>

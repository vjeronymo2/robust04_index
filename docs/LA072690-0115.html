			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWP'S RESPONSE TO LEAK LEAVES RESIDENTS STEAMING  </P> <P> When Stephen Nahmias and his neighbors saw all that clear, cool water gushing  down the street past their thirsty brown lawns, they practically salivated.  "I'd be really happy if we could get that water up on my lawn," Nahmias joked.  </P> <P> But when the leaking water line in the middle of the 1000 block of South  Hayworth Avenue continued spewing a river the third day after residents  reported the problem to the Department of Water and Power, the covetous looks  turned to scowls.  </P> <P> "This is an appalling situation," said Nahmias, a stockbroker who owns one of  the neat Spanish-style duplexes that flank the Mid-Wilshire area street. The  waste was especially egregious, he said, given drought-ridden Southern  California's ongoing battle for water conservation.  </P> <P> Nahmias and his conservation-minded neighbors have stopped watering lawns,  hired plumbers to patch leaky pipes and reduced the water flow in showers and  toilets to save water, he said.  </P> <P> "It rubs a really raw nerve at this point," he said of the thousands of gallons  of water he and his neighbors watched flow down storm drains.  </P> <P> But to the DWP, it was just one of those things.  </P> <P> According to DWP officials, the work crew that checked the leak Monday evening  -- and did not return until Wednesday afternoon -- correctly assessed it as  less than a top priority. There were at least half a dozen more substantial  water leaks each day this week, including several broken mains, in the  department's western district alone, said Larry McReynolds, the engineer in  charge of DWP's water operating division.  </P> <P> "We're going to have a number of small leaks that we won't be able to respond  to quickly enough to satisfy everyone," said McReynolds, adding that the Los  Angeles system is plagued by deteriorating water lines and meters built in  pre-World War II years. Despite the department's programs to replace tens of  thousands of outdated meters and more than a hundred miles of water line each  year, the system still suffers from a high rate of leaks each summer and winter  because of the temperature extremes, he said.  </P> <P> Water officials estimate that the DWP loses 8% of its water, or 1.8 billion  gallons annually, through leaks, evaporation and faulty meters.  </P> <P> Although the department's efforts have reduced the number of leaks in the  system over the years, McReynolds said that growing public awareness of the  drought and the need for water conservation have nearly doubled the number of  calls from residents reporting leaks and other water waste to DWP.  </P> <P> The increased awareness has led to increased frustration, as well, said  McReynolds. "The public expects us to correct problems overnight -- especially  since we're the ones urging conservation," he said. But that's not always  possible, he said, noting that high-priority leaks usually take from one to two  days to repair. Lower-priority leaks, such as the one on Hayworth Avenue, can  take even longer.  </P> <P> But because of the amount of work involved in repairing even low-priority  leaks, crews -- like the one sent to Hayworth Avenue -- sometimes leave without  even starting the repair work.  </P> <P> While personnel have been reassigned from other duties to increase the number  of leak-repair crews in operation during the busy summer months, McReynolds  said that it would not be cost effective to hire additional workers to deal  with the leaks. The water loss is minor, he added, compared to the district's  total water consumption.  </P> <P> Try telling that to Stephen Nahmias and his neighbors. On Wednesday -- two days  after they reported the leak on their street to DWP -- Nahmias' question  remained: "Where the hell are they and why isn't anybody at least patching the  leak to stop the water flow?"  </P> <P> DWP work crews sealed the leaking water line later that afternoon, after a  Times reporter called to inquire about the matter. McReynolds said the repair  had been scheduled for that afternoon since Monday.  </P></p>

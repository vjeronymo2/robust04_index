			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / People: Oftel old hand set to retire Bill Wigglesworth, deputy director general of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is taking early retirement from the end of March. Wigglesworth, 56, a popular figure in the industry, is the last survivor at the top of Oftel from its launch in 1984. He joined the fledgling watchdog, the first of the utility regulators and the model for the rest, from the Department of Trade and Industry. When Sir Bryan Carsberg, the first director general, departed in mid-1992, Wigglesworth took the helm for nearly a year before the arrival of Don Cruickshank, the present regulator. Wigglesworth is likely to be succeeded by civil servant, though his job will not be advertised publicly in the first instance: Cruickshank, himself recruited from the private sector, is keen to have a deputy familiar with Whitehall. Oftel has also appointed two new directors. Christine Farnish, Cambridge council's assistant chief executive, is to be director of consumer affairs. A graduate of Manchester University and University College London, Farnish started her career as Senior Research Officer at the Countryside Commission. Sarah Chambers moves from the DTI to become director of licensing. An Oxford graduate, she joined the DTI in 1979. For the last 18 months she has been part of the team reviewing the future structure and ownership of the Post Office. Cruickshank said the new appointments would help Oftel 'cope with the increasing number of new operators and focus on getting customers what they want.'</p>

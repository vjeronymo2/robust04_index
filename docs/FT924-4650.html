			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Bonds: UK announces launch of Dollars 3bn, 10-year Eurobond THE UK government last night announced the launch of a Dollars 3bn, 10-year Eurobond, the largest international dollar bond issue and the final leg of the government's Ecu10bn foreign currency borrowing programme which was announced on September 3. The proceeds will go towards the foreign exchange reserves and will be used to repay short-term indebtedness incurred at the time of the sterling crisis. The bond is expected to be priced to give a yield of between 22-25 basis points over the comparable 10-year US Treasury bond, which the Bank of England said represents 'very fine pricing'. S. G. Warburg Securities, one of the lead managers, said: 'The pricing reflects a balance between the large size of the deal on the one hand and the triple A credit (of the borrower) on the other.' Credit Suisse First Boston and S. G. Warburg Securities are joint lead managers and 28 other banks have been invited to join the syndicate. Book-building started in the Far East last night and will continue today. Pricing is expected to take place today or tomorrow. The government's foreign currency borrowing consists of an Ecu5bn revolving credit facility, a DM5bn five-year bond issue, and the Dollars 3bn 10-year bond issue. The Bank said the government was not contemplating any further issues under the programme although if it is able to refinance the existing bank credit facility at more favourable terms it will probably do so. Credit Local de France yesterday became the second borrower to raise funds using the ratchet collared floater, a new species introduced to the bond market by Morgan Stanley International last week. The bank said it launched the Dollars 100m five-year issue on the strength of demand for the first, a Dollars 150m five-year issue for Rabobank Nederland last Friday. Morgan describes the structure as an enhanced floating rate note, the interest rate on which can never go down. The thinking is to take advantage of interest in FRNs from investors who are positive about the dollar, but concerned that US interest rates, while rising, could fall in the medium term. Morgan argues it has taken away the downside risk, and the only limit to the upside is that interest rate rises are limited to a maximum of 25 basis points every three months. Morgan says this innovation has the potential to be as large as the collared floater market, but critics say the structure is too complicated and most investors are sceptical of missing any rise in interest rates. Meanwhile, the Republic of Turkey launched a Y70bn samurai bond in Japan, as part of its strategy to improve the currency composition and maturity structure of its debt, to improve the balance between syndicated loans and fixed-rate paper and to increase the investor base for Turkish risk. The bond, led by Yamaichi Securities, is divided into two tranches, one with a four-year maturity and the other six years. The platform for this latest issue was the triple-B rating gained from Standard and Poor's in May. Turkey's debt was Dollars 50.9bn at end-June. Of the total, 37 per cent is at variable interest rates and the rest is fixed. Bankers say the pricing on this issue is expected to be tight, making it difficult to sell to institutional investors. But the success of Y50bn five and seven-year bonds in June and September respectively suggests the appetite among Japanese retail investors is strong. Mr Masayaki Kanayama of Sanwa Bank in London said the market expects institutional and retail investors to take up the four-year tranche and retail investors to buy the six-year tranche. The republic has already issued Dollars 899m worth of bonds in 1992, compared with syndicated loans of Dollars 349m. In May, Paribas was lead manager on Turkey's Ecu bond, a Dollars 185m-equivalent three-year exercise. Commerzbank arranged a DM400m seven-year bond issue in July. Also in July, the Treasury arranged a Dollars 250m Yankee bond issue. When the samurai issues are included, Turkey is projected to be a net borrower on the international capital markets in 1992, despite its original target to be a net repayer. Debt repayments are estimated at Dollars 1.9bn in the second half of this year. Public debt repayments are officially projected to peak in 1995 at Dollars 4.6bn. Due to these new borrowings and the adverse exchange rate movements which are estimated to have added Dollars 2.3bn to the debt stock in the first half of 1992, total debt is projected to reach between Dollars 53bn by the year end. This is a net increase of more than Dollars 4bn over 1991.</p>

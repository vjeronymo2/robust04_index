			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour promises a fair wind for Ulster talks - Kevin McNamara and unification ATTEMPTS BY the Conservatives to resume round-table talks on Northern Ireland's political future would be given 'a fair wind' under an incoming Labour government - but the process would not be allowed to stagnate, Mr Kevin McNamara, the party's spokesman on the province, has said. Seeking to allay Unionist MPs' fears at the prospect of a Labour government, Mr McNamara says he will continue trying to start negotiations under the formula envisaged by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. When Mr Brooke offered his resignation this week for singing on an Irish television show just hours after an IRA bomb attack, Mr McNamara was the first to offer his support. 'It never was, nor should it be regarded as, a resignation matter,' he told the Commons. Yet Labour's official policy - backed enthusiastically by Mr McNamara, 57, a white-haired, academic-looking Roman Catholic - is for Irish unification by consent. He insists that nobody would be coerced into an extended Irish state - practically ruling out unification while the Unionist majority remains in Northern Ireland. But the aspiration is enough for Unionist leaders to insist that they cannot give an undertaking to continue formal negotiations if Labour wins the election. It is the stumbling-block Mr Brooke has run up against. Mr McNamara is adamant, too, that Unionists should not be allowed to set the agenda. 'We will seek to give a fair wind but the thing cannot be allowed to stagnate,' he says. Governments have a responsibility to govern. It is not automatic that Mr McNamara, spokesman since 1987, would step into Mr Brooke's shoes were Labour to win. His support for unification marks a significant break with policy when Labour was last in power. Mr Roy (now Lord) Mason, the last Labour Northern Ireland secretary, was highly regarded by some Unionists - more so than some of his Tory successors - for his tough security policy. If a Labour government had a small majority, Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, might want to avoid alienating the Unionists. Mr McNamara also is not an elected member of the shadow cabinet. Others might have to be rewarded before him. Mr McNamara believes strongly in finding cross-community agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed, saying it would be a 'strange form of neo-colonialism' if Labour insisted on a particular solution. Like Mr Brooke, he would want talks to look at relations within the province, between north and south Ireland, and between London and Dublin. If talks failed, he would want to build cross-border co-operation under the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - to which Unionists angrily object because, they say, it gives the Irish republic a say in the affairs of the north. Mr McNamara says his commitment to eventual unification is real but acknowledges the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to his goal. 'Our aspiration is for a union of peoples,' he says. 'You could unite in a territorial sense tomorrow . . . of course there would be problems, but it could be done. But that would not unite the peoples of Ireland.' Northern Ireland's political leaders looked likely last night to agree to meet on Monday and try to overcome remaining obstacles to formal negotiations on the province's political future - in spite of continued wavering by Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Drug sales growth slows Pharmacy drugs sales recorded either slower growth or declines in every significant European market during the first five months this year compared with the same period in 1993. The only exception was Germany, the region's largest market, where sales staged a small recovery after last year's steep falls. However, sales were still down on 1992 levels. The deceleration has been caused by healthcare reforms throughout Europe, described last week by Mr John Robb, chief executive and chairman of Wellcome, the UK drugs group, as a series of hammer-blows. Sales in Europe's top seven markets fell from Dollars 19.1bn (Pounds 12.3bn) to Dollars 18.2bn, although in local currencies they rose by 2 per cent, according to IMS International, the specialist market research company. The US market expanded by 7 per cent to Dollars 19.67bn, while the Japanese market was static in yen terms but rose in dollars from Dollars 7.7bn to Dollars 8.45bn. The Italian market has been the worst hit in Europe. Year-on-year sales fell 7 per cent from Dollars 3.59bn to Dollars 3.08bn. That compares with Dollars 4.7bn for the same period in 1992. The market is set for further falls this year once the Italian government has decided on additional price cuts, possibly as large as 10 per cent. The French market, which was growing at 6.5 per cent during the first five months last year, was static in local currency terms but fell in dollars from Dollars 5.18bn to Dollars 4.9bn. In the UK, where sales were up 11.6 per cent during the first five months last year, market growth decelerated to 8 per cent in sterling as price cuts and government controls on prescribing began to bite. In dollar terms, sales increased from Dollars 2.017bn to Dollars 2.154bn. In Spain, last year Europe's fastest expanding market at 13.6 per cent, growth fell to 3 per cent. In dollars, the market declined from Dollars 1.817bn to Dollars 1.577bn. Market growth in Belgium fell from 5.8 per cent to 3 per cent, while in the Netherlands sales growth dropped from 13.4 per cent to 4 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       World pharmacy drug purchases January-May 1994 in USDollarsm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             N.

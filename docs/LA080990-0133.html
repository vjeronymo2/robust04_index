			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> ONTRA CAFETERIA DEMOLITION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has approved the demolition of  the controversial Ontra Cafeteria, once a landmark Hollywood building that was  severely damaged by a fire five months ago.  </P> <P> The company that owns the building, Herbert Properties, which had sued the city  to gain permission to tear it down, received the redevelopment agency's  permission to demolish the structure late last week.  </P> <P> The owner plans to build a 90-space surface parking lot on the site, according  to an Aug. 4 memo from Cooke Sunoo, the agency's Hollywood project manager.  </P> <P> In processing a demolition permit for the structure, the agency determined that  the parking lot is a permitted use of the site under current zoning and land  use codes and the Hollywood Community Plan, Sunoo said.  </P> <P> Because of the historic character of the building, the agency has required that  a photographic record of its architectural features be prepared and that  preservation organizations be allowed to identify and remove any unique  architectural features.  </P> <P> The former cafeteria, at 1717-1719 Vine St., was the site of Hollywood's first  post office and was later a favored gathering place for hungry actors and other  film-industry workers.  </P> <P> City Cultural Heritage Commission officials had sought to protect the building  by designating it as a landmark but were rebuffed recently by a judge who said  the city overstepped its authority in trying to do so.  </P> <P> Although Cultural Heritage Commission officials sought city permission to  appeal the judge's ruling, the City Council declined to intervene to save the  building.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME GLAD TO SEE AGRAN GO; SOME HOPE HE'LL GO FAR  </P> <P> The June 5 electoral outcome in Irvine was a bitter disappointment to those of  us who believe in the innovative but realistic kind of government that Larry  Agran brought to this city.  </P> <P> Mayor Agran demonstrated that government, the business community and  grass-roots citizens can work effectively together to create a dynamic,  productive and compassionate community.  </P> <P> His leadership empowered us to envision Irvine as it might be and to join with  our neighbors in working for a quality of life determined by citizen power  rather than by corporate convenience.  </P> <P> Regardless of the electoral outcome, however, the progressive community that  has supported Larry Agran is still alive and thriving in Irvine. I believe that  Irvine citizens do care about transportation, the environment, human rights,  affordable housing, family reunification, open space and world peace.  </P> <P> Larry Agran's foresight, integrity, optimism and compassion at City Hall will  be missed, but the vision that he shared is far from dead.  </P> <P> BETTY GUTHRIE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: LIG's Pounds 175m loss part of a 'sorry' set of numbers Even its new finance director, Mr James Tyrrell, could only describe London International Group's results for the year to March 31, which accompanied its Pounds 115.2m rights issue, as a 'sorry' set of numbers. He said he had prepared the results on a conservative basis, for instance writing off costs previously deferred or capitalised, and switching the Indian joint venture, in which LIG has a 42.7 per cent stake, from a subsidiary to an associate. Group turnover fell 4.7 per cent to Pounds 396.6m (Pounds 416m) as health and personal products sales fell. Operating profits were Pounds 40m lower at Pounds 7.5m before exceptional losses. These included Pounds 30.9m of operating exceptional losses costs of surplus property, and a Pounds 137.4m restructuring charge which includes a Pounds 91.4m loss on the sale of the photo-processing division. Interest charges fell slightly to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m), thanks to lower interest rates and in spite of a more than Pounds 40m rise in debt to Pounds 168.4m. That left the pre-tax loss at Pounds 175.1m (profit Pounds 27.8m). However, after a tax credit of Pounds 200,000 and a minorities credit of Pounds 1.2m, the transfer from reserves was Pounds 173.7m (retained profit Pounds 2.8m). The loss per share was 102.93p (earnings 11.12p). Mr Tyrrell said the sale of ColourCare had been unusually complex. LIG had originally received an attractive offer from an American group but the interests of the small number of large players in the industry had prevented this succeeding. The sale to the MBO does not cover the 257 mini-labs in Boots stores, but LIG was close to selling these to two parties, Mr Tyrrell said. In the latest financial year ColourCare lost Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 3.2m) before exceptional costs and interest. The health and personal products division, including condoms, surgical gloves, household and industrial gloves and toiletries, suffered a drop in pre-exceptional operating profits from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 20.7m. This was partly due to a change to a smoother pattern of promotions, but also reflected problems in Italy, cost increases exceeding price rises, and a lack of one-off gains in the previous year. The deficit on the profit and loss account hit the balance sheet, cutting net assets from Pounds 121.5m to a deficit of Pounds 10.7m, after crediting reserves with Pounds 47.8m of goodwill previously written off. Mr Tyrrell said that after the rights issue, debt would fall immediately to Pounds 53.2m, 50.9 per cent of the enhanced shareholders funds. However, cash costs of the restructuring would increase debt once more to an indicated Pounds 82.1m, giving gearing of 78.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, President Lech Walesa appointed Henryk  Goryszewski to the posts of secretary of state and head of the  National Security Bureau [BBN]. Earlier, he accepted the  resignation of Jerzy Milewski, who has, however, retained his  post as deputy defense minister.    Henryk Goryszewski started his political career as a  Christian National Union [ZChN] deputy in the first  democratically elected Sejm. In Hanna Suchocka's government, he  was deputy prime minister as well as ZChN deputy chairman.  After the fall of Suchocka's Cabinet, he left the ZChN  leadership and retired from political life. Henryk Goryszewski  told a reporter from the Polish radio "Signals of the Day" that  he does not intend to introduce radical changes at the BBN:    [Begin Goryszewski recording] I have great respect for the  achievements of the BBN so far, when the bureau was managed by  Minister Milewski. For this reason, it would definitely be  premature to talk about any changes in the way the bureau works.  Of course, like Minister Milewski, I shall be modifying the  ways in which the bureau works, its procedures, when the need  for such modification arises. In a way, this will occur in  response to changing needs.    I have always attempted to be a flexible politician. People  view me as a pragmatist. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Suspected faction leader held ONE OF the men alleged to be at the centre of rivalry between republican gangs in Belfast has been arrested by police, it was reported yesterday. He is among five men being questioned about attacks linked to a feud in the Irish People's Liberation Organisation over drugs and money which has left three men dead. One of the factions bombed the Waterfront Bar at Dunbar Link on Saturday night, but it is not known if the attack was connected with the dispute. About 150 customers, many of them attending a wedding party, managed to escape and nobody was hurt. Three of those in custody were detained in the lower Falls area soon after the pub went up in flames. The other two were held some days ago after a car was stopped and a gun found. According to security sources, one is suspected to be a leading figure in one of the gangs. The power struggle is between the organisation's so-called Belfast brigade and a group led by a man now living in Dublin and on the run from the RUC. Mr Jimmy Brown, an IPLO leader before the split, was one of the three men shot dead when the in-fighting erupted in bloodshed last month. The sides have vowed to wipe each other out.</p>

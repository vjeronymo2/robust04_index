			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Warrants trust launched THE CROWDED unit trust industry is gaining a new family member, with the launch of the first trust to be based on the warrants market. The company behind the launch is Exeter Fund Managers, which already runs unit trusts based on the main classes of investment trust shares. A warrant is simply a piece of paper entitling the holder to buy shares at a certain price. It pays no income and could expire, worthless, if the share price moves in the wrong direction. A warrant to buy shares at 100p would expire valueless if the share price never rose above 80p. Conversely, the same warrant would be very valuable if the share price rose to 200p. Investing in warrants is thus highly risky. But Exeter is reducing this danger by holding about 40 per cent of the initial portfolio in zero coupon shares. These have first claim on the assets of investment trusts and so are relatively less risky (although far from completely risk-free). The manager will also be able to select warrants on overseas trusts, so his fortunes will not be tied to the health of the UK stock market. This trust is not for the cautious or the first-time investor. Warrants will fall more quickly than other investment trust shares in a bear market. The current market capitalisation of all the investment trust warrants is only Pounds 200m and some issues may be relatively illiquid. So this should only be considered by better off investors for the small, 'risk' element of their portfolios. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000; the initial charge is 6 per cent (with a 2 per cent discount till March 20). The annual charge is 1 per cent. Aegon Financial Services is launching the Select Portfolio, a fund of funds based on unit trusts managed by Perpetual. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000, initial charge 5.5 per cent, annual charge 1.5 per cent. During a launch period, investments of under Pounds 10,000 attract a bonus of 0.5 per cent and those above Pounds 10,000, 1 per cent.</p>

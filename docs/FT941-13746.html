			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / China becomes joint ventures hub China and Russia have emerged as centres of international takeover activity with overseas companies investing more than Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.8bn) there in the past 12 months, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The firm's annual survey of global takeover activity, published today, shows that investors in China took part in partial acquisitions and joint ventures worth Dollars 15.2bn, up from Dollars 5.2bn in 1992. The value of companies purchased outright rose from Dollars 89m to Dollars 287m. The increase meant China was second only to the US in selling equity stakes and joint venture opportunities. Russia, where the value of partial takeovers increased from Dollars 349m to Dollars 6.6bn, was ranked fifth, behind Britain and the Netherlands. Mr Richard Agutter, chairman of KPMG's corporate finance department, warned that the pace of future investment in Russia could be undermined by right-wing electoral gains. Uncertainties over the political future of Hong Kong had slowed UK investment in China, he added. The total value of worldwide cross-border mergers and acquisitions, meanwhile, declined 14.6 per cent to Dollars 64bn last year as many countries endured recession. KPMG said uncertainties over the Maastricht treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks also persuaded companies to postpone M&amp;A plans. Japanese companies made some of sharpest cutbacks, with the value of their outright acquisitions falling by more than 86 per cent from Dollars 4.3bn in 1992 to Dollars 558m last year. The value of partial takeovers and joint ventures by Japanese groups also fell sharply - down more than 70 per cent to Dollars 4bn. Mr Agutter blamed the decline on Japan's slowing domestic economy, and he said similar factors held back activity in France, Germany and Italy. The value of outright acquisitions by French companies fell by almost half to Dollars 5.9bn; German groups cut purchases by 21 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn; while the Italian total fell more than 92 per cent to Dollars 463m. 'Companies in all these countries are being more cautious. They don't want to buy outright any more, they prefer to share the risk,' he said. Britain and the US, however, increased M&amp;A dealings. Outright acquisitions by British companies more than doubled to Dollars 13.5bn, while purchases by US groups rose from Dollars 14.5bn to Dollars 15.3bn. Mr Agutter highlighted deals such as Unilever's Pounds 220m takeover last December of Ortiz-Miko, the French frozen foods manufacturer, and BT's decision to take a Dollars 4.3bn stake in MCI as examples of increased activity. He said confidence in North America and the UK was also reflected by an increase in 'global capital flows' - KPMG's valuation of total purchases and disposals. This figure rose from Dollars 203bn in 1992 to Dollars 216bn last year. Forecasting increased activity in 1994, Mr Agutter said there would be more joint venture agreements rather than outright acquisitions. The amount spent by companies on European cross-border mergers fell by 40 per cent last year to Ecu31.35bn (Pounds 23.3bn), the lowest level since 1988, according to a survey by Translink, the cross-border M&amp;A adviser.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] sent an emergency telephone message to the South Korean  puppet board of unification today denouncing the South Korean  puppets for kidnapping lumbermen of the North working in the Far  East of Russia.    The message was conveyed through the North-South Liaison  Office at Panmunjom.    Recalling that the North side had warned against the  kidnapping of North's lumbermen by the South side in the far  east of Russia, the message said:    Your side kidnapped again our six citizens engaged in normal  tree-felling in the Far East of Russia on May 18 and 20 and took  them to Seoul.    Such a shameless, inhuman and barbaric act committed by your  side against fellow countrymen even in an alien land is a  heinous crime destroying harmonious families and increasing the  number of families living separated on this land and a  deliberate challenge aimed at extremely deteriorating the  relations between the North and the South which have alreay  reached an impasse. This has aroused irrepressible indignation  among the entire fellow countrymen.    Your side's shocking crime can never be covered up with  anything nor can it be tolerated.    Though your side is claiming that our lumbermen defected to  the South, its maladroit trick is nothing but a drama the  deceptive nature of which has already been fully revealed.    The authorities of your side must unconditionally and  promptly send all the kidnapped lumbermen back to the North and  apologize to the nation and the world for the inhuman crimes it  perpetrated, undermining the dignity of the nation in an alien  land.    If your side refuse to send them back to the North and  continue kidnapping our lumbermen, it would entail grave  consequences in the North-South relations as a whole and the  South side would have to pay dearly for it.    Your side will be held wholly responsible for all the  consequences to be entailed in the North-South relations and  history and the nation will never tolerate your side's inhuman  and anti-national crimes.</p>

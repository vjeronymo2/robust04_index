			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Property: A Landmark in holiday homes - Michael Stourton reports on a unique property rental scheme YOU MIGHT have reservations about paying to stay in a building that you knew had been selected by its owner because it was 'too desperate, troublesome or unfashionable to appeal to anyone else.' Yet, these are the words used by Sir John Smith, founder of the Landmark Trust, in explaining his criteria for 'the rescue of buildings in stress'; properties at risk that are to bear the Landmark Trust label. Some of the names may conjure up a none-too-compelling image. Take Appleton Water Tower, for instance, or the Bathhouse at Walton. Beamsley Hospital does not sound particularly inviting; the Pigsty at Robin Hood's Bay still less so. The House of Correction at Folkingham takes the biscuit for being a turn-off. Nevertheless, competition to take these buildings for a week's holiday, or longer, is fierce. Despite there being no advertising, an occupancy rate of 80 per cent is achieved; a level most hoteliers only dream about. The only part of the UK so far without Landmark is Northern Ireland. Overseas, it has one property in Rome and has recently acquired Rudyard Kipling's house in Vermont, US, the house Kipling built in 1892-3 shortly after his marriage to Vermont-born Carrie Balestier. It was here that Kipling achieved some of his most notable literary successes. But holiday letting was far from being the main aim of John Smith, banker and former MP, when he started the Landmark Trust in 1965. With a discerning eye for unusual buildings in danger of being lost for ever, Smith set about buying them up. It was rarely a straightforward business. Difficulties of every kind were encountered, including that of establishing legal ownership. There are now nearly 200 Landmark properties. The rate of conversion works out at about six new properties each year. Landmark has its own architectural adviser and also employs local architects. Much trouble is taken over the furnishing and equipping of these places  - an essential part of Landmark's attitude towards guests. Landmark believes that by staying in these historic buildings people will gain far more of the feel of a place than by merely looking at it. Almost all the furniture is old, but good. Sometimes it, too, has been rescued and repaired. Most of the curtains are specially designed and printed by Landmark for each building, and carpets and rugs are chosen for their quality and character. Furnishing the buildings, in itself a formidable undertaking, involves a team of people, including Lady Smith, whose influence in this direction remains strong. The absence of televisions and their aerials speaks volumes for the Landmark ethos. There are sometimes informal links with the National Trust, where, for example, land that goes with a building is administered by the National Trust while the building is handled by Landmark. Unlike the NT, there is no membership of Landmark. The decision-making process has, until recently, been the province of Sir John and Lady Smith alone, although when Sir John retired in June 1990 a committee of management was appointed. Sir John regrets that he is seldom able to meet the people who stay in Landmark properties. From entries in the logbook, with which every property is supplied, he gains an insight into the enterprise and imagination that visitors, including more and more from abroad, reveal in discovering things to see and do. A surprising number are not on holiday at all, but have come to do or study something in particular. A price list and booking form are obtainable from The Landmark Trust Shottesbrooke Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 3SW: Tel: 0628-825925. The copiously illustrated Landmark handbook is Pounds 6.50, including postage.</p>

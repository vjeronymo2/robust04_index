			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWNING, DAVIS RETURN TO FAMILIAR ROLES;  </P> <P> ANGELS: OUTFIELDER, DESIGNATED HITTER ADD HOME-RUN POWER TO LINEUP.  </P> <P> There was a strange configuration to the Angels' lineup Monday, with Brian  Downing on the sidelines on an opening day for the first time in 12 years, and  Chili Davis making a rare appearance at designated hitter.  </P> <P> On the second day of the season, Downing, who has been bothered by a nagging  muscle problem in his lower rib cage and back, was back at DH.  </P> <P> Davis, who can make left field such a place of unexpected twists and turns, was  back in left, even though he has been bothered by a slight groin injury.  </P> <P> And the Angels, held to five hits Monday in a 7-4 loss to Seattle, turned the  tables on the Mariners in a 7-0 victory Tuesday in which five of the runs came  on three home runs.  </P> <P> Classic Angel baseball, from the team that led the league in home runs last  season but finished 12th in runs scored. But it doesn't matter when you win.  </P> <P> "Ain't nothing wrong with a team that hits home runs," said Davis, whose solo  home run in the second was the game-winner. "I know a whole bunch of teams that  wish they had some home-run hitters in the lineup."  </P> <P> Downing followed Davis to the plate in the second, and grounded out. Up stepped  Dante Bichette, who homered for a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Downing broke the game open in the seventh with a three-run home run, driving  in Wally Joyner, who had singled, and Davis, who had walked.  </P> <P> Downing had been in the opening day lineup every year since 1979. He sat out  Monday, and not by choice.  </P> <P> "It's always been my nature never to ask out of a game," he said. "But  realistically, I'm not playing well enough to have been in the lineup (Monday)  night."  </P> <P> Truth be told, he said, he might not have been right to start Tuesday's game.  "At times I've played when I shouldn't have played," he said. "This probably  was one of those times. But sometimes it works out."  </P> <P> It worked out for the Angels.  </P> <P> Downing, was batting fifth instead of leadoff, came up with two on and two out.  </P> <P> "The two-out home run really made a big difference in the ballgame," Manager  Doug Rader said. "Three RBIs with two outs."  </P> <P> The situation with Downing's rib cage/back problem, coupled with his age (39),  might mean changes for the Angels.  </P> <P> Downing doesn't know how much he'll be playing.  </P> <P> "Sporadically," he said.  </P> <P> That could mean more time at DH -- and less in left -- for Davis.  </P> <P> "Regardless of what happens, I think Brian is too good a hitter, too valuable a  player to not play," Davis said. "With the problem with his side they may try  to limit the time he plays. Hopefully, he'll get healthy. I'm 30, Brian's 39.  My turn will come to sit down and take four hacks."  </P> <P> The Angels lived up to their reputation by living by the home run Tuesday. But  at least they lived.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of fact that we didn't score enough runs last year," Downing  said. "What people say is true. We do strike out too much. We don't walk  enough. Our club is built on pitching. Our field is manicured for pitching.  There are just not going to be as many ground-ball hits. Specifically, balls  are outs that elsewhere are hits. We have to hit home runs."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, they did.  </P> <P> "The good thing is that we scored some runs," Davis said. "And if it's a home  run offense that does it, that's what it takes."  </P></p>

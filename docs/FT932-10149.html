			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Fiat board meets to take ethics into account: A company scarred by Italy's widening corruption scandal THE meeting today of the board of directors of Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, will be a more sombre occasion than that originally called to approve last year's accounts. The gathering has been overtaken by Italy's widening political corruption scandal, in which Fiat has been pitched into the front line. Almost a dozen executives have been arrested, interrogated or briefly detained by magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks on public-sector contracts or bribes to politicians or political parties. The board has been summoned to approve a new code of business ethics, drawn up by lawyers. Incorporating an existing document on internal issues, such as conflicts of interest and insider trading, the code, modelled on similar practice at IBM and General Electric, will guide Fiat managers when dealing with bribery and corruption. The magistrates' inquiries have moved steadily up the group's management ladder to embrace, most recently, two of its three top executives, excluding members of the controlling Agnelli family. Earlier this year, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, spent 28 days in Milan's San Vittore prison before being transferred to house arrest. Last month, magistrates issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, its chief operating officer. Mr Garuzzo was placed under house arrest. Other executives arrested or questioned by magistrates include Mr Antonio Mosconi, managing director of Fiat's Toro insurance company, Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, managing director of its New Holland farm and earth-moving equipment business and Mr Paolo Torricelli, head of the Fiat Avio gas turbines subsidiary. The last two are back at work. The arrests reflect the main strands uncovered so far in the investigations. Mr Garuzzo and Mr Ruggeri were formerly chief executive and head of the bus division of Fiat's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary respectively. Iveco has been implicated in alleged kickbacks on bus sales to Milan. Mr Massimo Aimetti, Iveco's finance director, is also under house arrest in Turin. Construction is the second sector in which Fiat has been implicated. Apart from Mr Mattioli, chairman of the group's Cogefar-Impresit building unit, other executives interrogated include Mr Mosconi, who was managing director of the Fiat-Impresit building unit, and Mr Enzo Papi, a former senior manager in the group. Fiat has also been embroiled in allegations of kickbacks on contracts from Enel, the state electricity generating authority. The allegations have resulted in the issue of cautionary warrants against Mr Torricelli, now back at work, and Mr Mauro Bertini, head of Fiat Avio's gas turbines division, who is under house arrest. The group has also been investigated for alleged kickbacks paid by its Savigliano railway equipment division. The inquiries resulted in the brief incarceration of its head, Mr Giancarlo Cozza, now back at work. The string of arrests, most of them in the past two months, triggered Fiat's more co-operative approach towards the investigations. Last month, its lawyers contacted Milan magistrates, proposing that Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, should volunteer to answer questions. Though the magistrates denied they had done a deal with Fiat, the company's initiative has led to a temporary halt in arrests and a relatively soft reception for executives to whom cautionary warrants have been issued and who have returned from abroad. So far, Mr Romiti has appeared twice before the magistrates. On the last occasion, he delivered a 20-page document, and six pages of appendices, outlining political corruption. Other Fiat managers have since supplied information. Mr Romiti also used the occasion to exhort other businessmen to adopt a similar approach. The change of heart has visibly eased tension between magistrates and the company. It has also lifted the mood within Fiat itself. However, last weekend, matters took a potential turn for the worse. In one of the press leaks endemic in the investigations, Panorama, a weekly news magazine, published extracts from Mr Mosconi's testimony. The report alleges that Mr Romiti knew of the existence of foreign bank accounts in the mid-1980s, long before previously indicated.</p>

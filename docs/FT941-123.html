			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Social clause in a trade pact to protect workers is not protectionist (1) Sir, Your editorial, 'Workers' rights and free trade' (March 28), calling for 'broad-ranging discussion of workers' rights in the World Trade Organisation' (the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) is to be welcomed. Non-governmental and civil society organisations in the third world have long supported the call for Gatt to set up a working party on the linkages between trade and workers' rights. In the Uruguay Round agreement, such a working party was agreed for the environment and it has long been a puzzle why the life of a dolphin or the fate of a forest should be afforded more importance than the right of children to be protected from inhuman exploitation. The question of protectionism can be properly dealt with in such a WTO working party made up on a tripartite basis. As unions see it, a social clause is the opposite of protectionist as it would raise living standards and purchasing power and increase commodity trade worldwide. Obviously a social clause which focused on international rights of free assembly, speech and organisation would be unwelcome to some authoritarian third-world governments and to those multinationals which flee their social responsibilities at home and seek out countries where human rights are violated. The bitter experience for many of the third world's workers is that the real protectionism today is the protection that authoritarian governments and multinationals have from international covenants on human rights in the workplace.

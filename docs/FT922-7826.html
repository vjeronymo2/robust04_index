			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar unsteady after losses THE DOLLAR recorded its fourth easier close in a row on European markets yesterday after tumbling to a three-month low against the D-Mark in the US overnight, writes James Blitz. After falling to DM1.6090 in Wednesday's North American trading, the US unit ended at DM1.6125 last night in London, nearly a pfennig down from its previous close. Once again, dealers said the market's obsession with another possible cut in the US Fed Funds rate had been the main factor undermining the dollar. North American traders were anxiously awaiting US money supply data due to be released yesterday, with fears that another sharp drop in M-2 money supply could force the Federal Reserve to ease credit. According to Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp, the dollar's performance will be by far the most important factor in foreign exchange markets in forthcoming days. He believes the next important event will be the Fed's open market committee meeting on Tuesday. 'If there is no easing of rates by next Wednesday, we should see new support for the dollar,' he says. He believes that if the Fed does reduce its rates again, the dollar will go below DM1.60 and test support at DM1.58. Analysts said the US currency had also been weighed down by extremely heavy selling of D-Marks against Swiss francs. The Swiss currency has traditionally been highly illiquid and dollar bull markets have often been short of Swiss francs. Yesterday, however, the 'Swissy' was highly popular as traders enthused about the fact that the authorities in Zurich have allowed market interest rates to rise. Suggestions that Switzerland may move closer to the European Monetary System also boosted the currency. The dollar fell nearly two centimes to SFr1.4775 and the D-Mark eased to DM108.90 per SFr100 from DM108.40. In New York the dollar finished near to London's close at DM1.6130, SFr1.4740 and Y130.23. Yen trading was quiet yesterday after the dollar's dramatic fall against the Japanese currency on Tuesday to Y130. A trader said the US unit, which closed last night in London at Y130.25, was now supported by rumours of very good dollar support at Y129.50. A number of large Japanese financial institutions were said to be ready to buy dollars if the rate fell to around that level. Sterling's movements have appeared to shadow the dollar in the last day-and-a-half. The UK currency weakened sharply against the D-Mark overnight, dipping to a low of DM2.9260. Similar to the dollar, it recovered yesterday to close at DM2.9375, a loss of  1/2 pfennig from its previous London close. A surprisingly strong rise in UK average earnings dashed hopes harboured in some quarters of another cut in interest rates, propping up the pound.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Strong showing for UK pension funds UK PENSION funds scored an average return of over 16 per cent in 1991, more than recovering all their investment losses from the year before. However, the strong performance means that net new cash flowing into pension funds is running well below average and this is restricting fund mangers' investment flexibility. Returns on equities alone were a record 20 per cent, the best year for those securities since the WM Company, which measures pension fund performance, began keeping records in 1976. Returns on overseas equities totalled 21 per cent. The stellar performance of domestic and foreign equities has been particularly significant for pension funds in the past year with average weighting in those securities rising to a record 80 per cent. In 1990, the average weighting was 70 per cent, while 10 years ago the average pension fund had 56 per cent of its assets in equities. WM Company's Stephen Gosztony says that there has been a switch out of UK bonds and cash, but the performance of UK bonds in 1991, at 18.8 per cent, nearly matched that of equities. Cash investments showed a 12.9 per cent return. The worst performing sector was property, which recorded a 0.2 per cent decline, and index-linked securities, which returned 5.6 per cent. WM Company analyses the returns of 2,500 UK pension portfolios representing more than three-quarters of the total UK pension fund market. Over the past five years, in spite of two stock market crashes, UK pension funds have comfortably out-run inflation, returning on average 9.5 per cent per year. This compares with average annual rises in retail prices over that period of 6.4 per cent, while average earnings rose 8.8 per cent per year. As a result UK employers are no longer providing enough new cash to their pension funds to meet current obligations. Net cash flow in 1991 was 2 per cent of initial value, down from 3 per cent in 1990 and from 15 per cent in 1981. Thus, pension fund managers must use investment income to pay for a portion of benefits due to current retirees. Fund managers prefer strong cash flows, Mr Gosztony said, because it gives them the option of directing funds to sectors they think will out-perform.</p>

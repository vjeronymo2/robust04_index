			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. T. Adamashvili, M. D. Peykrishvili, D. D. </F> Bitadze, Tbilisi State University, Tbilisi, Georgia]    [Abstract] The possibility of formation of SAW breezers in  the GaAs-AlAs superlattices, caused by non-harmonic oscillations  of the crystal lattice and by dispersion is examined. Since the  phenomenon of acoustic magnetic resonance occurs in GaAs in the  presence of paramagnetic impurity Fe[.sup]2+[/], the  possibility of realization of acoustic self-induced transparency  (ASIT) and formation of solitons as well as breezers is also  examined. Numerical computations demonstrated that with non-  harmonic oscillations of the lattice and dispersion, the  excitation of the breezers can not occur. By replacing the Ga  atoms in the GaAs by atoms of paramagnetic impurity  Fe[.sup]2+[/], the conditions of the ASIT effect can be  realized if the system is placed in an external permanent  magnetic field.

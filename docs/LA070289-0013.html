			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RED ROOM  </P> <P> At the risk of appearing ignorant, I have to know if "The Red Room," by Paul  Paree (May 21), is a true story. The story starts out like a bit of fiction  about paint or decorating, then becomes quite disturbing. Please let me know if  these two gentlemen really need help or if they spent too much time in the Red  Room.  </P> <P> GARN STEPHENS  </P> <P> Studio City  </P> <P> The story is true. -- The Editors  </P></p>

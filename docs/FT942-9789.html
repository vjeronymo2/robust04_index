			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers Squibb buys generics Bristol-Myers Squibb, the second largest US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday joined the drugs industry dash for corporate deal-making by buying a 25 per cent stake in Azupharma, a German drugs manufacturer. Azupharma specialises in the manufacture of generics, unbranded drugs that have lost their patent protection. It is a subsidiary of German drugs wholesaler Gehe which had sales in 1993 of DM10.2bn. The value of the deal was not disclosed. 'This investment is an important strategic move in the European healthcare environment,' said Mr Joachim von Roy, Bristol-Myers Squibb's European president. 'It represents the beginning of an alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gehe. We are now well-positioned to develop a strong generic presence across Europe.' The generics market in Europe is 'expected to grow substantially over the next five years', said Bristol-Myers Squibb, as a result of changes in healthcare spending and patent expiries on several big selling prescription drugs. The deal is Bristol-Myers Squibb's first stake in a European generics producer. The two companies began a business relationship March when Bristol-Myers Squibb licensed a generic version of its biggest selling drug, heart treatment Capoten, to Azupharma for the German market. The move reverses a recent trend for German companies to buy into US generics manufacturers. In February, Bayer, the German chemicals group, paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned generics company based in Florham Park, New Jersey. That deal followed the Dollars 546m acquisition last November by German chemicals giant Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a US generics and over-the-counter drugs maker. Acquiring generics companies serves two purposes for a drugs manufacturer: it is an entry into a rapidly growing part of the healthcare sector and it may help protect market share when patents expire. Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing the expiry of patents on Capoten around the world. The drug is an Ace-inhibitor, the newest type of heart drug which faces strong competition from Merck, the biggest US drugs company, and the UK's Zeneca, formerly part of ICI. Capoten's global sales last year were worth Dollars 1.8bn, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers. This figure is likely to fall sharply after patents expire in its biggest market, the US, next year.</p>

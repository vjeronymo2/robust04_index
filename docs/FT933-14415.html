			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Banamex to offer MTNs in international market BANCO Nacional de Mexico, (Banamex), Mexico's largest bank, is set to offer 1bn pesos (Dollars 320m) of medium-term notes in the international capital market, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. It will be the first peso-denominated Euronote offering by a Mexican company since the country's return to international debt markets in 1989. Banamex's existing peso debt is rated A grade by Standard &amp; Poor's. The issue will enable Banamex to fund peso loans at a lower rate than that available in Mexico. The notes can be issued with maturities from 30 days to 10 years. The offering is expected to be followed by other Mexican companies keen to sell peso-denominated, rather than dollar, debt to foreign investors. While the Mexican government has tapped foreign interest in high-yielding peso treasury bonds, Mexican companies have up to now brought in foreign funds mainly by offering dollar-denominated debt.</p>

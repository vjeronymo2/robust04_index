			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique signed by Colorado Party President Blas N. </F> Riquelme]    [Text] Colorado Party supporters:    The Colorado Party that won the 1993 May elections has the  political responsibility for the current government.    Therefore, the president of the Colorado Party is the  natural  party spokesman for its participation in government.    Bold actions by the president against the party as an  institution have recently become public.    The events that seriously concern the party, which are  detailed here, are the following:    1. The inconsiderate increase in basic public utilitiy  rates,  major public utilities rate increases, which violently hurt the  humble Paraguayan people, whose interests are of undeniable  priority for the party.    2. The massive, aggressive, and unjustified dismissal of  public employees, such as in the cases of Capasa [Canas  Paraguayas S.A.-- Paraguayan Liquor Inc.] -- the former Apal  [Paraguayan Alcohol Administration] -- the Foreign Ministry, and  others.    3. The president's unusual prohibition against ministers  accepting invitations from the party president to come to party  headquarters to coordinate issues related to the public good,  based on the ideals of Colorado Party doctrine.    4. The president's complacent attitude toward the  unconstitutionality of the law stripping military men and  policemen of party membership, thus betraying the party's  solidarity and the oath to observe and enforce the current  Constitution. The party, by a resolution of its Executive  Board, decided to ask the court to determine the  unconstitutionality of the law in face of the president's lack  of action to fully support the party members among the military  and police.    5. During 1993 Antelco [National Telecommunications  Administration] installed 12,000 new telephone lines and  received 24 billion guaranies more income than in 1992.  Spending was reduced by 25 billion guaranies with relation to  1992. Profits increased from 8 billion guaranies in 1992 to 56  billion guaranies in 1993, which represents a 700 percent  increase. Antelco's domestic and foreign debt decreased by 13  percent, and the amortization of the debt reached $42 million.  Antelco currently has 11 billion guaranies in its coffers.  Despite this positive situation its president and general  administrator were unexplicably and abruptly fired by today's  decree.    These events, in addition to others we are not listing for  the time being, seriously offend the party as an institution.  The party presidency is therefore forced to publicly denounce  this situation in order to safeguard the high interests of  Colorado Party supporters.    The president of the Colorado Party therefore declares:    1) His strong condemnation of the events listed here, which  are harmful to the legitimate rights of the party that won the 9  May 1993 elections.    2) His firm and unwavering decision to continue to struggle  for the ideals of the glorious National Republican Association  in order to preserve intact the dignity of Colorado Party  supporters. His assertion that he will not subject himself to  open or concealed pressures, wherever they may come from.    [signed] Blas N. Riquelme, president of the Colorado Party</p>

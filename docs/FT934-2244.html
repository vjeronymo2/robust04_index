			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Graduates 'happier on dole than in stop-gap jobs' Graduates are happier and healthier if they stay unemployed until they get the job they really want, according to research by Dr Tony Cassidy, a psychologist of Nene College, Northampton. He told the British Psychological Society yesterday that graduates doing stop-gap jobs, such as working as sales assistants, were worse off than those on the dole. Those in stop-gap jobs were more likely to complain of difficulty sleeping, feeling weak and believing they were inferior. Those who were unemployed felt more motivated to achieve and more optimistic. The Confederation of British Industry took issue with the findings, arguing that the research could also be taken as further proof that universities were failing to prepare students for the world of work. Mr Robbie Gilbert, employee relations director at the CBI, said: 'It has been a long-standing complaint of employers that universities do not prepare people for work and this research could be said to support that view.' Mr Gilbert said that there was no reason to doubt the conventional wisdom that employers were likely to be more impressed by someone who had been working rather than sitting at home. Dr Cassidy said only one in 10 of the 160 young people he surveyed was in a job of choice. Graduate unemployment stands at about 12 per cent. Defending his findings, Dr Cassidy said: 'What this survey shows more than anything is the importance of giving proper career guidance to students in their final year. This would identify their strengths and weaknesses and prepare them for potential problems.'</p>

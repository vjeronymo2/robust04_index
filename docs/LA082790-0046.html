			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE COMPLEXITIES OF PAIRING PRINCIPAL AND SCHOOL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SHOULD POSITIONS BE ROTATED ON A REGULAR BASIS? WHAT ABOUT PARENT  INPUT? CONTINUITY? SUPT. TOM PAYZANT, FOR ONE, HAS CHANGED THE WAY HE VIEWS  REASSIGNMENT.  </P> <P> By all accounts, Virginia Foster had done an excellent job running Morse High  School in Encanto for the past seven years and had no desire to move to another  site.  </P> <P> But earlier this month, when San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant and  school board trustees rejected the three finalists among applicants for the top  post at troubled Lincoln High, Payzant phoned Foster on the morning of the  board meeting to tell her she was being moved there.  </P> <P> While Foster's switch was only one of dozens made during the annual spasm of  principal reassignments announced over the past two months, it enjoyed special  visibility among several surprise transfers because both Lincoln and Morse are  home to a significant number of the district's nonwhite students whose academic  achievement lags unacceptably behind state and county averages.  </P> <P> Eyebrows were also raised because Payzant has promised Foster he will discuss a  bonus plan as part of her new post, his trial balloon to push individual  contracts for principals at selected schools, in contrast to present policies  for uniform pay based on enrollment.  </P> <P> She also is being permitted to take her administrative assistant, her head  counselor, a resource teacher, her ROTC instructor and a vice principal to  Lincoln, considerations almost unheard of when transfers occur.  </P> <P> As such, Foster's unexpected transfer symbolizes the complex nature of  principal selection, principal transfer and principal demotion in the nation's  eighth-largest urban school system.  </P> <P> Should principals be rotated regularly no matter what kind of job -- good or  mediocre -- they have done in their present assignments? Should changes be made  in salary scales that automatically reward principals at larger schools?  </P> <P> What about the increasing demand by parents and teachers for a say in who comes  to their school? What to do with administrators trained as managers at a time  when new conditions demand leadership in improving instruction and helping  teachers adapt to a wider range of student preparation?  </P> <P> "Candidly, we'd like to have more continuity, but people also want to make more  money, we have deaths and retirements, we have some principals whom we can't  figure out what to do with -- it's not always easy to get the right fit,"  school board President Kay Davis said.  </P> <P> Payzant, about to enter his ninth year as district superintendent -- the  longest tenure of his 22-year career -- has changed his view of how to handle  principal assignments.  </P> <P> No longer does he believe principals should be rotated among the district's  170-some schools every three to four years, just for the sake of change, as he  strongly felt when he arrived in 1982.  </P> <P> The critical need for schools to create strong parent-school ties, to  experiment with educational reforms and stimulate better teaching -- these and  other requirements for creative leaders argue for greater longevity as well as  improved principal training and ongoing reassessment, Payzant said.  </P> <P> But he concedes that, despite his high hopes for quicker change, the reality of  a district with multiethnic demands, wide-ranging student achievement and  uneven administrative talent has so far resulted in only halting progress.  </P> <P> "Where possible, I would like more stability and continuity for principals,"  Payzant said. "But you're always faced with having to weigh the needs of a  particular school and the entire district against the wishes of an individual  employee, and to strike the best balance among conflicting views."  </P> <P> He emphasized that his administrators are still told they are principals within  the San Diego Unified School District, "and not principals of a particular  school."  </P> <P> In the case of Foster, Payzant said the veteran's leadership abilities were  needed at Lincoln after trustees decided that the three finalists, all vice  principals, should not be given as their first assignment a school with the  toughest socioeconomics of any site in the district.  </P> <P> Foster was identified as one of the few black district principals who could  move forward with programs at Lincoln, long considered an educational symbol  for the black Southeast San Diego community.  </P> <P> "I didn't give her a choice because if you do that, you have to be willing to  accept 'no,' and I wasn't willing in this case," Payzant said. While Foster has  a longstanding policy of not talking to the press, several associates said  privately that she was not thrilled by the transfer.  </P> <P> Payzant said he told her that "if she had a similar situation" to his, she  would do the right thing. "And she laughed,," he said. "There's always going to  be tension if you really believe you ought to have your best principals in the  toughest schools when some of those people may not want those positions."  </P> <P> But the superintendent, in a move related to his push for fundamental changes,  has offered Foster incentives in exchange for her acceptance of the transfer.  Such site-based incentives could include a bonus plan based on her  accomplishment of specific objectives, Payzant said.  </P> <P> "We're talking about something in the range of $3,000 to $4,000, money in  return for accomplishing objectives at Lincoln," he said. "And yes, some  administrators might not like this at all because they are leery of  performance-based bonuses.  </P> <P> "But I think as part of our whole restructuring effort, we should open up our  thinking in response to incentives."  </P> <P> That restructuring -- under which the district hopes to give principals,  teachers and parents more decision-making power and accountability at  individual schools -- is already leading to some changes in the selection  process.  </P> <P> Numerous schools where the former principal retired or died have taken  advantage of a new district policy that allows teachers and parents to  participate in interviews of applicants for these so-called "first-order"  vacancies.  </P> <P> Maruta Gardner, principal at Mann Middle School for the past six years, was  asked by several teachers at Mission Bay High to apply after their principal  retired. Gardner said she had been interested in moving to a high school, but  would have stayed at Mann if her superiors could have guaranteed that she would  not have been moved to another school against her wishes. They made no such  guarantee this past spring, when the first soundings are made annually among  administrators as to what moves might be forthcoming.  </P> <P> "If I am going to move, I want to go to a place that I really want to be at,"  Gardner said. "Just waking up one morning and finding out that you are going to  a new school, after putting your heart and soul in a job you like, that's not  the best way to do things."  </P> <P> Gardner believes that principals chosen through restructuring must be allowed  to stay at a school longer than in past years in order to move programs forward  and repay the trust shown in them by parents and teachers.  </P> <P> "And all the research tells me that you need at least four to five years to put  programs into place, to get a school on track," Gardner said. "So if people are  moving every three to four years, that's counterproductive to everything being  said now."  </P> <P> However, the size of the district mitigates against a rapid reduction of  wholesale rotations because of what Payzant calls "backfill" and others call  "dominoes," the filling of the posts vacated when principals are promoted or  otherwise moved to positions left empty by retirement or death.  </P> <P> Principals for the backfill posts have traditionally been plucked from schools  without interviews or bids, based only on what assistant superintendents  believe would be good combinations of administrator and site, as well as a way  to punish or reward.  </P> <P> Former Crawford High Principal Nancy Shelburne, now a district administrator,  recalled walking into a trustee meeting one Tuesday afternoon to receive an  award for excellence for her two years of leadership at Bell Junior High. "And  while getting the award, they said, 'By the way, you're being moved to  Crawford,' " she said.  </P> <P> This year, for example, after the principal at Grant successfully applied for  the post at McKinley Elementary, Payzant and his assistants moved the principal  from Fremont Elementary to Grant, the principal from Silver Gate to Fremont,  the principal from Kennedy to Silver Gate and promoted a vice principal from  Florence to principal at Kennedy. Some of the moves were promotions, some were  lateral transfers and others were warnings to those judged to be doing poorly.  </P> <P> Payzant did allow two schools with backfill vacancies this year to conduct  interviews first with prospective principals, but he said that to allow  teacher/parent participation at all schools with vacancies would slow down the  process unacceptably.  </P> <P> "As more and more schools want a say (in selection), it's going to get harder  to handle each year because you always reach a point in the calendar where  we've got to have principals in place," he said, noting that it can take up to  six months to fill a vacancy by going through the complete notification and  interview process.  </P> <P> In addition, there could be some principals wanting to move -- or some whom  Payzant wants to move -- who would prove unacceptable to parents and teachers  at any school. "We've got to place those principals somewhere" because current  policies almost foreclose demotions back to the classroom, Payzant said.  </P> <P> A majority of principals at small schools who perform well generally want to  move up to sites with larger enrollments because that means more money, said  Cathy Hopper, a longtime principal and assistant superintendent who retired in  July.  </P> <P> "And for lousy principals, they are never going to be moved up to a larger  school, so they just get moved around from small school to small school,"  Hopper said, referring to longstanding district policies of not giving bigger  schools to principals with poor records.  </P> <P> "So some small schools that are among the toughest to lead in the district end  up with a new principal every three years and don't show the academic or  leadership growth that they deserve."  </P> <P> Hopper allowed Barry Bernstein, considered one of the district's better  elementary principals, to stay an extra year at Torrey Pines in order to  nurture several important curriculum and race-relations programs new to the  school, at a time when Bernstein had been tagged by Payzant for a bigger school  needing his expertise and enthusiasm.  </P> <P> "He suffered financially (for a year), but he wanted to stay," Hopper said of  Bernstein, now principal at Horton Elementary, a school with one of the largest  enrollments and a variety of academic programs.  </P> <P> Said Bernstein, "I believe that five to seven years could make it easier to  develop stronger relationships with parents as well as gain the confidence of  teachers and students . . . but I can also say that purposeful and planned  transitions can help produce better principals as well."  </P> <P> But in too many cases, administrators concede, principals learn of their  transfer to a school of which they know little or nothing about, and are forced  to undertake a crash course during the summer to know at least the names of  their new teachers by September. The time line is shortened further for those  principals assigned to the increasing number of year-round schools.  </P> <P> The iconoclastic superintendent of the 12-school South Bay elementary district  in Imperial Beach moves his principals around on five-year rotations, but sits  down with each one and discusses why they are being moved to a particular  school and what he wants them to try in their new position.  </P> <P> "You don't just leave someone largely to his or her devices without any  specific plan," Philip Grignon said. "I watch each school, I know the strengths  and weaknesses of each principal, so I'm not just moving them around for the  hell of it" or basing the changes just on intuition.  </P> <P> "After five years, I think most principals have done the magic they can at a  particular school, and so it's nice to bring in someone with a different  perspective. But we remain a centralized district with a strong academic focus,  and no school is going to go from pillar to post," Grignon said.  </P> <P> "One principal may be good at improving a school through his or her  personality, while another who has strong organizational skills will work well  at a school needing less of the personal touch. . . . The bottom line still has  to be better student results."  </P></p>

			<p>Manufacturer   <F P=102>   BR2502091894 Paris LA LETTRE DU GIFAS in English 27 Jan 94 </F> <F P=103> BR2502091894 </F> <F P=104>  Paris LA LETTRE DU GIFAS </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aerospatiale and SNPE Expand Scope </F> of CELERG"]    [Text] In 1992, AEROSPATIALE and SNPE formed a joint firm  known as the CELERG Co. specialized in motors for tactical  missiles and rockets. In its initial form, CELERG centralized  all the conceptional and marketing facilities of the two parent  firms. In a recently signed memorandum of understanding,  AEROSPATIALE and SNPE have added production and fabrication  facilities to their joint venture. These facilities will  include the production of propellants and engine integration.  They will be located at Saint-Medard-en-Jalles (Gironde) and  Angouleme for SNPE and at Bourges for AEROSPATIALE.    CELERG is now the leading European manufacturer of power  plants for missiles and tactical weapons systems, with a size  comparable to that of its major American competitors.    AEROSPATIALE and SNPE thereby reinforce their partnership  while enhancing the position of CELERG, a subsidiary to which  additional French or foreign partners will be added to obtain a  truly significant dimension in Europe, benefiting by important  commercial and technical synergies.</p>

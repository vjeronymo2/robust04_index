			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / DTI may exempt small businesses from annual audit MORE THAN 250,000 small companies could be exempted from the statutory annual audit as early as next year, under Department of Trade and Industry proposals issued yesterday. The move would represent one of the most sweeping changes for nearly a century to legislation covering the scope of audit requirements. In a consultative document launched by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, the DTI suggests exempting from annual audit limited liability companies with a turnover below Pounds 37,600, the threshold for value added tax registration. 'It is absurd that small companies should be required to spend scarce resources on something of no benefit to their business,' Mr Hamilton said. 'This is a measure which has considerable deregulatory potential for almost no risk.' While proposals for abolition of the small company audit have already been examined and rejected by the government twice in the past decade, most of the more influential decision-makers have now changed their views and endorse relaxation. The Inland Revenue, which has traditionally opposed the change, said yesterday it had been fully consulted: 'The chancellor is fully signed up to reducing the burdens on small business.' Mr Paul Chisnall, an associate director of the British Bankers' Association, said: 'We can see the need to try to lift the requirement. This proposal is moving with the times. We welcome it.' But Mr Terry Robinson, a vice-president of the Institute of Credit Management, said credit-rating agencies would resist the changes, which would reduce the reliability of published financial information. 'This will work against the best interests of small companies,' he said. The DTI document proposes two options: exemption from the audit requirement; or replacement of the audit with a 'compilation report' from an accountant confirming the accounts have been prepared in accordance with company law. Exemption would also require unanimous approval by shareholders and the company should have balance sheet assets of not more than Pounds 100,000. That could cover an estimated 250,000-300,000 companies, which research has suggested spend 2 to 4.5 per cent of turnover on an audit fee which many regard as having little practical value. Consultation closes at the end of June. Mr Hamilton said that, if approved, the changes could be brought about by regulation, and be introduced possibly as soon as spring or summer next year. Mr Tony Miller, an accountant who is financial affairs chairman for the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses, called for the threshold for exemption to be lifted further. 'This is a step in the right direction but it is still far too restrictive,' he said.</p>

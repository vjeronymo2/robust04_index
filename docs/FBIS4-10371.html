			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 April, key national union leaders categorically  rejected remarks by the U.S. State Department and, in  particular, an article by U.S. Senator John Kerry in THE  WASHINGTON POST, in which Kerry says Colombia is a  "narcodemocracy" and its economy is pervaded by mafia activities.    Spokesmen for the banking, industrial, and coffee sectors  issued statements yesterday from Cartagena, site of a banking  convention.    One of the first statements was issued by Carlos Arturo  Angel, president of the National Association of Industrialists,  who pointed out that economies throughout the world are pervaded  by drug trafficking and that Colombia is not a special case.    Angel stated: "We are a small part of a huge business which,  among other things, conducts a substantial share of its  operations in industrialized countries, and especially in the  United States." Angel also asserted that U.S. laws have  benefited drug traffickers.    Cesar Gonzalez, president of the Association of Financial  Institutions, expressed his confusion about these charges, and  he conveyed his confidence that these comments do not represent  a widespread view or the view of the U.S. Government or Congress.    He noted: "The United States has viewed the countries that  are south of the Rio Grande as one huge hacienda, and it  believes it can submit these nations to its will."    Gonzalez Munoz pointed to the efforts Colombia has made to  fight drug trafficking and the price it has paid in its fight  against organized crime, and he added that this is why he  believes remarks by some U.S. officials are less than  appropriate.    Gonzalez added: "The existence of drug money in the economy  cannot be denied, but this also happens in the United States."    Gabriel Rosas Vega, president of the Association of Coffee  Exporters, also rejected Senator Kerry's remarks. Rosas  indicated that the United States has no moral authority to call  us into question because U.S. banks, both large and small,  handle drug money.  <H5>  More Reactions </H5>   Rosas Vega said "we cannot bite our tongues" and avoid  saying  the United States is not morally qualified to speak on the  subject.    Carlos Caballero Argaez, president of the Bank of Foreign  Trade, noted that the problem "must be examined from its true  perspective, which is that Colombia's situation cannot be viewed  only in the light of drug trafficking activities when its  economy depends on and is rooted in traditional exports of oil,  coffee, ferronickel, and so on."    Last, Labor Minister Jose Elias Melo said that Senator  Kerry's opinion shows total ignorance of the recent progress of  the Colombian economy. He stated: "The fact that he has finally  noticed Colombia's recent strength and development does not mean  that this progress stems from drug activities; on the contrary,  it comes from the hard work of Colombian businessmen and  workers."    Melo added that efforts are being made to prevent money  laundering, and these efforts must be perceived in a better  light when viewed from abroad.</p>

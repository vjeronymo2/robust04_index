			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Simple and special ingredients - Nicholas Lander finds shelf space for Richard Olney's new book No enthusiastic cook with limited space on the kitchen bookshelf will welcome yet another book extolling the virtues of Provencal cooking. Almost every cookery book written today, regardless of the author's birthplace, seems to include a recipe for aioli, grilled vegetables or a daube of beef. Lulu's Provencal Table by Richard Olney (Harper Collins, Dollars 30, 364 pages - soon to be available in the UK), is different. It begins romantically in 1935 when Lucien Peyraud met Lucie (known as Lulu) Tempier in Aix-en-Provence and recounts their subsequent marriage in 1937. In 1940 they took over her family's wine property, Domaine Tempier, in Bandol, but the second world war imposed its harsh reality. The only food available in any quantity was Jerusalem artichokes and, unsurprisingly, they do not feature in any of Lulu's recipes. The book describes Lucien's dedication to improving the quality of his wines, now sold around the world, and Lulu's dedication to cooking for family, friends and those fortunate to have found their way to the Peyraud's table. Lulu's recipes exude an air of simplicity because she is a domestic, rather than a professional, cook. Her leg of lamb on a bed of thyme is stunning but very easy (even if you are cooking on a small oven in your holiday gite) and her recipes for flat vegetable omelettes will please a single diner or a large gathering. Behind all the menus lies a consistency of method and balance: a thoughtfully prepared amuse- gueule, a main course that is there to impress as much with its taste as with the care with which it has been prepared, a well-chosen cheese and/or a light dessert, usually incorporating the freshest fruit. This book excites on several other levels too. It is fastidiously written by Olney, an American who has lived in Provence for many years and has become a close friend of the Peyrauds. Gail Skoff has not only taken some inspirational colour photographs but has lovingly resuscitated some black and white pictures from the Peyraud family album. The book has also been edited thoughtfully. Many cookery tomes are annoying because the recipes end mid-page. The editor has avoided this and skilfully used a series of woodcuts from Le Tresor de la Cuisine du Bassin Mediterranean, published in 1930, to add to its variety. These provide the final special ingredient to a book which should find a place in any kitchen.</p>

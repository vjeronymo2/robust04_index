(IDO) is close to reaching an agreement with Motorola Inc. of  the United States on opening Japan's cellular phone market to  Motorola systems, Japan's postal minister suggested Tuesday [8  March].    Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told  reporters after a cabinet meeting that the Japanese cellular  phone service company and the U.S. telecommunications equipment  maker appear to have made good progress in their talks.    Kanzaki would not say when IDO and Motorola are likely to  reach agreement but added he believes both companies are keeping  in mind a U.S. plan to announce trade sanctions against Japan on  March 17 if no settlement is attained.    Kanzaki also declined to confirm news reports that the U.S.  has demanded that sales of Motorola-type cellular phones be  increased to about 240,000 per year in the cellular service area  extending from Tokyo to Nagoya.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KHOMEINI'S BODY FALLS FROM COFFIN AS FRENZIED MOURNERS TEAR SHROUD  </P> <P> Millions of frenzied mourners carried away with grief tore the white shroud  from the body of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, toppling his half-naked  corpse to the ground, before the Iranian leader was buried today.  </P> <P> Mourners blocked the path of a van carrying Khomeini's body in an open coffin  to the cemetery from the square where it had lain in state for 24 hours in an  air-conditioned glass cubicle.  </P> <P> In a scramble for mementos, they grabbed the tightly wrapped white shroud in  which Muslims are buried and tore it to shreds.  </P> <P> State television later showed the mourners grabbing the body and pulling the  shroud, until the feet could be seen. The broadcast then was cut off abruptly  for several minutes.  </P> <P> "The people love the imam too much," a young man said. "They cannot bear to see  him buried." He said they wanted pieces of the shroud "as sacred relics."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Son Knocked Down  </P> <P> The coffin was transferred to a military helicopter, but the crowd rushed  forward as it tried to land. As the helicopter flew away with the coffin  protruding from its open door, the crowd was told that the burial had been  postponed.  </P> <P> Three hours later, however, a helicopter landed the rewrapped body in a metal  casket. Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Khomeini's son, Ahmad,  accompanied the body and oversaw the burial.  </P> <P> Ahmad was knocked down in the melee around the coffin and lost his black  turban. He looked pale and dazed as he was hoisted above the crowd and passed  from hand to hand to an ambulance.  </P> <P> Women clad in head-to-toe black chadors rubbed shoulders with men despite the  Islamic prohibition of physical contact between a woman and any man other than  her husband.  </P> <P> Firemen sprayed the crowd with jets of water from fire hoses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nightlong Vigil at Bier  </P> <P> Most of Tehran's 6 million people appeared to be in the streets, and official  media said millions more came from other regions to bid Khomeini farewell.  About 2 million mourners had kept a nightlong vigil around the bier in Mousalam  Mosque, 22 miles north of the cemetery.  </P> <P> At the Baheshte Zahra cemetery, thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians  jostled around the grave raising clouds of dust as Khomeini's body was finally  laid to rest.  </P> <P> A television announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, chanted "Father, don't  leave your children! Oh father don't leave your beloved!" as the crowd surged  toward the grave. People wept and beat their heads and chests with clenched  fists in the Shiite Muslim expression of bereavement.  </P> <P> Soldiers passed concrete slabs over the sea of mourners and laid them across  the grave, a shallow pit in a 100-square-yard section of the vast cemetery  where men who died in the Islamic revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq are  buried.  </P> <P> A crane lowered a metal freight container onto the grave to prevent people from  grabbing handfuls of dirt from it and possibly unearthing the body.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8 Killed in Crush Monday  </P> <P> Guns roared a last salute to the 86-year-old patriarch who toppled a  2,500-year-old monarchy in 1979 and transformed Iran into a militant Islamic  state. For the moment, at least, no special marker was put on the grave.  </P> <P> Eight people were killed Monday in the packed square, some suffocating and  others trampled to death. About 500 mourners were injured or collapsed in  temperatures of 104.  </P> <P> Khomeini died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after intestinal surgery,  without settling the question of who would succeed him.  </P> <P> He left a 29-page "political testament," extracts of which his son read on  Tehran radio Monday.  </P> <P> It contained an attack on the United States, which Khomeini called the "Great  Satan," and said Iran should guard against "conspiracies and plots."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY IN MURDER REVERSED  </P> <P> A divided state Supreme Court today reversed the death sentence of a Riverside  man for a 1981 murder, saying the prosecutor improperly told jurors that the  life-or-death decision was made by the law and the voters, not their own  consciences.  </P> <P> The 4-3 ruling allows a new penalty trial for Lee Farmer Jr. to decide whether  he should be sentenced to death or life without parole. It is the 18th reversal  of a death sentence, and only the second non-unanimous reversal, out of 65  capital cases the court has considered since conservative justices gained a  majority in 1987.  </P></p>

Chen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] London, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China  (CBC) opened a representative office in London Wednesday as part  of its effort to promote financial exchanges between Taiwan and  European countries.    CBC Governor Samuel Shieh flew to London earlier this week  to  preside over the opening ceremony. Many British politicians,  bankers and business executives, including former Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and the deputy governor of the Bank of  England, attended the ceremony.    The new CBC office is located in London's financial district  and adjacent to the Bank of England. It is the CBC's second  overseas office. The bank opened a similar office in New York  last year.    The office will help manage CBC's foreign exchange deposits  in Britain and other European countries as well as strengthen  contacts with major British and other European banks, said Yang  Chin-lung, director of the London office.    London is one of the world's most important financial  capitals. "Our London office is expected to help train qualified  international money managers and accelerate Taiwan's financial  liberalization and internationalization," Yang added.    With the addition of the CBC office, Taiwan now has six  financial institutions in Britain. The Taiwan provincial  government-owned First and Chang Hua Commercial Banks have  opened branches in London. The Bank of Taiwan, Hua Nan  Commercial Bank and Chinatrust Commercial Bank have  representative offices here. Meanwhile, Taipei Bank is  scheduled to open a representative office in London in March.</p>

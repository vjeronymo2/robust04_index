			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Semtex found at IRA breakout jail: Anglo-Irish talks today under fresh pressure Police yesterday discovered three detonators and just over a pound of Semtex explosive at the prison in Cambridgeshire at which five IRA terrorists attempted an armed breakout this month. The discovery - which puts Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, under new pressure and strains the Northern Ireland peace process - came on the eve of the first Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference since last month's IRA ceasefire. Mr Howard last night described the find - inside Whitemoor prison's perimeter wall but outside its special secure unit - as a 'very very grave' matter. The find will cast a shadow over the future of Mr Derek Lewis, prison service director-general. Since the breakout the six high-security prisons in Britain have been undergoing intensive searches by tracker dogs for explosives and guns. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are expected to use today's meeting in London to take stock of the situation in Ulster in the light of recent developments. Mr Spring will have his first meeting with Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, at breakfast today. Dublin is keen for discussions to cover the sensitive subject of north-south economic co-operation and general prospects for the province's economy. The government said last night that six more roads on the Irish border were to be reopened, bringing the total to 16. Mr Major, speaking in South Africa yesterday, ruled out an amnesty for convicted terrorists. Circumstances in Northern Ireland were 'not remotely similar' to those in South Africa, where some prisoners convicted of offences committed before the first all-race elections in April have been released. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will review progress on the framework document which they hope will inject momentum into political talks involving the main political parties in the province. With significant differences understood to remain between the two sides on important constitutional issues, it seems increasingly likely that the framework document will not be published until at least November. Preliminary talks between London and Sinn Fein, to which the government is committed within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence, could start before it appears. Prominent nationalists are said to be keen that round-table talks involving the parties should not resume until Sinn Fein is able to take part. But the longer the document is delayed, the longer the province may have to wait for an end to loyalist violence. Yesterday's Semtex discovery brought sharp political reaction. Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, questioned Mr Howard's competence. He said: 'I hope the prime minister will have him in to talk about what is going on in our prisons.' Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: 'Mr Howard must stop escaping full responsibility for the state of the prisons and make sure the resources are there to carry out the searches which are needed.' Initial reaction from unionists was restrained. Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, said he did not think it would pose a problem for the ceasefire.</p>

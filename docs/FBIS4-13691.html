			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press Review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary entitled "The Israeli Obstacle and  the U.S. Responsibility," AL-THAWRAH says: U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher will arrive in the region on the day  after tomorrow on a new tour whose set objective is to secure a  breakthrough on all tracks of the peace talks.    The paper notes that Christopher lacks optimism about the  outcome of his upcoming tour even before it has begun. The  commentary speculates that this is due to the current situation  of the peace process. As the U.S. Administration knows, this  process is now backed up against an impasse due to its constant  collision with the Israeli position, which rejects the bases and  principles of this process as well as the only objective for  which this process was unleashed; namely, establishing a real  peace based on the literal implementation of the Madrid formula,  the relevant UN resolutions, and the land-for-peace principle.    AL-THAWRAH adds: If we analyze the Israeli position on this  process, we will find that Israel rejects the Madrid formula and  bases in order to replace them with another formula that  conforms to Israel's expansionist objectives after Israel has  discovered that this formula--which seeks a just and  comprehensive peace--conflicts with what Israel wants and seeks  to achieve through the kind of peace it seeks.    Noting the Israeli officials' intransigent positions on  Jerusalem, withdrawal from the Golan, and settlements, the paper  says: These positions irrevocably confirm that Israel is not  seeking a balanced and durable peace; it is only seeking a  partial solution that would maintain its occupation of the Arab  territories or at least the largest portion of these territories.    AL-THAWRAH continues: As long as the set objective of  Christopher's upcoming regional tour is to secure a breakthrough  on all tracks of the peace talks, it is better for this tour to  focus on removing the reasons behind both the stumbling peace  process and the tense regional situation. Naturally, all these  are caused by Israel in a bid to ensure success for its  objectives.    Concluding its commentary, the paper urges the U.S.  Administration to exert the utmost pressures on Israel in order  to make it yield to international will and legitimacy.    In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says:  Christopher has stated that his tour will remarkably routine,  that it will be devoid of any U.S. peace plans, and that he does  not expect it to bring any effective detente. These statements  remove, in advance, any remaining optimism and dash the hopes  for a possible circumvention of the current impasse and deadlock  in the peace process or for activating the talks which have  stumbled due to Israeli intransigence.    The paper adds: Given this new tone, which is in harmony  with both the U.S. statements and shipments of financial,  military, and political aid to Israel--which reached a peak  recently--we must wonder: What interest does peace have in all  this? What interest does the U.S. people have in keeping the  region volatile, subject to setbacks, and mortgaged to Israeli  terrorism and occupation that violates all values and defies all  international norms and laws and human rights?    Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says: As long as U.S.  political decisionmaking is biased toward Israel, and as long as  the Security Council resolutions are not implemented, efforts  will continue to be a waste of time and peace will not be  achieved if the occupied Arab territories and rights are not  regained.</p>

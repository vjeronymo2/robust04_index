			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIRTUOSO CRAFTSMAN;  </P> <P> GUITAR MAKER TAKES TIME TO CREATE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE WORKS OF ART  </P> <P> Danny Ransom spent the first six months of his career tediously making deformed  electric guitars for $10 each.  </P> <P> Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of art, that sell  for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that includes some of the world's  best-known musicians.  </P> <P> The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one guitar body and a  dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a craftsman like Ransom spends  several days, sometimes weeks, on a single instrument.  </P> <P> "These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, 'We build the most  perfect machine in the world,' and most of their stuff is junk," Ransom said.  "I've had to make sure every instrument is right."  </P> <P> Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-making business 13 years. He has made  guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and Alabama. Laurie Anderson  and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer violins he made for a company called  Zeta.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Understands Complexities  </P> <P> Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's Stratocaster-style  guitars last year from a friend. He said Ransom understands the complexities of  the instrument and how the different parts interact.  </P> <P> "He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most guitar makers,"  Kaiser said. "It's just a versatile, expressive instrument."  </P> <P> An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-strewn studio adjacent  to "Real Guitars," a collector's guitar store in the city's South of Market  district.  </P> <P> There was a time when Ransom was low man on the guitar-maker totem pole. He  first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now defunct, initially  making what he calls "the worst garbage."  </P> <P> Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff workers had a habit of taking  LSD on the job and "talking to the tools."  </P> <P> "The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was brought in,"  Ransom recalled. "They stuck me in a room with a bunch of tools, handed me a  guitar and said, 'Make these.' "  </P> <P> His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping $10 each. They  were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bursts Into Flames  </P> <P> One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first time he had  completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The final touches required  a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided to show him how it was done.  </P> <P> "At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals burning on it,"  Ransom said. "I said, 'Do you know what you're doing?' He said, 'Shut up, of  course I do.' Then the glue line started to lift off and the thing burst into  flames right in front of us.  </P> <P> "If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. . . . This is like  watching your child burn."  </P> <P> Things started to pick up after other workers began teaching him. Ransom said  the difference between a good guitar and a bad guitar lies in the details, such  as the curves in the wood and placement of the finger board and joints.  </P> <P> "There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail. The better you  can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get at whatever you do in  terms of craft. That's really what I got from some of the people who helped me  early on."  </P> <P> His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made mostly of  alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards, armed with density and  moisture meters, to find the right wood. Soft woods, such as mahogony, tend to  give off more mid-range sound while harder woods, such as poplar, produce the  higher, treble sounds.  </P> <P> He has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash from  Louisiana.  </P> <P> Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, cuts them out on a  bandsaw, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on a pin  router. Finally, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows and bellys  are cut by hand.  </P> <P> As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s, Ransom had planned  to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his experience working with wood was  in making matchstick holders and other "goofy little things" when he was a Cub  Scout.  </P> <P> Although he is an admitted "Deadhead" -- Grateful Dead fan -- Ransom is not  much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset than a liability for a  maker of electric guitars and violins.  </P> <P> "The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but aren't players tend  to be much more versatile in their building and are much more involved in the  quality of their instrument, not just the sound or the playability, but the  overall quality."  </P></p>

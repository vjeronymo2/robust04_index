			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "CiU Believes That Results Force </F> It To Continue Support for Government to Even Greater Extent"]    [Text] The Convergence and Union (CiU) liaison committee  yesterday expressed its great satisfaction at the results  achieved by the coalition in the elections to the European  Parliament and reaffirmed its view that it is not necessary for  Felipe Gonzalez to submit a confidence motion following the  defeat of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party [PSOE] and the  People's Party's [PP] victory. To this effect, Miquel Roca said  at the end of the committee meeting that an end must be put to  the speculation about a possible confidence motion or an early  general election: "People cannot continue to speculate with a  constant electoral atmosphere," asserted Roca, for whom  yesterday's result seems to have no consequence for  parliamentary support for the government.    As Jordi Pujol had already stated Sunday [12 Jun] evening,  the CiU leaders yesterday assessed the results as a clear  endorsement of the nationalist coalition's support for the  government, and Roca even asserted that because of "our voters'  mandate, as reflected in the results," CiU "is now much more  obliged than before" to continue the same state policy. "The  PSOE will do whatever it thinks fit, but we have already  confirmed our intention to continue to support the government,"  Roca continued. Nevertheless, in his opinion, CiU's support  depends on "the government's maintaining its intention to  strengthen the economic policy that we have promoted and its way  of tackling autonomy policy," he said. Roca added that the  agreement with the government on autonomy policy is at the  "final stage, not just of negotiation but of finalization," and  he hopes it will be completed within the next few days.    The view that Sunday's results endorse CiU's political  activity in both the European and state spheres and in Catalonia  was one of the points discussed by the liaison committee, which  also emphasized that the coalition has achieved its aims, which  were to win in Catalonia for the first time in other than  autonomous community elections and to win back the third seat  that it held between 1987 and 1989. The liaison committee also  considered the fact that CiU's victory has a balanced  distribution throughout Catalonia, since the coalition prevailed  in the areas of Tarragona, Lleida, Girona, and Barcelona.    The victory with a lead of almost 9 percent over the  Socialist Party of Catalonia in the city of Barcelona is of a  special nature for CiU, which Miquel Roca highlighted in saying  that following this result "we have the greatest hope and  confidence of success" in next year's municipal elections. Both  Roca and Democratic Union of Catalonia [UDC] leader Josep Antoni  Duran Lleida expressed the desire for the pact between the two  parties for these local elections to be signed before the  summer, although some sectors of Democratic Convergence of  Catalonia [CDC] would prefer an internal debate on relations  with Union to be conducted before the agreement is concluded.    The disagreements between the two parties on the  organization  of the campaign, which Union made clear and which culminated in  the angry walkout by all its leaders at the end of Sunday's news  conference, at which Duran Lleida was not called on to speak and  at which some Christian Democratic leaders had problems in  gaining entry to the hall, were raised formally by Union at the  liaison committee meeting. The two parties decided to draw up  reports separately and then call a restricted meeting in order  to study them, but while UDC wants this to be done this week,  CDC does not feel the same urgency. Convergence sources told  this newspaper that there was not the slightest mistake in the  campaign, contrary to what Union believes, and attributed any  possible shortcoming to the large number of meetings which CiU  held during that time.    Duran Lleida explained his sudden walkout from the  election headquarters by stating that "if the interpretation of  the results was made by the CDC secretary general, thanks were  given by the CDC candidate, and the political analysis was made  by the CDC chairman, it is clear that it was a very appropriate  news conference for a party but not for a coalition." Duran  Lleida, who stated a few days ago that he felt "uncomfortable"  in having to support the Socialist Party, said yesterday that  his stance had not changed, "although I can feel rather more  pleased following the victory in the European elections," but he  demanded a gesture by the PSOE to show that it wishes to  continue to have CiU's support.    Jordi Pujol, who would make no statement at the end of the  liaison committee meeting, later asserted in an interview  broadcast on TV3 at 1200 that the People's Party "cannot afford  the luxury of lapsing into fanaticism, intransigence, and  anti-Catalanism," because this would have "unforeseeable  consequences" for the country, referring to the insults against  the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier made by  PP supporters celebrating the conservative party's victory in  Madrid. "The language, culture, and whatever affects  Catalonia's national identity take priority for CiU, and  everybody should know that we cannot be counted on for anything  without taking this into account," Pujol stated in the interview.    Despite this, Pujol expressed his desire and confidence that  the People's Party leadership will lay down a policy totally  different from what could be deduced from those shouts: "I  expect People's Party policy to be dictated not by a few  hotheaded and anti-Catalan people but by people with a sense of  responsibility," he said, asserting that the party "will be in  the Spanish Government some day or other." He also reiterated  that CiU suffered no erosion in these elections because of its  support for the Socialist government, and that "if it depends on  us and if the policy we demand in the economic and autonomy  spheres is pursued, we will maintain our line."</p>

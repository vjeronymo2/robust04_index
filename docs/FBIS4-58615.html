We now have $8 to $10 billion in  commitments to other countries. Isn't it reasonable for us to  take another look at the nation's existing commitments and for  those that are appropriate to be eliminated? Then we can carry  out these important projects on which we are at the contract  stage, such as Karun 4, on which we have advanced to the  contract stage with the Japanese.    It is a contract with a very suitable profit rate whose  payments begin after the project goes into operation, and the  amount of the payments is quite small. They must also import the  technology. If we implement this project alone, it needs more  than 2.4 billion, while we have set aside only a total of 2.4  billion for all four projects.    He then continued: This is not a new commitment. For  example,  in some commitments goods have not been imported, and even  though they are not imported and no problem arises, we eliminate  them. Therefore, all deputies desiring to limit commitments and  improve on commitments must vote for it.  <H5>  Engineer Nabavi's Views </H5>   During a speech Engineer Nabavi discussed Nowbakht's  remarks.  He said: If Mr. Nowbakht had given an example of these potential  commitments and purchases that were eliminated, we would have  accepted what he said. These purchases go through various  phases, and it is not practical to eliminate or convert these  potential commitments.    In the same regard he added: Someone went and got a loan  from  the bank. He paid the profit on the loan and all the money for  his imported goods. Now the banks are not willing to give this  money back if should be willing to cancel these purchases.    Then there were efforts for several months to stop potential  purchases, and so far there has been no result, and the  likelihood of a result is quite small. Havardi made a list of  things that could be stopped, but he saw that the goods have  already been imported.    Therefore these new finances will be added to our foreign  exchange commitments.    If we do not want our commitments to be more than 1.9  billion, although these projects are quite important, due to the  many commitments that have been made, instead of doing more  financing and buy-backs, the emphasis has been laid on usance  and short-term purchases, and now the country is in a situation  with heavy commitments. Now that they are being refinanced, when  these new loans come due in a few years it will be at the same  time our refinance payments are due, and at that time we will be  faced with about $20 to $15 billion in commitments that are due.  Therefore these financing arrangements are being added to our  foreign exchange commitments.  <H5>  Mr. Mirvalad's Views </H5>   Mr. Mirvalad, expert on the commission, discussed the  creation of new foreign exchange commitments. He said: One of  the most controversial issues discussed in our commission was  this very Paragraph B, Note 29. The Plan and Budget Commission  is fully aware of foreign commitments. We know that the very  important projects must be implemented, and some of them have  been written up as contracts.    The discussed the importance of these projects. He said: We  agreed on two issues, one that the nation's commitments must not  increase beyond a ceiling of $1.6 billion, and the other that  these projects are very important and cannot be eliminated. The  commission therefore authorized the government to transfer  existing foreign exchange commitments until the end of the year  1372.  <H5>  Engineer Jalali's Views </H5>   One proposal was to delete the phrase "and implementation of  the project must be done so that the annual repayments on both  the capital investment and related expenses be done after the  project goes into operation" from Row 3, Paragraph B of Note 29.  Concerning this, Mr. Jalali said: In this paragraph we did not  make any request to increase numbers in terms of foreign  exchange. This is merely the deletion of a phrase that creates  problems with the implementation of projects to develop  sugarcane.    He added: As you know, the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, signed by 117 nations, removes the subsidies on  agricultural goods. Therefore, if we do not have the necessary  investment for agricultural projects, in the not-too-distant  future we will have to put all the nation's foreign exchange  revenues into the crops the country needs.  <H5>  Engineer Nabavi's Views </H5>   Continuing, Engineer Nabavi spoke in opposition to the above  proposal. He said: If we did not have the bitter experience of  outstanding debts, there would be no problem for Mr. Jalali to  be here defending the removal of this restriction.    He added: The repayments begin after operation begins. This  is the minimum restriction that must be used. Otherwise, it is  like the situation we are facing. That is, payments pile up and  the country does not have the ability to make them and the  country's political and economic prestige is lost. That is, you  want them to go and make foreign commitments without  restrictions or requirements, without any thought about paying  them back when they come due.  <H5>  Note 30 </H5>   A - The projects having to do with reconstruction  development  projects in the war-stricken areas in Part 3, B, Supplement 1 of  this law, as recommended by the executive organization and  approved by the relevant province reconstruction staff, are  designated for the cities and rural areas under construction,  for consumption after the exchange of agreements with the  province plan and budget organization.    B - The R320 billion in development credits in this law will  be usable to pay for the losses of those who suffered damages  from the war, those who suffered losses due to systematic enemy  fire or at the hands of the counterrevolutionaries, to pay for  the losses individuals caused by the above causes, and also to  pay the difference between the profit and the earnings on the  loans granted in this regard.    J: For all the means credits in this note, veterans,  families  of martyrs and former prisoners of war have priority.    D: Supervision by the deputies from the cities under  reconstruction (war-stricken) of the implementation of the  provision of this note will be done at the province and  municipal centers.    The executive guidelines for this note will be prepared as  jointly recommended by the Reconstruction Staff, the Ministry of  the Interior and the Plan and Budget Organization, with the  approval of the Council of Ministers.  <H5>  Note 31 </H5>   The court costs for cases arising from Article 86 of the  Guidelines Law for Civil Proceedings on Immovable Assets, in the  event that the sum demanded is less than the reasonable price,  will be based on the reasonable price and if the sum demanded is  greater than the reasonable price, the the court costs will be  collected based on the sum demanded. From the point of view of  competence, however, the price demanded is the same as what is  determined in the court.  <H5>  Note 32 </H5>   The Iran Fisheries Corporation is authorized, with approval  from the Economic Council, to deposit R3 billion from the sale  of its assets which it is transferring to the people, into the  Treasury's general revenues account.

The aforementioned 1 percent of the bills of lading will be  considered tax-exempt.    J: Based on Article 24 of the International Transportation  and Shipping Agreement for Roads in Iran and Turkey, the  Ministry of Roads and Transportation is authorized, in  implementing Paragraph 5 of the aforementioned agreement, to  collect R5 billion and deposit it into the nation's general  revenues account.

Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani, attending the Majles as the  government's representative, defended the new foreign exchange  commitments given in Paragraph B, and in part of his speech,  opposing the opponents, he said: "One cannot manage the country  with slogans."    In a guideline memo, Engineer Bahonar asked permission to  answer him on this point. During a speech he said: At the  beginning of my speech I said: The government's performance in  the economic sector in the First Five-Year Plan was something  miraculous, and I believe in it. I said that these commitments  are not significant numbers at all compared to our gross  national product. I said the gentlemen are not taking one point  into consideration, which is that the world magnifies our  problems. They said we have turned the Bahai cemetery into a  public park, and therefore human rights are not observed in  Iran. If we owe a dollar in the country, they exaggerate it  1,000 times. Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani said: "One cannot manage the  country with slogans, we went and built bridges, roads and other  things." We know all these things much better than he does. We  have spoken and given speeches. We also have his belief, and in  practice we have shown how steadfast we are and that we follow  the government of Mr Hashemi and we support him. However, if we  object to the performance of one or two organizations, this  can't be called sloganeering (shouts of approval from the  deputies).</p>

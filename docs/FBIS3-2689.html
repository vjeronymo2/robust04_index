			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Shangzhi (2621 1424 1807) and He Ping (0149 </F> 1627): "To Be Pragmatic Is Important -- An Account of Listening  to the Government Work Report as Visitors"]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (XINHUA) -- Applause again sounded  in the Great Hall of the People.    As the spring breeze is blowing over the vast land of China,  Premier Li Peng, faced by the deputies to the Second Session of  the National People's Congress [NPC], once again walked to the  platform of the 10,000-seat auditorium to begin delivering his  seventh government work report since his assumption of the  premiership.    His report went from reviewing the domestic work last year  to  spelling out the basic principles for work this year; from  maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy to accelerating the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure; from developing science and  technology, education, and culture to strengthening the building  of socialist democracy and the legal system; and from promoting  the peaceful reunification of the motherland to expounding on  China's foreign affairs work....    Condensed in his 16,000-character report were the part  reviewing the domestic work of the past year, the part on future  prospects, the part on domestic and foreign policies, and the  part on principles and tasks.    People will notice, through a comparison, that this year's  government work report, because it concentrated on the main  points and was concise, was the shortest government work report  in the past 15 years.    A person in charge of the government work report drafting  group explained the reason: One of the reasons for shortening  the work report is that the national major policies and  principles have been clearly defined. In particular, the basic  principles for party and national work this year mapped out by  the party Central Committee, as well as the general situation  characterized by "seizing opportunities, deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and  maintaining stability," provided a good foundation for the  drafting of the work report. Therefore, the government work  report, which was more concise than past reports, while focusing  on the implementation of the important guidelines of the Central  Committee, concentrated on the major tasks to be carried out by  the State Council this year. It did not list the 1993  achievements of each ministry and its tasks for 1994.    Although the work report was concise, it was rich in  content.  On the basis of the basic principles for party and national  work and in the interest of the whole party and national work,  the report, from the angle of government work, put forward a  series of measures concerning the correct handling of the  relationships between reform, development, and stability.    -- "Development is the last word." Development requires a  rational growth rate. Neither an excessively high growth rate  nor an excessively low growth rate can realize our projected  targets. In his report, Premier Li Peng proposed that the gross  domestic product will increase by 9 percent this year. At the  same time, he stressed the "importance of raising economic  performance." Authoritative sources commented that this is a  positive and steady growth rate. This shows that the government  is becoming more mature in understanding the laws governing  economic development.    For today's China, whether the economy can develop  significantly depends, in the final analysis, on the intensity,  depth, and breadth of reform and opening up, as well as on the  acceleration of the drive for building a socialist market  economic system. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee produced a  general blueprint and an action program for this purpose. The  government work report, therefore, did not simply repeat this  point but highlighted tasks in six areas in light of the demands  outlined in the government work report, the distinctive aspects  of this year's situation, and the reform plans, which had been  basically introduced, on financial, taxation, banking,  investment, and foreign trade systems. It also urged  governments at all levels to "devote greater efforts to reform,"  to combine breakthroughs in key areas with package reform, and  to make substantial progress in reform of the economic system.    Whether in reform or development, we cannot proceed without  a  stable and relaxed environment; otherwise, discussion of  anything is out of the question. It is evident that the many  reform and development measures enumerated in the report are  sound strategies for maintaining stability because they are  designed to control inflation and the scale of investment, to  appropriately increase the purchase prices of grain and cotton,  to alleviate peasants' burdens, to increase peasants' incomes by  all means, to relieve all state-owned enterprises of their  obligations to contribute to construction funds for key energy  and transportation projects and to regulatory budget funds, to  allocate special funds for reorganizing bankrupt enterprises and  for reassigning their workers and staff members, to control  price increases and stabilize foodstuffs prices in urban and  rural areas, to continue to battle corruption in a deep-going  and sustained manner, and to intensify efforts to improve public  order in a comprehensive way. All this will serve the sole  purpose of creating a good environment for reform and  development.    Reform, development, and stability are complementary, and  none of them is dispensable. This is the result of summing up  and reviewing our past experience, as well as a six-character  dictum for carrying out all of our tasks successfully.    As in the case of government work, the report reflected a  practical style throughout.    -- In the past, any discussion of economic work invariably  entailed an attempt to use increases in output value as an  important criterion for evaluating performance. This year's  report, however, replaced the phrase "output value" with the  formulation "added value."    Authoritative people are of the opinion that the main  difference between the two phrases lies in the fact that the  phrase "added value" excludes the prices of intermediary inputs,  such as raw and semifinished materials and energy. This helps  avoid such deficiencies as the repetitive calculation and  transfer of prices, overcomes the tendency to unduly stress  output value, and places greater emphasis on efficiency in our  country's economic development. Moreover, it reflects the end  result of social production more truthfully.    --While realistically outlining our achievements, the  report frankly pointed out shortcomings and inadequacies in our  work and truthfully set forth contradictions and difficulties:  The investment scale for fixed assets is overextended;  commodity prices have increased by a relatively large margin;  the problem of an irrational economic structure remains salient;  some state-owned large and medium enterprises face considerable  difficulties in production and management; public order in some  localities is bad; the fight against social ills is not forceful  enough; a handful of government functionaries engage in corrupt  practices such as embezzlement, bribery, favoritism, and fraud;  and formalism and bureaucratism exist in government  departments...[ellipses as received]    Only a people's government has the courage and magnanimity  to  confront deficiencies and acknowledge difficulties instead of  eschewing problems and disguising contradictions; only a  people's government can improve its work, promote what is  beneficial, and eliminate what is harmful with the support and  under the supervision of the general public in order to better  serve the people.    -- Compared to previous reports, this year's report placed  greater emphasis on spiritual civilization. Past government  work reports subsumed science and technology, education, and  culture on the one hand, and democracy and the legal system on  the other, either under the section dealing with economic  construction or the section dealing with social development.  This year's report specifically discussed issues in these two  areas under two independent sections, thus giving greater weight  to such issues than in the past. This shows that in keeping the  general situation under control, government departments place a  greater premium on the coordinated development of the economic  base and the superstructure, paying more attention to overall  social progress. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic concept of  "carrying out two tasks simultaneously and attaching equal  importance to both" is being implemented further.    After the drafting work began in mid-December of last year,  the government work report submitted to the Second Session of  the Eighth NPC for examination and approval was discussed and  revised many times by the State Council's executive meetings and  by meetings of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and  its Standing Committee. Various localities and departments, as  well as people in all circles, were canvassed extensively.  Premier Li Peng even held five rounds of informal discussions  to hear the views of officials in charge of various democratic  parties; people with no party affiliation; people in scientific  and technological, educational, and cultural circles; and some  comrades from public security and judicial departments at the  grass-roots level, enterprises, and institutions. The range of  opinions canvassed was broader than before. People can see that  the party's fine tradition of promoting democracy and drawing on  all useful ideas is being expanded during the new period.    At the end of its delivery, the report was greeted with  warm,  prolonged applause from deputies, who represent 56  nationalities, in a gesture of trust and support.</p>

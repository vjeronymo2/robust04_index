			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / People: Brian Emerson Brian Emerson, who retired as finance director of the Stock Exchange in 1986 after a varied financial career, died last week after suffering a heart attack at Heathrow airport. Former colleagues describe him as a highly-regarded man with a strong character. He was a powerful leader who developed many good ideas and drove them through to completion. Born in 1926, Emerson took his articles in 1942 at Barton Mayhew, an accountancy firm which ultimately merged to become part of Ernst &amp; Young. He joined Unilever as a systems auditor in the early 1950s, and moved on to Beecham and then PA, the management consultants. During the late 1960s and early 1970s he all but created the management consultancy division at Arthur Young, the accountancy firm which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, and became the division's first partner. He went on to join Barclays Bank, and then in 1976 became the first head of finance at the Stock Exchange before retiring ten years later. ***** Michael Dowdall, is to become chairman of Geest, the UK foods company, in May next year when Leonard van Geest, son of the founder, retires. In the meantime, Dowdall, already a non-executive, becomes deputy chairman. Dowdall spent most of his working life at Unilever where he was primarily responsible for the worldwide detergent sector. According to one analyst, 'he is good solid reliable chap, with excellent European contacts, who has been around for a long time.' Indeed, David Sugden, Geest's chief executive, says Dowdall is expected to help Geest expand its European network. Dowdall, 62, is also a non-executive of BPB Industries; chairman of Eemland Holdings NV, the holding company for Wilkinson Sword, and a main board director of the NFU Mutual.</p>

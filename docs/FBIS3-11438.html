He also doubted the United States' will and  desire to restore democracy in Haiti.    Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was participating last week in  the meeting of the Black Caucus, thinks the United States is  supporting the authors of the coup d'etat. How can one claim the  U.S. Embassy was not involved in the coup d'etat? asked the  president-in-exile.    Aristide feels President Clinton still has a chance to  prove,  by restoring democracy to Haiti, that the United States was not,  or is no longer, involved in the coup.    It should be recalled that Father Aristide made those  statements in Miami where he was the guest of the Black Caucus  at its meeting. At that forum, the president-in-exile severely  criticized U.S. policy on Haitian refugees, calling it racist.  Rothschild Francois has filed the following report:    [Begin recording] [Francois] Six months away from the third  anniversary of his forced departure into exile, Jean-Bertrand  Aristide seems to be beginning to lose patience and mostly to  doubt Washington's will to favor his return to Port-au-Prince.  Speaking over the weekend at the meeting of the Black Caucus in  Miami, the Haitian president did not hesitate to criticize the  Clinton administration's policies on Haiti.    Jean-Bertrand Aristide thinks the Americans are supporting  the military who overthrew him in September 1991. Aristide  said, further, that the Haitian people set great store by the  democratic principle and would like for peace to spread  throughout their country.    Without making direct reference to the international  community, Aristide invites the Haitian people to mistrust those  who, according to him, support criminals while claiming to want  to defend democracy.    [Aristide, in Creole] People who claim that they are  defending democracy and who, until now, have not done what they  said they would do, are showing that they do not respect their  word.    We ourselves have kept our word. We will continue doing  everything possible for democracy to return home and certainly,  it must end.    [Francois] During the meeting of the Black Caucus in Miami,  President Aristide hailed the support received to date from the  Black Caucus. The president also encouraged the initiative by  the members of the Black Caucus, who intend to intervene with  the Clinton administration so that it adopts a more aggressive  policy against the Haitian military. In his intervention before  the Black Caucus, the president also brought the discussion to  bear on the matter of the boat people.    Aristide sharply denounced U.S. policy toward the Haitian  refugees. It is a racist policy, says the president, who reminds  everybody that Cubans are welcomed in the United States while  Haitians are turned back. Aristide tries to compare this  situation to a house on fire: Some of the people inside the  house are trying to escape, while the police are forcing them to  return to the house, which is burning. That is the way the  president described it.    The exiled president stated that a solution to the problem  of  the boat people necessarily entails his return to the National  Palace. Furthermore, Jean-Bertrand Aristide asked for a total  embargo in order to force the military to accept his returning  to Port-au-Prince -- a request rejected by Washington.    The Clinton government clearly pointed out that just  reinforcing the sanctions cannot contribute to solving the  crisis.    Washington requests the president to appoint a prime  minister  and to support implementation of the parliamentarians' plan. To  date, President Aristide has refused to go along.    After a year of collaboration deemed good, the health of the  relations between President Aristide and the Clinton  administration is today hit by an epidemic of disagreements.    Meanwhile, in situ, nothing has really changed since the  legislators passed their resolution for a solution to the  crisis: The Senate is still in crisis; the military are  refraining from taking a stand regarding the legislators' plan;  the national economy is plummeting.    Meanwhile, one thing is certain: The word hope has begun to  disappear from Haitians' vocabulary. [end recording]</p>

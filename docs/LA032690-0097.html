			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA SYNAGOGUE, CHURCH DENOUNCE ANTI-SEMITIC FLYERS  </P> <P> Authorities today are seeking the identity of those responsible for  distributing hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers with a "Kill Every Jew" message  found near a Yorba Linda synagogue and a Protestant church over the weekend.  </P> <P> The flyers were found Sunday morning littering the neighborhood surrounding the  Chabad Center of North County, an ultra-Orthodox synagogue, and the Yorba Linda  United Methodist Church.  </P> <P> Police and church officials said this morning the flyers were "falsely and  fraudulently" attributed to the "Methodist fellowship."  </P> <P> "They were probably seeking credibility," said Brea police Lt. Tom Christian.  "They were probably trying to give somebody reason to think that they should  read it."  </P> <P> Church and synagogue officials condemned the flyers after a meeting today at  the Chabad Center. "This is a non-event," said Rabbi David Eliezrie. "One  person must have photocopied a piece of paper. . . . It is not a problem for  ourselves or our sister community."  </P> <P> The Rev. Kenneth Criswell, pastor at the United Methodist Church, called the  flyers "terrible and cruel."  </P></p>

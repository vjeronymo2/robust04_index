			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Squeezing videos down to size A high-definition digital videocassette recorder that uses cassettes about three-quarters the size of a standard VHS tape and has a playback time of two hours has been developed by NEC of Japan. Previously, digital VCR gave high-quality recording but lacked superior compression technology, so the machines were large and cumbersome. NEC's new Hi-Vision digital VCR uses a picture compression technique that achieves very high compression rates without spoiling the picture; a magnetic head for which NEC claims the highest recording density in the industry; and new ultra-thin (11 micron) tape. In combination, these technologies compress the signal to about one/fifth the conventional rate. NEC sees applications in the home and for large-screen displays. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6511.</p>

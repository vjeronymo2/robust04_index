			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ELKS VOTE TO KEEP BARRING WOMEN BUT EASE THE RULES FOR MINORITIES  </P> <P> Elks club members from across the nation voted today against allowing women to  join their fraternal organization but in favor of a membership rule that could  make it easier for nonwhite men to join.  </P> <P> Donald Dapelo, the newly installed Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks, said the  vote against admitting women was by a show of hands and there was no count. "I  wouldn't say it was close, not at all," Dapelo said. "I'd say it was  overwhelmingly defeated."  </P> <P> In St. George, Utah, a woman who was rejected for Elks membership filed a sex  discrimination lawsuit in 1987 that is still pending.  </P> <P> Approved was the proposal to eliminate a rule allowing any three members of an  Elks lodge to reject, or "blackball," a prospective member. Some said that rule  made it harder for minorities to join the organization. Under the new rule, a  two-thirds majority of a lodge's members can approve a new member.  </P> <P> Passage of a resolution to do away with the "three blackball" rule was urged by  the Lompoc, Calif., Elks Lodge after two black applicants were rejected.  </P></p>

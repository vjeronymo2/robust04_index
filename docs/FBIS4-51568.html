			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Khmer Rouge's Game"] </F>   [Text] People still well remember that on 22 April 1994,  Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK]-Khmer Rouge [KR], sent a letter to His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk Varaman stressing that, in line with the  profound aspiration of our entire nation and people, the PDK  would like to express full support for the proposal, the product  of His Majesty's profound insight, to organize a roundtable  meeting for peace and national reconciliation.    But hardly had the ink on this letter dried up than Khieu  Samphan sent another lengthy and detailed letter to the king  expressing concern over security for himself and his delegation  during their trip to Phnom Penh to attend the roundtable meeting  under the king's chairmanship, to be held in the Royal Palace  from 2 to 7 May.    On 27 April, the British REUTER news agency excerpted the  statement of a Khmer Rouge representative [words indistinct], in  which he said shamelessly that the Khmer Rouge would seize  Sisophon and Poipet next month. This man stressed further that  the Khmer Rouge would start moving to gradually seize positions  until they had total control of Poipet and Sisophon.    The above cases clearly attest that the Khmer Rouge have  continued to play their old trick of catching a fish with two  hands [words indistinct] won over the republic regime of Lon Nol  in 1975. This game is played by holding negotiations while  launching attacks or holding negotiations in order to launch  attacks; and by holding negotiations in order to postpone any  solution and to facilitate attacks aimed at seizing as many  positions as possible. (?In other words), they have striven to  attack in order to bargain on the negotiating table. This is  why, although the Royal Government has made many concessions,  the Khmer Rouge have stubbornly sought one pretext after another  in order to prolong the solution to the problem and enable them  to sell logs and gems and gain money to buy weapons for storage  to serve their guerrilla war. However, after His Majesty the  King issued a statement on 22 April calling for a roundtable  meeting, whether they liked it or not, the Khmer Rouge pretended  to support this idea. Later, they have sought pretexts to foil  the roundtable meeting, or at least to delay it or move it from  one place to another.    The main pretext raised by the Khmer Rouge is the so-called  issue of their personal security [words indistinct]. In fact,  it is widely known that Khieu Samphan's security can not be the  cause. This is because the security of the Khmer Rouge  representative in Phnom Penh is fully guaranteed.    On the night of 25 April, His Excellency Ek Sereivoat said  that the security for Khieu Samphan has been arranged very  thoroughly: that is, as soon as he comes out of the plane, he  will get into a car. The well-wishers, including journalists  will not be allowed to get near him.    Observers of Cambodia have also pointed out that Khieu  Samphan has raised the issue of security in order to avoid  coming to attend the roundtable, scheduled to be held from 2 to  7 May. In fact, this is just a pretext.    Our people wonder why if the Khmer Rouge are patriots and  really want to solve the Cambodian problem through political  means, have they hesitated to come to Phnom Penh? Since they  dare not come even to attend the roundtable, what can they do?  If the roundtable meeting is held somewhere other than Phnom  Penh; and if through that meeting, the Khmer Rouge are given  some posts in the Royal Government, will they dare to come to  work in Phnom Penh? Do the Khmer Rouge know how to carry out  the role of officials only in the jungle? And must their  meetings be held only in foreign countries?    Due to all these matters, our people are not very optimistic  about this roundtable meeting. And even if the meeting is  successful, the implementation of the spirit of this roundtable  meeting cannot be guaranteed. This is because everyone knows  very well that so far the Khmer Rouge have never respected  anything, such as the Paris agreement, that they have signed.    Our people persistently ask everyone to stop playing the  Khmer Rouge's game.</p>

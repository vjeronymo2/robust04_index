			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: British Foreign Secretary welcomes Egyptian President Mubarak FOREIGN secretary Douglas Hurd (left) welcomes Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak who arrived in Britain yesterday on a four-day visit to discuss ways to revive flagging Middle East peace talks. An Egyptian embassy spokesman said the president, who flies to the US on Saturday for his first meeting with president Bill Clinton, was likely to ask prime minister John Major today to do all he can to help the Arab-Israeli peace talks get back on track. The foreign office said the government was trying 'all avenues to get the sides back together again,' adding that Mr Mubarak was an 'influential player'. A new round of the talks, sponsored by the US and Russia, is due to start on April 20.</p>

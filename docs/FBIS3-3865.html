Through their mediation, they have prevented 76 crimes or  suicides, which might have cost 22 lives, the officials said.    According to the officials, some 35 percent of these  disputes  were related to matrimonial or love affairs, from which quarrels  easily arise and worsen into crimes.    The officials said disputes arising from unreasonable  behavior in house decorating, noise from home karaoke  performances and other entertainments also accounted for a large  share of the mediators' work.    While applying traditional morals and laws, the officials  said, the mediators also used psychological skills in clamping  down on short-tempered displays by those involved in quarrels.    The mediators also helped resident committees organize  entertainment, sports or mere talks between neighbors to promote  understanding, harmony and friendship in communities, the  officials added.</p>

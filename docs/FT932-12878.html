			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Pay deals of 9% may undermine militancy TWO LEADING German trade unions yesterday announced agreement on 9 per cent pay rises for their east German members, just as tens of thousands of engineering and steel workers started voting in a strike ballot on whether to reject a similar offer. The agreements by the chemical workers' union, IG Chemie, for 5,000 rubber workers, and by the banking and retail workers' union, HBV, for 300,000 shop workers, are likely to undermine the militant campaign by IG Metall, the giant engineering union. Steel and engineering workers were being asked to vote for all-out strike action yesterday in protest at the unilateral abrogation of their pay deal by Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers, which says it will force many eastern members into bankruptcy. The details emerged as Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a call for urgent negotiations in the engineering dispute, and then hastily withdrew it, apparently for fear of being seen to interfere in the wage-bargaining system. The rubber workers' deal is the most embarrassing for the engineers, because they have agreed to renegotiate a step-by-step contract for wage equalisation with the west, and settle for a relatively modest 9 per cent. The shopworkers, working in a sector which is far more resilient than manufacturing, have accepted 9 per cent, but it takes them to 86 per cent of western pay levels - above the 82 per cent level the engineering workers are seeking. The engineers have so far refused to accept a significant slowdown in their step-by-step contract providing for pay to rise from 71 to 82 per cent of western levels this year (equivalent to 15.5 per cent on current rates), and reach 100 per cent next April. They have rejected a 9 per cent offer from Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' organisation. The engineers' pay deal was originally the model for most east German industrial workers, but the collapse of manufacturing industry in the region, and fears over excessive unit wage costs, have persuaded others to slow down the equalisation process. Voting in the strike ballot began briskly yesterday, with IG Metall officials insisting they would win the 75 per cent Yes vote necessary to call an all-out stoppage.</p>

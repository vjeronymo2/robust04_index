			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: Image, not city, is tarnished Sir, In your editorial, 'Tired of life' (September 11), you state that in the BTA's annual report I 'trotted out the usual complaints about a litter-strewn, tired and tarnished city'. This was not my complaint. My comments referred to London's image, which I said 'regrettably, has become more than a little tired, even tarnished, in recent years' and announced a major campaign which seeks to put this right. It is the BTA's job to promote Britain in overseas markets and we naturally do all we can to present a favourable picture of our most popular destination. This is why, together with the London Tourist Board and industry partners, we are launching a campaign in the US which will highlight what our great capital has to offer. But promotion has to be matched to performance and we cannot afford to be complacent. We have to listen to what visitors tell us. London still has its share of problems and we have called for a determined effort to tackle them. We hope Londoners will respond, because the income from tourism, some Pounds 4.5bn a year, is vitally important to all. William Davis, chairman, British Tourist Authority, 24 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0ET</p>

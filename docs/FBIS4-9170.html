			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said on Thursday [21 April] that  the latest statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning  the Bosnian crisis was an escalation of the war of words at the  very least and could not help put the peace efforts back on the  negotiation rails. Speaking on Belgrade Radio, Jovanovic  described Clinton's statement as "unfortunate and unwelcome in  the extreme."    Clinton on Wednesday announced a new U.S. plan for Bosnia-  Herzegovina, which envisages for massive NATO air strikes  against Bosnian Serb positions, command points, supply lines and  warehouses, and a tightening of international sanctions against  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro).    Jovanovic expressed special concern at the emergence of  outdated thinking about sanctions as profitable in dealing with  the crisis in former Yugoslavia, although so far they have been  counterproductive.    The U.N. Security Council has clamped comprehensive and  mandatory sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in  the war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina among the local  Moslems, Serbs and Croats.    "We can only guess at the reasons for the punitive policy  being pursued blindly and obstinately when it neither benefits  America nor brings a prospect of ending the Bosnian war and  establishing peace," Jovanovic said. "We wish to believe that  this is the last gasp of a policy which has failed, and that the  latest tough stance towards us will be followed by a more  rational period in the U.S. policy, which will signal its  joining the rational forces on which the world can rely in the  efforts to put the final stop to the Bosnian war," Jovanovic  said.</p>

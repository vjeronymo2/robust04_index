			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE OVER SITE OF OLD HIGH SCHOOL MIRRORS TENSIONS IN MOORPARK  </P> <P> Teresa Godinez is so fed up with Moorpark officials that she has asked a lawyer  about suing the school district and the city to force a decision on the fate of  a 70-year-old high school that closed nearly a year ago.  </P> <P> But the city and school district may beat Godinez to the punch and file suits  against each other if they cannot reach a compromise soon on what to do with  the school's 26-acre campus, officials said.  </P> <P> In a dispute that reflects tension between old and new residents of this  rapidly growing city of 24,900, the two entities have been unable to agree for  the past year on how the property on Casey Road should be zoned or on the price  of a portion that Godinez and other residents want for a public park.  </P> <P> The district says the 8 acres the city wants for the downtown park are worth  $980,000 -- about three times more than the city's offer of $319,750.  </P> <P> While no one is eager to have the issue settled in court -- Godinez said her  group has decided to try lobbying politicians before suing -- frustration and  bitterness are growing.  </P> <P> "We'll use the court system if we have to," City Councilman Scott Montgomery  said.  </P> <P> The problem is that "when Moorpark sues Moorpark, the people who pay are the  Moorpark taxpayers," said school board member Tom Baldwin. "The only people who  win are the lawyers."  </P> <P> The dispute over the Memorial Union High School campus began more than a year  ago when the school district announced plans to sell or lease the site for  development to pay for new schools needed in other parts of the rapidly growing  district.  </P> <P> The district, which now has about 4,500 students in kindergarten through 12th  grade, has been growing at a rate of 10% to 15% a year, said Thomas G. Duffy,  superintendent of the Moorpark Unified School District. Most of the growth  comes from new housing tracts outside the downtown area, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rezoning Requested  </P> <P> In April, 1988, the school district asked the City Council to rezone the  abandoned high school property for residential or commercial use. The site is  now zoned for about three homes per acre, which is too few to generate enough  income to pay for new schools, Duffy said.  </P> <P> The property is made up of a large flat parcel near railroad tracks, known as  the lower fields; a smaller football field on a terraced hillside, and several  structures, including a gymnasium, a 350-seat auditorium and classroom  buildings. The district closed the old high school in June, 1988, and a new  high school across town opened in September of that year.  </P> <P> "We see the property on the Casey Road site as an asset we can use to generate  an income stream," Duffy said. "We can't educate kids unless we have funds."  </P> <P> But several citizens groups oppose large-scale development of the downtown  site, primarily because of traffic concerns. One group, which launched an  unsuccessful recall campaign in June, 1988, against four of the five school  board members who supported developing the site, said the old high school  should be preserved because of its historic significance. The City Council did  not approve the zoning change that the district requested.  </P> <P> "We need more growth in Moorpark like Hitler needed more Russians," said Bill  La Perch, president of the downtown Neighborhood Council, which opposes  high-density development of the site and wants the city to buy part of the  property for a park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ignored and Deprived'  </P> <P> Godinez, a member of a group called Citizens Advocating a Major Park, said  longtime downtown-area residents have felt increasingly "neglected, ignored and  deprived" by city officials as Moorpark's population has grown sixfold, from  4,030 in 1980 to 24,900 at the end of 1988, according to a report by the state  Department of Finance.  </P> <P> "It's our turn now, and we want a downtown park on the lower fields," Godinez  said, noting that all but one of the city's nine parks are in newly developed  areas.  </P> <P> The district is willing to sell the city the lower fields for a park but  expects to be able to develop the rest of the property in exchange, Baldwin  said. But the two have been unable to work out a deal after months of  negotiations.  </P> <P> Under a provision of the state education code known as the Naylor Act, a city  is allowed to purchase 30% of a district's surplus school sites for as little  as 25% of market value. Based on a $4.2-million appraisal of the 26-acre site,  the city has offered the district $319,750 for the 8 acres of the lower fields.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considered Most Valuable  </P> <P> But the district says the lower fields, which it considers the most valuable  portion of the property, are worth $980,000. The appraisals differ because the  district appraised the land as if it were already zoned for higher densities,  and thus were more valuable, said Councilman Clinton D. Harper.  </P> <P> In addition, the district said that because only 17 acres of the hilly property  are usable, the city can buy only about 5 acres at a reduced price under the  Naylor Act, instead of 8 acres.  </P> <P> "It's pie-in-sky planning and we don't buy it," Harper said. "The city will get  the lower fields at the price it wants or that site will just sit there at  current zoning."  </P> <P> Baldwin, on the other hand, called the city's offer "a setup for a lawsuit."  </P></p>

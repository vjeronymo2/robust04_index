			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hisao Imai, political commentator] </F>   [Text] It may be safely said that Nagata-cho, where the  forces of strength have changed with the shocking turnover of  political power, is astir today with the focus on the good  rivalry of the three politicians, Hosokawa, Kono, and Ozawa. The  time has finally come for the showdown with the commencement of  the special Diet session as the "site for the decisive  confrontations."  <H3>  Hosokawa Achieved Political Power by Capitalizing on the  Collapse of the LDP Government </H3>   Nagata-cho is revolving on the axis formed by the three  persons, namely, Prime Minister Hosokawa, leading representative  of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Ozawa and Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] President Kono. This statement is not an  exaggeration.    The clamor right now is "Hosokawa, Hosokawa," but the  Hosokawa of a year and a half ago was only a bum from  Nagata-cho. His personal history contains only the credentials  of former governor of Kumamoto Prefecture and former Diet member  of the upper house. When he formed the Japan New Party in May  1992 nobody, frankly speaking, paid any attention to him.    Hosokawa's new party increased its strength with four people  in the upper house election, 20 people in the Metropolitan  Assembly election and 35 people in the general election. The  increase in strength, of course, was really trifling. But  conspiring with Shinseito, he drew in such established political  parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito,  and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] to form a coalition  government and he himself took over the leadership. He is not  just an ordinary person.    Moreover, the fact is that he had not promoted any lofty  political doctrine and it was not a situation of expressing an  attractive policy that would capture the imagination of the  people. He seized Nagata-cho with only two key slogans, namely,  political reform and LDP opposition.    But the Hosokawa government is not something that dropped  unexpectedly out of the clouds. Several harbingers were evident.  The LDP lost its majority in the upper house election when the  Uno cabinet was in power in 1989, and thereafter politics took  on strange twists. Then the unforgettable 17 August 1992 when  Kanemaru, the former LDP vice president who had exerted his  authority as don of Nagata-cho, admitted having received illegal  contributions of 500 million yen, and he resigned from the  positions of LDP vice president and head of the Takeshita  faction. Since then, the LDP has been shattered, with the  Takeshita faction splitting into two and the Hata faction  bolting from the party.    These developments led to the passage of the no-confidence  motion against the Miyazawa cabinet, which originally was not  supposed to have passed; the dissolution of the lower house and  the loss of political power by the LDP with its defeat in the  general election. The fact is that the LDP's independent  political power of one-party domination that lasted, before one  knew what was happening, for 38 years collapsed resoundingly. I  feel that in terms of speed, the collapse occurred much faster  than the downfall of the former Soviet Communist Party's  organization after a 75-year domination.    And paralleling exactly the course of the LDP's political  power collapse, Hosokawa established the Japan New Party;  gradually increased his colleagues; pulled in other parties and  finally took over the reins of government by replacing the LDP.  It must be said that Hosokawa's intuition and behavior are those  of a genius.    Hosokawa was exactly like young Nobunaga Oda who, while  setting out to battle as a lone warrior and picking up allies  along the way, launched a surprise attack against Yoshimoto  Imagawa at Okehazama and decapitated him. A review of Hosokawa's  paternal ancestors revealed a feudal lord, Yusai Hosokawa, of  Higo country with a fief yielding 540,000 koku of rice. Although  outwardly appearing weak, Hosokawa has the blood of a lord of  the age of civil strife coursing through him. That he resembles  Nobunaga Oda is not a strange thought.    And at the same time, his mother is descended from the  Konoye  family, which was the highest of the five regent families. There  is no one in Nagata-cho who is not aware that Hosokawa's  maternal grandfather was Prince Fumimaro Konoye. The Konoye  family has continued the blood lineage of "heavenly beings"  since Daishokkan [high court rank] Kamaashi Fujiwara's days, for  over a thousand years. The heavenly beings, in other words the  members of the court nobility, were unarmed and the Minamoto,  Heike, Fujiwara, and Tachibana families, the four families of  nobility during the Heian era, controlled the arms of the  warriors. In other words, power politics is their family  profession. This faculty is genetically transmitted into  Hosokawa's body.    Hosokawa's cabinet is a collection of members from the eight  parties that form the ruling coalition. Troublesome members are  assembled in full force to the right and to the left. On parade  are the big and small taskmasters, such as the SDPJ's Yamahana,  minister in charge of political reform; Shinseito's Hata, deputy  prime minister and concurrently foreign minister; Komeito's  Ishida, Director of the Management and Coordination Agency;  DSP's Ouchi, minister of health and welfare; United Socialist  Democratic Party's Eda, minister of science and technology, etc.    But Hosokawa does not appear to be intimidated at all. He  proudly occupies the seat of honor with composure. While holding  the balance of power, he adroitly manipulates the bunch of  crafty veterans. This is showmanship that can hardly be  performed by a 55-year-old, fair-complexioned prime minister.  This is probably attributable, after all, to his family lineage  and blueblood background.    The weakness of the coalition government lies in the  contradictions of the basic policies of the respective parties  of the ruling coalition. Should the eight parties express their  individual views arbitrarily to the Hosokawa cabinet, the  government would not last even a day. That is why the Hosokawa  cabinet, before its inauguration, agreed to have the various  parties shelve all of their inherent policies and for the time  being to succeed the policies of the LDP government. This is  where one can see the wonders of the art of rule by division,  which is Hosokawa's ancestral inheritance.  <H3>  Kono Seized Presidency With Party in Prostration From Loss  of Political Power </H3>   With the loss of political power, the LDP's Kono is  experiencing difficulties. Kono stood at the forefront during  interpellations at the recent special Diet session and staged a  man-to-man debate with Hosokawa. The arguments were crisp and  articulate, and the orations were excellent, but the content  lacked appeal. This is because the idea of censuring Hosokawa in  effect is tantamount to criticizing the LDP. This is the merit  of Hosokawa following up with the LDP policies intact--borrowing  a little of the techniques formulated by the LDP with hard work,  neutralizing quarrels among fellow members of the ruling  coalition, and with suppressing attacks made by the LDP. One  must marvel at Hosokawa indeed, killing two birds with one stone  in the manner of the court nobility.    But Kono, who is burning with determination to overthrow the  Hosokawa cabinet even for a day sooner and to recapture the  reins of government, cannot falter with these occurrences. As  soon as feasible, he is ready to shoot his second arrow and his  third arrow. One of his arrows is the tactic of exposing  scandals. Resorting to money and women as weapons in political  warfare is somewhat low-grade. Crudely waged, they could turn  into mudslinging. The opponents can be wounded, but likewise the  attacker can be wounded. But if effectiveness is expected even  so, then resorting to dirty tactics is the practice of this  political world. As a matter of fact, the Uno cabinet fell  because of a woman, and boss Kanemaru's downfall was caused by  money.    Kono has openly declared that, "Even if it is wrong, the LDP  will not resort to delaying tactics." But rumors on the  suppression of a project team to expose scandals, which was  reported to have been secretly formed in the LDP, have not been  heard.    Even from now, Hosokawa and Kono will mutually muster all  their resources and they are fated to engage in mortal combat  with all their might. If Hosokawa is not an ordinary person,  then Kono too is not an ordinary person. The rivalry between  these two people will probably be the big battle that will  highlight the political history of the Heisei era.    Properly speaking, Kono was in a position to commit harakiri  along with Miyazawa. This is the role of the chief cabinet  secretary who is considered to be the guardian of the cabinet.  But instead of following Miyazawa and resigning, Kono overpassed  him to seize the presidency.    This does not mean that the LDP lacked a successor.  Previously battling Miyazawa for the presidency and emerging as  second and third choices are former Foreign Minister Watanabe  and former Policy Research Council Chairman Mitsuzuka,  respectively. Especially Watanabe, although in poor health, was  extremely enthusiastic and chose to run in the recent  presidential election. While fully aware of such transactions  within the party, Kono hurled a written challenge. Then he  gathered the votes of the young leaders of the various factions  to defeat Watanabe and rose to assume the top position.    During this time, the LDP was defeated in the general  election, lost its political power, and found itself in a form  of prostration. It was almost like the Japanese people right  after the end of World War II. The young leaders were knocked  into a state of shock and they became a nearly hysterical group.  In such an atmosphere, the extreme theory of old is bad and new  is good prevails. Kono took advantage of this theory. But it  must be said once again that Kono is a tremendous soldier of  fortune.    If Hosokawa is Nobunaga, then Kono is, for the present,  Tenichibo. Even Tenichibo, who sought to usurp the throne by  pretending to be the illegitimate child of Yoshimune, the eighth  Tokugawa shogun, alas, failed when his disguise was revealed by  the penetrating eyes of the famous judge, Echizen no Kami Ooka.  This then means that there is no Echizen Ooka of the Heisei era.    Although Hosokawa and Kono are on opposite camps right now,  they were like-minded friends in the past. Besides that, they  are dove politicians of the same mind. In that sense, for them  to be glaring at each other is said to be rather unnatural. Some  day, around the second act of the reorganization of the  political world, it might come about that these two will  unexpectedly join hands.    In 1976, along with six of his "foolishly honest"  colleagues,  Kono bolted from the LDP and they were entrenched as the  Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Actually Hosokawa was supposed to  join this foolishly honest group. Hosokawa was an upper house  member of the Tanaka faction and held the position of  parliamentary vice minister of finance. Although members of  different factions, with Hosokawa in the Tanaka faction and Kono  in the Nakasone faction, their minds were the same. Kono never  doubted and believed that Hosokawa would cooperate with each  other to the end. But just before taking the resolute step,  Hosokawa had a change of heart. This meant that Kono was  betrayed.    This sort of event occurred, but the thoughts of Hosokawa  and  Kono even today are running on the same track. For instance,  regarding the Constitution, both of them stand on the side of  protecting the Constitution.    Some day in the very near future, when Japan is faced with  the inevitable selection of either revising the Constitution or  protecting it and when this indeed becomes the time to test for  the reorganization of the political world, then surely this will  be the time when these two will likely take the same action.  There is no guarantee to say that this prediction will not occur.  <H3>  Neither Hosokawa Nor Kono Are Substantively Compatible With  Ozawa </H3>   The person to appear on the stage with open arms to shout  "wait" is Ozawa. He is an entirely different person from  Hosokawa and Kono. In short, if Hosokawa and Kono are of the  dove faction, then Ozawa is certainly of the hawk faction. There  is no compromise between the two factions.    Ozawa presently stands beside Hosokawa and has an enemy  relationship with Kono. But, naturally, Ozawa cannot get along  substantively with Kono, the enemy, nor with Hosokawa, the ally.  But there is a pipeline running between Ozawa and Hosokawa. If  Hosokawa will manage the cabinet, then Ozawa will administer the  party. There is no reason they cannot discuss matters with each  other and when they do, their feelings are conveyed. It is  ironic that the two of them, from the dove and hawk factions,  are presently in the honeymoon stage.    It is said that heroes understand the spirit of heroes, or  should it be that snakes follow the way of the snakes, but these  two people mutually respect the other's strength. Hosokawa has  highly evaluated Ozawa ceaselessly as a man of actions, not  words. The notion that there has never been any case, especially  of secret talks being leaked by Ozawa's mouth, appears to have  been a fresh experience for the first time for Hosokawa in his  life up to now. And there is another point, that of Hosokawa  having a feeling of respect for Ozawa's sense of direction. The  new leaders of the LDP, which Hosokawa had previously associated  with, were all nothing but competent managers of the factions.  From among them, Ozawa alone stood out as being different. Not  only did he possess farsighted intelligence, he has a kind of  clear sense of direction about the era. Although this sense of  direction is not necessarily the same as that for Hosokawa, at  any rate Hosokawa respects Ozawa for having this sense of  direction.    Ozawa too has not forgotten to praise Hosokawa. Ozawa has  applauded Hosokawa's trait of resoluteness. Ozawa had previously  served under former Prime Minister Kaifu and had cooperated with  former Prime Minister Miyazawa. During those periods, the  biggest ordeals were the lack of resoluteness at a time when  these two people should have been resolute. And because of this  indecisiveness, there is no way of knowing to what extent Ozawa  moved about busily with pressure of work. In comparison with  these two men, Hosokawa makes quick decisions that are  unbecoming of his countenance. Moreover, he follows through with  his decisions. These are traits that should definitely become  primary qualifications for anyone who becomes a leader. Ozawa  has spoken so in praise of Hosokawa.    The fact is that both of them flatter each other. But no  matter how many cheers are exchanged on the surface, parts of  the heterogeneity of the two people have clashed at the root of  the relationship between them, with sparks flying. The first  instance was the battle waged by the two people in the selection  of personnel for the cabinet Secretariat during the formation of  the cabinet, but it ended in total defeat for Ozawa. Candidates  proposed by Ozawa were rejected totally by Hosokawa and the  Secretariat was packed with pro-Hosokawa members, such as  Takemura as chief cabinet secretary, Hatoyama as the deputy, and  Tanaka as a special assistant. Ozawa's nominees were completely  shut out.    Furthermore, regarding the combined small constituency and  proportional representation electoral system and the political  party furtherance legislation, the plan compiled at the party  under Ozawa's supervision has been either rejected or revised by  Takemura of the Prime Minister's Residence. Needless to say,  Takemura has Hosokawa's support.    But at this point, Ozawa did not assume a defiant attitude  to  retaliate. But this does not mean that Ozawa's position was  weakened from the standpoint of power relationship. Should Ozawa  turn defiant, the Hosokawa cabinet will fall. Then everything  will be lost. If Ozawa has done some calculating, that is all  there is to it.  <H3>  Ozawa's Strength and Talent To Lead Ruling Coalition's  Representatives Council Are Excellent </H3>   There are more serious problems than those described above.  They are the differences in the thinking of the two people on  the concept of government leadership. Hosokawa has in mind a  coalition government based on a moderate multiparty  organization, frankly, for a fixed, long-term Hosokawa  government. Against this way of thinking, Ozawa's ideal is for a  confrontation of a two-party system that would suffice in  sustaining political power and that can field alternate  governments.    But it appears that the two of them are only engaged in  words. Deep examination and rich experience on the realities of  the situation are lacking. In the past, Japan had multiparty  coalition governments. In prewar days, there was the three-party  cabinet to protect the constitution, consisting of the Kensei,  Seiyu, and Kakushin parties; and in the postwar days, the  Katayama and Ashida cabinets which consisted of three parties,  namely, Socialist, Democratic, and Kokkyo parties. All of them  were short-lived and died by the wayside.    Also the period from the Taisho era to the beginning of the  Showa era was called the "Taisho democracy," which was the  golden era of party politics. There was the confrontation of the  two big parties, the Seiyu and Minsei parties, which alternately  took over the reins of government. But in order to rise in  power, they resorted to any means, hook or crook; used national  policies on diplomacy and national defense as subjects for  political warfare and mutually exposed scandals of the opponents  to wage mudslinging battles. The people became disgusted and the  military gained power. These developments were connected to lead  to the tragedy of the Pacific war.    Apart from Europe, the multiparty organization or the  confrontation of two large parties in Japan have facets which  are not suited to the character of the people. Therefore in that  respect, the actual performance of the LDP's independent  government under the medium constituency district system must be  reviewed all over. No matter how good the government, it is  bound to deteriorate from the bottom because of a prolonged stay  in power. There are numerous examples that have occurred  throughout the world. The LDP government was not an exception.  The series of corruption cases under the LDP government were not  lies. But it is not fair to discredit the LDP government itself.    Were it not for the LDP independent cabinets, such events as  the Japan- Soviet negotiations during the Hatoyama cabinet; the  Okinawa reversion during the Sato cabinet; the Sino-Japanese  negotiations during the Tanaka cabinet, and the introduction of  the consumption tax that was carried through the four cabinets  of Ohira, Suzuki, Nakasone, and Takeshita, would probably not  have been realized. Also, the national budget was 1 trillion yen  during the Hatoyama cabinet, but it exceeded 70 trillion yen  during the Miyazawa cabinet. This means that the country's  strength increased 70 times in a 38-year span. Even after  subtracting inflation increases, having a stable government and  continued policies under an independent cabinet are adequate  merits.    The fact is that here lies the foundation for recapturing  the  government by the LDP, which Kono is aiming for.    Ozawa says "no" to this and is putting a stop to it, but on  second thought, Ozawa is as shrewd and headstrong as Hosokawa  and Kono. Only recently during the latter part of the Miyazawa  cabinet reign, Ozawa was in the middle of being forsaken by  everyone and was on the verge of surely being tortured to death.    Anyhow, he was summoned as a Diet witness by the minority  parties regarding the Sagawa Kyubin case and about the Kominto,  and he was surrounded by the majority party's Executive  Committee, centering on then Secretary General Kajiyama. Ozawa  caught hell coming and going, and he was pushed to the wall.    Then in the turmoil of the series of events, that is the  passage of the no-confidence motion, dissolution of the lower  house, and the general election, Ozawa, before he realized it,  found himself in the minority party camp and in reverse was  flaunting the LDP. There is no need to say that one must marvel  at this quick change from one ruling party to another ruling  coalition. Indeed he is deserving of the nickname of Nezumi Kozo  [Robin Hood] of the Heisei era.    Nezumi Kozo was not simply a robber. He was known throughout  the country as a chivalrous robber and he was a friend of the  common people. Thus, to this day he is popularly remembered. And  for the spirit of chivalry and elusiveness in actions, to liken  Ozawa as a Nezumi Kozo is not too far from hitting the mark.  Except that from the standpoint of popularity, Ozawa has areas  that are far short of Nezumi Kozo. This is the point Ozawa must  reflect on.    Setting aside popularity, Ozawa's strength and talent are  excellent, more so than in the past. At any rate, because the  ruling coalition is an assembly of different groups, it is  without a central point. If there is such a thing, it would be  the ruling coalition's Representatives Council. It would be the  equivalent of the LDP's Executive Council and the SDPJ's Central  Executive Committee. The person who controls the Representatives  Council also controls the Hosokawa cabinet. It may be safe to  say so. As a matter of fact, the person leading this  Representatives Council is Ozawa.    The Representatives Council is comprised of personnel at the  secretary-general level of the ruling coalition. When one  mentioned the secretary general of the previous minority  parties, a feeling of fearfulness pervaded. When the SDPJ's  Secretary General Akamatsu, Komeito's Secretary General  Ichikawa, and DSP's Secretary General Yonezawa lined up, anyone  would probably be overwhelmed by their imposing figures and  strong appeal. But then, Ozawa is not overwhelmed one bit. On  the contrary, as the associations increase, he has come to rise  as the central figure in the Representatives Council. Right now,  the pattern is one of Ozawa sitting pretty in the center, and  Ichikawa and Yonezawa waiting on him on both sides. Akamatsu is  being used as an errand boy by Ozawa. Ichikawa shows no respect  for Akamatsu, and the atmosphere is one in which Yonezawa teases  Akamatsu with such statements as "bring your credentials from  the party."    It was said of Ozawa that he was respected only because of  Kanemaru. The fact that he could show a big face in the LDP was  possible only because Kanemaru existed in the background. If  severed from his relationship with Kanemaru, Ozawa would be  easily blown away with one stroke. This sort of view was evident  from around that time. So now Kanemaru is gone and Ozawa is by  himself. This same Ozawa has plunged in the midst of the  veterans of the former minority parties, without being  overpowered and without flinching, and far from being an equal  match, he has become the bully. After all, there is no reason  why Ozawa's true capability cannot be recognized.    In this manner, there is Hosokawa in the Japan New Party,  Kono in the LDP, and Ozawa in Shinseito, with each party not  lacking personnel. In comparison with this situation, what is  pathetic is the SDPJ. Although it is the number-one party within  the ruling coalition, it ranks the lowest from the standpoint of  personnel.    Yamahana resigned to take the responsibility of the party's  crushing defeat in the general election, but regarding the  process of his resignation and the selection of Murayama as his  successor, various SDPJ personnel were reviewed, but none of  them were considered to be high caliber. It appears that, since  the days of Suehiro Nishio and Saburo Eda, the SDPJ has run out  of outstanding personnel. In such a situation, the reference as  the leading party of the ruling coalition will cry. Nay, not  only will it cry. Its very name might be snuffed out.</p>

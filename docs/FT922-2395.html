			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (6): Farmers have an uphill struggle on the slopes - Agriculture is an important activity WHEN Portuguese navigators first set eyes on Madeira in 1419, they found an island covered in dense forest. Fires were lit to clear the land for cultivation and legend has it that the island burned for seven years. Today the regional government of Madeira - the word means wood in Portuguese  -plans to extend what remains of the ancient forest by replanting it with species of laurel and mahogany found only there and in the Canaries and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. Under a four-year forestry programme worth Esc1.5bn, to which the European Community will contribute, the authorities aim to buy up small woodland holdings to protect saplings from grazing sheep, stop soil erosion and stamp out fires that are often started as a result of quarrels. The programme is just one aspect of the government's efforts to make more efficient use of the land and improve the competitiveness of Madeira's main exports. Agriculture is literally an uphill struggle. Madeira, the largest island in an archipelago, is the summit of a mountain range which erupted from the sea bed, its highest point 1,861 metres above sea level. Fishing is unproductive because the waters are too deep, so Madeirans concentrate on the land, exploiting its fertile combination of volcanic soil and wood ash. The farms consist of terraced steps built up the mountainside to the sheer rock face or to the trees that crown the summit. The terraces are kept in place with neat, grey stone walls and the land is irrigated by a network of more than 1,000km of levadas, or channels, which bring water from the wet north to the drier south. Cows live in small sheds because the land is too steep and too precious to let them graze. Vegetables are grown underneath vines in winter to double the capacity of the plots. And on the most precipitous slopes farmers descend with ropes to tend their vines. Once dominating the economy, agriculture is now the island's second most important activity, contributing 13 per cent of GDP in 1986, the latest available figure. Some 22 per cent of the workforce was engaged in agriculture last year, down from 36 per cent 20 years ago. Bananas, the main crop, account for about 45 per cent of exports, followed by Madeira's famous sweet wine, with 18-20 per cent. Production remains highly inefficient. Over 80 per cent of the farms are less than half a hectare in size, and many are dispersed, making economies of scale difficult. About 20 per cent of the population is illiterate, mainly in rural areas, and young people have found jobs in the service industries around Funchal. Farming methods are often out of date. To add to their problems, rural Madeirans now face the threat of competition to their main export. The island sells 40,000 tonnes of bananas to mainland Portugal each year. This is tiny in terms of the European market - indeed, it meets less than half the mainland's needs  - but vital to the small island. In April, the European Commission proposed an EC-wide quota on imports of much cheaper 'dollar bananas' from Latin America, instead of the tariffs required by the Gatt. This protective measure requires a waiver of trade rules from the EC's partners in Gatt, which is likely to be opposed by producers in Latin America and the US multinationals which operate there. If the quota plan goes ahead, it will give EC banana producers such as Madeira and the French Caribbean islands a breathing space to adapt to competition. Madeira's agriculture secretary, Mr Jose Pereira de Gouveia, says he is confident and worried about the future - confident the EC will stand by its treaty obligations to protect Madeira's market and will take account of the peculiar circumstances, worried because 'we have a lot to do to improve the quality of our bananas'. The government plans to reduce the land used for banana production from 1,700ha to 1,200ha over the next four years, cutting output to 30,000 tonnes a year. At the same time, irrigation will be more carefully controlled and taller plants producing bigger bunches will be introduced. A marketing effort will be launched, emphasising the 'natural' methods of irrigation and low use of chemicals. Sugar cane, the source of Madeira's past prosperity, became uneconomic and has virtually died out. However, Mr Pereira de Gouveia rules out abandoning banana production. 'We can reduce the amount of land,' he says. 'But it's impossible for us to have a substitute for bananas.' Indeed, he hopes that the small, sweet Madeiran banana may one day find its way into the wider European market. Meanwhile, diversification of agriculture will continue apace. The 500ha released from banana production will be used to satisfy local and tourist demand for greenhouse products such as tomatoes and lettuces - Madeira has to import many of its vegetables as well as meat, cereals and milk. Exotic flowers are now being grown for export and the tourist market. Orchids and strelitzia, or Bird of Paradise flowers, can be found in hotel lobbies, packed ready for the flight home. Exotic fruits such as mango, custard apples and papaya are being grown in greater quantities. Restructuring requires money, and here too there is a struggle, this time with Lisbon. Under its 1988-1993 agricultural programme, Madeira was due to receive Esc5.3bn, 75 per cent from the EC and 25 per cent from Lisbon. But the EC money depends on Lisbon paying up, and Mr Pereira de Gouveia says only 14 per cent of the total has been forthcoming.</p>

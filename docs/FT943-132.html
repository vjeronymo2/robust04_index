			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cowie expands bus fleet with Pounds 30m deal Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday announced a big expansion of its bus operations with the Pounds 29.9m acquisition of Leaside Bus Company, the subsidiary of London Regional Transport (LRT). The deal, involving a Pounds 25.5m cash payment and Pounds 4.4m to settle intra-group loans, will enlarge Cowie's bus fleet from 128 vehicles to more than 600 and is expected to lead to a fourfold sales increase. 'We paid slightly more than we wanted to, but it was worth it for the enormous growth that it promises,' said Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive. The acquisition follows four months of talks between LRT and Cowie, which has been seeking a larger stake in the London bus network for more than two years. At present, the group's bus and coach operations are dominated by Grey-Green  -acquired 14 years ago - which serves 13 bus routes in London and employs 450 drivers. Leaside, by comparison, has a workforce of about 1,800 and operates 28 routes. Mr Hodgson, who is meeting Leaside managers today, said he was determined to introduce private sector efficiency to the business, which last year made profits of just Pounds 607,000 on turnover of Pounds 43m. In the same period, Grey-Green made profits of Pounds 1.6m on sales of Pounds 14.4m. Cowie shares fell 3 1/2 p to 218 1/2 p yesterday - a new low for the year.</p>

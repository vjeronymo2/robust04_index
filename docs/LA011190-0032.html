			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: DIET IS PERSONAL MATTER -- SO THERE!  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- While my husband and I are not Orthodox Jews, we find many  Jewish customs and rituals personally meaningful. For this reason, we abstain  from eating pork products and shellfish, and we do not consume meat and dairy  products at the same meal. In our own home or with close friends (even  non-Jewish friends), this is not considered unusual.  </P> <P> Sometimes when we have attended social events where things we do not eat were  served, there have been problems.  </P> <P> When asked if we would care to partake of the baked ham, beef stroganoff,  barbecued shrimp, oysters in bacon or other excluded foods, we try to refuse  politely. I always thought that saying, "No, thank you," or "Really, I don't  care for any," in a polite and friendly tone, would be sufficient indication  that we really don't want to eat that particular dish.  </P> <P> Lately, however, we have run into a type of host or fellow guest who insists  that we simply must try some. At this juncture, I usually say that we have  personal reasons for refusing. This is where the going gets really ugly.  </P> <P> On more than one occasion, an explanation has been demanded, which the host or  fellow guest proceeded to ridicule. We have been told that we are living in the  Dark Ages, that we are depriving our children of proper nutrition, and that we  are upholding ignorant superstitions.  </P> <P> Is it now acceptable for hosts to berate their guests in this way, or for  guests to berate other guests? Should my husband and I be prepared to defend  our choices? Or should we simply not accept any more invitations?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- As you well know, insulting other people's religious  practices, embarrassing guests and monitoring other people's eating habits and  child-rearing practices are all intensely rude, and always will be. Checking up  on what other people eat and don't eat has indeed become common, but that does  nothing to excuse it.  </P> <P> However, Miss Manners doesn't want you to have to give up social life in order  to avoid this. Just refuse to enter into any such discussions. A small amount  of indignation -- not enough to start a fight, just enough to discourage people  from pushing you -- is in order.  </P> <P> When you declare it is a personal matter, do so with conversation-ending  firmness. Further questions should be answered by repeating the statement ("I  believe I said it is a personal matter") and rude comments should be denounced  with an amazed, "I beg your pardon!"  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- When a waitress asks "How is everything?" aren't we  supposed to answer truthfully?  </P> <P> I recently told a waitress the prime rib was awful and I just couldn't eat it.  She said, "I'm sorry." I replied, "It's not your fault," and proceeded to eat  my salad and potato only.  </P> <P> About 10 minutes later, the owner of the restaurant (a fine supper club) came  to our table and said: "Do we have a problem here? I heard you don't like our  prime. I cooked it myself. My family and I ate it. There's nothing wrong with  it, and I think you owe the waitress an apology. She feels so intimidated by  you that she won't even come back to your table."  </P> <P> I said nothing further. Shortly thereafter I paid my entire bill and left,  vowing to never return. I was very upset about being yelled at just because I  told the truth about the meat. Some of my friends thought the owner should have  offered something else or reduced the tab because I did not eat the meat.  </P> <P> What should I have said? "It's OK" -- just to please the waitress and the  owner?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Not only the prime rib, but everyone in this unfortunate  anecdote seems to be unfit to be in a restaurant.  </P> <P> A shrewd -- to say nothing of polite -- restaurateur not only would have  refrained from yelling at a customer but would have seen to it that the  customer did not go away unsatisfied. Canceling the bill or substituting an  acceptable meal are two ways of doing this.  </P> <P> A good waitress would have alerted the owner to the problem rather than going  emotionally to pieces, which seems excessive, even to gentle Miss Manners.  </P> <P> But you were being inappropriately humble. If the food was truly inedible --  not if you changed your mind about what you wanted to order -- you should have  politely called it to the waitress's attention before she asked. Insisting on  value for money is not rude, provided it is not rudely done. For this reason,  Miss Manners has always believed "Is everything all right?" to be a silly  question. But this does not entitle the askers to be guaranteed silly answers.  </P> <P>  Judith Martin's "Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children" (Atheneum)  is now available for etiquette emergency consultation.  </P> <P> </P></p>

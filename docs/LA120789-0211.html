			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOARD SEEKS TO END COLLEGE SPATS  </P> <P> Pledging a renewed focus on classroom instruction and an end to internal  divisiveness, the Ventura County Community College Board of Trustees this week  seated two new members and elected a new president and vice president to  oversee the 33,000-student, three-campus district.  </P> <P> In the November election, Dr. Gregory Cole, 38, a Newbury Park dentist, handily  defeated Thousand Oaks attorney Joel Bryan for the seat representing Thousand  Oaks, Westlake Village and Simi Valley. Peter Tafoya, 40, an Oxnard engineer,  narrowly defeated Timothy B. Flynn for the seat representing Oxnard and Port  Hueneme. Running unopposed, Gregory Kampf, 37, a Ventura elementary school  principal, was reelected to the seat representing parts of Ventura, Oxnard and  unincorporated areas between the two cities.  </P> <P> Timothy Hirschberg was elected vice president.  </P> <P> Kampf, who replaced James T. Ely as board president, heralded the changes as a  significant turning point for the five-member board that oversees Ventura,  Oxnard and Moorpark colleges.  </P> <P> "This is the first time in eight years that we've had three new board members,"  said Kampf, who also served on the board from 1981 to 1984. "I think there's an  extremely positive attitude. We're really concerned about working together."  </P> <P> That has not always been the case. In recent years, trustees have publicly  squabbled over a range of issues, arguments that led the Ventura County Grand  Jury to criticize the board for "excessive parochialism." As recently as June,  a special election was called after four trustees deadlocked over a replacement  for a fifth member who resigned.  </P></p>

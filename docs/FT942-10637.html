			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Pounds 140m invested in wind farms Wind farms have attracted Pounds 140m in private investment from banks and companies, a wind power conference heard yesterday. Mr David Lindley, managing director of National Wind Power, which operates 100 of the UK's 400-plus wind turbines, told the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London that about a quarter of the total costs had been provided as equity. Nearly all the equity finance came from electricity and water companies. The balance of the funding has been project finance from banks. Venture capitalists at the conference said the rates of return available had generally been too low for them.</p>

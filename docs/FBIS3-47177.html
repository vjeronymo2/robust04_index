The draft  state budget which I will present to the honorable House is the  1994-95 draft state budget in the first year of the Sixth 5-Year  Development Plan. [passage omitted]    We should make more concerted efforts to further lower the  inflation rate in 1994 -- below the 1993 inflation rate. We  should make wiser and careful decisions concerning our monetary  and fiscal endeavors. We should also anticipate difficulties in  obtaining easy access to the supplies of certain commodities --  particularly commodities which are important for implementing  our development projects. In the effort to further improve our  economic efficiency, we need to continue with the deregulation  and debureaucratization processes. Several deregulation and  debureaucratization measures undertaken should be seriously  implemented and secured at the central and district levels.  [passage omitted]    We still need attractive foreign assistance to further  hasten  the pace of our national development. The more we acquire  attractive foreign assistance, the lesser will be our export and  commercial credit obligations. As such, our foreign debt burden  will not impose a heavier burden for us. We truly need to  upgrade our efficiency in making full use of all existing  foreign assistance. We must avoid wasting the attractive  foreign assistance by eliminating all unbeneficial and slow  development projects. [passage omitted]    In my state address on 16 August 1993, I presented the  estimates that served as the basis for the formulation of the  Second Long-term Development Masterplan and the sixth Five- Year  Development Plan as well as the main targets to be achieved. Now  I want to present the drafts of the sixth Five-Year Development  Plan and the 1994-95 budget to the honorable session. I hope to  receive comments from the honorable session and I shall pay  serious attention to these comments in my efforts to complete  the formulation of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan. The  1993 GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] stipulates that the  second Long- term Development Masterplan is a process of  continuity, intensification, expansion, and renewal of the first  Long-term Development Masterplan. In the second Long-term  Development Masterplan, the Indonesian people are entering a  process of take-off toward the realization of a just,  prosperous, and autonomous society based on the Pancasila  ideology.    The 1993 GBHN on the fundamentals of development has served  as a guideline in formulating development plans in the second  Long-term Development Masterplan. All development efforts must  be directed at consolidating and strengthening our nation's  economic independence. To achieve the desired stage of progress  and independence, we must make the efforts to achieve reasonably  high economic growth during the second Long-term Development  Masterplan, or higher than that recorded in the first Long-term  Development Masterplan, namely, an average of seven percent  annually. Such an economic growth rate must also be supported  by a declining population growth rate and be accompanied by  structural changes in the job market, which should be more  balanced and productive. The population growth rate must be  reduced to 0.88 percent annually by the end of the second  Long-term Development Masterplan from 1.66 percent annually at  the end of the first Long-term Development Masterplan. If we  can achieve these two main objectives, per capita income will  have increased four-fold by the end of the second Long-term  Development Plan, namely, at about U.S. $2,600, based on the  prevailing price of goods in the 1989-90 fiscal year. The  nominal price will automatically be higher.    We must promote education to make it more available to the  people, serve development needs, and produce more qualified  manpower. An important step in promoting education in the  second Long-term Development Masterplan is the introduction of  nine years of compulsory basic education. We only have six-year  compulsory education now. We must achieve this target in 10  years, or three Five-year Development Plans at the latest. We  will not only make education more available, but also upgrade  its quality. Our education will also be more focussed and  adjusted to the manpower needs in all fields and sectors of  development activities. [passage omitted]    In the sixth Five-year Development Plan, we will try to  achieve an average 6.6-percent growth rate annually. We set  this growth rate lower than the average rate of the second  Long-term Development Masterplan because of the heavy challenges  and the need to strengthen our economy. We have set the growth  rate of the agricultural sector at 3.4 percent, manufacturing  industry at 9.4 percent, and nonoil and nongas industry at 10.3  percent. The growth rate of other sectors are projected at six  percent. At the end of the sixth Five-year Development Plan,  the growth rate of industrial and agricultural sectors is  projected at about 24.1 and 17.6 percent respectively.    The population growth rate will be reduced to about 1.51  percent annually at the end of the sixth Five-year Development  Plan from about 1.6 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year  Development Plan. With this level of population growth and  economic growth, per capita income will surpass U.S. $1,000, or  an increase of about 4.7 percent. [passage omitted]    The improvement of our economy will be reflected in our debt  situation and we always make efforts to keep it within safe  limits. Indonesia's [words indistinct] is projected to decrease  from about 57 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year  Development Plan to 45 percent at the end of the sixth Five-Year  Development Plan. We will also make efforts to reduce the debt  service ratio [three preceding words in English] from 32 percent  to 20 percent.    Efforts will be made to further reduce the role of foreign  aid as a source of funds for the development budget during the  Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In the meantime, efforts will be  made to further enhance the role of government savings during  this period. The share of government savings in the development  budget is expected to increase from some 62 percent at the end  of the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan to some 68 percent at the  end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In addition, the debt  service ratio in the routine expenditure will decrease from some  45 percent to some 33 percent. [passage omitted]    Investments totaling some 660 trillion rupiah will be  needed during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. This will be  78 percent higher than the actual investment during the Fifth  5-Year Development Plan or 176 percent higher than the projected  investment for the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan. To achieve  this target, the role of the business circles must be further  enhanced because more than 73 percent of the investment is  expected to come from the people. The source of investment will  be domestic savings conmprising the government's and people's as  well as foreign funds. Government savings [words indistinct]  before the repayment of loans is estimated to reach some 169  trillion rupiah, while people's savings will amount to some 453  trillion rupiah. Foreign funds are estimated to total some 37  trillion rupiah. Government funds to finance development  projects during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan are estimated  to amount to 443.5 trillion rupiah made up of 382 trillion  rupiah from internal revenue and 61.5 trillion from foreign  loans. Meanwhile, routine expenditure is estimated to reach  267.6 trillion and development expenditure 175.9 trillion  rupiah. The state budget is estimated to grow by an average of  12.4 percent annually in the next five years.    Ladies and gentlemen! Internal revenue is estimated to  increase from 59.7 trillion rupiah in the first year of the  Sixth 5-Year Development Plan to 97.3 trillion rupiah in the  last year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. Internal  revenue will be optimally increased from the nonoil and nongas  sector, particularly various taxes. For this end, intensive and  extensive campaigns will be launched to exploit taxes, the  actual collection of which is lower than their potential.  [passage omitted]    A total of 11.9 million new jobs are expected to be created  through various efforts and on the basis of a projected 6.2  percent annual economic growth. The agricultural sector is  expected to absorb some 1.9 million workers, the industrial  sector some three million, and other sectors seven million.  Thus, the rate of open [terbuka] unemployment will be reduced  to 0.8 percent at the end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan  from an estimated 3.2 percent in 1990. [passage omitted]    Honorable Speaker, allow me to briefly outline the  perspective and direction of the draft budget for the several,  major sectors in the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Development Plan.  In the plan, about 6.4 trillion rupiah will be allocated to the  agriculture and forestry sectors. The irrigation sectors will  receive an allocation of 10.4 trillion rupiah, which will cover  the cost of the expansion of water resources, including  irrigation. During this development plan, the irrigation sector  will be an independent sector, taking into account its  increasingly important role vis a vis the other nonagricultural  sectors such as the industrial, housing, health, and environment  sectors.    Regarding the infrastructure sector, the transportation  sector will receive a large allocation of 33 trillion rupiah.  Of this amount, 22 trillion rupiah will be allocated for the  construction of road infrastructure. The major road  infrastructure will be concentrated outside Java, including the  construction of roads in the rural regions. Apart from this,  the large amount of 21.3 trillion rupiah has also been allocated  toward improving energy resources, including the development of  a rural electrical supply. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year  Development Plan, it is hoped that 79 percent of the community  will be able to enjoy an electricity supply compared with only  49 percent at the end of the Fifth Five- Year Development Plan.    The education sector receives one of the highest amounts in  the draft budget. In the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, the  education sector will receive an allocation of 20.3 trillion  rupiah, which includes the budget for national culture. The  health sector will be given greater attention. During the next  five years, a budget of 8 trillion rupiah will be allocated to  the health and population sectors. Housing and community  development sectors will receive an allocation of 5.7 trillion  rupiah; this is intended to hasten the pace of construction of  houses for low-income groups.    An estimate of 3.62 trillion will be allocated for the  science and technology sector. This includes expenditures for  the aerospace and maritime sectors, which have been merged and  which should be given more attention.    One of the highest allocations in the budget, standing at  34.2 trillion rupiah or 19.45 percent of the total development  budget for the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, is for the  regions and the transmigration sector. Regional development  will be intensified toward a more equitable distribution of  development and a more concrete, dynamic, harmonious, and  responsible regional autonomy. [passage omitted]    We have been unable to utilize our economic capacity to its  fullest because efficiency and productivity are still below par.  As yet, neither a much needed system nor regulations to support  our economic institutions has been able to fully function as  expected.    In addition, even though there are indications that the  global economic situation is heading toward reform, a feeling of  instability still prevails. Any increase in exports will face  heavy obstacles. The emergence of economic blocs was brought  about by political issues which have been interlinked with trade  and economic cooperation and also by the existence of new,  progressive, and competitive nations. These are factors which  could affect our efforts toward increasing our exports. We  could possibly be faced with stiffer challenges in our efforts  to attract the much-desired foreign resources.    Apart from this, our future plans will also be influenced by  oil prices, which are ever declining even though our dependence  on oil has been lessened. But in the next five years the role  of oil will have a greater influence on our national income and  revenues. All these factors should be seriously taken into  account when charting our future plans. With the implementation  of the GATT agreement in 1994, it is hoped that global trading  conflicts will be further lessened. This will provide greater  opportunities for us to increase our exports in international  markets. However, we will have to face certain consequences.  Undoubtedly, our internal market will then be fully opened.  This means that our internal market will face greater  competition. In that case, we will have no alternative but to  upgrade the competitiveness of our internal production with the  aim of further widening our export markets.    Honorable members, bearing in mind the global economic  situation and based on what we have achieved thus far, we have  formulated the 1994-95 draft budget. We plan to set a balanced  budget for the first year of the upcoming Sixth Five-Year  Development Plan at 69.7 trillion rupiah, which means a 11.9  percent increase over the current budget. The national income  from revenues is estimated at 59.7 trillion rupiah and the  income from development is estimated at 10 trillion rupiah.  This means that the national income is more than 85 percent of  the overall income. Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3  trillion rupiah, while development expenditure will be set at  27.4 trillion rupiah. It can be observed from the total amount  that the national expenditure stands at 17.4 trillion rupiah or  10.3 percent more than the state expenditure in the existing  budget. Domestic income, which is 59.7 trillion rupiah, is  derived from the oil and gas sector, which amounts to 12.8  trillion rupiah, and income from the nonoil and nongas sector is  46.9 trillion rupiah. The income from the nonoil and nongas  sector makes up 78.6 percent of the total domestic income. This  development is very heartening because the national income is  becoming stronger and we are confident of weathering any  external turbulence. The income from the gas and oil sector is  still needed as one of the major sources of income providing  assistance in funding national development. However, with the  increasingly important role of revenues, we should not be fully  dependent on the income from the oil and gas sector. Following  the sharp decline of oil prices in 1986 -- a decline which has  continued up to now, except for the Gulf crisis in 1990 -- the  crude oil price was at around U.S.$16-17 per barrel; however, at  the end of 1988 the crude oil price was only U.S.$11-12 per  barrel. Therefore, we should be wary and should not hope for  crude oil prices to increase again. Recently, there were signs  that the crude oil price would again decline because of  weakening demand from the industrialized countries and  speculation that Iraqi crude oil would re-enter the world market.    The crude oil price has been estimated at U.S.$16 per barrel  in the 1994-95 draft budget based on these developments.  Therefore, based on these calculations and the production of  1.5 million barrels per day, receipts from the gas and oil  sector in the 1994-95 draft budget are expected to amount to  12.8 trillion rupiah. Receipts from the nongas sector amounting  to 46.9 trillion rupiah come from the services sector -- 40.1  trillion rupiah; the nontax sector -- 4.3 trillion rupiah; and  net oil profits -- 2.3 [figure as heard] trillion rupiah.    The receipts from taxes indicate their important and  strategic role in development as a source of funds. This can be  seen from the high amount received from taxes. The receipts  from taxes in the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan were at an  annual average rate of 22 percent. The income from taxes for the  1994-95 draft budget is estimated at 69 percent. Among the  receipts from various tax sectors, the biggest portion has been  estimated to come from income tax, value added tax, and land and  building taxes. The three forms of taxes are the current and  future major source tax incomes. As I stated earlier, we cannot  be fully dependent on the gas and oil sector to provide us with  total income. On the other hand, we have determined to be  self-dependent in implementing our development. [passage omitted]    As I stated earlier, domestic income from the nongas sector  also included receipts from net oil profit. These receipts are  derived from the excess amount from the domestic sale of fuel  based on the price of crude oil at U.S.$16 per barrel. In  general, the national income from the gas and oil sector  experienced a sharp decline due to the lower crude oil price.    Apart from domestic incomes, the estimated receipts from the  development are set at 10 trillion rupiah. This figure  represents the [word indistinct] from the liquidity of foreign  aid, which we received from international organizations and from  several countries. The amount is 4.8 percent more than the  receipts from development in the existing budget. The  relatively low increase indicates the lesser role of foreign aid  in funding development. Allow me to further clarify the basic  national expenditure, which are made up of routine and  development expenditures.    Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3 trillion rupiah,  which means an increase of 14.2 percent over current  expenditure. Of that amount, nearly half -- that is, 20.1  trillion rupiah [words indistinct].    The current national funds should be utilized for  development. Because of this, the pay rise for civil servants  and members of the Indonesian Armed Forces cannot yet be  implemented. If the country's future situation warrants it, the  government will definitely honor its obligation. Regarding the  routine expenditure, it is estimated that the subsistence  allowance for armed forces personnel will be increased from  1,800 rupiah to 3,000 rupiah per day.    Honorable members, with domestic income totalling 50.9  trillion and routine expenditure for administration totalling  42.3 trillion rupiah, then the national savings in the 1994-95  budget are estimated to be 17.4 trillion rupiah. This amount  will be used to fund a large portion of the development  allocation, which stands at 27.4 trillion rupiah. A balance of  10 trillion rupiah is development expenditure in the form of  [words indistinct] project aid. It is then clear that the  portion from development expenditure has utilized more national  savings. Besides, since the 1991-92 fiscal year, the amount  subsidized by national savings has exceeded the subsidized  amount from project aid. This means that we are becoming more  self-reliant in funding our development.    Honorable members, I shall continue to clarify the broad  guidelines on development expenditure. The amount for  development expenditure is estimated at 27.4 trillion rupiah or  an increase of 8.6 percent compared with the current budget.  This is not a heavy increase. On the other hand, on entering  the Sixth Five-Year Development Master Plan, the government will  be given heavier responsibilities by parliament. [passage  omitted] These are the priorities which should be given to the  allocations for development:    1. To complete and continue all ongoing projects;    2. To fully utilize all the allocations for the  implementation of projects;    3. To provide allocations tapped from the development  expenditures for operational and management purposes;    4. To fund the development projects within the framework  of trying to achieve the development objectives. [passage  omitted]    All presidential funds will total just over 5.3 trillion  rupiah. This will represent a 10-percent increase over the  current fiscal year, generally because the scope of presidential  programs will be expanded and particularly because a new  presidential program for backward villages has been created. I  presented to the House the main points of the new presidential  program on 16 August. Every village categorized as being  backward will be given 20 million rupiah unless it has already  been taken care of under the current coordinated territorial  development program. The total funds for the backward villages  are estimated to amount to 389 billion rupiah. Beginning the  first fiscal year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan, some  presidential programs will be simplified by according greater  responsibility to regions. This step shows our serious  determination to develop regional autonomy more concretely,  harmoniously, dynamically, and responsibly. Emphasis will be  placed on second-level regions. This also shows our greater  confidence in the ability of our development officials in the  regions. Presidential funds for villages will be increased.  Every village will get additional aid of 500,000 rupiah. Thus,  every village will get six million rupiah in aid. Of this  amount, one million will be used for family welfare development.  The additional aid of 500,000 rupiah will be used primarily for  village child and youth development. Thus, presidential funds  for villages will total 423 billion rupiah or an increase of 8.5  percent. Presidential programs for second-level regions will  also be enhanced. More aid for these programs will be  proportionate to their areas.    Beginning the next fiscal year, every second-level region  will get additional aid on the basis of its area -- 20,000  rupiah for every square kilometer. The additional aid is aimed  at helping develop backward areas, which are generally remote  due to their vastness and inaccessibility. Additional aid will  also be given to second-level regions whose areas are made up of  populated islands. This additional aid will be useful  particularly for vast regions made up of islands in Eastern  Indonesia. Based on these considerations, 2.4 trillion rupiah  has been earmarked for presidential programs in second-level  regions. This will represent an increase of some 135 percent  over the current fiscal year. In the meantime, presidential  funds for first-level regions will increase to 1.2 trillion  rupiah, an increase of 55 percent over the current funds. There  will be a slight increase in aid for first- level regions from  56,000 rupiah to 60,000 for every square kilometer. Additional  aid will also be earmarked for monitoring development projects  in first-level regions. Thus, sectional and regional  coordination will be enhanced in these regions. [passage omitted]    The second, third, and fifth biggest sectors in terms of  fund  allocations pertain to infrastructure. Transport is to receive  over 5.2 trillion or 19 percent of the total development budget.  Mining and energy is to get 3.5 trillion rupiah, most of which  will be used to generate electricity. Almost 1.7 trillion  rupiah will be for irrigation as the fifth largest sector.    Being the fourth biggest sector, education, national  culture,  religion, youth, and sports will receive some 3 trillion rupiah.  About 97 percent of the amount will be used for education,  including extracurricular education and official training  programs. The amount has been greatly increased primarily to  support a 9-year compulsory basic education program, which will  begin in the next fiscal year. Similarly, religious education  will also get a much bigger funding as part of the 9-year  compulsory basic education program.    Only two other sectors will be allocated over 1 trillion  rupiah each. Some 1.1 trillion and just over 1 trillion will be  allocated to defense and security and health respectively.  Health development will continue to get top priority as part of  efforts to enhance the quality of human resources. Agriculture,  which is currently under the combined sector of agriculture and  irrigation, will receive 990 billion rupiah, while housing and  settlement will get some 888 billion rupiah.    The fact that other sectors will not receive huge funds does  not mean that they will receive less priority. They will  receive the smaller funds because they have different needs to  sectors which will need huge investment. The industrial sector,  for example, will receive a relatively small development fund of  450 billion rupiah, although industries will be an important  sector during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan.  Essentially, industrial development is undertaken by the  business circles, including state enterprises, while the  government plays mainly a guiding or supervisory role and  creates a healthy climate in which the industries can grow.

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Conflicting credit figures reported Figures on consumer and business credit for October present conflicting evidence on the buoyancy of the economic recovery. Business finance fell sharply in October compared with the previous month and with October last year, says the Finance and Leasing Association's monthly report. The decline suggests that businesses are increasingly cautious about capital investment in spite of the recovery. But consumers took out credit worth Pounds 1.46bn, 32 per cent more than in October last year. A strong performance in retail store credit outweighed a decline in new-car finance for consumers, the association says. Store-card finance rose 70 per cent, compared with October last year, to Pounds 462m.</p>

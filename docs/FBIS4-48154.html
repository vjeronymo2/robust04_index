			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The government has been losing more than 2.7  billion shillings annually through ghost workers. The chairman  of the national payday committee, (Ndugu Mwamba Jingu), said  that preliminary results have shown the presence of 14,764 ghost  workers in the civil service. He noted that there were  possibilities of the number of ghost workers to increase as  (?reports) of ten accounting officers were until yesterday not  yet announced.    According to (Ndugu Mwamba Njingu), the national payday  committee has submitted its recommendations to the government  following the ghost workers' findings. They recommended, among  other things, that the concerned ghost workers should be deleted  from the payroll by the end of this month. [passage omitted]</p>

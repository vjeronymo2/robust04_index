The Liberal Party-93 (PL-93) is  also to be represented at the talks by a group favorable to  unification.    Asked to explain the situation created in PNL after the  so-called "anti-ordinary" congress called by supporters of  former PNL leader Radu Campeanu, both the present PNL President  Ionescu-Quintus and PNL Vice President Viorel Catarama said the  only chance for that grouping was to register as a new party,  and said that Mr. Campeanu's supporters "brought grave prejudice  to the liberal movement and to the opposition as a whole," and  that the new leadership intended "no purge" in the party.    "The National Liberal Party, one of the main engineers of  the  great union of 1918, has taken note with disappointment and  apprehension of the irresponsible and strongly anti-Romanian  statements of President Mircea Snegur of Moldova," a PNL  statement read by its president at the same news conference  runs. "PNL hopes that the true Romanians in the Republic of  Moldova will be able to defend their national being and  independence from these new attempts of turning Bessarabia into  a Russian colony," the statement winds up.</p>

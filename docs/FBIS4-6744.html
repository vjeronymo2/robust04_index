			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  wasted no time as it took him only about 20 minutes to appoint  Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok as Yi Hoe-chang's successor.    Unsurprisingly, both the prime minister's office and the  National Unification Board were apparently stunned by the swift  change and expressed concern over its repercussions.    -- Returning to his office with slightly-reddened face from  a  40-minute talks with the president, Yi told Government  Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha his intention to resign  and asked him to take necessary steps.    He then called his chief secretary Yi Hung-chu and  administrative coordinator Kim Si-hyong and praised them for  their hard work.    "I'm sorry to have worked you too hard," he told them.    Officials at the prime minister's Secretariat found the  announcement as a shock.    "Today was like every other day," one official said, "I  can't  believe he would be leaving so suddenly."    Premier-designate Yi Yong-tok said that when the president  called him to inform the appointment around 4:40 p.m., he had no  time to think twice because he first thought the president was  trying to tell him to better help the prime minister.    Yi, a devout Christian, at first found no words to say when  he met reporters. "I am afraid I have no sufficient wisdom and  knowledge. But, I think it is god's dictate," he said.    "When President Kim told me to take the premier's post, I  only understood what he really meant when the president started  talking about National Assembly approval," he told reporters.    -- Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang reportedly explained about  the  statement he made on the Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Council to chief presidential secretary Pak  Kwan-yong Thursday night.    Yi had pointed out problems about the council from the legal  point of view, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said,  adding Yi must have explained the same thing to the president  when he met him earlier in the day.    But President Kim must have not accepted Yi's explanation as  diplomatic and security matters fall under the exclusive  authority of the president and since the council was formed at  the president's instruction after all, the official said.    He said that the Chongwadae secretariat with the duty of  assisting the president, have to consult government offices  regarding various policies, but Premier Yi kept ministers from  making reports directly to Chongwadae, thus posing substantial  problems to the business of Chongwadae secretaries.    Not a few ministers and other government officials had been  reproached by premier Yi for going directly to Chongwadae in  breach of his instructions, he said.    A senior government official said President Kim thought of  reshuffling the premier from Thursday when Yi demanded his  advance approval of unification- and security-related policies.</p>

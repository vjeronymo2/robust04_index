			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Canadian labour deal may soften newsprint prices WORLD newsprint prices face renewed downward pressure after the expected approval today of a new labour contract by workers at seven Canadian paper mills owned by Abitibi-Price of Toronto. Union leaders have urged workers to accept the five-year contract, setting a pattern for other eastern Canadian mills without triggering the work stoppages which usually disrupt newsprint supplies during labour negotiations. Uncertainty over the outcome of the contract talks has helped push up newsprint demand in recent months. Many North American publishers built up inventories to protect themselves against supply interruptions and a 5-7 per cent cut in discounts imposed by producers in the eastern US and Canada on April 1. An official at Knight-Ridder, the US newspaper group, said the company had 80 days' consumption on hand, against the industry average of 40-45 days. Strong demand in North America led to a sharp cut in US and Canadian exports to Europe earlier this year. The gap has largely been filled by Scandinavian producers, whose competitiveness has been improved by a fall in the value of the Swedish krona and Finnish markka. Some Scandinavian producers had been hoping for limited price increases in the second half of this year if the US market continued to strengthen. But current North American production appears to be outstripping consumption. An Abitibi-Price official confirmed that 'we may see a little softness in the middle of the year'. The company has said it is shifting production of two machines at its Iroquois, Ontario, mill from newsprint to specialty groundwood papers and late yesterday it announced production cutbacks totalling 30,000 tonnes. According to Mr John Johnson, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Vancouver, the New York Times' advertising lineage is 6 per cent lower so far this year than in 1992, while the Los Angeles Times' lineage is down 10 per cent. But newsprint mills, especially in Canada, are running at full tilt to meet the recent run-up in inventories. The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association will report today that Canadian mills were operating at 99 per cent of capacity in April, up from 78 per cent in July 1992.</p>

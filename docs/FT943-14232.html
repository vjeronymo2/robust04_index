			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Rules on capital held by banks to reflect new derivatives risk The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision yesterday proposed new rules for banks which will require them to hold far more capital against increasingly complex derivative instruments. 'The (Basle) Committee's review indicated that the current approach may produce insufficient capital for certain kinds of instruments,' the Bank for International Settlements said. It noted that current capital requirements were designed for traditional interest and currency swaps rather than the commodity and equity derivatives 'which are rapidly growing segments of the market'. The proposals also suggest that more capital should be required for longer-term derivative positions which can cause hefty losses for the banks in volatile market conditions. The Basle Committee, a division of the BIS, said it was seeking comments on the proposals by October 10 and hoped to implement them by mid-1995. However, the higher capital requirement will be offset by an amendment to the Capital Accord of 1988. This will sharply reduce the amount of capital banks have to hold for off-balance sheet transactions which can be 'netted' with a single counterparty. According to the Bank of England, this rule could reduce the capital requirement of a 'typical' bank portfolio of interest rate and currency swaps by 25 to 40 per cent. The Capital Accord of 1988 sets out international standards for banks aimed at insuring they have enough capital to withstand risks. The new netting arrangements, which had been proposed last year, will force banks to set aside capital only for the 'net' exposure, that is, the difference between the value of all the transactions with a single counterparty. The arrangements will only help banks in countries, such as Britain and the US, whose bankruptcy laws recognise netting. Thus, banks which may have several offsetting transactions with each other - such as a series of interest rate or currency swaps - will only need to have enough capital for a small portion of the total value. However, the Bank of England said yesterday that UK and other EU banks will not be allowed to take advantage of the new rule until it becomes part of an EU Capital Adequacy Directive next year.</p>

People were  especially excited when they saw Deng Xiaoping, at the age of  88, making an inspection tour of Shenzhen and Zhuhai, pushing  for a new upsurge of reform and opening up throughout the  country.    While wholeheartedly wishing Comrade Xiaoping good health  and  longevity, people also are interested in how this great and  tested revolutionary has managed to remain in good health. A  newspaper report revealed that Comrade Xiaoping's principle for  healthy living is to lead a simple and spare life, and to do  moderate exercise.    According to the newspaper report: Comrade Xiaoping's daily  diet is extremely simple. Breakfast: a small bowl of glutinous  rice wine mixed with an egg, two steamed buns, a bowl of  porridge, and a bit of soybean paste. Lunch: a glass of white  or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, a dish of soybean paste  or chili paste, and two small bowls of rice. Supper: a glass  of white or rice wine, three vegetarian dishes, and two small  bowls of rice. He has some meat dishes only on Sunday.    Comrade Xiaoping likes to drink wine, especially glutinous  rice wine. He said: "I like to drink some rice wine. The  brewing of rice wine is simple and easy, and I always do it  myself. To brew glutinous rice wine, you first cook some  glutinous rice, put it in a jar, and add some sugar and some  yeast. Then you seal the jar, and the wine will be ready to  serve in a few days."    This is a very traditional formula in China for the brewing  of glutinous rice wine. Comrade Xiaoping has adhered to the  principle of a simple diet and has persisted in doing moderate  exercise. A few years earlier, despite his advanced age of over  80, he used to go to Beidaihe to swim. Therefore he has managed  to keep his weight constant.    Constant weight is an extremely good indication of health  for  people of advanced age. A REUTER reporter once filed an  interesting piece of information: On 19 December 1986, the  reporter had an exclusive interview with Tian Atong, one of the  four master tailors of the Hongdu tailor shop in Beijing, which  is the Chinese leaders' specially designated garment supplier.  Mr. Tian told the reporter: "I first made clothes for Deng  Xiaoping in 1956. His figure has remained constant since then,  so the cutting has not needed to be changed." This implied that  Comrade Xiaoping had neither gained nor lost weight for the  whole 30 years from 1956 to 1986. No change in the cutting of  garment is an important indication of good health.    In addition, Comrade Xiaoping, as a great proletarian  revolutionary and the chief architect of China's reform and  opening- up program, always has remained strong-willed,  broad-minded, and optimistic, whether under favorable or  unfavorable circumstances. This is not only a very lofty  character, but also seems to be a part of his secret for healthy  living and longevity.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Disclosure plans for sales of unit trusts Companies which sell unit trusts - pooled investment funds  - are to be required to give customers more information about the investment products and about their fees and charges, under plans to be introduced next year. The move follows the imposition of a new regime which requires companies and individuals selling life insurance policies to disclose more about the policies and the incentives paid to those who sell them. This will come into effect in January. A consultation paper on what information should be included in the disclosure regime for other financial products, including unit trusts, is to be published by the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, next month. It should have simpler requirements than for selling long-term life and investment policies - since unit trusts themselves are simpler  - but the aim will be to enable customers to make a fair comparison between the different types of financial products available. Unit trusts have been growing in popularity with private investors. In the first half of this year net retail sales grew from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3.9bn. The PIA hopes to have made the detailed rules for unit trust disclosure by the end of the year, so that the new regime can be optional from January when the regime for life companies becomes compulsory. The similar regime for unit trusts is intended to be mandatory from next July. The pace at which unit trust companies adopt the new pattern of giving information to customers in advance of that date is likely to vary. Some will want to move to the new system early, in order not to appear to be less open with customers in the sale of unit trusts than in the sale of life insurance products. Others will want to move later in order to take account of the other changes likely to affect unit trusts next year which will require significant changes to computer systems and to the documents provided to customers. The most important likely change is a move away from the current system of dual pricing, under which investors buy units at an 'offer' price and sell at a lower 'bid' price, to a system of single pricing, which is intended to make unit trusts easier to understand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Kangqin (7120 1660 0530): "Facing the </F> Challenges and Exploring New Paths -- Sidelights on a National  CYL Organizational Work Conference"]    [Text] The CYL Membership in Rural Areas Throughout  China Actually Being Lower Than Overall Party Membership Is an  Unparalleled Warning Signal, Admonishing the Whole CYL To Pay  Attention to CYL Organization-Building    Facing up to our magnificent goals for the transition to the  new century by exploring new ways of CYL organization-building  for the new age was the theme of the "National CYL  Organizational Work Conference" held in early November 1993 in  Wuxian County, Jiangsu.    In the course of building and developing our socialist  market  economy, CYL organization-building is obviously facing many new  challenges, as well as the need to respond to many new  questions. China now has 56.8 million CYL members, only a few  million more than overall party members; but in China's rural  areas, CYL membership is actually millions lower than party  membership. As to the ratio of national CYL members to all  youth, the CYL organizational system's database on youth show  this to be 19.9 percent; but this figure seems to inadvertently  show a sizeable mistake, as the CYL organization's data on the  overall number of youth throughout China is 70 million less than  that of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB], so that taking SSB  data on the number of youth, this ratio of CYL members to all  youth is even harsher at only 5.8 percent. And if we shift our  attention to the new economic groups that have grown up in  recent years, we will be startled to discover that in the new  economic growth zone, such as the three kinds of foreign trade,  wholly foreign-owned, private, and township enterprises, the  zones and parts with CYL organization-building gaps are even  larger. While these figures and data are quite abstract, they  are certainly like an unparalleled and harsh warning signal,  admonishing the whole CYL that we must pay attention to and  intensify CYL organization-building.    We need to face up to the immediate need for courage,  as well as to the fact that reality is sometimes a bit painful,  particularly since we have done our utmost to emphasize in  recent years the rectification of grassroots CYL organizations.  Faced with China's ever-more dynamic economic and social  development, we absolutely must soberly and reasonably examine  and consider CYL-organization building, development, reform, and  progress.    Of course, self-knowledge is wisdom. Just as we were  facing such challenges, not long after the CYL Central  Secretariat had conducted a large nationwide investigation and  study, we held the "National CYL Organizational-Work  Conference," where CYL Central Secretariat Standing Secretary  Liu Peng [0491 7720] set forth on behalf of the secretariat the  basic future missions of national CYL organizational work: To  conscientiously meet the needs of our socialist market economy,  by actively pushing forward with CYL building and reform,  focused on increasing CYL membership, in order to build a CYL  membership corps that is great in numbers and capable of playing  an exemplary role; to aim at producing more talent, in order to  train CYL cadres into multi-talented personnel who meet CYL work  realities and our socialist modernization needs for the next  century; to focus on promoting social and economic development  and serving youth development and progress, by taking a new CYL  grassroots-building route, and gradually establishing  CYL-organization operating forces that are on track with our  socialist market-economy system, in order to pave the way for  national CYL work to rise to new heights and create a new  order.  <H3>  CYL Organizations in Places Such as Jiangsu, Shanghai,  and Gansu Are Facing the Challenges, Exploring New Routes, and  Making New Responses in CYL Organization-Building </H3>   Faced with challenges, the CYL has never lost its  confidence and nerve, with CYL vigor and vitality also growing  and developing precisely in the midst of challenges.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, Jiangsu has developed its industrial and  agricultural production very quickly, with its industrial and  agricultural output value ranking foremost in China, to create  the nationally-noted "southern-Jiangsu model" -- a rural  economic-development model marked by collective industry. In  Jiangsu's economic development process, the CYL's Jiangsu Party  Committee has always paid attention to building the CYL  membership ranks among township enterprises in rural areas.  CYL Jiangsu Party Committee Secretary Xu Ming [1776 7686]  gives the following briefing: While statistical difficulties  have kept us from yet making a full investigation of township  enterprises throughout Jiangsu, samplings show Jiangsu's  township enterprises to have a CYL-organization rate of 80-85  percent, far higher than the CYL average for township  enterprises. In the course of CYL-building in township  enterprises, the CYL Jiangsu Party Committee has acted in line  with industrial needs to flexibly set up CYL organs, through CYL  leadership of villages, village leadership of the CYL, or  CYL-enterprise mergers, to gradually grow and steadily achieve  its current heartening successes. Since 1993, they have been  focusing on the large army of youth among transient workers.  They began with the inflow sites, first organizing after-hours  recreational and sports activities to attract young workers from  other provinces to take part in CYL activities; then, to raise  the quality of young workers to meet enterprise development  needs, they launched all sorts of technical-training and  competitive activities; finally, they actively built up CYL  membership among young workers, conscientiously carrying out  CYL-building. While this task has just begun, it has already  received the attention and support of all areas of society.    The CYL's Shanghai Party Committee has also shown  unique foresight in building the CYL membership ranks, which CYL  Shanghai Party Committee Deputy Secretary Xue Chao [5641 3390]  sums up as "moving to the forefront, and providing early  guidance." In CYL membership expansion, they emphasize sources,  by expanding CYL membershp among high school, technical high  school, and technical school students; in industrial  distribution, by emphasizing places where new organs and  employees in economic development congregate, and by conducting  active CYL-building in financial institutions that are springing  up in large numbers, such as foreign banks and securities and  trust investment companies, as well as industries, such as  hotels and tourism. The CYL Shanghai Party Committee holds  that these industries have rapid youth mobility, high employee  quality, and a large guidance role of work and life styles on  youth in other industries. Moreover, in the course of  developing Shanghai into an international financial and trade  metropolis, as the number of youth employed in these new lines  will continue to grow, Shanghai's CYL membership-building has  had to "move to the forefront, and provide early guidance," in  order to keep the initiative.    In training "multi-talented" CYL cadres, the CYL  Shanghai Party Committee is also in the CYL front ranks.  Having summed up experiences in recent years in this area,  they hold that "multi-talented" CYL cadres should be defined as  combinations of political and economic quality, practical  grassroots work experience and leadership management skills, and  different positions and experiences. So the training of  "multi-talented" CYL cadres is aimed at overall political  quality, appropriate work skills, rational knowledge structure,  and rich practical experience. As to training ways, the CYL  Shanghai Party Committee has created a style combining  diversified forms, such as on-the-job training, work-release  for study at party schools, commissioned training at  specialized schools, job-related training for CYL cadres, and  job rotation and exchange of CYL cadres.    While Gansu is an inland province with a relatively  undeveloped economy, the CYL Gansu Party Committee has also made  its own successes and explorations in grassroots CYL-building.  Based on the demonstration counties that they have established  in CYL grassroots organization in recent years, they have  proceeded from the grassroots-building goal of "permanent  invigoration," combined with local economic-development  realities, to conduct an experimental "youth S&amp;T development  zone establishment" in Gansu's Yumen City and Gaolan County.  After CYL Party Committee help in getting loans as starter  funds, organizing various specialized joint-production  collectives in the form of rural youth share cooperatives,  investment-project declarations by various CYL branches, and  examination and approval by departments, such as municipal and  county CYL committees, they selected feasible and practical  S&amp;T  projects for development in industries, such as breeding,  cultivation, manufacturing, and cultural activities, organizing  youth to get rich through work and S&amp;T. This developed the  local  economy by enriching CYL youth, while strengthening CYL  grassroots cohesion. These two places' CYL rates are now up  from the former 11-12 percent to 19-20 percent. Moreover, as the  establishment and development of these applied S&amp;T projects  were  all controlled by the CYL organization, their operating  efficiency has sharply added to the CYL's economic might. Xu  Weizhong [1776 4850 1813], director of the CYL Gansu Party  Committee Organization Department, predicts that the original  goals for participaion in this project, of rural CYL branch  income of 1,000 yuan a year, township CYL Party Committee income  of 50,000 yuan a year, and CYL Yumen City Party Committee and  CYL Gaolan County Party Committee income of 200,000 yuan a year  each, will be realized.    So while the CYL is certainly facing severe  organization-building challenges in our establishment and  development of a socialist market economy, our creative CYL is  also responding with new explorations and successes. And while  we certainly do not expect CYL organization-building to be  accomplished in one stroke, to reach our goal in one step, or to  accomplish our heavy CYL organization-building task once and for  all, CYL members will continue to fight, advancing steadily to  lay a fine organizational foundation for CYL work to reach new  heights and create a new order.</p>

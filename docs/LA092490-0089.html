			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD ISSUE SHOULD CITY CHANGE ITS NAME?;  </P> <P> OXNARD, INCORPORATED AS A CITY JUNE 30, 1903, WAS NAMED FOR BROTHERS HENRY,  JAMES, ROBERT AND BENJAMIN OXNARD, WHO BUILT A SUGAR FACTORY. THE AREA WAS  FORMERLY CALLED KASUNALMU (THE SENDING PLACE) AND PLEASANT VALLEY. THE CITY  MOTTO IS "MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY NAME." SHOULD THE CITY CHANGE ITS NAME?;  </P> <P> ROB VARLEY;  </P> <P> EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OXNARD CONVENTION AND VISITORS BUREAU  </P> <P> We don't need to change the name; we need to change people's attitude and think  positively about it. I would encourage our resort operators when they're  talking to potential customers about their amenities to remind them that it's  in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Then Oxnard will be associated with beaches and rich agriculture and  recreation, instead of the dingy little farm town it was 20 years ago.  Out-of-towners who haven't been here for awhile come back and say they can't  believe the changes we've made in Oxnard. If they had a referendum on a name  change, I think the name Oxnard would win, based on civic pride. Besides,  changing the name of a city would be a massive undertaking, what with having to  change the letterhead and signage, for instance. We could add Santa to our name  and be Santa Oxnard. The thing that I like about the word Oxnard is that once  you tell people the name, they never forget it.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation news leaves Dow flat Wall Street Good news on inflation and a big rally in bond prices failed to lift US stock markets on Thursday, and the main indices all ended the shortened week flat or lower, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.54 at 3,396.48. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.89 lower at 441.84, while the Amex composite finished down 1.43 at 416.24, and the Nasdaq composite 2.55 weaker at 666.33. NYSE trading volume was 282m shares. Equities perked up briefly at the opening in reaction to the news that the March producer price index rose 0.4 per cent. Although the increase was above some forecasts, the bulk of the increase was attributable to higher energy prices. If the volatile food and energy components were excluded from the PPI, the 'core' rate of producer price inflation rose by only 0.1 per cent. After two months of higher-than-expected core PPI readings, the weak March figure was a welcome sight for the inflation-sensitive bond market, where prices surged, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue down to 6.85 per cent. Ultimately, however, the good inflation news and the big drop in yields failed to sustain equity prices, which quickly fell back from their early highs. News of poor corporate earnings, coupled with some futures-related sell programs, ensured that stocks remained in negative territory all day. The big corporate story of the day was US Surgical, which plunged Dollars 15 1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 in volume of 7m shares after the company warned that it expects second and third quarter sales, and second quarter profits, to be significantly lower than a year ago. Aluminium Company of America dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 60 3/8 in volume of 1.5m shares as investors reacted badly to Wednesday's late announcement that first quarter net income fell to 31 cents a share, down from 64 cents a share a year earlier. After the news the brokerage house, Smith Barney, reduced its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Philip Morris, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 in volume of 7m shares, remained under selling pressure in the wake of last week's announcement that it was slashing the price of its Marlboro cigarettes in an attempt to salvage market share. Westinghouse Electric climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 in busy trading after the company announced it will sell, for Dollars 1bn, most of the commercial property assets of its financial services unit to an partnership run by investment bank Lehman Brothers. Canada TORONTO was depressed by losses in gold and metal shares after PainWebber downgraded its recommendation for Alcan Aluminium. The TSE-300 composite index eased 9.62 to 3,591.80, and turnover retreated from CDollars 514.6m to CDollars 430m.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1ST MAN ON MOON BACKS PLANNED SPACE STATION  </P> <P> Neil A. Armstrong, who walked into history 20 years ago July as the first man  on the moon, made a rare public appearance today with his two Apollo 11 crew  mates and endorsed NASA's planned space station.  </P> <P> At a news conference to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their historic  flight, Armstrong, 58, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin, 59, and Michael Collins, 58,  reminisced about their July 16, 1969, blastoff atop a mighty Saturn 5 rocket  and the mission that fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's promise to land men  on the moon before the end of the 1960s.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, I did make a statement endorsing the concept of a permanent  presence in space," Armstrong said. "I guess I still feel that's a worthy  objective. I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality before we have  another 10 years go by."  </P> <P> Armstrong was referring to NASA's plans to build a permanently manned space  station in the late 1990s, a project that is threatened by budget cuts and a  lack of political support.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mars Mission Endorsed  </P> <P> Aldrin called for an evolutionary approach to exploring the solar system while  Collins strongly endorsed a mission to Mars.  </P> <P> "I think this country should set a goal of exploring and setting up on Mars,"  Collins said. "That is the one goal that . . . I think would have a unifying  and perhaps even an electrifying effect on NASA and our space program."  </P> <P> Armstrong and Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969,  in a spider-like lunar module spacecraft called Eagle while Collins orbited 69  miles overhead in the gumdrop-shaped Apollo command module, Columbia.  </P> <P> "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong said as  he stepped onto the moon's surface.  </P> <P> While Aldrin and Collins have granted interviews and written books, Armstrong,  a very private man, has routinely refused to meet the press or make public  appearances.  </P></p>

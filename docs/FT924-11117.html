			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GM Firth selling most of Arthur Lee stake to Carclo Engineering GM Firth is selling almost all its stake in Arthur Lee to Carclo Engineering Group. If accepted by Firth shareholders Carclo will hold 29.99 per cent of Lee. Carclo is paying 80p a share for a 10.52 per cent holding and has conditionally agreed to buy a further 11.53 per cent at the same price. The second deal is subject to approval but holders of 43.3 per cent of Firth have indicated their intention to accept. Firth has also reached agreement with its bankers for the provision of continuing bank facilities subject to certain asset sales and the provision of a Pounds 350,000 loan by Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman and chief executive of Firth, to Clarkes of Stillington, a Firth subsidiary. The loan, which is secured on steel owned by Clarkes, also requires approval. The result will be a cash inflow to Firth of about Pounds 5.8m reducing bank borrowings to Pounds 8.8m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] A government official revealed that the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC] and the Khmer Rouge have already  chosen their representatives to the roundtable commission. The  four representatives from the RGC are: "Sok An, Tol Loah, Yu  Hokkri, and Chhuo Leanghuot." But this official did not confirm  whether there will be any change in this composition before the  commission's scheduled meeting is held in Phnom Penh on 15 June  under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong. The  roundtable commission delegation from the Party of Democratic  Kampuchea [PDK] will arrive in Phnom Penh on 13 June to attend  the meeting.    According to a report on 10 June by the CAMBODIAN DAILY in  English, the four PDK delegates on the commission will be chosen  from among the following six officials: "Chan Youran, Mak Ben,  Tep Khunnal, Tup Kiem, Meas Chey, and Sok Roeu."    The topics on the agenda are:    1) The answer from both sides on whether they will or will  not accept a permanent cease-fire in Cambodia.    2) The PDK's proposal on the minimal policy program.    Various analysts have expressed doubts that the 15 June  meeting will be successful because the Pyongyang roundtable  failed despite the fact that it was chaired by the king himself.</p>

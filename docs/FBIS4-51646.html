			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 KYODO -- A North Korean diplomat  said Friday [29 April] the replacement of spent fuel rods at a  nuclear power plant cannot be postponed and replacement of the  rods will go ahead with or without the oversight of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "If the production of electricity is to continue, then it is  necessary to change the fuel rods... The matter of changing the  fuel rods is in no way related to the agency (IAEA)," said Tae  Chong-chae, a minister at the North Korean embassy in Beijing.    Last week North Korea invited IAEA inspectors to view the  removal of the rods at an experimental nuclear reactor at  Yongbyon, a key nuclear facility suspected by the west of  producing weapons grade plutonium.    The IAEA has yet to respond to the invitation and is  awaiting  Pyongyang's response to IAEA demands concerning the history of  the plant.    A team of IAEA inspectors sent to North Korea in March  returned to their home base in Vienna claiming that North Korean  officials had interfered with their two-week inspection, leading  to a further deterioration in the yearlong standoff over  Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program.</p>

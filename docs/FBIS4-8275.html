			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry  denounces Wednesday's [6 April] massacre in the north Israeli  town of Afula in which innocent people, including women and  children, were killed, says a statement given to CTK today.    The militant Islamic organization Hamas said in its  statement  the Afula attack was retaliation for the massacre in Hebron in  the occupied West Bank in February in which a Jewish extremist  shot dead 29 Palestinians. The Afula massacre claimed the lives  of seven people and of the attacker himself, and 50 people were  wounded.    The Ministry "is opposed on principle to the solution of  problems by the use of violence and terrorist actions which only  aggravate the situation in the Middle East," the statement says  and expresses support for political settlement on the basis of  dialogue.    "The Israeli-Palestine agreement the implementation of which  has been the subject of intensive negotiations indicates a  suitable way of solving the situation," the statement says.</p>

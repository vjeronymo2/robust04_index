			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: Moving into the fast track - High-speed digital networks are the next leap forward International Business Machines has joined a growing body of companies in the computer and communications industries backing Asynchronous Transfer Mode as the definitive technology for high-speed digital networks - the 'information superhighways' of the future. ATM is 'the springboard to the next great leap forward in communications,' says Ellen Hancock, IBM senior vice-president and general manager of IBM Network Systems, which this week announced plans for a range of ATM products. 'We have made a fundamental shift to increase our investments in developing ATM,' she adds. ATM is a set of international standards that define a new method for sending large quantities of voice, data and video information simultaneously over networks linking computers across offices, and ultimately across continents, at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than is currently possible. Worldwide demand for ATM products will rise from Dollars 275m (Pounds 185m) this year to Dollars 3.1bn in 1997, predict analysts at Gartner Group, a US high-technology market research firm. ATM is based upon the same principals as the 'packet switching' technology used in today's data communications networks such as BT's Tymnet. Information is broken up into 'packets' or 'cells', each labelled with an address to which it must be delivered. To accommodate different types of information, such as video and voice signals, ATM establishes a standard cell format and size. In this way, ATM provides the communications equivalent of a multi-lane highway along which information cells can travel at varying speeds, switching lanes to overtake slower 'vehicles'. In contrast, today's data networks resemble single-lane streets, with speed restrictions. Traditional telephone networks might be compared with the railways, with voice traffic being routed by circuit switches like as the 'points' on the tracks. Although well suited to long voice messages, or 'trains', these networks are less efficient carriers of the shorter 'bursty' signals that computers typically send. The primary advantage of ATM is that it can be used to expand the amount of information existing networks can carry by making more efficient use of the bandwidth. It is also well suited to 'multimedia' applications and provides the basis for 'internetworking'; linking local and wide area networks. ATM is not the first digital communications technology to promise such advantages. IBM is one of many companies to have invested in the development of products based on Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), an earlier digital telecom- munications standard, that has not lived up to expectations for widespread implementation, particularly in the US. IBM is more sanguine about the prospects for ATM. 'We believe that the demand is there for cost-efficient bandwidth and multimedia communications,' says Hancock. 'ATM is a technology that responds to real needs.' Providing a 'graceful migration path' to ATM, so that customers can take advantage of the new technology while preserving their investments in existing networks, is the critical issue in the emerging ATM market, says Stan Kramer, ATM product line manager at Stratacom, a Silicon Valley company that is one of the pioneers in high-speed networking technology. IBM also acknowledges its customers are looking for a way gradually to incorporate ATM technology into their networks. 'We've designed a strategy that lets them do exactly that,' says Hancock, 'by bringing users on local area networks (LANs) into the ATM world, then linking users throughout the enterprise. And they won't have to discard current equipment to do this.' The first IBM products incorporating ATM technology will be introduced next year. These will include adapter cards for computer workstations and servers, and IBM's intelligent switching hub, developed in partnership with Chipcom, a Southborough, Massachusetts, manufacturer of networking equipment.</p>

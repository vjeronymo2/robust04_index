			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Labsystems helps Life Sciences to 22% advance at Pounds 10.3m LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer, increased pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 8.48m to Pounds 10.3m in the six months to June 30, helped by the May acquisition of Labsystems, the Helsinki-based instruments group. However, Mr Simon Constantine, acquisitions and finance director, pointed out that about half of Labsystems' Pounds 1.54m trading profit contribution derived from a one-off shipment of about Pounds 1.1m to its equipment distributor in the US, on which few expenses devolved to the enlarged group. Trading profits of continuing operations expanded to Pounds 8.64m, compared with Pounds 7.83m, with which Mr Constantine was 'content', although he said that the group had had 'no help from the market, especially in the first quarter'. But he said that the acquisition of Labsystems - for Pounds 33.5m funded by equity (Pounds 12m) and debt - had created a platform for the medium-term growth of the group. Before the purchase, 67 per cent of Life Sciences' business was in North America and 23 per cent in Europe. After the acquisition Labsystems' European bias had shifted the percentages to 56 and 35 per cent respectively. As well as geographical balance, the acquisition also complemented Life Sciences' range of products, increasing consumables from 5 to 20 per cent of the product whole. Since the end of the period the group has also acquired Alko Diagnostic, a maker of consumables, for Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 4.4m) and Memphis Biomedical Services for up to Dollars 1.5m. Consequently. group debt has risen to Pounds 30.9m, giving gearing of about 70 per cent. Mr Constantine conceded that the balance sheet was 'a bit stretched'. The interim dividend is lifted by 17 per cent to 1.4p compared with 1.2p, payable from fully diluted earnings per share of 4.3p against 3.8p.</p>

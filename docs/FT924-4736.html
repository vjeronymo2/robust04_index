			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Those who spent countless hours in their youth balancing on pairs of steps or crouched in basements reading the stock in London's secondhand bookshops will want to see Channel 4's art and culture magazine, Without Walls. It promises 'a 40-minute film exploring the outer edges of London's used-book trade introducing us to a bizarre array of characters along the way'. (9.00). In his first series looking at British industry, Sir John Harvey-Jones made one excursion into the public sector to visit a hospital. In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2) he visits the troubled South Yorkshire police force. Film director Lindsay Anderson presents the first of a two-part profile of film director John Ford in Omnibus (10.25 BBC1). If James Stewart is right it will be no mean undertaking. Stewart said 'Take everything you've ever heard and multiply it about a hundred times and you still won't have a picture of John Ford'. Between 'The Tornado' in 1917 and '7 Women' in 1966, Ford made more than 100 movies, including 'Stagecoach', Cheyenne Autumn' and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, which is being shown on BBC1 at 11.15.</p>

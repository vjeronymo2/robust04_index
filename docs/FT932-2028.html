			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: Factors behind the swift decline in unemployment Sir, It has been suggested that the unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment relative to the recovery in output may have been caused by changes in labour law or in the way in which the unemployed are registered. But another possible contributory cause seems to have been overlooked. In response to the changes that have taken place in the tax system and in capital markets, companies are now paying out more of their profits in interest and dividends and are retaining less; and they have become more afraid than they used to be of being taken over if they cut their dividends. Consequently, when output has fallen, they have felt obliged to act more quickly than before to save their profits by cutting employment; and now, left with no margin of labour to spare, they have to act more quickly than before to take on labour when demand for their products recovers. The corollary is that productivity will fluctuate less than before in the business cycle: it will keep up better in the downswing, as has happened; and it will show less of a recovery in the upswing. And the economy will be more volatile, since any initial change in demand will be transmitted more quickly than before into changes in employment, and hence into changes in consumer spending, and it will be cushioned less than before by company savings. These effects may have been amplified by the reduction in the rate of corporation tax in recent years. For if a smaller part of profits is taken in tax, a smaller part of the profits that are foregone by a company when it retains an extra employee comes out of the revenue of the exchequer, and a larger part out of the post-tax income of the company. The pressure to dismiss labour is intensified. What effect the changes that have taken place in the financing and taxation of companies have had on their underlying efficiency is a separate issue. My concern is to explain the apparent change in the cyclical behaviour of employment. Robert Neild, Trinity College, Cambridge CB2 1TQ</p>

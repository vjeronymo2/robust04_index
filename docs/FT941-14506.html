			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Brewers welcome licensing change The government's decision to amend the liquor licensing law to allow children under 14, accompanied by an adult, into pub bars in england and wales was widely welcomed by brewers and pub operators. The move will bring the law in england and wales - which at present restricts children to pub dining areas or family rooms - into line with changes introduced in scotland two years ago. Under the bill's provisions licensing justices would be able to grant a children's certificate to any licensee provided they were satisfied that the bar concerned was a suitable environment and that meals and non-alcoholic drinks would be available. The brewers' society said: 'we believe many people are keen to see at least some pubs granted children's certificates. About one in six pubs in scotland now caters for children. 'We are concerned, however, that certificates should be granted in a consistent way throughout the country, and that the licensing authorities do not make unreasonable demands on licensees who apply for them.' The campaign for real ale strongly supported the move. with the consumers' association, it expressed disappointment that the bill did not provide a clear statutory basis for pub licensing in general instead of allowing magistrates unfettered discretion.</p>

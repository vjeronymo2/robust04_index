			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Islamic venture fund plan PLANS TO raise a Dollars 400m (Pounds 224.5m) venture capital fund to make investments according to Islamic doctrine have been launched. The First Islamic Venture Capital Company is offering up to 40m shares at Dollars 10 each. The company intends to invest in established, profitable enterprises in Europe and the Islamic world, although some of its investments in Islamic countries will be in infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges, which will make a lower return. This is believed to be the first time that a specifically Islamic or ethical fund has been launched. The fund will not make investments that produce interest or rents, nor will it back banks, finance houses, breweries, casinos or tobacco companies. It is designed to appeal to Moslem investors and others seeking an ethical investment. Up to 40 per cent of the fund's assets will be invested in Islamic countries, and at least 30 per cent in Europe. The remaining 30 per cent will be invested in international equities to provide liquidity and income. Within the ethical code, investments will be made on a commercial basis. The fund expects to make between 10 and 30 investments, according to Mr Derek Bartlett of City Financial Asset Management, which will manage the fund's liquid assets. First Islamic takes the form of a close-ended investment company - it will stop issuing shares once its agreed capital is reached - incorporated in the Isle of Man. It will have an expected life of about 18 years, after which time it plans to go into voluntary liquidation. Piper Investment Management, which has a venture capital fund specialising in the retail sector, will manage the European portfolio, while the Mohammed Group, with interests in housing, industrial, agricultural and media projects, will advise on marketing in Islamic countries. The offer period for the shares closes on October 9.</p>

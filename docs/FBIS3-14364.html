			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  made a statement following President Husni Mubarak's meeting  with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' today. He said that  al-Shar' briefed the president on the latest developments in the  peace process, the Arab League meeting, several issues of joint  Egyptian-Syrian interest, and the coordination of  Egyptian-Syrian political moves in the context of collective  Arab action and the resumption of the peace negotiations.    Asked about Syria's position on the U.S. President's recent  remarks on Jerusalem, al-Shar' replied: Our views on this issue  are known. Jerusalem is an inseparable part of the occupied  Arab territories and is subject to the same principles governing  the rest of the territories.    Al-Shar' affirmed that Israel must withdraw from all the  occupied territories because the peace process began with the  understanding that the pertinent UN resolutions would be  implemented. He noted that these resolutions refer to Jerusalem.    Asked about Syria's position on resuming negotiations,  al-Shar' pointed out that Syria's position on peace is clear and  no international doubts remain about the necessity of attaining  a just and comprehensive peace.    He added that resisting the occupation is a nation's  legitimate right, which is only terminated by ending the  occupation and is not subject to bargaining.    Asked why no meeting of the Arab cordon states was held on  the sidelines of the Arab League Council session, the Syrian  foreign minister remarked that actually no invitation was issued  for such a meeting, but bilateral discussions were held on the  sidelines of the Arab League conference. He added: We will  continue these bilateral contacts and when the need for a  meeting of the cordon states arises, we will use diplomatic  channels to arrange one.    In response to a question whether any new developments had  occurred in connection with the Syrian-Israeli negotiations,  al-Shar' said there have been no new developments but there is  now a better understanding and recognition of the importance of  the Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and  U.S. President Clinton in January and its results. He explained  that this means there is now a better understanding of Syria's  leading role in the peace process.    In connection with the recent U.S. announcement that it  received a Syrian response about resuming the Syrian, Jordanian,  and Lebanese negotiations with Israel in April, the Syrian  foreign minister was asked to comment on the fact that the PLO  was not mentioned in this announcement. He was asked if this  meant a separation of the PLO's negotiating track from the other  three. Al-Shar' replied: Syria has no plans, and I believe our  Lebanese and Jordanian brothers have no plans either, to  separate our negotiating tracks from the Palestinian track.    The Syrian foreign minister continued: Regrettably the  opposite happened. Those in charge of the Palestinian track  separated it from the other Arab tracks. This affair is  well-known to the Arab citizens and in international circles too.    Al-Shar' pointed out that negotiations between the PLO and  Israel have actually been resumed in Tunis and then in Cairo and  will continue. He said the Palestinians did not coordinate this  resumption of the talks with the other Arab parties concerned  with the peace process.    He added: In Syria, of course, we attach great importance to  coordination and will maintain our bilateral communications,  especially with our Lebanese and Jordanian brothers.    Responding to a question on Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's  recent statement on the need for Syria to show its genuine  desire for peace to the Israeli people so that Israel may define  the line from which it will withdraw from the Golan, al-Shar'  said that withdrawal from the Golan is a lawful, legal, and  binding demand according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and  338 and Article 25 of the UN Charter, which expressly calls for  member countries' commitment to implementing Security Council  resolutions. He stressed that Israeli withdrawal from the Golan  is not negotiable and, consequently, total withdrawal is a  requirement that must be met in accordance with Resolutions 242  and 338. He said: Despite this, Syria called for total peace  in return for total withdrawal and we are waiting to hear  similar talk from the Israelis, that is, to declare that they  are ready for total withdrawal in return for total peace.    In reply to a question on Syria's position on the Arab  boycott of Israel, al-Shar' said that the Arab boycott of Israel  is a legal action and is in accordance with the Arab countries'  declaration made as a result of the state of war between the  Arab countries and Israel and Israeli occupation of Arab  territories. He said that as long as the reasons for the  boycott are valid, the Arab boycott will remain binding to the  Arab countries collectively or individually. He stressed that it  is wrong to request the Arabs to cancel the boycott while Israel  continues to occupy Arab territory. Such a demand, he said,  gives the impression that you ask me to cancel a legal and  lawful decision to support an illegal and unlawful position,  namely the occupation of land. He said: The boycott of Israel  is legal and lawful but the occupation is illegal and unlawful.</p>

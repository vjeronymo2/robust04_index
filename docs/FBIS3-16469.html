This is why so much importance  is being attached to contacts between the leaders of their  defence authorities. This was the key idea behind today's  meeting in Moscow between Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  and U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry.    A personal relationship between the two countries' defence  ministers is no less important and need further deepening, the  meeting was told.    Following talks between the two delegations, William Perry  and Pavel Grachev are due to hold a one-to-one conversation.  The Russian minister told journalists he wanted to discuss with  his opposite number from the United States the situation in  Bosnia, Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace  programme, joint peacekeeping, the problem of nuclear arms,  including their withdrawal from Ukraine and a wide range of  problems relating to better relations between the military  authorities of the two countries.    Also today, William Perry is due to meet First Russian  Deputy  Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Chief of Staff Mikhail  Kolesnikov.    According to American sources, Perry, 66, is a true  professional with deep knowledge and extensive experience. He  favors the development of the Stealth bombers, Cruise missiles  and high- precision electronic-optical homing devices.</p>

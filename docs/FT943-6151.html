			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Argyll sells 151 small stores to Spar for Pounds 19.7m Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest food retailer, has sold 151 of its smallest Lo-Cost and Presto supermarkets for Pounds 19.7m to a consortium of five companies operating under the Spar banner. The deal rids Argyll of most of its Lo-Cost and Presto stores smaller than 4,000 sq ft, allowing it to concentrate on larger stores operating under those names and on the Safeway superstore chain. The future of the Lo-Cost discount chain has been under review since May when Argyll said operating profits in its Presto/Lo-Cost division had fallen by 20 per cent to Pounds 40.7m in the year to April 2. Analysts attributed much of the fall to Lo-Cost. It was hit by increased price competition in the grocery sector, and particularly by the 'Price Check' campaign launched in May 1993 by the Gateway group, now Somerfield. Some 123 Lo-Cost and 28 Presto stores are being sold. Fixtures and fittings and goodwill have been sold for Pounds 10.7m, and Argyll expects to realise at least Pounds 9m more from property transactions. That would represent a Pounds 7m profit over the Pounds 12.7m book value of the stores, whose annual sales are Pounds 150m. The stores will be converted into Spar convenience stores and all 1,750 staff will be kept on. 'These stores have gone to a natural home, given their size and location,' said Mr Colin Smith, Argyll's chief executive. Mr Smith said Lo-Cost had remained profitable. But further evidence of the pain felt by some discounters was provided by last month's profits warning from Shoprite, the discount chain operating mainly in Scotland. The sale leaves Argyll with 144 Lo-Cost stores, of which fewer than 50 are smaller than 4,000 sq ft. Mr Smith said the trading prospects of the remaining stores would be kept under review. Argyll is conducting a strategic review of all its businesses. The consortium buying the stores includes AF Blakemore, the family-owned wholesaler; Appleby Westward, the grocery distributor; Alfred Jones; Capper; and James Hall. Lex, Page 16</p>

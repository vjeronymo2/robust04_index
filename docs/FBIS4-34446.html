			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by President Fidel Castro during news conference </F> with domestic correspondents following the fourth Ibero-American  summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 16 June; from the  "Doing Radio" program -- recorded]    [Text] I cannot say that there are paramount differences  between summits. Progress was made at all of them, and  altogether they represent something positive. The summits are  being honed. We are never fully satisfied with everything  discussed or said at the summits. Yet, the fact that the  summits are taking place is an important step in Latin American  history. As I told representatives of the solidarity groups  today, it is the first time in history that we meet or hold  meetings...[pauses] This is already the fourth.    The summits have gained strength. These Latin American  summits have become institutionalized. Each one has made a  contribution, fostered certain accords, and promoted specific  results. The summits, in general, yield results. They have  fostered greater awareness, understanding, and a spirit of  cooperation among Latin American leaders. This is reflected in  the diverse steps the Latin American peoples are taking toward  integration. The summits' value does not lie in what is  accomplished but in what is fostered. The summits have truly  fostered much.    I liked this summit. Guadalajara was first; Rio was also  good; some things came out of Spain. The Caribbean atmosphere,  this city's spirit, the hospitality, the quality -- although  also present in Rio and Guadalajara -- contributed to this  summit. We felt closer to our climate and character.    You can see how important these summits are by the fact that  they have prompted the Miami summit. Our northern neighbors are  worried and envious of the fact that this movement continues to  grow and advance and has attained specific results in  establishing subregional integration mechanism. Therefore, they  want to have their own. We do not know if they want to hold it  annually. Of course, they began by excluding us, which is a  clear act of cowardice. They fear debate and discussion. They  fear the truth.    They know I would go to the summit even if it were held in  the very city of Miami. The truth, however, is that they do not  want to see me there. This exclusion is mediocre and cowardly  and reflects political weakness. As I explained, however, I am  not opposed to that summit. On the contrary, we must start  discussing the issues that ought to be discussed at that summit  because it is an opportunity. One cannot reject an opportunity  to have the Latin American and Caribbean peoples go there and  talk with the alleged masters of this hemisphere. I hope they  have enough spirit and courage. There are always certain  courageous men that will express certain truths at that summit  and defend the many interests of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

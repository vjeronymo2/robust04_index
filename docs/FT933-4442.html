			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / French railways try to refine Socrates FRANCE'S national railway yesterday announced a series of measures to draw passengers back into its carriages following an unfortunate brush with high technology. Mr Jacques Fournier, president of the SNCF rail company, sought to restore its image as one of Europe's most efficient services following the introduction of a computer booking system that created chaos and had prospective travellers waiting up to 40 minutes for tickets that were often wrongly priced. The over-complex system, called Socrates, was introduced at the beginning of this year at a cost of about FFr1.3bn (Pounds 140m). Plagued by software problems, it tarnished the image of France's proud railways, contributing, along with recession, to a 6 per cent cent fall in passengers in the first half of the year. Mr Fournier assured passengers that more technical problems had now been ironed out. The system had succeeded in making 18m reservations in June, July and August and could make 420,000 reservations daily, compared with 201,930 a day under the old system. But just in case of hiccups, SNCF will allow passengers to board a train with a simple 'ticket of access' and pay the fare in their compartments. This should avoid the biggest problem arising from Socrates' teething troubles whereby frustrated passengers who gave up waiting for tickets and boarded trains without them were liable to be fined. Special offers are to be introduced next month in which young passengers, families and the over-60s will be offered 50 per cent discounts on cards which give reduced rail fares. The validity of reduced-fare cards issued so far this year will be extended by three months. Drawing travellers back onto the trains is not just necessary for the image of SNCF. The company also faces serious financial pressures. Losses so far this year amount to about FFr8bn. With the French government facing a mounting budget deficit, targeted at FFr317bn this year, such shortfalls are increasingly difficult to sustain.</p>

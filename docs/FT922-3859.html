			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / S Korea plans Dollars 12.7bn international airport SOUTH KOREA announced plans yesterday to build a Dollars 12.7bn (Pounds 6.9bn) international airport that it hopes will become the air transport hub of north-east Asia, AP reports from Seoul. The airport would handle up to 100m passengers a year and would be built on a tidal flat between two islands off Inchon, the western port which serves as South Korea's main trade base with China. Financing for the project, however, is expected to cause concern since the country's economy continues to be troubled by a high inflation rate and a large trade deficit. Construction of the airport and its terminals and roads would be completed in 2020, said officials from the Transportation Ministry, which drafted the plan. The airport would have four runways capable of handling 700,000 flights a year. The officials said South Korea needed a new international airport to meet the growing demand for transport between South Korea and China.</p>

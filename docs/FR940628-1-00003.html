			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have also reviewed the regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart B, which provide for certain testing, restrictions on movement, and other restrictions on certain chickens, eggs, and other articles due to the presence of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella enteritidis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These regulations were established in February 1990 [Docket No. 88&hyph;161, 55 FR 5576&hyph;5584] and were most recently amended in January 1992 [Docket No. 91&hyph;193, 57 FR 776&hyph;779]. These regulations are not being revised as part of this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing to revise the regulations in subpart A (referred to below as the regulations) to accomplish two goals. One goal is to make the regulations easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with them. The other goal is to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and psittacosis/ornithosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Psittacosis or Ornithosis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing to change the name of the disease ``psittacosis or ornithosis'' to ``chlamydiosis.'' Since the time the regulations were last amended, accepted veterinary medical terminology has changed. The disease ``psittacosis or ornithosis'' is now generally referred to as ``chlamydiosis.'' In this proposed rule, we will use the term ``chlamydiosis'' when referring to the disease referred to in the current regulations as ``psittacosis or ornithosis.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Exotic Newcastle Disease <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In current &sect;82.1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is defined as the exotic viscerotropic type of Newcastle disease, a contagious, infectious, and communicable disease of poultry. We are proposing to revise the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to include any velogenic Newcastle disease. (``Velogenic'' refers to the severity of the strain of the virus in question.) Velogenic Newcastle disease is an acute, rapidly spreading, and usually fatal exotic viral disease of birds and poultry. If there were an outbreak of any velogenic Newcastle disease in this country, it would be treated in the same way as velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the change to the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we are proposing in part 82, we are proposing to amend 9 CFR parts 92, 94, and 161 to use the term `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' instead of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND), and are proposing to revise the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 9 CFR part 94 to make it consistent with the proposed definition in part 82. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Organizational Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to make the regulations easier to understand, we are proposing to reorganize them. Under our proposal, part 82 would be divided into three portions, instead of the current two. The first portion (proposed subpart A) would concern quarantines and other restrictions imposed only because of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (END). The second portion (proposed subpart B) would concern restrictions imposed only because of chlamydiosis. Subpart C would contain the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella enteritidis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  serotype  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> enteritidis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in proposed subpart A would: (1) Set forth criteria for determining birds or poultry to be infected with, exposed to, or free from END; (2) explain how and when we would impose a quarantine; (3) list specific requirements for moving quarantined birds, poultry, and other items interstate; (4) explain how and when we would remove a quarantine; and (5) Set forth provisions regarding replacement birds and poultry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in proposed subpart B would: (1) set forth general restrictions on the interstate movement of poultry infected with chlamydiosis and on the interstate movement of other items related to infected poultry; and (2) list requirements for cleaning and disinfecting premises, vehicles, and other equipment that are or that have been used in holding or moving poultry infected with chlamydiosis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing many other nonsubstantive and substantive changes to the regulations. These proposed changes, which are all intended to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exotic Newcastle disease <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and chlamydiosis, are discussed individually below. Some of these provisions are similar or identical with regard to both the END and the chlamydiosis regulations (proposed subparts A and B). Other changes are particular to the END regulations (proposed subpart A). In this preamble, we discuss first those provisions that are particular to proposed subpart A. We then discuss those provisions that are similar or identical in proposed subparts A and B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions Particular to the END Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing to delete current &sect;82.2(a). This section states that ``poultry, psittacine and mynah birds, and birds of all other species'' are susceptible to END and, therefore, that ``the provisions of [the regulations] shall be applicable in relation to such birds in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions are applicable in relation to poultry.'' This language is not needed in our proposal, because we clearly specify which requirements apply to birds, to poultry, or to both birds and poultry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Task Force <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing to remove or replace all references to ``task force'' and ``Director of the Task Force'' in the regulations. In order to eradicate specific outbreaks of END, we have sometimes established task forces. However, because we do not always do so, the current regulations can be confusing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

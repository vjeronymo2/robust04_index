			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anirban Choudhury: "Crime and Violence Thrive in </F> Border Villages"]    [Text] Malda, April 6--The indiscriminate firing by a BSF  [Border Security Force] jawan leading to the death of six  residents of a North Dinajpur village, about 200 km from here,  has underscored the simmering tension that permeates the border  districts of West Bengal.    Malda, with a 170-km-long border with Bangladesh, is no  exception. The villages here, dotted along the border--from  Kaliachawk to Bamangola--survive on smuggling. Some BSF  personnel serve as catalysts.    Local smugglers reportedly thrive under the patronage of the  panchayats and violence, mostly in connection with  smuggling-related incidents, erupts at regular intervals.    In Malda town itself, out of the estimated 20,000 rickshaw  drivers, 7,000 are suspected to be Bangladeshis, who cross the  border each day to make a living. Intelligence officers here  said that a Bangladeshi has to pay Rs 20 [rupees] to the BSF to  cross over. Most of them return home but some stay back.    The district administration says it is worried at the spate  of criminal activities along vulnerable points along the border.  Kumbhira, Mojonpur, Kumarpur, Atradanga, Modipur and  Muchia-Adampur have been identified as some of the hot-spots.    At a BSF border camp near Adampur this morning, a youth was  seen having a conversation with security personnel. Inquiries  revealed that he was caught by the police only a week ago with  smuggled goods. However, he was back in business. Incidentally,  he was the brother of the panchayat pradhan, a CPI(M) [Communist  Party of India-Marxist] leader.    This isn't a singular case. Today the BSF watch-tower was  vacant and people freely roamed in the "No Man's Land." Just  across the Mahananda River, residents of Bholahat of Bangladesh  were seen bathing. A man crossed the river and proceeded towards  Bangladesh, wading in the waist-deep water.    An elderly resident, apparently scared to identify himself,  said: "We are used to seeing trucks being parked on the  riverbank while smuggled goods are being loaded and unloaded."    Mr Krishnendu Chowdhury, district Youth Congress(I)  president, said that there was a system of "Border Dak" in the  BSF outposts. Under this, the big-league smugglers are allegedly  required to pay hefty sums to the BSF outposts, which, in turn,  allow them to operate freely.    Cattle smuggling and theft of cattle have posed serious  threats to the villagers. They allege that the personnel of the  Bangladesh Rifles, the BSF and smugglers--from both sides of the  border--have forged alliances of convenience at several points  along the border.    And cattle continues to disappear from Indian villages.  Besides cattle, rice, sugar, atta and kerosene continue to be  ferried across the border with impunity. They fetch prices  double those in Indian markets. And in return, arms, gold and  electronic goods are despatched to different parts of India  through various points in Malda.    Seen in this context, last Sunday's firing has put the role  of a section BSF personnel in question. Villagers say that the  BSF personnel's free mixing with known smugglers, harassing  village women and extortion from villagers, have brought the  entire force under a cloud.    Local residents say they are too apprehensive to talk to the  BSF and this has severely affected the organization's  Intelligence network. Also, the committed personnel are  incurring the wrath of the villagers.</p>

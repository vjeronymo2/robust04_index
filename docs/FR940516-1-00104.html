			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to distinguish between ``handheld'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``nonhandheld'' equipment in a manner that is similar to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted by CARB. However, EPA proposes to clarify and expand on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's handheld definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, in cases where the operator carries all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment's weight during engine operation, the equipment would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be classified as handheld. Second, where the equipment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly required to operate in any position the equipment would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be classified as handheld. California's handheld definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that the equipment must both be carried and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multipositionally in order to qualify for handheld status. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on whether this approach may preclude equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is in practice ``handheld'' from qualifying for handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status. The proposed federal definition does not require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both stated criteria be present for a given piece of equipment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify as handheld. One criterion is sufficient. It is EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent that the preceding two criteria allow leafblowers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trimmers (both string and hedge), cutters, or chain saws to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for handheld status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA is proposing that engines be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet Class III, IV, or V standards if the dry weight of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment they are used in, including engine weight, is under 14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kg, there are no more than two wheels present on the equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least one of the following three attributes is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present: (1) The operator alternately provides support or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carries the equipment throughout its performance; (2) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator provides support and attitudinal control for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment throughout its performance; (3) the engine is used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusively in a generator or pump.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that a weight-based criterion is an appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial determinant of whether a 2-stroke engine can be handheld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry data show clear weight distinctions between those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines which are ``lightweight'' and made for handheld operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and those which are not. For example, review of industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brochures revealed that 2-stroke engines were almost always found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in equipment under 14 kg. In addition, the presence of not more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than two wheels in a given piece of equipment is another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important indicator of the need for an operator to either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support, carry, or provide attitudinal control for the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first attribute seeks to classify as ``handheld''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment which is either carried or supported by the operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the entire engine operation. An operator carries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment when the full weight of the equipment is borne by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator. Support means that the operator holds the equipment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position so as to prevent it from falling, slipping, or sinking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire weight of the equipment is not necessarily borne by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operator. Legitimate sources of support might include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground, ice, wood, or concrete. EPA intends that lightweight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snowblowers, edgers, and augers qualify for handheld status under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this first attribute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second attribute classifies as ``handheld'' equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which requires either operator support or attitudinal control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the entire operation. Attitudinal control means the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator regulates either the horizontal or vertical position of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equipment. This definition is meant to allow certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lightweight tillers, augers, or edgers to qualify for handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status. Both ice and earth augers must be carried to each drill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site by the operator, and must be supported by the operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during operation. In addition, the operator must control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vertical attitude of the equipment during operation including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulling upward after each hole is drilled. Tillers without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheels or with no more than two wheels are designed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported or picked up frequently during operation while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maneuvering between rows in a garden. Likewise, the vertical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal position of the tiller is controlled by the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the third attribute acknowledges that engines used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lightweight pumps and generators should be allowed to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld emission standards. Like augers, lightweight generators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pumps are carried to the work site by the operator and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate at significant distances from electrical-power outlets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other equipment would be classified as nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Examples of nonhandheld equipment include lawnmowers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compressors, lawn tractors, garden tractors, tillers with wheels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chippers/grinders, and log splitters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the proposed handheld definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifies sufficient criteria by which all handheld equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types may be classified. However, it may still be possible that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain equipment types which are in practice handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications would not meet this definition. EPA is considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to institute a ``case-by-case review process'' so that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where appropriate in the Administrator's judgment, engines used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in specific types of nonhandheld equipment would either be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassified as handheld or would be allowed to meet the handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards as if that type of equipment was classified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld. In such cases, the Administrator might consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors including, but not necessarily limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equipment function and design (for example, handle placement);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment capability; equipment weight; engine weight; rated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power; multipositional operating requirements; presence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of wheels; presence of other weight supports; availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of similar 4-stroke, electric, and/or nonpowered models by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same manufacturer or competitors; typical operating profiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including season of use), and nationwide annual industry-wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales. The manufacturer requesting such a review might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to demonstrate, based on these and any other pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors, that a 2-stroke engine clearly was a necessary design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature of the equipment concerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

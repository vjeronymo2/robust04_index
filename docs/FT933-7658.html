			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Roof support system at Bilsthorpe and deep mines throughout the world - relies on steel bolts three metres long which are coated with adhesive resin and rammed into the rock above the coal, Clive Cookson writes. The bolts strengthen the sandstone rock in the same way as steel can reinforce concrete. Mr John Harrison, lecturer in rock mechanics at the Royal School of Mines, London, said it was a common misunderstanding that bolts were used to attach a roof to a hard rock stratum. 'In fact the rock supports itself and the tunnel roof becomes a strong beam.' The photograph shows a rock bolted roof at Asfordby pit, Leicestershire. The steel mesh hung from the bolts does not give structural strength but is intended to prevent small pieces of coal or rock falling. Mr Harrison said yesterday that - contrary to claims by the National Union of Mineworkers - rock bolting was faster and cheaper than traditional steel arches and also a safer way to support the roof. He said: 'Rock engineers understand that if you make the rock capable of supporting itself, it is far stronger than any engineering material. Steel arches allow the rock to fail around the arch.'</p>

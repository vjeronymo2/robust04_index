			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> DOWNSIZING AMERICA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. this month announced a major change in corporate strategy by  choosing to sell its Ford Aerospace unit and exit the defense business. The  move followed a similar announcement a month earlier by Chrysler to sell its  aerospace operation.  </P> <P> Both moves recognize a growing problem that, if not adequately dealt with by  other defense contractors, could result in serious harm to our military  production capabilities, aerospace work force and technological  competitiveness.  </P> <P> The problem, in a nutshell, is that there are simply too many defense companies  chasing too little defense business. If companies don't merge or initiate  creative joint ventures to proactively reduce capacity in the near term, they  will be further weakened by their debt loads at a loss to shareholders and  employees. In the interim they need to maximize use of their existing assets by  improving cash flow. This includes selling unproductive assets, such as real  estate, that aren't part of their basic businesses, reviewing options for  pension overfunding and aggressively managing working capital.  </P> <P> If not, as the stock market overreacts to "peace breaking out" by rapidly  pushing down the value of defense stocks, there may be a window of  vulnerability to takeovers of defense firms through leveraged buyouts, as has  recently been the case in other consolidating industries such as retailing or  airlines.  </P> <P> After years of serving the country well, a haphazard breakup of the industry  wouldn't be good for our overall defense posture or for U.S. technological  innovation, which relies a great deal on the work of our defense firms. Many  products or advances such as composite materials, digital communications,  lasers, advanced electronics and space systems trace an important part of their  technological roots to military programs.  </P> <P> Why is there not enough business to go around?  </P> <P> The defense business has always been cyclical. But reduced tensions in the  Eastern Bloc and continued high U.S. budget deficits have resulted in pressures  to cut the American defense budget on a longer-term basis. As budgets decrease  and current order backlogs work off, as they will in the 1990s, a large number  of defense firms may have to get out of the business, and the ones that remain  will face an extremely challenging contracting environment.  </P> <P> Even if budgets were stable, there would be overcapacity. That is because the  nature of our defense programs is vastly different from a decade ago. Today,  military programs have become more complex in design and smaller in number.  Whereas in the past we would build five planes or five missiles capable of  fulfilling five roles, we now build only one plane or one missile to fulfill  five roles. That means fewer pieces of the action for fewer contractors.  </P> <P> Also, the financial returns on defense business are falling. Delayed payment  schedules and the growth of fixed-price development contracts -- in which firms  must perform work on a fixed price and absorb a share of losses if costs rise  -- have shifted more of the financial risk to contractors.  </P> <P> These and other problems have been reflected in the declining stock prices of  defense contractors. Shareholders have seen the firms' market value fall  dramatically in the past two months. A composite index of defense companies,  for example, is currently trading at a discount of over 30% on Standard &amp;  Poor's 400-stock index of industrial firms.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there has been some realization among defense firms of the need to  consolidate. One manifestation of that is through "teaming" relationships on  such programs as the Advanced Tactical Fighter. In that program, a team  comprising Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed is competing against the team  of Northrop and McDonnell Douglas. The thinking is to spread the financial risk  in a difficult environment and keep more contractors involved, albeit with a  smaller piece.  </P> <P> The problem with that approach, however, is that you don't really reduce  overall capacity. In some cases, each team member focuses on a specific  expertise, but in many others, their capability of performing multiple roles is  still maintained. Instead of feeding everybody a full meal, they try to get by  giving them half a meal. That may be a short-term transitional fix, but it will  result in malnutrition in the long run unless defense firms -- large or small  -- merge or otherwise reduce capacity.  </P> <P> European defense firms out of necessity realized the need to merge or divest  long before ours and are well on the road to consolidation. Rather than  plodding along in a declining domestic business, European companies -- well in  advance of the 1992 framework for cooperation -- have seen the need to  consolidate efforts with former competitors. They have moved past the stage of  successful teaming relationships and have announced, at an increasing pace,  large acquisitions such as West Germany's Daimler-Benz buying  Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, or the British-German GEC-Siemens acquiring  Britain's Plessey. They have also pursued mergers or joint ventures, such as  France's Aerospatiale with Alcatel in satellites and British Aerospace with  France's Thomson-CSF in missiles.  </P> <P> But U.S. firms generally have been reluctant to follow this path. Why?  </P> <P> Partly it's because during the Reagan Administration military buildup, they  were not encouraged to do so. A large base of contractors put pressure on each  other to assume greater risks and bid aggressively, motivated by the need to  keep capacity on line and the fear of missing milestone programs and thus being  left out of a generation of technological advancement. This process increased  the role of contractors as bankers, helping to finance the buildup. So long as  the defense budget dollar pool was rising, this system managed to keep a large  base of contractors afloat.  </P> <P> Now with the prospects of fewer defense dollars to spend, the government is  effectively forced to say to those in-debt contractors, "Sorry, I've lost my  high-paying job and can no longer afford the mortgage payments on that  expensive home you're building for me."  </P> <P> Firms have also relied on growth in the commercial sector of the aerospace  industry to balance their risk. But as the experiences of Boeing, McDonnell  Douglas and Lockheed in the mid-1970s or early 1980s painfully showed, their  commercial aerospace businesses were not immune to cyclical vagaries. Even now,  airline stocks have started to tumble after an active year of consolidations,  hinting at the possibility of cancellations of future orders. And Europe's  Airbus Industrie has become a formidable competitor in this previously  U.S.-dominated market.  </P> <P> Firms may also hesitate in following the merger path out of a perception that  the Pentagon, concerned about reduced competition, won't allow large-scale  consolidations. Many companies in fact have believed that Defense Department  concerns would shield them from hostile U.S. takeover bids while the  Exon-Florio Amendment, requiring presidential review of foreign takeovers of  U.S. technology-based companies, would act as a similar hindrance for overseas  buyers.  </P> <P> History has shown, however, that the Defense Department has taken a relatively  passive role in merger cases. And as uses of Exon-Florio indicate, a surprising  number of foreign acquisitions have been permitted with only some minor  tinkering on financial terms.  </P> <P> By the mid-1990s, the U.S. aerospace industry will look significantly  different. A period of consolidation will have dramatically reduced capacity.  With the proactive consideration of industry participants, this process can be  managed to create companies that are strong international competitors. If not,  the process may unfortunately be characterized by a higher level of  bankruptcies, writeoffs, layoffs and financial arbitrage opportunities.  </P></p>

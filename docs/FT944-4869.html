			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (8): Secretive bank lifts veil - Ian Rodger profiles Pictet, undisputed leader of its tribe Swiss banks are notoriously secretive, the country's 18 private banks especially so. These firms, with exotic names such as Mourgue d'Algue or Landolt Lonfat, are in fact private partnerships and operate under a special Swiss law which enables them to keep information about virtually every facet of their business to themselves. No balance sheets or income statements ever emerge from these banks, and the partners - whose liability for their firm's problems is unlimited - rarely talk in anything but the most general terms about their business. They are, of course, supervised by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. That, plus a long tradition of competence, has tended to satisfy their core customer base, the world's so-called high net worth individuals. Undisputed leader of this tribe is Pictet &amp; Cie of Geneva, with a staff of 900 and offices in Zurich, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Montreal, Nassau and Luxembourg. Pictet has about Dollars 30bn in funds under management, ranking it the largest fund manager in Switzerland after the three big universal banks. It also claims to act as global custodian for Dollars 45bn, which includes most of the funds under management. Until recently, Pictet, which was founded in 1805, has been among the most secretive of the private banks, but now that its business is becoming increasingly international, it has begun to lift the veil on its activities and strategies. The firm, with assets of over SFr2bn, is owned, directed and managed by its seven partners (an eighth is due to be appointed). Not all have connections to the Pictet family. Deliberately, the age range is wide, from early 30s to early 60s. 'If you have seven of the same age, they will be rivals,' says Mr Jacques de Saussure, one of them. Shares in the partnership are sold at par to new partners and bought back at par when they retire. Young partners are awarded extra dollops of the firm's profits to help them build up their share stakes. The partners meet every working morning to review problems large and small. Mr de Saussure says important decisions are made by friendly consensus. 'It is very lonely to be a chief executive in a company; when we have a tough problem, we are all in it together.' Pictet's main policies, similar to those in other Swiss private banks, are to eschew diversification, debt, trading for the firm's account and acquisitions. Sometimes, this makes it look over-cautious, but this year when many other banks have taken a beating on own trading, Pictet is purring. Highly qualified young people are sought - fluency in three languages is a prerequisite - and trained to be team players. 'We do not want any stars or gurus,' says Mr Charles Pictet, another partner. The firm likes to control every aspect of the process of investing client funds, from research to custody. With these cautious policies, change cannot happen quickly. Until the early 1960s, Pictet was active only in private banking and mainly for European clients seeking to avoid taxes in their home countries. It then set out to broaden its base, developing from scratch an institutional fund management business and searching wider for private clients. It has taken a generation to achieve these goals. From its London base, Pictet is now recognised by US institutions for its expertise in emerging markets and on small capital stocks in Europe. The London office manages some Dollars 3.5bn in funds. The firm also has a big institutional business in Switzerland and feels well placed to offer its services in neighbouring European countries if and when their pension schemes become capitalised. Mr Pictet says the bank's private clients come from more than 60 countries today, compared with only eight 30 years ago. Services are offered in 12 languages. More recently, the firm has polished up its Swiss equity brokerage and global custody departments to be internationally competitive. One impact of this broadening of activities has been to reduce substantially the firm's dependence on private banking for tax-evading Europeans. As many analysts foresee growing pressures on Switzerland from its neighbours to give up tax evaders, the move appears sensible. Mr de Saussure says only that the partners are pleased with the broadening because it has opened up much greater opportunities for growth. 'The pie is growing, the portion of the pie that is going into asset management is growing even faster. We can take a bigger market share and we have a strong income with which to finance our growth,' he says.</p>

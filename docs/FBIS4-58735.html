			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The agreement on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord was signed yesterday while the combatant  Palestinian groups expressed their opposition to it. With the  signing of this accord, which defines the manner of implementing  a limited autonomy for the Palestinians in Jericho and the Gaza  Strip, the Israeli forces will withdraw from these areas and  delegate their control to Palestinian policemen.    After the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, these areas were  occupied  by the Zionist forces. The signatories of the Gaza-Jericho  accord and their main supporters are seeking to magnify the  importance of the signing of the accord as an end to the Middle  East crisis and a solution to the Palestine issue.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is in the  Middle East to consolidate the process of compromise and was  present at the signing of the document on the implementation of  the Gaza-Jericho accord, lauded it as a historic accord. He  added that it indicates that the two sides are in favor of  putting the era of war and violence behind them, which engulfed  the area for many years.    'Arafat described this accord as an infrastructure for peace  in the region, and the Zionist regime's prime minister said it  would pave the way for peace. The combatant Palestinian groups  proclaimed a day of mourning and a general strike and declared  today a black day. They have openly displayed their opposition  to the Gaza-Jericho accord and have stressed the continuation of  their struggle until the vindication of the true rights of the  Palestinians.    The factor that has motivated the authors of the  Gaza-Jericho  accord to view it as a means to put the Middle East conflict  behind them is that they believe that by propounding a limited  autonomy plan in this region they have catered to the  Palestinian wishes for an independent government and have doused  their fervor for a Palestinian homeland.    The Islamic nature of the Palestinian territories is a  strong  reality that has retained its luster despite the years of  occupation and the homelessness of its citizens and efforts to  destroy their identity. On the basis of this reality, the  establishment of an independent government, which should reflect  this identity, is a historical demand of the Palestinians that  must be achieved or struggles will continue.    In view of this irrefutable reality, the formulators of this  compromise have attempted to delegate a small segment of the  Palestinian homeland with limited autonomy to placate the people  of Palestine and the world. It remains to be seen whether the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord can bring about peace  and compromise between the Zionist regime and the Palestinian  people.    The Palestinians seek the establishment of a government that  protects and upholds all Palestinian characteristics, embraces  the entire Palestinian population, encompasses the entire  historical Palestinian homeland, and enjoys complete and  comprehensive sovereignty. The autonomy propounded on the basis  of the compromise between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime does  not have any of these characteristics. This will result in  opposition by a large section of the Palestinian population.  The declaration of opposition by the Palestinian groups and a  general strike by the intifadah commanders on the day the  document for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord was  signed is eloquent testimony of this fact.    On the other hand, in light of the expansionist nature of  the  Zionist regime, one can say that it does not even consider  itself obligated to abide by the limited agreements in the  accord signed. The killings of Muslim worshipers in the  al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque proved that this regime, along with  those participating in the talks, constantly gives vent to its  savage nature so that it can restrict the Palestinian Muslims  even more. The massacre of Muslims by the Zionists took place  when this regime constantly referred to the Palestinian people's  struggles as extremist actions that disrupt the so-called peace  process. The Zionist regime calls on the obsequious leaders of  the compromise to rein in these actions.    Thus, it may be said that despite the signing of the  compromising accord the Zionist regime ignores it whenever it  deems fit so that it can attain its expansionist objectives.  What is obvious is that the Palestinian issue can only be  resolved when a government that reflects the Palestinian  identity of the people of these territories is established with  complete integrity and the holy land of Jerusalem is liberated  completely from the occupation by the Zionist usurpers.  Otherwise, the Palestinian nation and the Islamic world will  not relinquish their demands and the defeat of plans such as the  Gaza-Jericho accord, which was established on unstable  foundations, will be imminent.</p>

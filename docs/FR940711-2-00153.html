			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA is reviewing its policy on alternative bridge designs (53 FR 21637, June 9, 1988) for consistency with this interim life-cycle cost analysis policy as well as with Executive Order 12893.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is FHWA's LCCA policy for infrastructure investment analyses. It represents good practice that should be followed by States and local transportation agencies in making program and project investment decisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Life-cycle costs are an important consideration in all highway investment decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The level of detail in LCCA should be commensurate with the level of investment involved and the types of alternatives being analyzed. Investments on the NHS generally warrant more detailed analysis than investments on non-NHS routes. Similarly, evaluation of decisions whether to reconstruct or rehabilitate a facility warrants more detailed analysis than consideration of alternative maintenance strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Typical life-cycle cost analysis profiles may be developed and used as the basis for evaluating alternatives for general types of improvements, such as, consideration of alternative pavement designs or different types of bridges on various functional class highways. Major programs and projects, however, often will require consideration of a broad range of alternative rehabilitation and reconstruction options and more detailed analysis of potential alternatives. The potential applicability and use of LCCA profiles will be discussed in greater detail in future technical advisories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Other factors, including budgetary, environmental, and safety considerations, legitimately influence highway investment decisions and should be considered along with the results of LCCA in evaluating investment alternatives. Life-cycle cost analysis principles should be used in conjunction with other appropriate economic analysis techniques in pavement and bridge management systems. Systemwide or network objectives as well as project level concerns should be considered in decisionmaking, and both levels of analysis should consider life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Analysis periods should be for the life of the facility or system of facilities being evaluated and should account for costs of foreseeable future actions. Analysis periods should not be less than 75 years for major bridge, tunnel, or hydraulic system investments, and not less than 35 years for pavement investments. Longer design lives may be appropriate for the NHS or other major routes or corridors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. All appropriate agency costs anticipated during the analysis period should be considered in the analysis, including traffic control costs during maintenance and rehabilitation, costs of special construction procedures required to maintain traffic, and agency operating costs for such things as tunnel lighting and ventilation. In those cases where the agency required to operate a facility is not the one making the investment decision, it is important for the funding agency to include operating costs borne by other organizations responsible for operating the facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. User costs including increased vehicle operating costs, accident costs, and delay-related costs incurred throughout the analysis period should be considered in LCCA. Increased costs due to deteriorated riding surfaces, circuitous routings, and accidents and delays around and through maintenance and construction work zones are all important.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Future agency and user costs should be discounted to net present value or converted to equivalent uniform annual costs using appropriate discount rates. Discount rates selected should be consistent with guidance provided in OMB Circular A&hyph;94.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical advisories on these and other technical issues in the application of LCCA will be issued by FHWA in the future. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: June 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Rodney E.

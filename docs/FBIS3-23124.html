			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An unidentified person telephoned the Qol Yisra'el  newsroom this morning and said he was speaking on behalf of an  organization called Shlomtziyon-Yehuda [The Well-Being of  Zion-Judaea]. He warned that his organization will retaliate to  every terror attack by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or  the Islamic Jihad with murders, in Israel or abroad, which will  be similar to the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The man who  will carry out the act will never be caught. He will commit  suicide to sanctify God's name.</p>

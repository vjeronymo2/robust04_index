			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Boddington's Pounds 26m boosts shares BODDINGTON, the pubs and drinks wholesaling group, topped market forecasts with a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 26.3m for the 53 weeks to January 2. The shares rose 14p to close at 230p. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, who reported 'an encouraging start' to this year's trading, also indicated that the group was in no hurry to dispose of its near-20 per cent stake in JA Devenish, acquired during the unsuccessful bid for the west country pub operator in 1991. Increased dividends from Devenish and lower interest rates reduced the carrying costs of the stake to about Pounds 300,000 a year. 'We are happy to sit on it for the moment,' Mr Cassidy said. 'We regard it as a trading investment which gives us several options.' Boddington could renew its bid, transfer the stake to another potential bidder, or place it on the market. The results further justified the strategic switch out of brewing and demonstrated that it had a sound base for continued expansion, Mr Cassidy claimed. Fully diluted earnings per share improved 30 per cent to 16.2p. A proposed final dividend of 4.7p lifts the total to 7.3p, an increase of 10.6 per cent. Robust trading across the group's operations raised turnover 28 per cent, from Pounds 185m to Pounds 236.2m; trading profit advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 25.8m). Further upgrading of the pub estate - including Pounds 4.5m expenditure on refurbishment - resulted in 34 fewer outlets but increased sales and profits. Pub trading profit improved 10 per cent to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 18.4m) on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 83.9m (Pounds 75.5m). Beer volumes dropped 4.4 per cent against a regional market decline of 5.4 per cent. Food sales through the 236 managed houses doubled. Hotel and restaurant profits rose 55 per cent to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 2.6m) on turnover ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.3m). Restaurants achieved profits of Pounds 2.5m in difficult market conditions. Hotel occupancy rose from 57 per cent to 65 per cent, five points above the national average. The drinks wholesaling division, after recent acquisitions now supplying 20,000 customers from 24 depots nationally, raised profits 75 per cent to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 4.3m) on turnover 50 per cent ahead at Pounds 112.6m. Health care homes recorded a 41 per cent increase in profit to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 2.3m) on turnover 19.7 per cent higher at Pounds 12m (Pounds 10m). Occupancy levels averaged 87.5 per cent against 80 per cent the previous year. The pubs and restaurants were revalued at Pounds 182.5m, 20 per cent below their 1989 value. See Lex</p>

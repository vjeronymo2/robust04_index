			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 21 Apr -- Turkmen-Chinese  summit talks started in Ashkhabad today. Turkmen President  Saparmurad Niyazov and Li Peng, premier of the PRC State  Council, have started discussing specific issues relating to the  development of economic cooperation.    Journalists were allowed to be present only for the first  few  minutes of the meeting. However, these first few minutes did  reveal that the meeting was exclusively about business. An  understanding has virtually been reached on the purchase of  Turkmen cotton by China.    Alongside the official talks, discussion is under way of  draft intergovernmental agreements. These center on matters  relating to projects for sending Turkmen gas to China and a  number of other commercial and economic cooperation issues.</p>

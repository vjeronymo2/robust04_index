			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves higher The German Bundesbank yest-erday sent a clear signal that interest rates are likely to fall when it announced a variable rate for its 15-day securities repurchase tender, writes Philip Gawith. The repo is the main instrument by which the Bundesbank sets money market rates, and a variable rate - more responsive to market forces than if the Bundesbank sets the rate itself - should herald an easing of monetary policy. Yesterday's move came amid indications that last week's turmoil in financial markets, and pressure on the dollar from a stronger yen, have combined to lend strength to the D-Mark. The German currency closed in London yesterday at DM1.7069 against the dollar, a pfennig stronger than its low for the day of DM1.7167. It was also higher in Europe, ending at L988.2 against the Italian lira from Friday's L984.3 close. The prices of UK and German interest rate futures also recovered yesterday, indicating a return to fundamentals in markets' assessment of the outlook for interest rates. The dollar gained initial support from the German repo announcement, and the downing of four Serbian aircraft by Nato. Renewed fears, however, of a stronger yen after the weekend's G7 summit kept the US currency under pressure and it was trading lower in New York, where it finished at DM1.7041 and against the yen at Y104.58. Although the Bundesbank's move to a variable rate repo was not unexpected, it was still welcomed as confirmation that German interest rates are likely to fall further. It is the first time that the Bundesbank has set a variable rate tender since mid-November. The repo rate has been held at 6 per cent since early December. It may, in the short term, prove to be of mostly symbolic significance. For technical reasons - the allocation of funds in this week's repo coincides with the introduction of new minimum reserve requirements for banks - the repo rate is unlikely to fall much. Easing reserve requirements will put liquidity into the market. The Bundesbank will want to drain this liquidity without putting upward pressure on short-term rates which are already high. German call money is trading at about 6.7 per cent, up from 6 per cent before the Bundesbank eased policy on February 17. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), described the move to a variable rate as 'highly significant'. He said the early resumption of European rate cuts, which the Bundesbank move appears to encourage, provided the signal to stop the liquidity withdrawal which has hit world bond and equity markets recently, and also spilled over into currencies. Not all observers were as sanguine. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the variable repo would help, but markets remained 'incredibly nervous'. He said that, although UBS's three-month prognosis for the dollar remained positive, the short-term outlook was 'very depressed'. Mr Chertkow placed the blame for the current uncertainty squarely with the US government. 'The Clinton administration is playing with fire and it could very easily get out of control.' He said a financial meltdown similar to October 1987 was possible. The UBS analyst said the only means of averting this scenario, and arresting a possible dollar rout against the yen, was a 'policy catalyst'. 'The policy (of talking up the yen) emanated from the Clinton administration, and the Clinton administration, through the Fed, must now act,' added Mr Chertkow. Just as the Federal Reserve intervened to support the dollar last August when it fell to Y100.3, so it should do so again, 'actively and publicly'. Putting downward pressure on the dollar was the absence of any clear statement from the weekend G7 meeting of agreement between Japan and the US about their trade differences. The Bank of Japan is trying to counter the strength of the yen, with some traders estimating that the BOJ has been buying dollars to the tune of Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn a day. With the BOJ not apparently enjoying much support in its efforts, there is little confidence that it can resist the trend. Most observers agree that the rate is the function of political events, although some argue that fundamental flows into yen - the current account surplus not being fully offset by capital outflows - could be the dominant force. Sterling had a fairly quiet day. Although the trade dispute with Malaysia is a negative factor, the currency is being underpinned by the prospect of lower interest rates in continental Europe. It finished slightly lower against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4861 from Dollars 1.4904 on Friday. Compared to the D-Mark, it declined to DM2.5366 from DM2.5418. The Bank of England yesterday provided UK money markets with Pounds 325m of late assistance after revising its forecast of the liquidity shortage to Pounds 1.45bn. Earlier it had provided the market with Pounds 1.136bn of assistance at the established rate of 5 5/32 per cent.</p>

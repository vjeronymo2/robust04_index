The discussion came after leaders in  the House of Councillors from both sides agreed in a preliminary  meeting that they will negotiate on possible amendments to  government-sponsored political reform bills.    Juro Saito, chairman of LDP members in the upper house, told  reporters that the coalition and the LDP agreed to search for a  compromise in the upper chamber rather than through a proposed  summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP  President Yohei Kono.    The government bills, aimed at weeding out rampant political  corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in mid-November.    Upper house debate on the package, which features changes to  the electoral system for the lower house and tighter curbs on  campaign funding, is to be concluded on Wednesday, paving the  way for a vote by an upper house panel and a final vote at a  plenary session of the upper chamber.    Representatives of the coalition and the LDP in the upper  house are discussing the LDP's compromise proposals, one of  which calls for a change to the balance between single-seat  districts and the proportional representation system for lower  house elections.    On the possibility of a summit between Hosokawa and Kono,  Saito said only, "it depends on developments in our talks."    Hosokawa has staked his political future on enactment of  necessary reform legislation in the current Diet session, which  ends January 29.</p>

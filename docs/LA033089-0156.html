			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BEAST'S BELLY BRINGS BACK BYGONE BAUBLES  </P> <P> A farmer whose water buffalo swallowed his wife's gold jewelry 12 years ago  patiently waited for the animal to die a natural death, then recovered the  baubles from the beast's belly, it was reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> When the unidentified farmer bought the animal in Kaithal, 50 miles south of  Chandigarh, his wife fed it a traditional mixture of sugary flour from a basin  that she had forgotten also contained her jewelry, the Chandigarh Tribune  reported. The buffalo swallowed the woman's necklace, earrings and bangles  worth about $2,000. Friends suggested that the farmer kill the animal to  recover the jewelry, but he decided to wait until it died a natural death,  which occurred Sunday.  </P></p>

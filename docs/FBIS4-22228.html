			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Pavlo Lazarenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk </F> Oblast State Administration, by Mykola Makarenko in  Dnipropetrovsk; date not given: "Pavlo Lazarenko: `The Regional  Experiment -- Ukraine's Chance for Survival'" -- first four  paragraphs are HOLOS UKRAYINA introduction]    [Text] The idea of regional self-government, which has long  hovered over the Dnieper region, is now taking on a concrete  form. A presidential edict issued on 26 November 1993 granted  the state administrations of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk,  Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk oblasts authority to manage  state-owned property. An experiment was initiated to create a  kind of economic and legal zone capable of functioning quite  independently.    One would have thought that this arrangement would benefit  everybody. The government would no longer be saddled with  concern and responsibility for the situation in the country's  most troublesome and tense region, and the local leadership  would finally be given the opportunity to operate freely in  market conditions.    But the attempts of the regional administrations to bring  the  policies of ministries and departments into conformity with the  president's edict do not always enjoy support from the center.    What does this first experiment in economic self-government  in Ukraine actually entail? We asked P.I. Lazarenko, the head of  the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration, to tell us about  this undertaking.    [Lazarenko] The only thing that the leaders of the four  oblasts wanted was to join efforts in assuring rational and  mutually advantageous management. Especially as in some fields,  even heretofore, our oblasts were very dependent on one another.    The Donetsk-Dnieper region relies on a common energy  potential. In addition to the metallurgical branch, the Donbas  supplies the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhya thermal electric  power stations with coal, while the power these stations produce  is sufficient to meet the needs of other oblasts as well.  Integration in machine-building will also be very productive:  the region's enterprises complement one another wonderfully. We  are already cooperating in the production of a feed-harvesting  combine. We have the "Ukrainian Automobile" program and many  other, very promising ideas. In a situation in which the economy  is collapsing, if we ourselves do not see to it that these ideas  are implemented, no one else will.    As you can see, the creation of a common economic space is  not something that began today; life itself has forced us to  seek out new ways to cooperate. All we need to do is bring to a  logical conclusion a process that began a long time ago. It is  particularly important to do so now that the integration of  oblasts has been secured by the president's edict.    [Makarenko] Did not a similar territorial-economic division  during the period of the national economic councils prove  ineffective?    [Lazarenko] I would not take such a categorical stand on the  councils of national economy. They had their shortcomings, but  they also had their advantages. It was not mere chance that in  the seven and a half years that they existed, the rates of  growth attained in industry, agriculture, and the social sphere  were higher than those achieved in the 25 years since the  introduction of the branch system of management.    Today's experiment also promises a lot. That we wasted time  in starting this experiment and did not manage to settle the  issue of regional ownership by the beginning of this year is  another matter. But the blame for this lies with individual  ministries, which failed to understand the point of the  experiment, as well as the president's edict. Suffice it to say  that although the edict came into force on 26 November 1993, the  drafts of the normative acts needed to regulate its  implementation were not submitted for review to the Ministry of  the Economy until 30 December. Small wonder that the new  economic conditions in which we are beginning to live are now at  variance with acting legislation.    To be sure, it is not all that difficult to bring all the  legal acts into conformity -- this is only a matter of time. The  worst of it is that the fundamental principles on which the  entire, well thought-out concept of egional self-government is  structured are being eviscerated as this concept makes its way  through the various ministerial offices.    [Makarenko] Pavlo Ivanovych, you must agree that one can  understand the ministries in this situation. The Donetsk-Dnieper  region accounts for the lion's share of the revenues that flow  into departmental pockets, especially from such branches as  metallurgy, mining, and the power industry. If the basic  enterprises are handed over to the region, and they ultimately  demonstrate that they can manage perfectly well without the  center, will this not give rise to the question whether there is  any need as such for the ministries as we know them today? This  is a real delayed-action mine for them.    [Lazarenko] It is very likely that many at the departmental  level perceive our initiative in just such terms. But I believe  that the interests of the people and of the state must take  precedence over all else.    Can anything other than personal ambition explain the  following? The list of 857 enterprises proposed by us for  transferring into regional ownership was "cut" by the ministries  by more than half -- to 365. Moreover, the principle according  to which the selection was made defies all logic.    For example, the Ministry of Industry left a number of  ferrous and nonferrous metallurgical enterprises,  scientific-research, and planning and design organizations on  the list, while removing enterprises in the metal products, ore  mining, and coke and chemical subbranch. This, despite the fact  that even a nonspecialist understands that these are components  of a single metallurgical complex.    Enterprises specializing in gas and oil and coal extraction  were left off the list completely, as were all transportation  and communications enterprises. Of 31 enterprises within the  Ministry of Power system, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast got all of...  six, although we asked that the three latter branches be  included in the experiment with a double subordination.    The managers of the republic's building industry also ruined  our plans. At the request of the Ukrmontazhspetsbud, Ukrtsement,  Ukrprombud, and Ukravtodor corporations, not a single enterprise  in the oblast subordinated to them will be handed over. The  building complex "generously" gave us 33 of the 139 enterprises  we asked for.    [Makarenko] This situation reminds me of the well-known  saying: "Here, God, you take what I have no use for..."    [Lazarenko] Yes, but only at first glance. After all, it is  not as if we wanted to take over only the large and strong  enterprises and not want to bother with the unprofitable ones.  The whole point of the experiment is to make both strong and  weak enterprises part of a single economic space and subordinate  them not to a department, but to a common objective --either  cooperation through joint production, or a long-term building  program.    Is it so important to us who runs an enterprise as long as  it  operates and provides people with jobs and the state with  revenues? They just introduced a clause into the decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers which forbids changing the product  specialization of enterprises. Does this mean that a plant that  manufactures products for which there is no demand should die?!  Shut down?! Where is the common sense in this?    [Makarenko] How many such contradictions are there in the  Cabinet of Ministers documents that regulate the implementation  of the edict?    [Lazarenko] Many, unfortunately. In addition to cutting up  the list of enterprises to suit itself, the Cabinet of Ministers  has also drafted a decree on the procedure for managing  enterprises, institutions, and organizations by the state  administrations, which contravenes effective legislation. After  all, all these questions were regulated back in 1992 by the  Cabinet of Ministers decree "On Managing State-Owned Property,"  and no one has revoked this decree. And the Ministry of the  Economy has still not gottten around to reviewing our proposals  regarding other normative acts, without which it is impossible  to pursue an effective economic policy in the region.    [Makarenko] What is the gist of the proposals of the  Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration?    [Lazarenko] We requested that the draft of the decree  include  a clause establishing a regional order for production as part of  the state order, as well as allowing the oblast administrations  to issue export quotas and licenses as part of the same regional  order in order to enable us to effectively resolve socioeconomic  problems. Unless this is done, it is virtually impossible to  regulate price formation and satisfy the region's need for  imported goods.    Second, the acts that have been drafted so far are clearly  inadequate to ensure that the regional economy functions in a  normal and full-fledged anner. In these new economic conditions,  it is imperative to regulate the credit and financial policies  of banks, develop mechanisms for settlement clearing with CIS  members for deliveries of raw materials, fuel and energy  resources, and equipment, and stipulate in greater detail the  procedure for managing state-owned property.    Until all these documents are completed and approved, any  positive changes in the region's economy are out of the question.    In light of this situation, the president of Ukraine was  forced to issue another edict on 21 February 1994 "On Additional  Measures With Respect to Delegating Powers to the  Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk Oblast State  Administrations To Manage State-Owned Property." The edict is  well thought-out and tough. It takes into account the needs of  the region. After all, Ukraine does not live and work in the  capital, but in the regions. The edict provides for export  quotas, for the right to act as guarantor for foreign  investment, and many other necessary things. Essentially, this  second edict says to the officials in Kiev quite unequivocally  that Ukraine does not exist to serve them, but that they exist  to serve Ukraine, and that it is not up to them to accumulate  everything into their own hands and then disburse it. I hope  that the officials will get the right message and not attempt to  continue trying the president's patience...    [Makarenko] In other words, as in any other field, the  purity  of an experiment in economics must also be assured?    [Lazarenko] Absolutely. This experiment will make sense only  if the Cabinet of Ministers executes all the nuances of this  large-scale and unquestionably promising undertaking. On the  other hand, I feel that our government simply does not have the  choice whether to conduct this experiment or not. There are two  presidential edicts, and, most important, we are now in a  situation that threatens us with the collapse of the economy and  a social explosion. All well thought-out proposals for  tabilizing the economy -- be it in the republic or in a region  -- must find support today. We are counting on the government to  take this sober view of the situation.    There is also a need to review our taxation policy. I will  give you an example. Last year, our oblast transferred 220  billion karbovantsi into the Chernobyl fund and got back a mere  two billion. Meanwhile, 26,600 participants in the liquidation  of the accident at the Chernobyl AES reside in Dnipropetrovsk  Oblast, and the oblast still has no rehabilitation center for  them. Next. The State Property Fund "made" 58 billion  karbovantsi on privatizing enterprises in our oblast last year.  I feel that 50 percent of the income from privatization of state  enterprises should be left at the disposal of the region.    In working out the taxation policy, at least one rule should  be adhered to: do not kill the chicken that lays the golden  eggs. Otherwise there will be nothing left to transfer into the  budget.</p>

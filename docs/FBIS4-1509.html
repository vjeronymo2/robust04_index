			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 31 (CNA) -- A 45-member Japanese  delegation will visit Taiwan April 26 to attend a trade seminar  and discuss the purchase of semiconductor products, a China  External Trade Development Council (Cetra) spokesman announced  Thursday.    The April 26-28 seminar will be sponsored by Cetra, the  Electronic Industry Association of Japan (EIAJ), and the  Coordination Council of ROC-Japan Business Affairs.    During the seminar, 19 noted Japanese business groups will  meet with 16 Taiwan electronic manufacturers and suppliers at  the Taipei International Convention Center.    The Japanese delegation will include representatives from  Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba, and Sanyo,  the spokesman noted.    The visit comes after eight Taiwan semiconductor producers,  led by the United Electronic Corp., visited Japan last December.  During the tour, Taiwan producers reaped more than U.S.$40  million in integrated circuit (IC) and other computer peripheral  products trade.    Semiconductors are widely used in electronic products such  as  computers and televisions. Taiwan exported some U.S.$2.5  billion worth of semiconductor products to Japan in 1993,  topping all other electronic products exported to Japan and  registering an annual growth rate of 35 percent.    The Cetra spokesman said the forthcoming visit not only  signifies Japanese affirmation of Taiwan's semiconductor  industry, but will also help in correcting Taiwan's trade  deficit with Japan.    The meeting will be a good opportunity for Taiwan  manufacturers to expand trade in the closed Japanese market, the  Cetra spokesman added.    After the talks, the Japanese traders will visit factories  in  the Hsinchu science-based industrial park before returning to  Japan.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: I Musici de Montreal There are now rather too many bands called I Musici, but the Montreal team of that name deserve serious attention. Their conductor, the cellist Yuli Turovsky, is an alumnus of Rudolf Barshai's Moscow Chamber Orchestra who emigrated to Montreal in 1977; and with his violinist wife Eleonora as leader, he has re-created something like the Barshai band in French Canada. They are an exciting tonic. It is usual for small, ambitious bands to claim extravagantly that their members are 'all soloists', but Turovsky's players go a long way towards making the claim good. Their second-violin boast no less pith and character than their firsts (granted Mme Turovsky's flamboyant pre-eminence as leader); their violas make a full-throated trio, and so do their celli and bass. In the programme I heard them deliver in Montreal recently, every player was not only alert but brilliantly assured. It is hard to do justice to the effect of such playing, vividly committed from top to bottom: try to imagine a string band put together exclusively from eager prizewinners, every man-jack determined not to waste a single note. Britain has some excellent string orchestras, but I doubt if any could easily muster the unhesitating, up-front attack of these Quebec players. It may be to do with native tem-perament (French-Canadians are volatile where English-Canadians play safe), but probably more to do with the Turovskys' own vivid example. Even in Nielsen's pawky little Petite Suite these strings were gutsy and unabashed, though clever, and in Barshai's arrangements of some of Prokofiev's Visions fugitives (originally for piano) they achieved a range of unnerving effects without a slip. Like Barshai's original band they stood up in a semicircle to play, except when accompanying Mendelssohn's Double Concerto - for violin and piano, written when he was 14. Though they sounded slightly duller there, the fault was surely Mendelssohn's: the part he allotted to the orchestra suggests that his papa could not or would not afford a competent band. Even the 1st-movement recapitulation is assigned to the soloists alone, and that sounds less like a bold stroke than a mere ruse for keeping the band prudently silent. Luckily we had not only Mme Turovsky's unstinting panache (reckless, even: she overshot some high ledger-lines) but the pianist Marc-Andre Hamelin's stylish bravura, in a part which seems not much more than second-fiddle accompanying until the Finale, when young Mendelssohn indulges his pianistic finger-fervour to the limit. Hamelin made the most of that, always with rippling grace; and in Schoenberg's scathing, anti-Hitlerian Ode to Napoleon his incisive piano contributions were vital. There was more to the unusual success of Schoenberg's bitter Ode, however, than Hamelin's sterling work. Turovsky chose to play it in the composer's own 1944 version with string orchestra, much less discouragingly gritty than his lean first draft for solo quartet (and piano); and Kevin McMillan declaimed Byron's text with all the right lofty scorn, not a whit diminished by his Canadian diction. For once, a piece that even dedicated Schoenbergians find unappetising struck home with a ring of conviction. From many honest performances in years past, I remember none that made so convincing a case for the musical integrity of Schoenberg's diatribe. This is a band worth hearing, and in October St John's ought to flatter their lean, sinewy sound. Visiting St John's, Smith Square, London, on 27 October</p>

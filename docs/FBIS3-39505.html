Preliminary  1993 figures by the Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution indicate that there were some 1,100 acts of  violence by left-wing extremists, while the other side accounted  for 1,820 such incidents (in 1992: 980 and 2,638, involving one  and 17 deaths, respectively).    Included among the acts of violence are murder and homicide,  bomb and arson attacks, breach of the public peace, personal  injury, traffic blockages, and severe damage to property.    Christian Democratic Union Bundestag Deputy Heinrich Lummer  said that irrespective of the "convergence of extremism"  reporting on leftist violence is neglected in most media: "All  forms of extremist violence must be stigmatized." Left-wing  extremism, the former Berlin senator for the interior said, is  "overshadowed insofar as national exposure is concerned."</p>

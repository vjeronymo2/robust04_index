			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been continuing his  contacts in Romania. Stressing that Turkey wants stability in  the Balkans and in Europe, Demirel indicated that once the  two-year human shame in Bosnia-Herzegovina is eradicated, the  region will enter a new cooperation environment. This morning  Demirel held a news conference in Bucharest where he is on an  official visit. TRT correspondent Ertugrul Bulent Danaci  reports from Bucharest:    [Danaci] Demirel held a news conference at the Turkish  Embassy in Bucharest on the second day of his visit and answered  Turkish correspondents' questions.    Pointing out that his contacts in Bucharest were very  favorable, Demirel stated that Turkey and Romania have no  problems and that a state-to-state and people-to-people  friendship exists between the two countries. Explaining that  the infrastructure which will constitute the basis of the  bilateral relations has been in preparation for the last four  years, Demirel recalled that several agreements were signed  within this framework.    Demirel said that Turkey, a Balkan country and therefore a  European country, aspires to a peaceful solution to the problems  within the Balkan countries. Indicating that today Europe is  faced with a security issue, Demirel said that the CSCE is part  of this issue and that the CSCE could not function as expected  during the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation.    Pointing to raised hopes in terms of things running smoothly  in the world after the Soviet Union's dissolution, Demirel  recalled that this was not achieved. In spite of all this,  Demirel stressed, regional countries should work toward a  composed and long-term cooperation for the happiness of their  people. Within this framework, Demirel added, Turkey and  Romania have good cooperation.    Recalling that Turkey supports Romania's inclusion in the  European organizations, Demirel noted that Romania was the first  country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO.    Wishing Romania success in its efforts toward democracy and  market economy, Demirel said that Turkey and Romania have good  relations within the framework of the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation [BSEC]. Demirel announced that following his  meetings with the concerned heads of state, he would call for a  BSEC summit meeting.    Answering a reporter's question on Turkey's depreciation by  international financial institution, Demirel said that he cannot  comment on Turkey's credit points dropping from 3B to 2B, since  it was meaningless, and added that credits to be extended to  Turkey should not be measured according to the B's. Demirel  said: God help us if we are indexed to the B's. Turkey has  difficulties and we have to accept them. Would we not have any  difficulties if we had not dropped from 3B to 2B? I think that  you should all believe that we are going to overcome these  difficulties. Turkey will overcome all these difficulties.    Demirel will continue with his contacts in Bucharest in the  afternoon.</p>

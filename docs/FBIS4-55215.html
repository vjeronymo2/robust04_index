			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular Tuesday interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F> by Lucie Weisova -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weisova] Mr. Prime Minister, our country was  yesterday accepted as an associate partner of the Western  European Union [WEU], that is, not as a member but merely as a  partner without the possibility of influencing the policy of  that organization and without the opportunity of attending  regular meetings in Brussels. Do you think this is a formality  and does this partnership have concrete significance for our  country?    [Klaus] I would not want to pass a strong judgment because I  would unnecessarily stir the political waters both in our  country and Europe. The various European integrational groupings  have selected a strategy under which they would negotiate with  countries like the Czech Republic, that is with postcommunist  countries, in stages and steps, and not simply yes or no. They  would negotiate in stages such as for semimembership,  association, and the like. I respect this and accept it, since  I believe that at the given time this probably cannot be  otherwise for them, although this is not the case for us. I  therefore accept it as it is.    [Weisova] You met the command of the Czech Army in Olomouc  on  Friday. Do they share the Czech Government's view on the  Partnership for Peace program and do you think, after this  meeting, that the Czech Army is able to fulfill its obligations  following from Partnership for Peace?    [Klaus] I would first like to ask myself whether I think  that  the Czech Army is going through a transformation process of the  same speed and thoroughness as the entire Czech Republic. This  is the first question for me, and my answer is in the  affirmative, that it is.    The second question is whether the Czech Army is getting  ready to fulfill its own objectives. These objectives are not,  first and foremost, about Europe and Partnership for Peace; they  are in the first place about the Czech Republic and its defense.  It is not right to formulate the question from the wrong end.    I think that the minister of defense repeated the Czech  Government's basic view in the presence of all the assembled  military representatives, that we proceed from our own  capability and determination to defend this country. [passage  omitted] All other agreements and cooperation treaties come  second after this crucial starting point, on which we must not  keep silent. I believe that the Czech Army is moving in this  direction.    I cannot say that I am an expert who has visited dozens of  military units -- this is not true. However, I was favorably  impressed by what I saw in Olomouc and Praslavice.    The second question is whether we will be capable of taking  part in the activities of the Partnership for Peace initiative.  I can say that we will. I have been assured by our soldiers  and commanders that the level of preparedness is very high and  that their experience from various actions is always very  favorable, I think. Groups of our soldiers and officers take  part in various competitions, in shooting and other disciplines,  and their results are very, very good. I believe that there is  no need to be too modest.    [Weisova] Would you comment on the outcome of the  parliamentary elections in Hungary?    [Klaus] I think that Hungary has been heading in this  direction for a considerable time. It lacked a vigorous,  radical, striking, and decisive transformation policy similar to  what we have in our country. It lacked high-profile and  charismatic personalities capable of uniting the Hungarian  public around them in order to carry out radical social changes.    As for the implications it has for us, the Czech Republic is  becoming a small nonleftist island in the center of Europe.  This, I think, should compel each of our voters to reflect on  this fact. I think it should compel each member of our  government coalition parties to treat this valuable factor with  very, very great caution, indeed.</p>

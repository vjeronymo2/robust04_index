			<p>BFN     [Text] A further 227 Russian peacekeepers complete with  satellite communication equipment has been airlifted aboard two  airforce transport planes from a military airport in Ryazan to  ex-Yugoslavia, military officials told Interfax in Moscow. The  operation is part of the rotation of the Russian contingent of  the United Nations Protection Force there.    As many as 600 servicemen of the 1,500-strong Russian  peacekeeping force deployed in the former Yugoslavia are to be  replaced in April.    It is now known that many of the peacekeepers who served a  term of six months and earned $6,000 have bought cars and will  be travelling home by road.</p>

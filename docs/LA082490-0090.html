			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OLD LENS GIVES WAY TO NEW AT LIGHTHOUSE  </P> <P> After guiding sailors for 52 years with three flashes of light a minute, a  brass-mounted crystal lens from the Anacapa Island lighthouse has been replaced  by modern technology.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard on Wednesday turned the nine-foot circular lens over to the  Channel Island National Park, which will display it in about a month at the  island's visitors center.  </P> <P> The new light is less attractive, but it will be easier to maintain, officials  said.  </P> <P> Only eight of the old-style lenses are used in 25 working lighthouses in  California. One is at Port Hueneme, Coast Guard spokeswoman Helen Denny said.  </P> <P> Since the 1970s, it has become increasingly difficult to find people to service  the handmade lenses.  </P> <P> "We're gradually having to replace them," Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver  said.  </P> <P> The Anacapa lighthouse, the only one on the Channel Islands, has helped sailors  navigate the Santa Barbara Channel since 1912. The lens, in place since 1938,  was part of a system of lenses that rotated around a 1,000-watt light bulb,  creating a flash every 20 seconds visible for 20 miles.  </P> <P> The lens has been replaced by a plainer-looking parabolic reflector, Rear Adm.  Marshall E. Gilbert said. The older type, called Fresnel lenses, "are really  classic works of art," he said.  </P> <P> Officials displayed only the center of the lens at a reception Wednesday.  Assembled, it consists of four pyramid-shaped lenses around the circular lens  on a 40-inch steel base. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

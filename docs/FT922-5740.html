			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / An embarrassment of riches for President Suharto: The opposition, set to lose the coming election, is making accusations of nepotism INDONESIA'S President Suharto will have been watching the parliamentary election campaign, now in its third week, with more than usual interest. Leaders of opposition parties have highlighted an issue likely to embarrass the President: alleged nepotism within government, in particular that the business interests of Mr Suharto's children have enjoyed political favours. The president's ruling Golkar party is still expected to win the June 9 election with a large majority, supported by a 20-year record of economic growth averaging more than 6 per cent a year. Nevertheless, the public airing of such divisive issues is a significant change in a country which prides itself on consensus. There have been growing allegations - attributed by government supporters to jealousy - that companies controlled by members of the Suharto family have received favours in the form of monopoly rights. The most controversial has been a monopoly in the buying and selling of cloves granted in January 1990 to BPPC, an unquoted company headed by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son. Cloves are the key ingredient in Indonesia's kretek cigarettes and, diplomats say, BPPC shareholders include many traders who had built up stocks in the mid-1980s. BPPC doubled the price paid to farmers and told cigarette companies to pay almost twice as much again, giving BPPC a projected turnover of more than Rp1,000bn (Dollars 500m) last year. In February, however, Mr Putra told parliament that BPPC would be unable to service Rp759bn of soft loans given to it by the central bank. He suggested a third of clove trees should be cut down to counter over-supply. BPPC's financial crisis has caused consternation and surprise among politicians and Indonesia's donor community. Diplomats say many clove farmers received only half-payment for their crop last year, and BPPC's income was guaranteed after the government linked the selling of cigarettes to proof of the purchase of cloves. While BPPC may not have operated at a profit, diplomats say it does still have financial reserves which, according to one western ambassador, are held in Singapore bank accounts. Domestic critics of BPPC have not been exclusively opposition politicians. Mr Kharis Suhud, speaker of the parliament, has called for the monopoly to be reviewed. Dr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister, says that BPPC must 'repay the debts of the bank'. 'The government cannot take over (BPPC), because then who will repay the debt? They (BPPC) are responsible,' he says. Mr Putra is not unique among Mr Suharto's children to head a company with monopoly rights or to have been the target of criticism. A subsidiary of the Bimantara Group, chaired by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo - Mr Suharto's second son  -enjoys exclusive rights to buy oranges in Kalimantan, formerly Borneo. A monopoly was granted last October in the collection of television licence fees to Mekatama Raya, in which Mr Sigit Hardjojudanto, Mr Suharto's eldest son, is reported to be a shareholder. Mekatama lost the contract, however, after fees were doubled and the company ceased door-to-door collection and told people to pay at their local post office. Defenders of the children say the monopolies issue has been blown out of proportion. They point to the wide-ranging and profitable companies they have built and argue that monopolies play only a minor role in their success. In particular, these supporters say the children have helped reduce the hold of the ethnic Chinese community over the economy. Ethnic Chinese account for about 4m of Indonesia's total 183m population but control many of the largest banks and conglomerates. 'The president and his wife are proud of their children's contribution to the economy,' explained one senior diplomat. Bimantara, established by Mr Trihatmodjo in 1982, had estimated revenue in 1991 of Rp2,200bn and about 11,000 employees. Its business interests include a contract to transport Indonesia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South Korea and construction of a major gas pipeline. Projects supported by Bimantara include negotiations for a Dollars 1.95bn power station in East Java, a Dollars 1.6bn olefin plant in West Java, and a project estimated at Dollars 100m to recycle toxic waste. The Humpuss Group, Mr Putra's main company, was established in 1984 and had estimated revenue in 1991 of Rp2,000bn. Its activities include the shipping of LNG to Taiwan, timber processing and air transport. Sempati Air, in which Humpuss holds a stake, is the first private airline to break the monopoly of state-owned Merpati on domestic jet-powered flights. Mrs Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, eldest daughter of Mr Suharto, has also been active in business with companies acting as local partners in major telecommunication and road construction contracts. In 1991 she helped set up TPI, a private educational television channel, which now runs in competition with state television and RCTI, a channel run by the Bimantara group. There are signs that the children may try to defuse criticism by taking portions of their companies public. Bimantara is a shareholder in Plaza Indonesia Realty, an up-market retail and hotel company which this month floated a minority shareholding. Shares have been valued at a price/earnings ratio of 23, compared to an average of about 14 for listed companies. Brokers say state pension funds were the principal buyers.</p>

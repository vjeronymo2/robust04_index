			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Commander of the air force  branch of the Chinese People's Army, Colonel-General Cao  Shuangming, is scheduled to begin a ten-day official visit to  Russia on Thursday, ITAR-TASS was told by the Russian air force  press centre. The general should arrive in the evening, at  20:00 Moscow time.    The Chinese commander's itinerary for Friday includes laying  a wreath at the monument to the unknown soldier and visits to  the aviation technology demonstration center in Kubinka (south  of Moscow) and to the victory day memorial on Poklonnaya Hill.  Later in his visit, Cao Shuangming plans to visit the Gagarin  air force academy and the Sukhoi experimental design bureau.  The Chinese commander will visit Volgograd and St. Petersburg  in addition to spending two days in the Black Sea resort of  Sochi, where the Russian air force has an exclusive resort.    Military experts say that Russia's and China's military  departments have normal business-like ties. They have an  agreement on cooperation, which aims to ensure the security of  the two countries and strengthen peace in the Asia-Pacific  region.    The document, in particular, envisages mutual visits,  including by the commanding staff. This April, head of the  General Staff of the Russian army, Colonel-General Mikhail  Kolesnikov, went to China on an official visit. It is envisaged  that, by the end of 1994, seven Chinese military delegations of  different levels will have visited Russia.    The Chinese military is especially interested in Russian  aerospace technology. Russia recently sold China some Su-27  fighter planes, and additional shipments are under  consideration. China is interested in obtaining a license to  produce the Su-27, and has initiated negotiations on what  conditions such a deal should include.</p>

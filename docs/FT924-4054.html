			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Brazilian steel sell-off in balance BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco began two days of meetings yesterday to decide whether the country's largest privatisation should go ahead this month, Christina Lamb writes from Rio de Janeiro. The National Steel Company (CSN) is to be sold on December 22 for at least Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) but Mr Franco has expressed considerable doubts about the sale, and about the whole privatisation process. Brazil's stock markets fell yesterday on fears of a delay. Last month Mr Franco cancelled the sale of Ultrafertil, a fertiliser company, just 90 minutes before the auction was due to start, causing Mr Marcos Vianna, vice-president of the National Development Bank, which oversees the programme, to resign in anger. The CSN auction could attract sizeable foreign investment. Among those interested are the construction company Andrade Gutierrez and a German consortium involving steelmaker Thyssen. The sale is sensitive because of CSN's emotional significance as a symbol of Brazil's economic development. Mr Franco's talks will include Mr Paulino Cicero, mines and energy minister and, like the president, a past opponent of privatisation, Mr Roberto Procopio, CSN's president who strongly favours the sale, and Mr Jose de Castro, Mr Franco's legal adviser who recommended the Ultrafertil cancellation. Analysts believe the CSN sale may be put off until March when Mr Franco is expected to introduce rules stipulating that 30 per cent of any bids must be in cash. Currently most purchases have been made using 'rotten currencies', domestic debt swapped at par; less than 1 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised so far is in cash.</p>

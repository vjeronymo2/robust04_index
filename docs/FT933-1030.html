			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Foreigners sniff the bargains - Gerald Cadogan considers what's on offer in the capital and the market's state / London HAVING LED the property revival since last autumn, London is still pulling ahead of the country market. Both markets suffer from a lack of good properties to sell and eager buyers becoming frustrated at the lack of choice. Will this imbalance of demand and supply in London translate into higher prices? Yes, it is already doing so, but slowly. It is a long haul before they match 1989 levels. Last year when prices had fallen to mid-1980s levels, the devaluation of the pound brought foreign buyers. Britain's political stability, lower inflation rate and the likelihood of being first out of the recession were extra inducements, besides the perennial pleasure of having a London base. Buying has continued busily this year. 'Prices have hardened, with sale prices closer to asking prices,' says Noel Flint, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's Knightsbridge office. Yolande Barnes, head of Residential Research at Savills, puts the rise at 2.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1993, and at 4.4 per cent over January-June. She sticks to her December 1992 prediction that the rise for prime flats and houses in central London will reach 10 to 15 per cent by June next year. She expects an increase of 12 per cent or more during 1994 as a whole, to bring prices back to spring 1988 levels in nominal terms. This bullish forecast carries a caution. The economy must carry on improving without 'major political setbacks.' And in 1995 it will need another 12 per cent growth to bring prices back to the 1989 plateau. David Forbes, of agent Chesterfield, is worried that with the shortage of stock agents will compete for instructions by suggesting higher asking prices. This would raise the hopes of would-be vendors but would not attract buyers. 'Vendors could flood the market with over-priced houses and we could see a return to an inflated market which could simply stall,' he says. The proportion of foreign buyers in central London has risen from 28 per cent in 1992 to 32 per cent this year, Savills estimates, increasing to 46 per cent in Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Chelsea and Kensington. Many are buying for their own use. Other overseas investors are buying a return of 8 to 10 per cent from letting, which is more than twice the yield on shares and a percentage point or two above that of long-dated gilts, says William Gething, of buying agent Property Vision. These yields will drop as rents will probably remain static when buying prices move upwards once owners decide to release properties. The desire to buy has now spread out from the centre. Battersea, Fulham and Clapham reported good business in the spring. But again it is the familiar story of not enough stock. Vendors worried that spring 1993 might fizzle out, like spring last year, helped to ensure that it did. Those who were waiting for the apparent security of higher prices, were overlooking the fact that the market is wholly relative. Sell for more, buy for more. You must live somewhere. When prices go up, the first to benefit is the Treasury through stamp duty and inheritance tax. As another boost to UK economic recovery, big foreign companies are bringing more staff to London, helping both buying and rental sectors. Agent Lassmans finds that many prefer to buy on behalf of their staff if they are working in London for a long time. If, eventually, there is no need for the house, it becomes part of company assets and can be let. For Britons posted to London, borrowing is cheap - and may become cheaper - and capital growth is likely in a non-inflationary climate. If vendors agree a good price, the surveyor or mortgage provider's valuer may declare it not worth that much or point to its bulges and cracks as possible signs of subsidence (covering against later claims of negligence). Then the buyer may try to renegotiate. The vendor may refuse but then he has the hassle of finding another buyer, while a foreign potential buyer may lose confidence and withdraw altogether. This is a real risk when, as Flint pointed out, the discrepancy on the best properties may be Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 200,000. Two seriously expensive houses still wait for the right buyer, 9 Tregunter Road, SW10, with a guide price of Pounds 9m freehold, and Halkin Gate House, off Belgrave Square, SW1 on a long lease, with high ground rent, is Pounds 5.75m. De Groot Collis is agent. Two other premier league properties offer plush penthouses and flats: the new conversion of 130 Park Lane, W1 on the corner with Green Street (from De Groot Collis or Wetherell) and 3a Palace Green in Kensington Palace Gardens, W8 (from Hamptons or Savills). An unusual Art Deco house, within walking distance of Lord's cricket ground, is 58 Hamilton Terrace, NW8. Designed by Francis Lorne in 1934, it deserves to be listed. It visibly pays respect to its early Victorian neighbours. Behind is a long garden with swimming pool. Lassmans is selling the 58-year lease for Pounds 1.75m. The freeholder is the John Lyon Road Trust which continues to carry out the wishes of Lyon, founder of Harrow School in 1571, to keep the road from Harrow to London in good repair. On the better known Eyre estate, in St John's Wood, 30 Marlborough Place, NW8, is an early Victorian six-bedroomed 'cottage', which Lassmans offers on a 43-year lease for Pounds 1.15m. It too has a good garden. A more imposing house is no 28 in Nash's Chester Terrace, NW1, on the east side of Regents Park. It is on sale for Pounds 1.395m from the same agent or Aldine Honey. In Lowndes Place, SW1, there is a villa on offer for Pounds 1.85m from Francis Russell or Aylesford (52 years: the ground rent, already Pounds 1550, is to be reviewed in 2001). Lord Kitchener, the soldier and war minister, lived in 44 Phillimore Gardens, W8, a solid house with a garden, which John D. Wood offers for Pounds 2.45m. The agent also offers, new on the market, a maisonette with palm trees in the garden at 49 Holland Park, W11, for Pounds 875,000. This freehold property gives the buyer the right to Pounds 600 of ground rent from the other occupants who will become his/her tenants. Some good Georgian brick houses: 21 St Leonards Terrace, SW3 (Egerton or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, Pounds 975,000), 20 Fournier Street, E1 (Jackson-Stops, over Pounds 280,000), 5 Highbury Terrace, N5 (Wood at Regents Park, Pounds 695,000) and 29 Percy Street, W1 (William H. Brown, Pounds 700,000). And, to end with a splash, The Chantry, a grand 1920s Tudoresque house on Ellerton Road in Wimbledon, SW20, which includes a Japanese-style water garden in the grounds; Pounds 2.9m from Wood, in Wimbledon.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Car production rises by 4.4% CAR production rose by 4.4 per cent last year, helped by a substantial increase in output by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, and by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US. Production rose to 1,291,231 from 1,236,900 in 1991, figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Output of commercial vehicles rose by 14.4 per cent last year to 248,435 from 217,141 in 1991, although output during last month alone was 10.2 per cent lower than in December 1991 at 16,758. Last month car production was 19.8 per cent higher than a year before, at 94,652, helped by a 26.6 per cent increase in output for export markets. Car production has performed relatively well during the recession, with much higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the home market. Production fell by only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m in 1991, in spite of a 30.9 per cent fall in UK new car sales in the same period. Car production is set to rise significantly throughout the 1990s largely as a result of the three car plants under development by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Nissan's Sunderland plant, which began small-volume output in 1986, is expected to increase production this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year. The plant is developing a capacity to produce 300,000 cars a year. Honda began production in October at its Pounds 300m Swindon plant and Toyota started output last month at its Pounds 700m car plant at Burnaston, near Derby. According to the latest forecast by the SMMT, car production will rise to 1.4m this year and will increase further to 1.5m in 1994. Car production reached its previous peak in 1972 at 1.92m, but then declined rapidly in the following decade to reach a low point of only 888,000 in 1982. According to the latest forecast by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analysts, car output could exceed the earlier peak by 1997, rising to 2m.</p>

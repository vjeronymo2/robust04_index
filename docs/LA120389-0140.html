			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. GROWTH GAME NO FUN  </P> <P> After a three-year absence, I recently returned to San Diego for a visit. It  was a bittersweet experience. Looking around the beach area in the clear light  of a Santa Ana day, I suddenly understood the game being played here: "How many  buildings, people and cars can you fit on every block?"  </P> <P> The game isn't much fun. In fact, it seems to hurt folks living here a lot.  "It's like losing your hometown in a disaster," said a friend, "but piece by  piece, instead of all at once."  </P> <P> At Famosa Slough in Ocean Beach, I drew a sigh of relief, finding that magic  window into another world still remains. With the newly arrived migrant pintail  ducks and graceful egrets, I congratulated the slough for being a survivor.  </P> <P> But what's going on here? Wasn't the city going to buy the slough and preserve  it? Instead of a proud sign announcing Famosa Natural Wetlands Park, I found an  ugly half-demolished fence and new construction spilling debris into the edges  of the wetland. What happened to all those campaign promises by City Council  candidates and the mayor to rescue the slough?  </P> <P> There was time enough in three years to develop Belmont Park, but not enough to  save one tiny wetland?  </P> <P> What are you doing, San Diego?  </P> <P> DEBRA PATLA  </P> <P> Victor, Ida.  </P></p>

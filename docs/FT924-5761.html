			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Foreign Affairs: Big bang but deaf ears - A 'social atomic bomb' has exploded over Sarajevo but the EC's response is inadequate The grim truth has begun to dawn on western Europe. The disaster of the former Yugoslavia is not just one of those awful things that happen in other continents, about which one can ease one's conscience with a donation to Oxfam or Unicef. It is going to affect us, disturbing the humdrum comforts and discomforts of our ordinary lives. We are confronting a 'social atomic bomb' in Europe. The phrase is that of Tony Smythe, a man who knows something about human misery and inhuman behaviour and does not speak of atomic bombs lightly. He has been director successively of the National Council for Civil Liberties, the mental health charity Mind, and most recently MedAct (Medical Action for Global Security), a branch of International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War. Earlier this month he went to Macedonia for a pan-European 'citizens' and municipal peace conference', organised by the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly and the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities in Europe. It is easy to make fun of all these small non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with long-winded titles which hold meetings up and down the continent. Their efforts to keep dialogue going across national or ethnic boundaries may seem Lilliputian in relation to the scale of the problems involved, but that is surely better than the Brobdingnagian impotence of governments and intergovernmental bodies which are infinitely better endowed. In fact the latter often find they get good value for money by subsidising the activities of the former. By 'social atomic bomb', Mr Smythe means that the effects of what is happening in the former Yugoslavia are as devastating to life, health and property as an atomic bomb if one had been dropped there, and that they also spread gradually, if in attenuated form, over a very wide area. But while many of the effects are painfully physical, the process itself is social. One cannot pinpoint a precise place and time at which the bomb exploded, and while in broad terms its effects are all too predictable, in detail they are much less so. That means that the effectiveness of any given remedial or protective measure is also very hard to predict. Which perhaps explains why, in contrast to the elaborate plans that governments made to deal with the aftermath of a nuclear attack, there seems to have been no planning at all for dealing with a disaster such as this. Even now, after it has happened, there is no consensus about what needs to be done, or even about how bad the disaster is. The figure of '2m or 3m' displaced persons has, Mr Smythe points out, been 'trotted around for the last few months', while the process of displacement is going on all the time. Perhaps, if 2m was right when first quoted, 3m is right now. More probably, no one really knows. What is certain is that, however bad it is now, it will be worse in a week's time, and probably a great deal worse in six months. Equally certainly, it is by far the worst refugee problem in Europe since the immediate aftermath of the second world war. It is happening on the fringes of the European Community. So far the great majority of the displaced are still within the borders of the former Yugoslavia, but an estimated half million are outside and roughly half of those are in Germany. Austria and Switzerland, not yet EC members but about to form the European Economic Area with it, have well over 100,000 between them. Not surprisingly all three of those countries are agitating desperately for the burden to be shared, and for the adoption of a co-ordinated European response. Yet, says Mr Smythe, the most striking feature of the situation is 'a diabolical lack of any kind of co-ordination across Europe and within ex-Yugoslavia'. How can this be? It is hard to blame the European Commission, since national governments have been very careful to prevent it getting its sticky fingers on the immigration and asylum issues, which they regard as part of the holy of holies of national sovereignty. There is an ad hoc group on immigration, set up in 1986, but it is strictly intergovernmental. It meets sometimes at ministerial, sometimes at official level, and the chair is taken by the state holding the EC presidency at the time. That business of the rotating presidency is often cited as a weakness in the EC's constitution. It puts, one is told, an excessive burden on the bureaucracies of small states, such as Luxembourg, that are not really up to the task. How lucky then, you may think, that this acute phase of the Yugoslav crisis coincides with the presidency of a large state whose bureaucracy is the envy of the world. Presumably the UK has taken advantage of this circumstance to get a hold on all the issues involved and hammer out a co-ordinated European response. Alas, that is not the impression gained by people working in other EC governments, or in NGOs, or in intergovernmental organisations. Nor do British civil servants themselves seem unduly proud of their achievements in this respect. My own attempt to find out what they were doing revealed, mainly, that there is little co-ordination even within the British government. In fact, their response was rather similar to that of their political masters when confronted with the 'Iraqgate' scandal: they start by explaining that, whatever your particular question is, it should properly be answered by a different department. The east European department of the Foreign Office has relinquished all responsibility for Yugoslavia to a special unit set up for the duration of the British presidency. There is some sense in that. But the unit in question doesn't deal with the refugee issue. In fact that issue itself is split in two. There is aid to the refugees still in the area, which is handled by the Overseas Development Administration and the UN department of the Foreign Office; and there is admission (or non-admission) of refugees into EC countries, which is handled by the Home Office. It would be unfair to suggest that the various officials involved never speak to each other. In fact it seems there is a daily meeting on Yugoslavia at the Foreign Office, and that as often as two or three days a week it is chaired by a minister, Mr Douglas Hogg. But the least one can say is that Mr Hogg has not yet instilled into those working under him a strong sense of urgency or common purpose. Foreign Office officials complain that the Home Office makes the agreed asylum policy sound even less generous than it is, by quoting only the figure of 150 families whom Britain has agreed to take 'in the first instance'. Certainly it is clear enough that the Home Office's main concern remains, as always, to limit to the minimum the number of foreigners allowed into Britain on any pretext whatsoever. But why does the Home Office always win in any argument with the Foreign Office? More important, why is this whole crisis being dealt with as an argument between EC member governments, and between departments within those governments? Why are political leaders not getting together to work out an answer to it, as a matter of urgency, as they surely would if a real atomic bomb had been dropped on Sarajevo?</p>

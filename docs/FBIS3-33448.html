Escobar </F> Franco and Jorge Caceres]    [Text] Coronel Oviedo -- After almost three hours of  negotiations between peasant leaders and President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy, there are no prospects for finding a solution to the  social demands since the two parties did not reach concrete  agreements. President Wasmosy accused Deputy Hermes Chamorro of  being a "communist" during the meeting held in the Coronel  Oviedo departmental Government House on 22 February. Wasmosy  made the accusation when Deputy Chamorro demanded that exporters  of agricultural products like him (Wasmosy) give up a minimum  part of their profits in favor of the peasants to find a  solution to the conflict.    Chamorro said this request caused an immediate reaction by  the president, who accused Chamorro of taking a position typical  of populists and that he was revealing his ideological  inclination toward communism.    Chamorro replied that the accusation of being a communist is  completely irresponsible and absurd, thus playing down the  accusation. Chamorro came with the peasant leaders to meet  Wasmosy, who was accompanied by Ministers Raul Torres  [agriculture], Carlos Podesta [interior], Nicanor Duarte Frutos  [education], and Candido Nunez Leon [health].    Chamorro said: "I made the request because I know there are  exporters of agricultural products who advocate an increase in  the price of cotton but Cadelpa [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] is  exerting tremendous pressure on its members to keep their prices  at the same level." Chamorro added that Wasmosy supposedly  advocates free competition but in practice, "when they have to  put that principle, that philosophy, in practice they get  together and make decisions by a majority. The president is part  of that clique running the cotton business. Only someone who is  blind cannot see the peasants' painful situation."    Rafael Ruiz Diaz, peasant leader in the Simon Bolivar  district, said the peasants came out of the meeting with Wasmosy  disappointed because no agreement was reached and they only  received promises. Ruiz Diaz said the president practically  indicated that this case is not in his hands, but he will try to  find a solution. Ruiz Diaz added that this was not the answer  they expected. Ruiz Diaz also said, in Guarani: "He clearly  told us that the government has enough force to prevent road  closures and to take other measures of force. But we, the  peasants, are ready to face the government if necessary."    He said Wasmosy told them they can sell their cotton freely  but that the Brazilian buyers, in this case, will have to pay  the appropriate taxes at the border to take the product.    He revealed that the peasants want [words indistinct]  guaranies per kilogram of cotton, the release of the San Pedro  peasants under arrest, the distribution of land, and guarantees  for the land's exploitation. Regarding the peasants under  arrest, they received the promise they would be released next  week.    Ruiz Diaz said Wasmosy told them that "if we resort to  force,  the peasants do not have a chance." Ruiz Diaz then said, in  Guarani: "As Paraguayans and peasants, no one will run away from  anyone. There is no such thing as being afraid of each other."  He reiterated that the peasants will not give in to their  demands and the peasants have more than enough energy. He said  [in Guarani]: "There is no such thing as being afraid of each  other."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on </F> Peres, in Cairo, by Mikha Friedman and Ge'ula Even, in Tel Aviv,  on 29 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Friedman] We will now carry large segments of an  interview we conducted earlier this morning with Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, who is currently in Cairo. Our first  question to Peres was about the myriad symbols of sovereignty  Israel was prepared to grant the Palestinians: a stamp,  passport, international dialing zone, strong police force,  legislative assembly. Did you know, we asked Peres, that this  was the only autonomy in the world with all these attributes?    [Peres] No, it is not the only case. There are not many  autonomous areas in the world. I think that there are only one  or two. Each autonomy has its own logic. The autonomous areas  I am familiar with have passports and stamps. There is nothing  unique about this.    [Friedman] The question is whether this autonomy's internal  logic indicates that this is the embryo of the future  Palestinian state?    [Peres] I do not know what you mean by the term logic. I  only know that we are leaving the Gaza Strip without any  intention of ever returning. I do not know what we have to look  for in Gaza. You know, we also have to put things in clear  perspective. There are 800,000 people in the Gaza Strip. Do we  want to give them Israeli passports? Do we seek to prevent them  from travelling abroad? Why? We therefore came up with a very  original solution. We agreed on laissez-passers and passports  for a period of three years; or in other words, until the  implementation of the permanent arrangement. I think this is an  elegant solution. Look, we should not be niggardly about  insignificant things. What do we want? What is all this talk  about signs of sovereignty?    [Friedman] Up until yesterday, Israel was very adamant about  these issues.    [Peres] Who told you that?    [Friedman] Is this not true? Was Israel prepared to give  the Palestinians all this from the very beginning?    [Peres] Excuse me. The decision on this was reached in  Israel before I left for Cairo. I made no concessions here. We  carefully considered what had to be done and I believe we found  a unique, original, and fair solution.    [Friedman] I expressly asked whether this was the embryonic  Palestinian state. You know that there are many Israelis who  fear this demon [last word in English]?    [Peres] Is it preferable to annex these areas to Israel? We  have decided to begin negotiations on the permanent arrangement  in two years. These negotiations have to end within a year. We  agreed to the issuing of Palestinian laissez-passers for a  period of three years. I admit that we were a little bit  generous. Why not? This still does not constitute a decision  either on a Palestinian state or on the permanent arrangement.  This agreement, which is totally unique to the best of my  knowledge, deals entirely with an interim period.    [Even] Mr. Peres, I do not know if you have been updated on  this but Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has described this  agreement as Israel's biggest political defeat ever. Other  right-wing figures voiced similar reactions.    [Peres] I want to tell you that this constitutes tremendous  progress. He has already warned about unprecedented political  defeats in the past. We are advancing from defeat to defeat.  What has Binyamin Netanyahu ever achieved? What did the Likud  achieve during its 15 years in the Gaza Strip? Damage, blood,  shame, and disgrace. What else? What does he mean by defeat?  Does he want to remain in the Gaza Strip? What solutions does  he propose for the refugees, poverty, terrorism, assassinations,  hatred? What are these empty statements? Anyone can just quote  words from the encyclopedia. I think that this is a brave and  fair step.    [Even] The question is whether we were not in too much of a  hurry to sign the agreement without tying up some very important  loose ends.    [Peres] I do not understand what we were supposed to wait  for. For more terrorist attacks? I think that Israel must use  a stick and carrot approach in its war against terrorism.  Although we still have our stick we have dropped the carrot.  One cannot quash terrorism with just a stick. We unequivocally  have no interest in running the Gaza Strip. We therefore took  the appropriate steps. What would we have gained from dragging  things out another year? We would have just had more soldiers  acting as policemen in the Gaza Strip with daily television  coverage of children throwing stones at them while mothers were  quaking in fear. What for?    [Friedman] Mr. Peres, there are two contradictory statements  which you may be able to square. One of them is the assessment  by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the IDF's  [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will  precipitate a massacre. The second statement came from Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] who said it would not sabotage the  agreement between the PLO and Israel. Which of these  assessments do you lean toward?    [Peres] I want to make this very clear. Ben-Gurion said  that all the experts were very knowledgeable about the past.  There are no experts on future developments. Anyone who  purports to be an expert about future developments is taking an  unnecessary risk. However, I think that an agreement that is  equitable both in form and content on the Gaza Strip will  greatly help in reducing the level of hatred, and perhaps also  violence. I do not see any alternatives. As for the future,  time will tell. No one knows which forces will seize control or  demonstrate their presence. It is crystal clear, however, that  the Palestinians now have an interest in managing a tangible  reality through administrative, not violent, measures. The  alternative to administration is brute violence.    [Friedman] You met U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher in Cairo yesterday. Christopher has already arrived  in Israel, ostensibly to promote the Syrian-Israeli track. On  arrival, however, he somewhat discouragingly stated that he did  not anticipate significant progress on this track.    [Peres] No progress will be made without clear and  intelligent decisions. If anyone thinks that anything can be  achieved by stuttering or demagoguery then they are wrong.    [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I left the most sensitive question for  last. Do you think that the agreement you reached with 'Arafat,  according to which the PLO promised to immediately deliver any  information it receives on the Israeli POW's and MIA's to the  Israeli Government, will satisfy Yona Baumel, the father of MIA  Zekharya Baumel, who called you a traitor this week?    [Peres] That is something I cannot tell you. I only know  that both the prime minister and myself have done our best with  regard to this sensitive issue. We all belong to the same  family. I can certainly understand the feelings of the Baumel  family; however, I can also say that we did absolutely  everything possible. I would like to take this opportunity to  say that I appealed to the Egyptian president who agreed that  Egypt would continue to help in the search for the bodies of  Israeli pilots and soldiers who fell on Egyptian soil. I know  that this issue is also very sensitive and important to the  families and to all Israelis. We will never forget the people  who risked their lives, fell in battle, or have been missing in  action since then. This is the responsibility of the State of  Israel and its government, and we will continue to exert serious  efforts in this regard and tenaciously pursue this issue.    [Friedman] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres in Cairo.</p>

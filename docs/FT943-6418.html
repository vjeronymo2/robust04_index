			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Russian PM warns on debts Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, has vowed the government will take a tough line on the problem of inter-enterprise debt, and he appeared to reject calls for the government to intervene with state funding In an interview with the Interfax news agency yesterday, Mr Chernomyrdin described debts between Russian companies as one of the most pressing issues facing the economy. But he indicated the government would not help ease the problem by injecting fresh credits into the economy. Inter-enterprise debt has accumulated as companies have continued to supply each other with goods and services without securing payment. The failure of companies to pay their bills has led to a snow-balling of the debt, paralysing the financial system. Estimates put the total level of indebtedness at around Rbs90,000bn (Pounds 27bn at the market rate). The government has been under intense pressure from cash-starved companies to loosen its monetary policy and has partially relented by granting some cheap credits to the defence sector and heavy industry. But economists have warned this will only stimulate another surge of inflation. Mr Chernomyrdin said the government was working on a package of measures to force debtors to use their hard currency funds to pay their debts. He also hinted the government would introduce greater powers of disclosure to find out the true financial state of particular enterprises. He even suggested some branches of the economy should introduce price freezes to help alleviate the debt burden, echoing the views of Mr Alexander Shokhin, the economics minister. Mr Chernomyrdin said the railway, coal, iron and steel industries had all reached an agreement not to raise their tariffs this year. 'I think the next stage will be when they agree not to raise wages during the same period of time or, for instance, to keep them at the same level. This is a civilised market mechanism working all over the world. I think we will get used to applying it.' Mr Chernomyrdin said federal intervention to resolve a similar problem in 1992 had been a serious mistake. 'Enterprises can carry out mutual conciliation of debt at the regional level and within their branch of industry,' he added.</p>

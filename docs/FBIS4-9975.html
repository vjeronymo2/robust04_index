			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Obstacle Race," by Marcelo Bauer] </F>   [Text] Ever since early February, when he publicly  announced his intention to run for the presidency of Brazil,  former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia has been busy rounding  up support. In the space of three weeks he has met with his  party's executive board and with the federal, state, and  municipal delegations of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] legislators, received mayors in his office, gone to Rio  de Janeiro to talk to Mayor Cesar Maia, and launched a furious  series of attacks against some of his principal adversaries. On  Wednesday 2 March, Quercia will participate in the first big  public event of his campaign, a party thrown in Sao Paulo by the  Paulista Association of Cities. The former governor says he has  been encouraged by all these gatherings. His strategy at the  moment probably is to build up some important grass-roots  support in the various states. Except at the meetings he  sponsors, however, all Quercia is collecting are problems.    Within the PMDB, the former governor faces opposition from  the national leadership, which is dreaming of creating a  National Salvation Front--uniting the PMDB, the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party], the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and  part of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]--and watching the  maneuvers leading to the launching of a presidential candidacy  by current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho.  Meanwhile, in the courts, Quercia will have to testify and  probably attend the proceedings concerning the legality of an  importation of equipment from Israel that occurred during his  administration, but which might also hurt Fleury. "For now, the  status of his candidacy is still complicated," a  quercista delegate admitted.    When he decided to run, Quercia knew he would have trouble  winning the support of some factions of his party, like the Rio  Grande do Sul group headed by Senator Pedro Simon, the leader of  the Itamar government, and by former Social Security Minister  Antonio Britto. It was also inevitable that this exposure as a  candidate would swell the wave of accusations aimed at tying  Quercia to charges of corruption and unexplained wealth. In his  favor he has a history of four victorious campaigns that, like  this one, also started at pretty close to zero. A rundown of the  recent exciting days for the PMDB shows that although Quercia  gained ground with his aggressive style, the constraints on his  candidacy also grew. Led by Deputy Mauro Miranda (Goias), two  dozen PMDB legislators from six states met in the Chamber on 23  February to propose an anti-Quercia front. "If Quercia is the  candidate, it will be practically impossible to unite the  party," argued the party's leader in the Chamber, Tarcisio  Delgado (Minas Gerais). That same day, Fleury was parading  around Brasilia with the air of a candidate. In the morning, he  met with President Itamar Franco, accompanied by the  administration's leader in the Chamber, Luiz Carlos Santos, the  governor's leading campaign strategist. In the afternoon, he  lunched with Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB, Amapa) and greeted party  legislators and leaders at the Hotel Naoum. In the evening, he  met with deputies from several states at the offices of the PMDB  leadership in the Chamber. "Most of the PMDB would very much  like to see Governor Fleury's name on the list of the ones  around which the party will have to make a decision," Britto  announced. "Between Quercia and Fleury, I'm for Fleury," Simon  advised.    Suspicious of the sudden interest in his candidacy displayed  by old internal enemies, Fleury reacted cautiously. "I am not  going to be the instrument of a party breakup," he promised.  Deputies from the Sao Paulo PMDB do not rule out the possibility  that behind the virtual support for the candidacy of the present  governor is an attempt to isolate Quercia and force him to  withdraw from the race, which would favor either an alliance  with the PSDB or the emergence of a Britto candidacy. For all  these reasons, although he is not ruling out a run for Planalto  Palace, Fleury is still cautious in his statements. "I am not  announcing a candidacy. I think it is important to work for  party unity," he said. On the same day when he met in Brasilia  with members of the party who oppose Quercia, Fleury telephoned  the former governor to schedule a meeting. He wanted to tell  Quercia that he did not plan to join any group that would  exclude him from the negotiation. Quercia claimed that his  schedule was full and postponed the meeting.    Irritated by the indecisiveness of his political godson,  Quercia toughened his rhetoric against the governor. "Fleury's  base in Sao Paulo supports me. If he announces his candidacy, he  will be betraying both his electorate and me." Fleury reacted.  "No one who wants my support should make a statement like that."  The feud between the two is just part of the rhetorical duel  promoted by the various PMDB groups and by the party's  adversaries (see box). With his sharp candidate's tongue,  Quercia has revived the "If you hit, you'll get hit"  [bateu, levou] style of Collor's former spokesman,  Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva. Quercia's main targets, since he  announced his candidacy, have been PT [Workers Party] President  Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, tucanos Mario Covas,  candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo and Ciro Gomes,  governor of Ceara, and fellow peemedebistas Pedro  Simon and Antonio Britto. "The PSDB has this watered-down  campaign. I'm going to start up the quercista  bulldozer and roll right over all of them," Quercia promised.  "He's talking about bulldozers because he is the candidate of  the construction contractors," responded Covas, repeating a  pronouncement by PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] Senator  Esperidiao Amin (Santa Catarina). The shouting match has been  loud enough to worry Governor Fleury. "We need to stop these  assaults among leaders," he argued. "Internal disputes are  healthy when they do not create splits."    There is speculation in the Sao Paulo PMDB that the  launching  of Quercia's candidacy was due to the need to nip in the bud a  move by the top leadership to forge an alliance, for the first  round of the elections, with the PSDB. "If they were to reach  this agreement for the presidential race, they would also  abandon Quercia in his effort to become governor of Sao Paulo  and would back Mario Covas instead," said Deputy Roberto  Rollemberg, president of the Sao Paulo PMDB. Rollemberg said  that "by announcing for the presidency, Quercia torpedoed the  accord." There is still talk about setting up that National  Salvation Front, although the chances of an agreement during the  first round are remote. A month ago, in a conversation with Rio  Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT), PMDB President Luiz Henrique  suggested a pact under which the PMDB, PSDB, and PDT could unite  around whichever name ranks highest in the polls in May, when  the conventions must indicate their candidates for president.  Witnessed by two pedetistas and two  peemedebistas, the conversation went even further.  "My name is on the list, but it is not an obstacle to anything,"  said Brizola, according to what one of the witnesses told ISTOE.  "I am tired of falling on my sword." After Carnival ended, the  PFL wing that is headed by party President Jorge Bornhausen also  came onto the dance floor. Brizola, Luiz Henrique, Bornhausen,  and Tasso Jereissati, of the PMDB, now have 60 days to agree on  this mutual plan that would result in a single candidate, a  left-of-center anti-Lula.    Formation of the National Salvation Front would seem to be  the only alternative to the increasingly unlikely candidacy of  Deputy Antonio Britto. On Sunday the 6th, he will take part in  the PMDB pre-convention that will nominate the candidate for the  governorship of Rio Grande do Sul. He is running against Deputy  Mendes Ribeiro and should garner 80 percent of the votes of  those in attendance. Britto entered the state campaign in  earnest in this past month. Two weeks ago in Vacaria, for  example, he outlined his timetable to the party's municipal  leadership. "I know there are a lot of people here who would  vote for me for president," the former minister said. "I really  will need your votes for president--but not in 1994. Now I want  your votes for the governorship of Rio Grande do Sul," he said.  Britto claims he wants to govern his state and not run for  president until later. But not everyone in the PMDB is convinced  of this.    Not only is he criticized by his party, but Quercia still  has  problems in court. On Monday the 28th, Governor Fleury will have  a golden opportunity to either add to his predecessor's problems  or lend him a helping hand. At 1600 in Brasilia, Fleury will  testify in the case that is looking into an allegedly improper  purchase of equipment from Israel. The testimony will be given  in the chambers of Judge Costa Leite in the Superior Court of  Justice (STJ) in Brasilia, at a closed-door hearing witnessed  only by a federal prosecutor. Quercia is supposed to testify on  Friday the 4th. If the inquiry ends in March, Costa Leite can  still present the case against the former governor at the  Special Court in April. This panel of 21 members of the STJ  would judge Quercia. "At any rate, the case will go to trial," a  court staffer said. "All that remains to be done is for Judge  Costa Leite to conclude the case." In the event he is convicted,  Quercia would lose the right to run for any public office in  this year's elections. If acquitted, he would have an extra  trump card to use in the attempt to discredit the charges  against him, but it would not prevent his opponents from  exploiting the issue.  <H5>  [Box p 26] </H5> <H5>  "If You Hit, You'll Get Hit" </H5>   Here are some quotes from the rhetorical contest between  Quercia and his opponents:    "If he announces his candidacy, he will be betraying both  his  electorate and me." (Quercia, on Fleury)    "No one who wants my support should make a statement like  that." (Fleury, in response)    "I'm going to start up the quercista bulldozer and  roll right over all of them." (Quercia, on the PSDB)    "He's talking about bulldozers because he is the candidate  of  the construction contractors." (Mario Covas, in response)    "I'm going to put that guy in jail. From the governor's  mansion right into the clink." (Quercia, on Ciro Gomes)    "That's what he hopes to see--himself and those other  thieves  running around loose and the good guys in jail." (Ciro Gomes, in  response)    "The candidate of the Right is Lula, along with his fascist  party." (Quercia, on Lula)    "Quercia is using Gestapo methods." (Lula, in response)</p>

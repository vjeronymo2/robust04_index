			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Security pact speeds Mideast peace process: Compromise and complicated formulae were key to hard-won Israeli-PLO accord Israel and the PLO have overcome deep suspicions to forge the Cairo accords on security. The signing in Cairo on Wednesday night broke months of deadlock over implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Employing painstaking compromise, complicated formulae and postponement of some sensitive issues, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, reached a deal which will inject momentum into the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The Cairo accords pave the way for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to meet Mr Arafat within four weeks to sign a comprehensive protocol leading to the delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho. Completion of Israeli military redeployment will not be possible by the April 13 deadline. To reach agreement on security issues, Mr Arafat had to give up demands for absolute PLO control over borders and roads, viewed as important symbols of sovereignty for a Palestinian state. Israel had to concede the Palestinian need for dignity without jeopardising security requirements. Israel keeps exclusive control over external security. The most important issues resolved under the accords are arrangements for the Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan border crossing; security details for the Jewish settlements in Gaza and for roads linking the settlements with Israel, and broad outline of the size and composition of the Jericho area. The most important details of a final protocol yet to be agreed are relations between the two economies; the operational limits of a Palestinian police force and transfer of administrative power from Israeli to Palestinian hands. All these issues must be finalised before Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat can sign the comprehensive protocol. Separate agreements on the modalities of holding Palestinian elections and redeployment of Israeli troops in the rest of the West Bank will be negotiated in Washington. The Cairo accords cleared away the most difficult issues of a protocol on Palestinian self-rule: Border arrangements: Israel retains responsibility for external security. It will rely heavily on modern surveillance devices rather than physical searches. Each border crossing will have one terminal with two wings, the Palestinian one to serve Palestinians and visitors to Gaza-Jericho, with a Palestinian flag and Palestinian policemen at its entrance. The Israeli wing will serve Israelis and foreigners. The Palestinians and the Israelis will have a closed area for searching luggage; Inspection: The Israelis may open luggage in the presence of the owner and a Palestinian policeman. Persons entering the Palestinian wing will pass through a magnetic gate in the presence of an Israeli and Palestinian policeman. A Palestinian may be physically searched by a Palestinian policeman in the presence of an Israeli policeman. Israel will check the identity documents of all Palestinians crossing the Palestinian wing but will do so 'in an invisible manner' for Gaza-Jericho residents. In the event of suspicion, both sides may question a Palestinian. A Palestinian may be apprehended crossing through the terminal by either side, but must be dealt with by a Palestinian policeman. Both sides have the right to veto entry to any person not a Gaza-Jericho resident; Israel will control security in the Palestinian-controlled areas between the Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan border posts, in close co-ordination with a Palestinian deputy. Palestinian policemen present will be armed with handguns; The area of Jericho: Israel and the PLO have initialled a mapped area of Jericho of 55.5 sq kms but left the final decision to Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat when they meet to sign the protocol. Israel guarantees safe passage to Palestinians to three areas outside the Jericho area: the religious site of Nebbi Moussa, the pilgrimage site of al-Maghtas, and the northern shores of the Dead Sea, where Palestinians will be allowed to set up private projects and joint tourism ventures. Palestinians will have sole control over roads in the Jericho area, with joint patrols, under Palestinian authority, on the main roads used by Palestinians and Israelis. Gaza security: Israel retains absolute authority over the Gush Katif and Erez settlement areas and Israeli military installation along the Egyptian border. In a second zone Israel will control security, in co-operation with Palestinians in security matters, including joint patrols. Israel retains absolute control over security for three roads linking the settlements with Israel.</p>

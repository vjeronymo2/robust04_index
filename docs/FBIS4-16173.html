			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Russian air defense aircraft have intercepted a  small U.S. private airplane over Kamchatka and forced it to land  on our territory because it had violated Russian airspace.  After the circumstances were clarified, the airplane was  refuelled and allowed to continue its flight. [passage omitted]    INTERFAX reports that Russian air defense troops were  alerted  by the fact that when the private jet violated flight rules an  American RSI-135 [as heard] spy aircraft was flying near the  Russian state border at the same altitude and at the same speed.  An investigation into the incident has started.</p>

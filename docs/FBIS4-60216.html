			<p>BFN     [Text] The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of  the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] Central Committee, addressed  a speech to the masses of the Yemeni people on the occasion of  the blessed 'Id al-Adha in which he stressed that Yemen was  facing oppression, tyranny, and an unjust war.    He said that a catastrophe has befallen Yemen and we have  done everything we could to avoid it, but the tyrants have  decided to impose it on us. If they have succeeded in imposing  the war on us, they will not, and they cannot, impose surrender  on us by their whims, desires, and shortsightedness.    The brother 'Ali Salih al-Bid pointed out that on the  occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, on the day when the  pilgrims stand on Mount Arafat, we appeal to God, the Great and  Almighty. We stand with our heads held high. We refuse tyranny  and oppression and we refuse to surrender.    He said that nothing other than what God has ordained would  befall us. We would face the injustice, irrespective of the  hands. [sentence as heard] Our belief would increase and we  would overstep this ordeal and show resistance similar to that  shown on the battlefield. Though the criminal gang has  dispatched all its forces to destroy the towns and besiege Aden,  it did not succeed in achieving anything. If they managed to  enter some areas, they have entered them as invaders and  occupiers.    The brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid expressed his confidence that  the masses of our people could respond to the occupation and  invasion, in the same manner as they confronted the Middle East  base before independence in Aden.    He called upon our courageous soldiers and brave strugglers  to make a single stance and to adhere closely to God and the  homeland and to the principles of the September and October  revolutions which we have absorbed. May God, the Great and  Almighty, enforce the right and defeat the rabble tyrants who  refuse to accept a cease-fire even during these sacred days and  on the day of the standing on Mount Arafat.</p>

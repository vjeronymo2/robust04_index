			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Dates for the diary What do the following dates have in common: October 13 1989, October 19 1987, October 18 1937, October 6 1932, October 29 1929, and September 18 1873? Dunce's caps for those who did not know they were the occasions of US stock market collapses, and top of the class for those who are also aware of other autumn falls. Indeed, of the 15 largest daily declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1928, 10 have been between September 24 and November 11. For those of an astrological bent, such figures may have significance, but there is also a more serious side to stock market crashes. Since 1987 much attention has focused on what role, if any, derivative products played in the crash. Futures and options do not create any net new risk, since for every long position there is a short, but they do encourage speculators. If such short term traders dominate a market they may increase volatility. Extra short-term volatility, however, does not make crashes inevitable. Because futures allow speculators to sell markets short as well as buy them, derivatives may even lead to a more measured decline over a longer period when a market is over-bought. In cash markets, fear may build up in holders of shares who are reluctant to sell until a crash is triggered. Futures pressure may provoke smaller bouts of selling earlier. Yet if history does hold the lesson, those obsessed with autumn catastrophe may have the last laugh. The South Sea Bubble burst between August and November 1720, and the Dutch tulip mania peaked in November 1636.</p>

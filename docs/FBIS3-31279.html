			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Who in the PDP Is the PDP?"] </F>   [Text] The inevitable has happened -- the largest party of  the Albanians in Macedonia, the PDP [Party for Democratic  Prosperity], has split. The attempt to reach a compromise  between the two opposing sides at an early congress produced no  results -- it was precisely at this congress that the final  split occurred.    The deputies and ministers group, as well as the majority of  congress delegates, left the hall when they saw that the other  side, the supporters of the radical Menduh Taci [chairman of the  Tetovo branch of the PDP], was making every effort to hold the  congress outside the Statute. What is more, Taci's group, which  made the technical preparations for the congress -- it never  crossed their minds to raise the Macedonian flag beside the  party flag and the Albanian flag -- used force: They barred  entry to members of the Central Assembly and prevented them from  participating in the congress (a congress body), they prevented  former president Nevzat Halili attending, and they deprived the  delegates and ministers of their right to vote! A working  presidency was not elected, for which only Menduh Taci's  supporters were proposed! Some delegates of several  simultaneously "formed" branches were also introduced. The  intention was clear -- to ensure that Taci's current won at all  costs.    His supporters had another objective -- to take over the  name  and property of the party. The party seal was "sequestered,"  and the rooms of the Tetovo Center occupied. Obviously, it will  be up to the court to decide -- who in the PDP is the PDP.  <H5>  Political Differences </H5>   Something that has been clear for some time was once again  confirmed: Taci's group is supported by the Republic of Albania.  The delegation attending from Tirana, besides delivering the  welcome speech (after the ministers and deputies group had  left), remained till the end with Taci's supporters. The Kosovo  delegation, sitting in the fourth row and not together with the  guests from Albania, who were sitting in the first row, remained  neutral after the "split" and left for Pristina, although they  are on the side of the deputies group.    Here is further evidence that Tirana is deeply involved in  the party division and that it supports the "Tacists": Albanian  Television's report on the congress was confined to Taci's  congress, with the solitary remark that "a group of delegates  left the congress," without mentioning the fact that it also  held a congress. Let us recall that Albania has hosted Menduh  Taci a couple of times, giving him support at very high level:  the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party of Albania,  various ministers, and even the Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi.    Only at first sight does it seem that there are no  differences in the programs of the two sides. As far as  political activities are concerned, however, the differences are  enormous and very substantial. At its congress Taci's group  assessed that the deputies and ministers had a different  ideology -- progovernment. They assessed that the final goal  must be the unification of all Albanians! According to Taci,  under the old leadership "Ilirida" remained undefined, and the  result of the (government) coalition was the arms affair and the  creation of other Albanian parties, which "destroyed the  Albanian people." Another conclusion was that -- the Yugoslav  Army and the Macedonian authorities were arming the Macedonians  in their homes, and therefore the "Albanians had to create  paramilitary formations!"    In his report Taci accused the PDP and the deputies group of  failing "to accentuate the interests of the Albanians" and said  that the Albanians were not "an equal and authentic subject in  Macedonia." As if the process of political activities aiming at  national equality were limited in time, after which other  methods of activities had to be undertaken. It is weird that a  negative reply was given to the "authenticity" of the Albanian  subject in Macedonia. Taci remarked that the position of the  deputies group in parliament was dependent (is it not logical  and normal with 22 deputies positions?) and that the coalition  was created without having a political platform (and what is the  PDP program, which is normally represented by the deputies  group, with its additional requests, depending on the activities  and agenda of parliament, which are not constant?).  <H5>  No More Coming Together </H5>   Quite a different tune from that of Taci's supporters  prevailed at the congress held by the supporters of the group of  deputies and ministers, where all conditions were fulfilled to  make it the Second PDP Congress. Aside from raising a large  Macedonian flag, it was reiterated that the PDP will operate  only through the institutions of the state, and that it was in  the interest of the Albanian factor to have the party operate  within the state authority. How the Albanians could otherwise  pledge to promote their status in the state is dangerous even to  think of. It was also said that the PDP must pledge to maintain  peace and stability in the state, which was their fatherland,  and official Albania was accused of interfering in the affairs  of an "authentic party."    The question now is -- what will become of the PDP?  According to the first statements in the course of the two  congresses, both sides claimed to have the right to the party.  Taci was precise: "One of the dilemmas is over -- we inherit  the party." This is probably not the case, however, because  their congress was of doubtful legitimacy. The deputies and  ministers group did not even think of whose hands continuity was  in: "They had created a scenario and a voting team" (Naser  Ziberi, their elected secretary, said).    Yesterday, when we believed passions had cooled, we put the  same question to both sides. The leader of the so-called "hard  current," radical Menduh Taci, elected vice president by his  supporters, declined to make a statement. He simply directed us  to someone else: "Ask President Arben Djaferi." Djaferi said  he would be giving neither statements nor interviews this week,  but he agreed to give us an interview after the end of the week.  Let us recall, Taci had also promised to give us an interview,  but he did not keep his promise.    We asked Djeladin Murati, the newly elected president of  the other side, to make a statement. He is also vice chairman  of the Macedonian People's Assembly. First, he told us he would  occupy this position only temporarily. He was candidate for  president of both sides, but he said he could not remain with  the "Tacists" because they worked contrary to the Statute.  "Privately, I never believed this would happen, and the PDP  must survive even if there is a small degree unity and even if  there are the problems of a careerist nature. The struggle for  power must be waged in a democratic way, and not by way of  disqualifying and labeling people," Murati told us.    Further, Murati pointed out that divisions occur in other  parties, too, and that the process of political differentiation  and definition was normal, and usually beneficial. Murati said  that the dispute within the PDP was of a program nature. He  also emphasized, however, that arguments were needed, not simply  some desires for autonomy, "Iliridas," or the refusal to join  the Macedonian Army.... "The PDP pledges the maintenance of  peace and stability, prosperity for the Albanians, without  neglecting the others in Macedonia. I believe there will be a  process of reexamination in the demonstrated relations, but it  is unlikely the two sides will come together." If the other  side wanted the name PDP, in Murati's opinion, it would have to  give it a suffix.</p>

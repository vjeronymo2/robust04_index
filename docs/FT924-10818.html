			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Financial reporting standard issued UK COMPANIES will be required radically to re-state their profit and loss accounts and provide more information under a financial reporting standard issued yesterday. FRS 3, produced by the Accounting Standards Board, the UK standard-setter, will virtually abolish extraordinary items and introduce several financial tables into accounts. It follows the consultation draft, Fred 1. Mr David Tweedie, chairman, said: 'FRS 3 is a landmark standard. It represents a radical change in the profit and loss account and moves the emphasis away from simple headline numbers.' The standard becomes compulsory for companies for financial year-ends on or after June 22 next year, but the ASB is encouraging earlier adoption. It supersedes SSAP 6, the existing standard. The biggest change is an attempt to divert readers' attention from earnings per share and to place all business transactions above the line. It will make the earnings figure more variable and require users of accounts to carry out their own calculations to reach a figure they find useful. The Institute for Investment Management and Research said yesterday it had set up a sub-committee to derive a 'maintainable' earnings figure using FRS 3. It expects to have produced a formula within six months. FRS 3 demands that companies split out results for acquisitions, and separate continuing from discontinued businesses. Figures for reorganisation, and sales of businesses and assets must be separately disclosed. It introduces a fourth primary financial statement - to accompany the profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement - which will be called the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Among other elements are: impact of foreign currency translations a note of historical cost profits and losses, reconciling pre-tax profits with the effect of revaluation and depreciation of property which has been sold. a note reconciling movements in shareholders' funds profit or loss on assets sold be shown as the difference between net sale proceeds and the net carrying amount shown in the balance sheet.

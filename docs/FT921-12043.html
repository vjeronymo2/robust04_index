			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: A taxing type of conundrum Sir, Reading Lex ('UK tax', January 25) leaves me asking this question. Why is a part of British industry moaning about the lack of capital allowances, which would reduce its taxable profits, while another part is saying that its taxable profits are too low, resulting in unrelieved advance corporation tax (ACT)? Never mind the voters' lack of interest in the niceties of corporation tax, the chancellor, too, must be rather bored by the topic. Maybe if one of the leading protagonists in the anti-ACT lobby had not got rid of its UK paper and retail earnings and if others had not over-distributed to save their skins, sympathy might be extended.

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (9): Trees planted for the future - Tim Coone investigates the renaissance of an ancient industry Ancient oak forests once covered much of Ireland. Over the centuries they were gradually laid bare to serve the economic and military ambitions of the Vikings, then the Normans, and later, to build the British battle fleets of Tudor, Stuart and Hanoverian kings and queens. Land that once grew Irish oak - which helped to spread the British empire from Jamaica to Jaipur - now grows cattle and sheep to build beef and butter mountains in the EU. Today there is no natural forest left in Ireland. Moreover, only 7 per cent of the country's land surface is afforested, compared with an average 24 per cent in the EU. But Irish forestry is now undergoing a renaissance, thanks to the overhaul of the EU common agricultural policy, a range of new financial incentives and a commitment by the Irish government to a big afforestation programme. Together, these have helped forest plantings grow to some 22,000 hectares a year. A target of 30,000 hectares a year has been set for the year 2000. 'Forestry will be a mainstream industry here within 30 years with an output of over IPounds 1bn a year at today's prices,' says Mr Martin Lowery, chief executive of Coillte, the Irish forestry board. Encouraged by tax-free grants and incentives, private plantings have grown 30-fold in the past decade, from fewer than 300 hectares a year in the early 1980s to more than 10,000 hectares a year at present. Proposals to increase the grants by about 50 per cent, with the maximum levels at IPounds 3,000 per hectare, are currently awaiting approval in Brussels. In total, some IPounds 40m a year in grants is expected to be channelled to the forestry sector up to the end of the decade. In addition, all income from forestry activities has been rated free of corporation and income tax. The existing 450,000 hectares of forest in Ireland, 85 per cent of it conifers, has mostly been planted since the early 1950s; it is only just beginning to mature. Current output of 2m cubic metres of timber a year is projected to rise to about 3.5m cubic metres by the end of the decade and will continue to rise thereafter. In the longer term, if current planting rates are maintained over the next 20 to 30 years, Mr Lowery believes that a sustainable yield of 12m cubic metres a year is feasible from a total planted area of 1.5m hectares which have been identified as being the most suitable for forestry. This would exceed the UK's current output of some 10m cubic metres a year. 'Forestry is a far better use of EU funds than set-aside payments, because at least there is a new industry being built up,' Mr Lowery says. Currently, there are two important industrial developments in preparation, both of which will once again place Ireland on the map as an exporter of forest products. Medite, the US company, is investing IPounds 21m to double output from its existing plant making medium density fibreboard (MDF). It aims to produce 300,000 cubic metres of MDF a year, using forest thinnings and by-products from the country's 100 saw-mills as raw material. Louisiana Pacific Corporation, also of the US, is due to start a joint venture later this year with Coillte to build an oriented strand board plant to export to Europe. Together, the two plants located in the Waterford region of Ireland are expected to absorb most of the residues and pulp wood coming from the newly-maturing Irish forests up to the end of the decade. Beyond then, additional processing capacity will be required as well as additional saw-mills. But can planting levels reach the government's 30,000 hectare-a-year target? Mr Lowery admits that obtaining sufficient land is becoming a problem. Spiralling land prices 'is going to make it difficult,' he says. Ms Elaine Farrell, head of the forestry division in the Irish Farmers' Association, says that poor land is currently being sold for forestry in a range of IPounds 900 to IPounds 2,000 a hectare, and that many farmers are now finding it difficult to compete with outside investors. More than three-quarters of private forest plantings are currently done by farmers. Mr Lowery says that Coillte aims to pay no more than IPounds 1,700 a hectare for the very best forestry land, and in 1992 paid an average of IPounds 1,313 a hectare. Land prices have risen more than 30 per cent since 1990, almost three times faster than the general inflation rate. Mr George O'Malley, managing director of Beltra Forestry, a private company which plants more than 1,000 hectares a year and manages plantations for private clients, says the tax incentives and grants available make forestry investment 'very attractive as long as the cost of the land is not too high'. The growing competition for land, however, is resulting in available sites now more likely to be in parcels of 'hundreds rather than thousands of acres,' he says. Meanwhile, opposition is growing from another quarter. Environmentalist groups are becoming increasingly vocal over the steady encroachment of sombre blocks of Sitka spruce on the Irish countryside, and are demanding that a greater variety of tree species be planted and that planning controls be introduced for new plantations. The government has responded predictably (by setting up a a committee to consider the issues), but has signalled that new legislation will probably - eventually - follow. Mr Lowery says that Coillte's aim is to reduce Sitka spruce plantings from just over 80 per cent at present down to 65 per cent, and to increase native broadleaf species such as oak and beech to around 10 per cent. Four years ago it began landscaping new plantations. But the species-diversity problem is that Sitka grows better than any other tree on low-quality soils, and in Ireland's damp, temperate climate at rates five to six times faster than in Scandinavia or North America, and at about double the rate of growth in the UK. Better quality conifer trees and hardwoods, suitable for joinery and sawlogs, require better soils, and the best agricultural land can now cost over IPounds 6,000 a hectare. The higher grants will undoubtedly have the desired effect of encouraging increased plantings and greater species diversity, but the danger is that they might also drive land prices higher still and ultimately dampen investor enthusiasm in the sector.</p>

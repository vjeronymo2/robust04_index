			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 23 March carries in its  regular 7-minute newscast two reports on the fighting in the  Bugojno and Bihac areas.    Correspondent Emir Avdakovic, reporting from Bugojno on the  situation in the past 24 hours, says that "Bugojno is a  veritable hell, as the city is pulverized by dozens of the most  destructive howitzer and tank shells. From their lairs in the  mountains encircling Bugojno, particularly from the direction of  Kupres, the chetniks are continuing to shell the town. The  fervor with which they are doing this is proportional to their  failures in direct clashes with the members of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army who have courageously and effectively  repelled the enemy's attempts at infantry breakthroughs, with a  further 15 chetniks being killed in the process. I say further,  because in recent clashes on the Bugojno front over 60 chetniks  were killed. According to reliable information, chaos rules in  their ranks. The members of the UN Protection Force's British  Battalion stationed in Bugojno have witnessed all this. For the  time being, they are silently observing from their armored  personnel carriers the horrors that the citizens of Bugojno are  being forced to endure. This morning the town was once again  shelled and the general alarm remains in force."    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "throughout  the night, the Serbian aggressor used artillery and tanks to  shell the Bihac and Cazin areas. The attacks were particularly  fierce after 2300 and in the early morning hours, when they  shelled the town centers and the roads linking Bihac and Cazin.  The aggressor is obviously employing a new strategy of shelling  civilian targets in those periods when there is less chance of  NATO planes patrolling the skies over Bihac. The situation on  the defense lines remains the same with the chetniks continuing  their bestial attacks, alternating artillery and infantry  attacks. Actually, there is not a single inch of the defense  lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau, Hasin Vrh, and  Barakovac that has not been hit by several shells overnight and  in the early morning hours. [Words indistinct] the Serbian  aggressor has been sporadically attacking in the theater of  operations of the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council  on the Pljesivica part of the front, where snipers are  particularly active this morning, while the area of Skoce has  come under artillery attack. All the defense lines are firm and  stable. [Abdic's] paramilitary forces have not been quiet  overnight and this morning. They are attacking the defenders  with all (?available means) in the areas of Krivaja, Leskovac,  and Trs [words indistinct]."</p>

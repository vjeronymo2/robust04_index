			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Markets surprised by tax on share profits Brokers and market analysts said yesterday they were surprised by the Israeli government's sudden reversal of policy on Tuesday with the announcement of a 10 per cent tax on real stock market profits. Most experts predicted the market would see a wave of selling in the short-term when it re-opens on Sunday, further depressing the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 companies, which has fallen 25 per cent this year from a peak of 250 points to around 180. They also said the government's lacklustre privatisation efforts would suffer another blow and hoped it would find ways to allow individuals to offset the tax against losses. However, many analysts accept the move brings Israel into line with global markets. Reflecting the mood of many of the country's economists, the Jerusalem Post said in an editorial yesterday: 'There is a glaring unfairness in taxing wage earners and not stock market speculators and there is no reason not to follow the example of most of the world's money markets.' Finance Ministry officials also believe the move could help to stabilise the volatile market by making highly speculative entry and exits less attractive. More importantly, experts believe the government's tax reform package will help to sustain medium-term growth of around 5 per cent a year and help to battle inflation, which has risen to 13-14 per cent this year. Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, said the expected Shk500m (Pounds 107m) revenue from the capital gains tax would allow the government to reduce the tax burden on employers. Among the measures announced by Mr Shochat are a cut in national insurance employer taxes from 2.4 to 1.93 per cent from October 1 to forestall further rises in prices as a result of the large cost of living increase being paid in this month's salaries. The reduction will amount to Shk300m annually. The treasury also announced reductions in purchase taxes totalling about Shk480m on a number of items such as air conditioners, computers, batteries, white cement, telephones, car parts, liquid soap, shampoo and toothpaste. Mr Shochat also said he was pressing ahead with unilateral trade liberalisation, reducing duties on imports from countries with no trade agreement with Israel. Duties on most items will drop 5-10 per cent. The effect of trade liberalisation and tax cuts, on top of next year's Shk800m reduction in taxes, should considerably reduce inflationary pressures. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said the cost reduction elements of the package would help in the war against inflation but represented moves to make the economy more efficient and were 'not a substitute for conventional macro-economic policies designed to tackle inflation'. Economists said the governor's remarks were a clear hint about a further increase in interest rates - the fourth rise this year. Interest rates charged by the Bank of Israel to commercial banks have risen since January from 10 to 12.5 per cent.</p>

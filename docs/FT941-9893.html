			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy BP trade Initial reaction to fourth-quarter figures from BP saw the share price shoot through the 400p barrier, but after the company's meeting a more sober reaction saw the stock slip back. Hefty two-way business led to exceptionally heavy turnover of 24m shares. The results showed BP back in profit, with a historic cost net profit of Pounds 615m after exceptionals, against a loss of Pounds 458m in 1992, and a replacement cost net profit of Pounds 896m, compared to a loss of Pounds 352m previously. Despite this, one analyst said: 'David Simon (the chief executive) reminded the market that BP is sensitive to oil prices.' Even the most bullish analysts argued that it was time BP paused for breath, while Mr John Toalster of SGST, and the renowned bear of the stock, said: 'The shares are massively overbought. When reality does set in, I would see them fall below 300p.' Yesterday, BP shares swung back from a high of 407p to end a net 4 1/2 down at 386p, shrugging off confirmation of a large oil find west of the Shetlands. Shell Transport picked up to close 3 higher at 734p. International stocks with strong US exposure held up well against a weak market as Salomon Brothers, the US brokerage, launched a Pounds 130m warrant on stocks geared to US recovery. The house issued 10m call warrants, which give holders the right to buy underlying stock at a fixed date at 128p. Holders of 20 warrants can buy a basket of shares made up largely of shares in Hanson, the UK conglomerate, which generates more than 45 per cent of its turnover in the US. Hanson put on 1 1/2 at 299 1/2 p. The other companies are Carlton Communications (off 10 at 996p), Grand Metropolitan (down 11 at 450p), RTZ (8 cheaper at 866p), Siebe (3 easier at 579p) and Tomkins (up 3 at 258p). Mr Marcus Grubb, Salomon's chief strategist, said: 'As a basket the shares have underperformed the London market by 12 per cent over the past year and they all have a big exposure in terms of sales, profits and assets to the US.' The warrants expire in two years' time, when they will be exercisable into share baskets costing Pounds 258.60 each, a discount to yesterday's collective share price of Pounds 290. A successful market debut for Alpha Airports, the airline catering group spun off from Forte, saw the shares open at 165p, a premium of 25p, and advance to end at 172p. Dealers said the shares were oversubscribed six times and Forte retained a 25 per cent stake. They also pointed out that the equity market had made gains since the shares were priced last week. Forte firmed a half-penny to 253p. Initial enthusiasm to first-quarter results from BOC dwindled away as analysts returned from a very cautious meeting with the new management. Realisation that profit margins were still under pressure in spite of volumes picking up saw the shares swing from a gain of 14 to end a net 17 lower at 681p. Third-quarter results ahead of market forecasts saw BT shares move smartly forward, only to be clipped back by profit-taking. They closed 1 1/2 adrift at 455p on 9.3m traded. Most brokers raised full-year forecasts after the company reported improved inland calls and business connections. Vodafone was one of the day's best performers, the shares jumping 15 to 630 1/2 p on talk of strong US buying and imminent upgrades in London. The mobile telecoms operator recently unveiled new connections for January at 27,500, more than twice the figure in the previous year. Exploration and production group Enterprise Oil fell 15 to 449p in the wake of a strong sell recommendation from Nomura, the Japanese securities house, which has argued that its premium to the net asset value is unjustified. Textiles were firm on the back of a sector conference hosted by SG Warburg, but Dawson International was down 7 at 134p after touching 123p on an announcement that the group would have to make provisions. The day's biggest retreat in the market was recorded in motors group Jessups, which initially tumbled 36 to 80p after stating that it would report a loss for the 16 months to the end of last year. Bargain hunters later helped the shares claw back some of the earlier loss to finish a net 20 down at 96p. Reports that international trading group Lonrho was planning a Pounds 100m convertible bond issue within the next few weeks did the rounds. The shares relinquished 3 1/2 to 162 1/2p, as 5.6m were dealt. Announcement of an acquisition saw Starmin, the aggregates group, rise 1 3/4 to 5p, or more than 50 per cent - the biggest percentage gain in the London market.</p>

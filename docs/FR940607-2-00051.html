			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HCP will be implemented under the terms of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit issued by the Service and the IA. The permit is requested for a period of 20 years, or until urban development permits are issued for 15,200 acres of natural lands or 43,000 acres of open lands. The HCP has three categories of participation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Service as a permitter and advisor to the Implementation Trust (Trust); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. City and County as permittees and trustees; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Other implementing entities such as The Nature Conservancy and CDFG as preserve development coordinators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The City and County will be the primary entities responsible for administering the institutional elements of the HCP in their respective jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration of the HCP involves the following categories: (1) Local mitigation fee collection and fund management, (2) management of State and Federal funding, if applicable, (3) preserve selection and acquisition, (4) preserve management, (5) land restoration and enhancement and species monitoring, (6) annual report and preparation, and (7) enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCP program relies on the formation of a Trust which would be in charge of making major preserve acquisition decisions and for administering the plan. The Trust will comprise representatives from the City and County as trustees, the Service, CDFG, and a member of the public as mandatory advisors. Specific preserve management plans would be developed later and carried out by each individual preserve management entity. The mitigation funds collected by the City and County will be deposited into a trust fund and would be administered by the Trust. The Trust will meet as necessary to carry out the HCP. The Trust will be responsible for reporting to the Service as to the status of enhancement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCP program will be funded through the collection of a one time mitigation fee paid on all new construction taking place within the conservation plan area. The fee is $1,240 per gross acre for all new construction on previously undeveloped land, payable at the time building permits are issued. The fee is set in 1993 dollars and will be adjusted annually for inflation. Upon payment of this fee and receipt of City or County project approval, a development permit applicant would become a sub-permittee and would be allowed the incidental take of species in accordance with Federal endangered species laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fee is based on per acre estimated costs of, (1) $600 for land, (2) $100 for fencing and improvement, (3) $300 for management and enhancement, and (4) $250 for program administration. The amount of mitigation fees collected will depend on the rate of growth in the HCP area. At current growth rates, fees will generate funding for acquisition and management or roughly 700 acres per year. State and Federal conservation funds will be sought to augment local funds for land acquisition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCP applies to the entire conservation plan area (2010 General Plan), but the requested section 10(a)(1)(B) permit would only allow take in the area outside of the primary flood plain of the Kern River and lands within the Kern Water Bank. The Kern River is excluded to assure that an open corridor can be maintained between the foothills to the northeast and the San Joaquin Hills Valley floor to the west. Kern Water Bank lands are under the jurisdiction of the State of California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCP addresses lands converted primarily to urban uses as permitted by the City or County. Activities which may result in a take, but which are not subject to approval by the City or County, will not be authorized by the proposed permit. Thus, impact on natural lands from oil extraction or agriculture are not subject to the permit, although some types of ancillary oil and agricultural facilities that are subject to City or County permits would be covered. Activities not covered by the permit would have to comply separately with Federal requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

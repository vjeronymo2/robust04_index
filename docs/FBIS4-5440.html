			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dirty Conspiracy of Master and Stooge"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The abortion of the  third round of the DPRK-USA talks and the creation of a grave  situation on the Korean peninsula are a result of the filthy  conspiracy between the U.S. master trying to stifle the  socialism of Korea and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique who are  courting the favor of the master and attempting to slay fellow  countrymen with his help, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary  today.    The news analyst notes:    In return for its "commitment" to the "security" of South  Korea from "nuclear threat of the North," the United States  forced the puppets to open the South Korean rice market, bear  heavier burden for the maintenance of the U.S. troops in South  Korea and introduce Patriot missiles and other weapons in larger  quantities.    Accepting all the demands of the United States, the South  Korean puppets sold off the dignity and interests of the nation  to the master. They made no bones about committing such  flunkeyist treacheries as entreating the master to set the  exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea as a  precondition for the third-round of DPRK-USA talks in an attempt  to meddle in the "nuclear problem" without any power and  capacity.    The abortion of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks and  the  creation of a grave situation on the Korean peninsula are  entirely attributable to such disgusting conspiracy between the  United States and the South Korean puppet clique.    If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is to be  solved and the strained situation is to be eased today, an end  must be put to the U.S. hostile policy to stifle Korea, and such  a flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from the  power and their criminal tieup be smashed.</p>

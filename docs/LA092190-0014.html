			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSTON HANDS CINCINNATI CRUSHING DEFEAT, 3-2;  </P> <P> REDS: PINCH-HITTER CARL NICHOLS HITS TWO-RUN SINGLE FOR ASTROS WITH TWO OUT IN  BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Carl Nichols singled home the tying and winning runs with two out  in the ninth inning Thursday night, giving the Houston Astros a 3-2 victory  over the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> The Reds, who have lost three straight and six of 11, had their National League  West lead trimmed to 3 1/2 games over the Dodgers, who beat San Diego, 7-2.  </P> <P> Glenn Davis led off the ninth with a single off Reds' relief ace Randy Myers  (3-5), who relieved starter Norm Charlton in the eighth. Gerald Young ran for  Davis and Dave Rohde, another pinch-hitter, was hit by a pitch.  </P> <P> Craig Biggio sacrificed the runners to second and third and Rafael Ramirez was  intentionally walked, loading the bases. Myers struck out Mark Davidson before  Nichols batted for winning pitcher Xavier Hernandez and delivered his  game-winning hit.  </P> <P> Hernandez (2-0) pitched one hitless inning in relief of Mike Scott, who gave up  two runs -- one earned -- and six hits in eight innings. Charlton held Houston  to three hits in 7 1/3 innings. Since moving into the starting rotation July  15, Charlton is 7-3 with a 1.91 earned-run average and has not allowed more  than three earned runs in any of his 14 starts.  </P> <P> The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Davis singled, stole second,  continued to third on catcher Biggio's throwing error and scored on a passed  ball.  </P> <P> Eric Davis made it 2-0 in the fourth with his 22nd homer.  </P> <P> The Astros began their comeback in the sixth when Eric Yelding singled, stole  second and scored on a single by Casey Candaele.  </P></p>

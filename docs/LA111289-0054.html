			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GDANSK A SOLID SYMBOL OF POLAND'S PAST, FUTURE  </P> <P> It was adjacent to this city, at a narrow peninsula on the Baltic Coast called  Westerplatte, that the first shots of World War II were fired, little more than  half a century ago.  </P> <P> The date was Sept. 1, 1939.  </P> <P> Though Gdansk has achieved worldwide fame in recent years as the birthplace of  the Solidarity trade union, Westerplatte, symbolically, remains a significant  landmark of 20th-Century history.  </P> <P> The monument, modernistic and muscular in appearance, was erected in 1966.  Towering 82 feet atop a man-made hill, it commemorates the Defenders of the  Coast. Fresh flowers -- in red and white, Poland's national colors -- adorn the  monolith's base. Bouquets tied with ribbons are sometimes placed in clefts in  the sculpted granite.  </P> <P> The first time I visited the peninsula, blossoms quivered in a stiff breeze  blowing in from the sea. I was joined that morning by flocks of bundled-up  Polish school kids, who learn early on that Westerplatte has great significance  in their country's long, often tragic history.  </P> <P> So they listened intently as teachers told them about Maj. Henryk Sucharski's  gallant stand.  </P> <P> Following a cannon bombardment from the battleship Schleswig-Holstein at 4:45  in the predawn morning of Sept. 1, 1939, 5,000 Germans stormed Westerplatte.  Maj. Sucharski's 88-man garrison, hastily reinforced by about 100 volunteers  from the city, was ordered to hold the peninsula's munitions depot for 12  hours.  </P> <P> Incredibly, the stubborn defense against impossible odds lasted seven days and  seven nights, while Poland waited for Allied naval and air force help that  never came. The world's most destructive war was suddenly under way, and the  Poles were its first victims.  </P> <P> Why Adolf Hitler chose to attack this place at that time is an entangled  matter, with strands stretching all the way back to the Treaty of Versailles,  signed 70 years ago, in 1919.  </P> <P> By treaty mandate, the strategic port city was taken from defeated Germany and  made an independent state -- called the free city of Danzig -- at the Baltic  outlet of a 90-mile strip of German territory assigned to Poland. This "Polish  Corridor" separated East Prussia from Pomerania on Germany's fractured map.  Hitler's demand for reunification led to the 1939 invasion.  </P> <P> I walked the pathways over grassy stretches and through wooded areas. Sea birds  swooped and squawked overhead. The vanished garrison's concrete barracks have  been left as a bullet-pocked, artillery-shattered ruin.  </P> <P> The actual monument to Sucharski and his men is close by: a tank on a pedestal,  along with a cross and a dark bronze tablet brightened with flowers. Atop a  tablet perches an eagle -- Poland's ancient, stalwart emblem -- with one wing  bent low to represent pain in battle.  </P> <P> As I looked and pondered, a girl's voice came from a cluster of teen-age  students. She was reciting a poem. It is, my companion explained, commemorative  verse written by Konstanty Ildefons Galczynski and familiar to Poles young and  old:  </P> <P>  "When the days were fulfilled  </P> <P>  and one had to die in summer,  </P> <P>  straight to heaven, in rows of four  </P> <P>  went the soldiers of Westerplatte."  </P> <P>  Such gestures are not uncommon, for this is hallowed ground indeed, and Polish  people are emotional and intensely patriotic. On a subsequent visit, I watched  six old men step into military cadence while heading uphill to the Defenders of  the Coast monument. Medals hung from their suit jackets. After laying a floral  wreath, they saluted and then marched back down the hill to conclude their  silent, private ceremony.  </P> <P> Friends in Gdansk told me that Westerplatte's importance to Poland goes beyond  that fateful first week of September in 1939. It represents defiant resistance  throughout the war. Hence the powerful symbolism of a monument that stands  alone, rock-solid and tall, facing the sea.  </P> <P> Of course, my friends also showed me their city, made famous in this decade by  Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement. Local history, however, precedes  Westerplatte and the labor unrest of the 1980s by hundreds of years.  </P> <P> As is the case everywhere in Poland, the past is clouded by conquests and  partitions. Consequently, Gdansk has endured geopolitical identity crises,  becoming Prussian-German Danzig in 1772 and 1793. It was absorbed into Hitler's  Reich after the fall of Poland in 1939.  </P> <P> But there have been glory days, too. This is immediately apparent in the  sizeable Old Town sector, clustered between canals, the Motlawa River,  magnificent gate towers and remnants of medieval walls.  </P> <P> We strolled the pedestrian-only Royal Road, lined with beautifully embellished  Baroque and Renaissance facades. The route broadens at a public square called  Dlugi Targ (long market); its narrower continuation is Ulica Dluga (Long  Street).  </P> <P> At midpoint stands the Town Hall's 260-foot clock tower, built in dark-red  brick late in the 14th Century, soon after the seaport had joined Northern  Europe's Hanseatic League of mercantile cities.  </P> <P> Highest prosperity occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries. Gdansk,  favorably situated at the mouth of the Vistula River, became a Baltic granary  for rye and wheat, shipped on rafts from the Polish heartland for purchase by  German, Dutch and Swedish merchants.  </P> <P> Rich burghers acquired mansions with decorative terraces, parapets and curlicue  gables. They can be seen in pastel rows on parallel side streets, dominated by  the Church of Our Lady's stern tower. This lofty Gothic basilica -- begun in  1343 and completed in 1502 -- is said to be the world's largest brick church  and is the fifth-biggest cathedral in Europe.  </P> <P> It takes little more than a casual look around the Old Town to notice numerous  pale patches in the omnipresent brickwork covering towers, steeples and  facades. These are vestiges of a massive rebuilding program that began in 1948  and was substantially completed by 1956.  </P> <P> Gdansk suffered almost total destruction during the war, especially in the  spring of 1945, when the city became a last-ditch German stronghold against the  Russian Red Army's advance on Berlin.  </P> <P> And so one learns that the historic district is, remarkably, a meticulous  reconstruction from rubble -- a powerful assertion that Poland, though battered  by war, was too tough to die. Restoration work is now under way on the dozen  granaries bordering the Motlawa River. Granary structures elsewhere tend to be  squat and drab. Gdansk's were built in the Hanseatic tradition of architectural  flamboyance. The best is 17th-Century Baroque; another has been transformed  into a music academy.  </P> <P> Displays and artifacts covering the city's centuries-old history as a port and  shipbuilding center are on view in the Central Maritime Museum, facing the  river embankment where sightseeing excursion boats tie up.  </P> <P> The Gothic gate tower that houses this fascinating museum has a past of its own  -- its built-in wooden crane began hoisting cargo 500 years ago. The river and  interconnected canals are vital access lanes to the sea, four miles away.  </P> <P> Any reference to shipbuilding in connection with Gdansk must lead to the Lenin  Shipyard and, in turn, to Solidarity. The yard isn't far from Old Town  attractions and is easy to find because its dark, angular cranes loom high on  the skyline.  </P> <P> St. Brygida's is a venerable 15th-Century parish church, but has become far  better known as a meeting place and sanctuary for Solidarity activists and  sympathizers. Fiery slogans are familiar sights on the interior courtyard  walls.  </P> <P> The lean, high, much-photographed Solidarity monument shares blood brotherhood  with the granite shaft out at Westerplatte. Both, after all, commemorate  resistance against numerically superior powers. Situated just outside the  shipyard's Gate 2, this newer memorial consists of three steel beams, each  rising 140 feet to form three crosses at the top.  </P> <P> The mound covering the base of the emotionally charged, stark but oddly  beautiful structure is festooned with flowers as well as banners, ribbons,  coins and school badges, even religious medals, rosaries, handwritten poems and  prayers, along with votive candles whose dots of flame flicker in the wind.  </P> <P> I looked up at the crosses on an afternoon when glinting sunshine turned the  beams to silver. Dedicated in December, 1980, the monument honors 27 protesters  who died exactly a decade before, killed by police during Gdansk's "bread  riots."  </P> <P> Nuances are the tower's real strength. Purposely lacking any arty pretensions,  it looks the way it was built: shaped and welded by local laborers. Three  anchors hanging below the crosses could easily be interpreted as symbols of the  dingy shipyard where the independent trade union Solidarnosc was organized  during a 17-day strike in August, 1980.  </P> <P> But in fact they go back 45 years into the depth of Poland's wartime trauma. An  anchor, symbolizing hope, was the insignia of the underground Home Army that  launched the Warsaw Uprising against German occupiers in August, 1944. In terms  of utterly courageous resistance, nothing in Polish history can match that  63-day battle to the death.  </P> <P> Inbred emotional fervor gives typical Poles a talent for dramatic flair. I was  mindful of this when one of my Gdansk friends shared with me her memory of the  Solidarity monument's 1980 dedication.  </P> <P> Government and church dignitaries were present, for this was meant to be a time  of national reconciliation during the fragile hiatus preceding martial law,  imposed 12 months later. An orchestra and chorus performed an oratorio to the  dead by Polish composer Krzystof Penderecki.  </P> <P> Then came a synchronized wail of whistles, horns and sirens from the shipyard,  autos, outlying factories and ships on the Vistula. With a welder's torch, Lech  Walesa lit the eternal flame.  </P> <P> My friend recounted this as we sat in a kawiarnia (coffee house). For the  Poles, this is a favored haven for relaxation and gossip. The best of them --  and there are several in central Gdansk -- have a quiet, intimate, prewar  European atmosphere enhanced by dim lighting and dark, carved woodwork.  </P> <P> In fair weather, cafe proprietors set up tables beneath tulip-shaped umbrellas  on the Long Market pavement. They're placed beside the 17th-Century Neptune  Fountain, with watery reference to this city by the sea and perhaps the finest  classical statue in Poland.  </P> <P> Patriotism becomes audible each hour throughout the day. Bells in the Town Hall  tower clang out the pigeon-scattering notes of an anthem called Rota (the  Oath), written in 1908 to honor Polish territorial resistance in nearby  Prussia:  </P> <P>  "We shall not yield our forebears' land  </P> <P>  Nor watch our language muted;  </P> <P>  Our nation is Polish and Polish our fold . . . "  </P> <P>  But brooding about past struggles is not a national obsession. Poles have  always managed to escape into their rich, exuberant culture. Thus the Wybrzeze  Theater, located alongside the walls on the Old Town's perimeter, is widely  acclaimed for artistically bold, nationalistic productions. Packed houses are  the norm in Gdansk's futuristic glass-and-brick performing arts center, home of  the Baltic Philharmonic, State Opera and a brilliant ballet company.  </P> <P> Begun by Cistercian monks in the 13th Century, the cathedral in suburban Oliwa  predates partitions and the severest wars. Though Romanesque on the outside,  its prized feature is an 18th-Century rococo organ with 7,826 wooden and pewter  pipes.  </P> <P> During daily recitals, hymns boom out, accompanied by sounds of trickling  water, twittering birds, howling wind and tinkling bells rung by mechanical  angels.  </P> <P> I also toured a hilly "Polish Switzerland" lake district where Kashubians live.  The Kashubs are a durable breed of northern Poles who have preserved their  distinct Slavonic dialect and traditions throughout national upheavals.  </P> <P> Wydzydze Kiszewskie, 40 miles inland from Gdansk, is a vibrant, full-fledged  folk center with ethnic Kashubian crafts, food, music and farm-village  architecture.  </P> <P> And so, despite the blitzkrieg and conquest of 1939, despite limitations on  freedom during the subsequent 50 years, the Polish spirit lives on.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> LOT Polish Airlines has scheduled nonstop service to Warsaw from New York and  Chicago. Pan Am is the only U.S. carrier with service to and from Warsaw. New  York's Kennedy Airport is the gateway with connections in Frankfurt, West  Germany. Flights between Warsaw and Gdansk via LOT domestic service are  frequent; travel time is one hour. LOT now flies wide-body Boeing jets across  the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Hotels managed by Orbis, Poland's largest travel organization, have  consistently good standards of quality. There are seven in the vicinity of  Gdansk, including two -- Hevelius and Monopol -- which are close to the Old  Town. The Orbis Marina in suburban Jelitkowo is an alternative for those  preferring a resort close to Baltic beaches. Double-occupancy rates are per  person for all three hotels are approximately $62 U.S. in summer and fall, $42  in the low-season winter period.  </P> <P> Along with a passport, U.S. citizens need a visa to enter Poland. The fee for a  single-entry visa, good for up to a 90-day stay, is $18. Visa applications are  handled by the Orbis Polish Travel Bureau, 500 Fifth Ave., New York 10110,  (212) 391-0844.  </P></p>

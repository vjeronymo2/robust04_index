			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: M-Net declines to R13m LOSSES suffered in the European associate of M-Net, the South African pay television company, offset a sound domestic performance causing attributable earnings to fall by 36 per cent in the six months to the end of September, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Turnover rose by 29 per cent to R353.2m (Dollars 121.7m) from R274.4m a year earlier and net profits were 43 per cent higher at R22.1m, against R15.5m. M-Net's share of losses incurred by associated companies, however, amounted to R9.3m against none previously. This dragged attributable profits down to R12.8m from R15.5m in 1991. A 29 per cent increase in the number of shares in issue - a R252m rights issue was concluded in January - further diluted earnings per share which fell by 36 per cent to 6.5 cents from 10.2 cents. Mr Ton Vosloo, chairman, attributed the improvements in turnover and profits to advertising revenues remaining firm, despite the recession and continuing growth in the subscriber base. He said that the losses by associate companies were attributable to the strategy of restructuring and aggressively growing FilmNet, the European pay television company. M-Net was part of a consortium, led by Richemont, the Swiss tobacco and luxury goods group, that bought FilmNet in November 1991. M-Net has an effective equity stake of 45 per cent in FilmNet.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): When optimism was misplaced - London / David Wighton looks at where the analysts got it wrong There is a traditional Christmas game beloved of financial columnists which consists of pointing out how wildly wrong highly-paid analysts were with their end-of-year forecasts. This time, the results are striking. Their predictions for 1994 were mostly way out. But had they merely repeated their forecasts for 1993, they would have been spot on. Having been over-cautious in 1993 they were over-optimistic in 1994. The FT-SE 100 index closed 1994 at 3,065.50, down 10.3 per cent on the year, but up nearly 8 per cent since the beginning of 1993. In their defence, analysts might argue that the period between November 1993 and March 1994, in which shares rose and fell by more than 10 per cent, was what Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, might have described as a 'blip' - an interruption in the steadily-rising trend since sterling fell out of the exchange rate mechanism. The forecasters would have to admit, however, that they read the economy wrongly. The City, and almost everybody else, under-estimated the strength of the UK's economic recovery in 1994 and the extent to which it would be achieved without re-kindling inflation. It turned out that the threat to UK markets lay not at home but across the Atlantic. Low US interest rates had generated strong economic growth in the US and booming bond markets around the world as US funds sought out better returns. Given the pace of US growth, a rise in short-term interest rates was expected widely. It was the reaction of the bond markets following the Federal Reserve's first move in February that took most observers by surprise. Bond prices crumbled, driven partly by the unwinding of highly-geared, speculative positions held by hedge funds and banks' in-house trading teams. The UK gilts index fell by a tenth in two months and equities were dragged down in line. To be fair, many leading analysts downgraded their expectations swiftly as interest rates started to rise. Nomura's Nick Knight, whose bullishness was spot-on in 1993, turned bearish shortly after the Fed moved; by June, his 1994 Footsie forecast had been slashed from 4,000 to 3,000. He is now one of the more bearish of market forecasters - along with Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon, whose January prediction that the Footsie would hit 2,900 at some stage during the year came true in June. As gilts bottomed over the summer, equities staged a short-lived rally. Both ended the year on a firmer note, but 1994 still goes down as one of the worst years in recent memory. Including dividends, equities provided negative returns for only the second time in the past 20 years (the other was 1990), while the negative return on gilts of around 11 per cent was the worst since 1974. For equities, that came against a background of around 20 per cent growth in earnings per share and average dividend increases of almost half that. Dividend growth was better than expected, with cash flooding into companies' coffers and investment remaining subdued. Many companies found themselves with too much and decided to return some of it to shareholders. Boots spent Pounds 500m buying back its shares, while the regional electricity companies put a total of Pounds 1bn back into investors' hands through buy-backs or through special dividends. Given the strength of corporate balance sheets, bids for UK companies were surprisingly few. Following the series of television bids - for LWT, Central, and Anglia - and GKN's offer for Westland, activity was rather subdued apart from the battle for VSEL and Enterprise Oil's unsuccessful Pounds 1.45bn bid for Lasmo. The problem initially was that the stock market was valuing companies more highly than potential bidders. This was reflected in the many new issues as companies (particularly former management buy-outs) that might normally have been sold to trade purchasers floated instead. All too many rushed on to the market - only to trip up shortly afterwards. The fall in share prices failed to stem the flow of new issues or to fuel a widely-expected explosion of bids. But this month's Pounds 1.2bn bid by Trafalgar House for the Newcastle-based Northern Electric could well mark the start of a much more active period. The bid helped to ensure that electricity was one of the few stock market sectors to end the year ahead. Most of the others that did so - such as oil, mining and paper - were businesses which benefited from price increases. Once again, small company shares outperformed large, although not by much. During the first part of the year, small companies continued the strong relative recovery begun in 1993. But they were left behind somewhat in the end-of-year rally; what trading there was concentrated more on larger stocks. At the end of 1994, both equities and gilts are offering reasonable value by historic standards. The yield on shares is back to 4 per cent, with another year of strong earnings and dividend growth ahead, while 10-year gilts are offering 8.7 per cent. That promises an attractive real return, and stiff competition for equities, unless inflation breaks back through 4 per cent. UK valuations also look attractive relative to the US and most continental markets although, as 1994 showed once again, relatively cheap stocks can easily get cheaper still. Taking all these factors into account, we can predict confidently that the Footsie will have regained the 3,400 mark by the end of 1995 . . . or perhaps 1996.</p>

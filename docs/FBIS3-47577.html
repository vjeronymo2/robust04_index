An agency official briefing reporters on the monthly report  on the state of Japanese economy said the situation is severe  and the recession is lagging on.    In the report, the EPA simply stated that the state of the  economy is "overall sluggish."    Asked if the agency is using its gloomiest words possible to  describe the situation, the official answered "yes."    The EPA pointed out that consumer spending remained  lackluster, while the weakness of plant and equipment investment  is spreading from manufacturers to the nonmanufacturing sector.    The report noted the plodding process of inventory  adjustments and said industrial output remains stagnant.    The official said business conditions of private enterprises  are worsening. He said he can no longer attribute the situation  merely to the yen's appreciation, admitting the overall  situation is simply "bad."    Job offers continued to decline, while the unemployment rate  continues to increase, the report said.    The EPA said the government is hence currently working to  compile another comprehensive pump-priming package to spur the  economy, in addition to steady implementation of past  stimulation programs.    Exports are down with effects of the yen's appreciation  gradually appearing and because of an adjustment of the economic  growth in China after a heated period, the official said.    Meanwhile, implementation of public works spending improved  and housing starts were also solid.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: BCH rises 34.8% to Pta98.5bn in first half BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, yesterday reported sharply improved first-half results, raising its operating profit by 34.8 per cent to Pta98.5bn (Dollars 794m). Mr Jose Maria Amusategui, chairman, said BCH had overcome the difficulties of the 1991 merger between its constituent parts, Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano, and was on the road to sustained profitability. The bank, which saw its 1992 profits fall by 22 per cent to Pta52.6bn after negative results in the second half of last year, posted net profits of Pta38.4bn in the first six months of this year, 4 per cent up on the first half of 1992. The bottom-line profit came after putting aside Pta38.1bn for provisions, 84 per cent more than at the six-month stage last year. Mr Amusategui, who took over the reins of the bank late last year and has since reshuffled its senior management, said BCH would this year easily improve on 1992's net income. Mr Amusategui said that on the advice of Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, BCH intended to place 2m shares, representing just under 1 per cent of its share capital, on the international markets. The offering, worth Pta6.9bn at Madrid market prices involves shares held by Dragados, the BCH-controlled construction company. The decision to offer bank shares follows a series of favourable reports by financial houses, including Merrill Lynch, on a prospective turnround at BCH. Mr Amusategui said it was useful for the bank to present itself on the international markets.</p>

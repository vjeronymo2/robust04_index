			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Observer: An insider speaks out So who knew what, and when? These are the questions being asked as Franz Steinkuhler fights to retain his job as Germany's most powerful union boss in the wake of the disclosures about his recent winning streak on the German stock market. Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the German Bundesbank, is in no doubt that Steinkuhler must have had some idea of the impending decisions at Daimler-Benz where he is on the supervisory board. 'As a private citizen I am convinced that Steinkuhler had information, for I was myself deputy chairman of the supervisory board at VW during the 1970s, and I know how it works. Of course there is no officially recorded information,' he told Welt am Sonntag, the leading German Sunday newspaper. Even if Steinkuhler did not know about the plans which led to a sharp rise in the share price, there were others who probably knew something was afoot. Prior to the event, Deutsche Bank chief executive Hilmar Kopper, whose group has a big stake in Daimler, was asked about plans to do away with MAH, which holds a big stake in Daimler. All he would say was 'watch this space'. But two weeks before, Deutsche board member Ronaldo Schmitz had hinted to fund managers in Dusseldorf that action was likely before Deutsche would do anything to reduce its 28 per cent Daimler stake. Pohl's real concern is that the allegations of insider-trading against Steinkuhler could damage Germany's international reputation as a financial centre, especially in the US. American investors found it hard enough to understand why leading trade unionists were on the supervisory boards of German companies in the first place, says Pohl. If they now believed that such board members were speculating in the shares of their companies, 'they will prefer to avoid the German share market altogether'.</p>

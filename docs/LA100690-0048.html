			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STAND ON U.N. CONVENTION FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> We do not allow minors under 18 to vote, to sign binding legal contracts, to  enlist in the Army without parental permission, or to marry without special  permission because we know that they are not fully mature or responsible. But  we are perfectly willing to gas them, electrocute them or lethally inject them  if they commit a murder, as if they were fully responsible adults.  </P> <P> KENNETH A.

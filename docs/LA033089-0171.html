			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE PROWL  </P> <P> As land development in Orange County pushes into the foothills and former wild  land, residents have had an increasing number of confrontations with the areas'  native inhabitants -- the wily coyotes.  </P> <P> The coyote, like man, is a victim of the negative aspects of growth. And like  man, the coyote adapts, adjusts and learns to live in new surroundings.  </P> <P> The coexistence, however, is not entirely peaceful. Nor is it always desirable.  Housing tracts on the doorstep of coyotes' natural habitat provide the setting  for dangerous changes in the animal's behavior.  </P> <P> The coyote, according to wildlife experts, is a member of the canine family  that generally fears people and flees from them on sight. But familiarity  brings about a change, and in the peaceful setting of a housing tract, with  plenty of food, water and local pets to stalk, the coyotes lose their fear of  humans. They become more brazen. Visible. Lazy. And dependent on the  residential neighborhood for the easy abundance it provides.  </P> <P> Coyote sightings have increased dramatically from San Clemente to the Anaheim  Hills. Fortunately, there have been no deaths or attacks on children since 1987  in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> But pets have been attacked and killed. There is talk once again of employing a  sharpshooter to hunt down and kill the most daring coyotes causing the most  trouble.  </P> <P> That, however, is a stopgap, short-range solution to a specific part of the  coyote problem.  </P> <P> As long as land development continues to rob coyotes of their living space and  people push farther and farther into their domain, the most effective approach  is still preventive.  </P> <P> Residents should not, under any circumstances, feed coyotes or leave pet food  and water dishes outside where coyotes can get to them. Some cities, like San  Clemente, even have enacted laws against such feedings. Trash cans should be  kept tightly closed. Underbrush should be trimmed and children and pets closely  supervised.  </P> <P> For its own protection, the community must also not take from coyotes their  fear of humans and their natural ability to hunt and survive in what is left of  the county's brush country.  </P></p>

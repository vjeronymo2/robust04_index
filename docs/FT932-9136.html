			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / E Germans seen as pawns in strike THE struggle between employers and IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, was not a struggle for the hearts, the minds, or even the economic interests of eastern Germans. Instead, until the early hours of yesterday morning, both sides were using eastern Germany as a means of fulfilling their own goals. IG Metall successfully balloted, and called a strike for two reasons. The first was a point of principle. It wanted the employers to reinstate a contract signed with the union in March 1991 which would have equalised western and eastern German wage levels by next year. Both sides agreed on the contract, but for different reasons. Western employers - not wholly united on this - believed high wages would stifle eastern German competitiveness. The union wanted the contract to maintain high wage levels in the west. In the run-up to the strike, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president, believed Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, wanted to discard the contract as a first step towards ending the tradition of collective wage bargaining, first in eastern Germany and later in western Germany. Yesterday's agreement guards that principle, despite modifications. IG Metall was also determined to keep up the pressure in the belief if it did not 'win' in eastern Germany, then it could not use that victory to maintain high wage levels in western Germany. 'We are striking for that as well,' one union official admitted, adding: 'The strike in eastern Germany is a solidarity strike for today's unemployed, and for those of tomorrow because we will have won for them higher unemployment benefits'. The employers were just as determined to prolong the strike. They too were fighting for a principle, articulated by the Mittelstand - the small and medium-sized enterprises in Gesamtmetall - rather than the big corporations. The strike might never have started had the giant corporations such as Siemens, AEG, and Volkswagen felt they had something to lose in a prolonged dispute. 'We were not worried about the strike,' a Siemens official said. 'Our turnover in eastern Germany is less than 2 per cent of our total turnover. We can afford the pay rises.' But for the Mittelstand, the strike provided an opportunity to break away from collective wage bargaining, and negotiate individual plant contracts which they could afford. They had a point. They started investing in eastern Germany in 1990 and 1991 when markets still existed in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. But the collapse of these markets and the recession in western Germany weakened their prospects. They genuinely could not afford wage increases of more than 20 per cent this year as productivity continued to lag behind western German levels by at least 65 per cent, and labour costs were 70 per cent above western German levels. The Mittelstand has won a partial victory. Income parity has been postponed: it will now be introduced by, at latest, mid-1996. Wage increases will be lower than expected. IG Metall has managed to maintain the principle of collective wage bargaining, albeit with more flexibility. As for the eastern Germans, IG Metall has proved it can organise a strike in the region. But the five new states have simply been pawns in a power game played by the unions and the employers.</p>

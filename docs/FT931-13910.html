			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Shopkeepers' euphoria goes out of the window: Why the Christmas retail figures came as a surprise THE euphoria that surrounded retailers at new year, amid reports of the busiest start to January sales for years, evaporated abruptly this week. On Tuesday the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey showed that many retailers had a disappointing Christmas, with sales reported to have fallen on a year-on-year basis for three successive months. In December, the balance between retailers reporting an increase in sales and those reporting a decrease was minus 4, compared with plus 5 the year before. Yesterday, government figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that high street spending in December fell 0.7 per cent - in contrast to the 0.5 per cent rise many analysts had expected. Retailers are notoriously wary about revealing details of their Christmas and new year performance. But the generally upbeat tone of those who have commented - and widespread reports of a last-minute spending surge before Christmas and a promising start to the January sales - mean the official figures have come as a blow to the government and to the sector. Among the stores, Marks and Spencer said its full-price sales figures were higher than the year before although the increase was not in double figures. Sales were particularly strong in the three weeks to January 2, and the company had been left with considerably less stock to be marked down for the post-Christmas sales than in the previous year. Mr Stuart Hampson, who takes over next month as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said yesterday that Christmas spending had come late, but had eventually been slightly above expectations. The encouraging start to January had continued, with noticeable growth in the household goods sector. The Storehouse group, which includes BhS and Mothercare, was similarly positive, saying it had experienced sales growth consistent with the trend of year-on-year increases - averaging about 8 per cent - which it has shown in the past 15 months. Elsewhere the news was more patchy. Ratners, the jewellery chain, said sales were down 27 per cent in December although operating profits were up 20 per cent, reflecting a switch away from the strategy of heavy price-cutting the previous year and towards increasing margins. Body Shop surprised the City with the news that like-for-like sales, which do not include new shops or store closures, were down 8 per cent in the nine weeks to December 26. However, like-for-like sales for the three weeks to January 2 were up 4 per cent, reflecting the late Christmas surge. Big food retailers are generally thought to have had a good Christmas. Tesco announced like-for-like sales growth of 1.5 per cent and total sales growth, including new stores, of 9.5 per cent for the four weeks to January 2, prompting some analysts to increase their profit forecasts. J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, is said to have seen like-for-like growth of between 4 and 5 per cent over the same period; Argyll, owner of Safeway, 3 per cent; and Wm Morrison 6.5 per cent. What conclusions can be drawn? The discrepancy between the statements of the bigger retailers and the government's figures seems to reflect a factor noted in the CBI survey - that big retailers performed well while small retailers, employing fewer than 200 people, did badly. Moreover, there is little doubt that retailers did enjoy a few very good days - notably in the week before Christmas and the first few days of the sales. But while these grabbed the headlines, they could not fully compensate for an otherwise flat Christmas period. Many industry observers pointed out that the overall pattern of spending was similar to that in 1987, the last time Christmas fell on a Friday. 'Economically, you couldn't find two more diverse years, but the pattern of trading was very similar,' said Marks and Spencer. The pattern of spending may be evidence of something else. Many retailers share the view of Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, who believes UK consumers are increasingly sophisticated and more apt to postpone their shopping until they can get the best prices. Most retailers agree there is little sign of a consumer-led upturn, and little prospect of one until the housing and employment markets recover. 'People do have more money in their pockets, but the feeling is, I'm OK now but I might not be in a few months,' commented one retail executive. Many retailers also warn they can no longer absorb the rising costs of imports since sterling's devaluation in September and these are bound to start being reflected in retail prices. This, in turn, could delay any return in consumer confidence.</p>

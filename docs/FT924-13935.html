			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Lamont tries to clarify 'TRUST US,' is what, in effect, the chancellor told the Treasury and Civil Select Committee yesterday. Trust us to bear down on inflation. Trust us to read the signs given by the monetary indicators. Trust us to exercise judgment wisely. But no British government can be trusted with the exercise of such complete discretion. The chancellor of the exchequer has ruled out return to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) until several conditions are met, the most important being that 'the requirements of German monetary policy and those of the UK must come closer into line'. Official German interest rates may soon fall further. British monetary policy has already eased. The chancellor could soon decide that the 'requirements of German monetary policy and those of the UK' are closer in line. Would he be right to do so? Probably not, with equal emphasis on the 'probably' and the 'not'. ERM membership has not provided the best possible monetary regime for the UK. But it might well be better than the policy that the government will actually pursue. Nothing in Mr Lamont's discussion stilled worries on this score. Mr Lamont stressed that monetary policy has to be judgmental. He is right. But the more judgmental the policy, the more necessary it is for the policymaking institutions to be both focused in their goals and open in their procedures. A chancellor of the exchequer working through the Treasury cannot meet these requirements. The addition of a target for inflation of 1-4 per cent hardly helps. It is worth remembering, after all, that the former chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson, whose policies ultimately led to inflation of more than 10 per cent, announced in 1986 that he intended to eliminate inflation in the next parliament. The gap between long-term interest rates on conventional and index-linked bonds - now some 5 1/2 percentage points - makes it clear that investors do not trust Mr Lamont's 4 per cent target, let alone the 2 per cent he has set as his longer-term aim. They must be right not to do so. So many targets - that for a balanced budget or, more recently, for zero inflation - have come and then gone. The government felt unable to raise interest rates in the summer to defend the ERM parity, even though the UK's inflation performance was still mediocre by European standards. Then, following the abrupt exit from the ERM, the chancellor cut interest rates as soon as he decently - or indecently - could. Above all, investors know that Mr Lamont is subject to fierce pressures to declare victory over inflation too soon. The only thing the government could plausibly do to increase its credibility is what it is apparently determined not to do: to tie its own hands. The government's determination to avoid making the formation of monetary policy more independent lowers its credibility, makes the cost of achieving low inflation higher and so, in turn, renders the target still less credible. Whatever the rhetoric about a new, more open approach to policymaking, the UK is back to secretive choices, under day-to-day political pressures, among multifarious indicators, in the pursuit of imprecise goals. Existing institutional arrangements will not deliver the credible policymaking that the UK needs. It is time to shift to the kind of arrangements that might.</p>

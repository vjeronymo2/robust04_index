			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A.Sl.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F> RZECZPOSPOLITA on Inflation, Wages, and Unemployment; Faith in  the Government Increases Along With Incomes"]    [Text] Only 20 percent of adult Poles believe in the  government's promises that inflation will be decreased to less  than 10 percent by 1997 and that the number of unemployed will  be limited to 2.7 million people. Slightly more--27  percent--believe that the real wages will be rising at the  announced rate of 1.5 to 2 percent a year. These are the  results of a poll carried out by the Public Opinion Research  Institute [PBS] in Sopot.    People with higher education more frequently than others  believe in the plans for decreasing unemployment and increasing  real wages (23.5 percent and 34 percent, respectively). However,  they are least convinced about the promises of limiting  inflation (17 percent). Generally, the research suggests that  various social, professional, and age groups have extremely  varied views regarding the wage increase and unemployment  limitation. Opinions concerning the lowering of inflation are  similar. It is also difficult to say that one group trusts the  government promises more than other groups do. Least skeptical  about the promise of decreasing inflation are people employed on  farms (25 percent believe in it), and about the promise of  limiting unemployment--the employees of private companies (25  percent believe in it). The promise concerning higher real wages  convinces the budget sphere the most (36 percent). The material  situation does not greatly influence opinions concerning  inflation. However, there is a certain pattern in the evaluation  of plans concerning an increase in wages: The trust increases  along with higher incomes. Among persons with less than 700,000  zlotys [Z] per capita, this trust amounts to only 21 percent;  among persons earning over Z3 million, to 42 percent. A similar  pattern can be observed in the evaluations of the forecasts  concerning unemployment: The optimism increases along with  incomes.    Most skeptical about an increase in real wages are peasants  (18 percent believe in it), and the group that believes in it  the most are managers--39 percent. Plans for limiting  unemployment seem feasible primarily to private entrepreneurs  (31 percent); housewives are most skeptical about it--only 13  percent believe in it. School and university students constitute  the group that believes in decreasing inflation the most--23  percent; housewives--14 percent. It is worth noting that each  time the greatest number of undecided people is among peasants  and farm employees--from 35 to 41 percent.    Is faith in the government's promises of a political nature?  This question can be answered after an analysis of the results  and the political sympathies of the respondents. The  government's promises concerning decreasing inflation is least  trusted by the supporters of the Confederation for an  Independent Poland, the former Liberal-Democratic Congress, and  the Center Accord (10 in each case). Those who trust those  promises the most are the voters of the Non-Party Bloc in  Support of Reforms (as many as 41 percent). For the sake of  comparison, among the supporters of the governing coalition--the  Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance--faith in  limiting inflation is 22 and 24 percent, respectively.  Supporters of the Union for Real Politics and of the Coalition  for the Republic are those who most strongly believe in plans  for limiting unemployment. Voters of the Labor Union believe in  this promise the least.    The research was conducted by PBS in Sopot on 14 and 15 May  on a 1,010-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of  Poland.    In line with the government's plans, in 1997 inflation is  supposed to drop below 10 percent. Do you believe that the  government will put its plan into effect?    60 percent--No, I do not.    18 percent--Yes, I do.    22 percent--It is hard to tell.    The government claims that real wages will increase by 1.5  to  2.5 percent a year in the coming years. Do you believe that the  government will put its plans into effect?    People with not more than Z700,000 per capita: Yes--21  percent.    People with Z701,000-1 million per capita: Yes--23 percent.    People with Z1 million-1.5 million per capita: Yes--24  percent.    People with Z1.6 million-2 million per capita: Yes--31  percent.    People with Z2 million-3 million per capita: Yes--27  percent.    People with over Z3 million per capita: Yes--42 percent.</p>

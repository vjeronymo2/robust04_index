			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov: "The President Has Come to the </F> Defense of Hired Labor. The Authorities Are Working on the  Timely Payment of Wages"]    [Text] For the first time, the state has proclaimed  its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the payment  of wages at all enterprises, including private. This was done  through Boris Yeltsin's edict "On Penalties for Violations of  the Labor Rights of Citizens," of which the official  distribution began yesterday. However, the real significance of  the edict is political rather than economic.    The main thrust of the edict is quite simple: The president  instructs the procuracy to step up the oversight of compliance  with the legislation of the Russian Federation on labor and  collective contracts and agreements by enterprises, offices, and  organizations regardless of the form of ownership and  departmental affiliation, "paying special attention to the  prevention of instances of delays in the payment of wages."  Therefore, the state has officially proclaimed for the first  time its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the  payment of wages at enterprises with all forms of ownership.    Technically, such steps by the authorities may have certain  significance for entrepreneurs. Since the right of the employees  to receive wages at the times specified in advance is mainly set  forth in collective contracts, employers at both state and  private enterprises may be accused of violating these contracts  in the event that the payments are delayed. Pursuant to the law  "On Collective Contracts and Agreements," which was passed in  March 1992, individuals representing the employer who are guilty  of violating and failing to honor obligations under collective  contracts shall be liable to fines in an amount of up to 100  times the size of the minimum wage assessed by courts. However,  no actual stricter control by the authorities should be expected  in this sphere, given the traditional high case loads of the  Russian procuracy and courts, as well as the purely technical  difficulties involved in the continuous monitoring of a large  number of enterprises. Nonetheless, in individual cases  enterprises may, of course, run into problems. For example, a  technical delay in financing for many city enterprises may occur  in conjunction with the redistribution of the budgetary accounts  of the city among authorized banks by a recent decree of the  government of Moscow. In view of friction between the federal  authorities and those of Moscow, this may very well be used as a  pretext to accuse these enterprises of delaying the payment of  wages.    Under the specific Russian conditions, the significance of  the edict on the whole is political rather than economic. In  this manner, the authorities have simply pointed up yet again  their intention to win the broadest possible support from the  population, having selected the problem of delays in the payment  of wages precisely because it is virtually the easiest to  understand for Russian citizens from among all other economic  problems. It is quite safe to say that the new edict is one of  the steps calculated to make popular a new slogan of the  authorities--the idea of reinforcing the statehood of Russia: A  quite significant proportion of the population still views the  state primarily as the direct or indirect employer and guarantor  of incomes. This is not the least important reason why the  government has demonstratively dissociated itself from the  practice of delaying the payment of wages to the employees of  units financed from the budget as a peculiar method of financial  stabilization. It is noteworthy that precisely on the eve of the  signing of the edict, the presidium of the government ultimately  approved a draft of the programmatic decree "On the Standing of  the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 1994."  The decision to fully pay the debt of the budget to enterprises  in the sphere financed from the budget in March 1994 is one of  the focal points of the decree. This is quite a serious step,  given that according to some estimates, such debt comes to 1.9  trillion rubles, and may only be eliminated within a short  period of time through additional emission.

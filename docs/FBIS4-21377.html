			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vlad Ignatov report under the "Ecology" rubric: "Russia </F> Produces 10 Percent of World Pollutants"]    [Text] The work of an All-Russia Conference of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources with the participation of deputy heads of  administrations of federation components and heads of  territorial nature protection bodies is winding up today at  Parliament Center. For two days, some 400 participants have  been taking stock of the work done in 1993 and discussing their  goals for the current year.    The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources faces a great deal of work. According to its head,  Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in many respects -- the discharge into  the atmosphere of ozone-destroying substances and sulfur  dioxide, the generation of radioactive waste -- Russia, on whose  territory live only 2.5 percent of the earth's population,  accounts today for a tenth of the world's amount of pollutants.    It was pointed out at the conference that the uncertainty of  the nature watchdogs' status sometimes led to confrontations  with representatives of the other agencies in resolving  ecological issues. This problem has been partially eliminated  by the Russian Federation Government decree "On Specially  Authorized State Organs in the Area of Environmental  Protection." Currently a new decree is in the works whose draft  gives Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources  staffers broader rights, up to the use of punitive sanctions.  There is still no unanimity, however, on the role of  territorial nature protection structures. According to a  departmental poll conducted by the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources, nearly 30 percent of  territorial nature protection bodies see their functions in  being only coordinators, 24 percent see themselves as  coordinators and inspectors, while the majority -- 47 percent --  are prepared to become the only special nature-protection  management bodies.</p>

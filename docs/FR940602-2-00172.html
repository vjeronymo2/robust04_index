Follow these procedures in determining the base (beginning) fee and subsequent fees under a 20-year cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. As the initial base, use the fees established in one of the years between 1978 and 1982. The first year of the fee cycle is the first year of the established fee (disregarding any phase-in that may have been provided). Adjust the full base fee forward by applying the appropriate cumulative Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD&hyph;GNP) adjustment factor shown in exhibit 01. New fees for 1989, established in this manner, will be phased-in over a 4-year period (1989&hyph;1992) at the rate of one-fourth of the increase each year, except that fees will not be phased-in for those permits that limit fee adjustments to 5-year intervals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those cases where there may not be a fee established for the 1978&hyph;1982 period, Regional Foresters are authorized, subject to concurrence of the Chief, to utilize a different starting date and to adjust the length of the fee cycle so that all permits will have a new base fee determined during the 1998&hyph;2002 period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. For 1990 through the last year of the fee cycle, adjust the fees on an annual basis by calculating the percentage change of the IPD&hyph;GNP index (as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, in July of each year) from the second quarter of the previous year to the second quarter of the current year and applying this percentage adjustment factor to the current year's fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For term permits that restrict adjustments to 5-year intervals, apply the IPD index adjustments cumulatively at 5-year intervals. At the end of the current 20-year term, or earlier if agreed to by the holder, revise permits to provide for annual indexing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Limit the annual fee adjustment for 1990 and thereafter to 10 percent per year when the change in the IPD&hyph;GNP index exceeds 10 percent in any one year. The index amount in excess of 10 percent will be carried over and applied to the fee for the next succeeding year in which the index factor is less than 10 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If a new permit is to be issued (FSM 2721.23a), re-appraise the lot toward the end of the 20-year cycle. Beginning in the twenty-first year (the first year of the next fee cycle; 1998 in the case of 1978 fees), put into effect the base fee for the next 20-year cycle by applying 5 percent to the newly determined appraised market value of the lot for recreation residence purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In those few cases where one or more additional sleeping structures (guest cabins, and so forth) have been added to a single lot, add to the current adjusted base fee an additional charge equal to 25 percent of the fee established for a single residence use of the lot or $100, whichever is greater, per structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

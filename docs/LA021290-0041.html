			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 FELONS, INCLUDING 3 KILLERS, CUT BARS TO FLEE ILLINOIS PRISON; 1 CAUGHT  </P> <P> Six convicts, including three murderers, escaped from the maximum-security  Joliet Correctional Center early Sunday, apparently by cutting through metal  bars, state police said. One was captured later in the day.  </P> <P> The escapees, most in their 20s and all in segregation cells as disciplinary  problems, were considered extremely dangerous, authorities said.  </P> <P> Tommy Munoz was captured shortly after 5:30 p.m. at a cousin's Chicago home by  officers who had staked it out, state Department of Corrections spokesman Nic  Howell said. Munoz, 22, was serving a sentence for narcotics violations and  intimidation.  </P> <P> A search with dogs and an airplane was called off because the escapees  apparently split up, state police trooper Thomas Miller said.  </P> <P> The prisoners escaped from the segregation cells, authorities said. Four of the  inmates were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone.  </P> <P> Reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course of the day. State  police originally reported the men were discovered missing at 4:55 a.m., but  Howell said later that the discovery was made after a 7 a.m. inmate count came  up short.  </P> <P> About 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with escapes assisted  state police and local law enforcement officers in the search.  </P> <P> The inmates had to cut through bars on the cells, break a window, cut through  bars outside the window and cross a fence to get away, Howell said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, this is a breach of security," he said. "They shouldn't have had  the materials to be able to cut with and should not have been able to cut like  this without being noticed."  </P> <P> The prison, which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent years, is one of  the state's four maximum-security facilities and one of two in Joliet.  </P></p>

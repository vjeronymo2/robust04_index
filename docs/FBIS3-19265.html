			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by J.-M. Helvig: "Blows and Costs"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Minister of Defense] Francois Leotard just lost  the chance of being Jacques Chirac's minister of defense  someday, and he has every reason to congratulate himself. First,  because the feverish interest in military issues demonstrated by  the Rally for the Republic's (RPR) natural candidate would make  the job very sensitive under his tutelage. Secondly, his  fixation on resuming nuclear testing augurs poorly for his  diplomatic discernment. The Leotard side offered itself the  pleasure of noting it for future reference, under guise of  ironic advice to the aspiring president of the republic: when  one occupies this job, it is better to remember that France does  not live alone in this world, unless one wishes to put one's  government (and eventually one's country) in an untenable  situation. In other words, if the Americans and the Russians  persist in abolishing nuclear testing, it is not in the best  political interest to oppose such praiseworthy intentions by  insisting on resuming ours, of whose urgent usefulness,  moreover, not all experts are equally convinced. However, the  present priority of the RPR leader is of course more prosaic. It  is less important to publicize one's own defense project than to  show that the prime minister lacks one because of cohabitational  collusion. [passage omitted]</p>

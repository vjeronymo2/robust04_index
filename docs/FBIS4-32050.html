			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Lech Walesa by an </F> unidentified correspondent at the Gdansk polling station on 19  June--recorded]    [Text] Polling stations opened at 0800 hours: 27.5 million  Poles eligible to vote will elect 52,000 councillors for 2,500  parish councils. President Lech Walesa and his family voted in  Gdansk at 1215.    [Correspondent] President Walesa arrived at the polling  station after attending Mass at the St. Stanislaw Kostka Church  in Gdansk-Oliwa. His wife and daughter accompanied him to the  district polling station.    President, how do you assess the work of local government in  the previous term in office?    [Walesa] I think that in these conditions and after such a  long time of being deprived of democratic liberties, local  government has really achieved a lot. A lot, but the needs were  even greater.    [Correspondent] What do you expect from councillors who will  be elected for the coming term?    [Walesa] I hope they will learn from the experience of their  predecessors and that they will concentrate even more on the  most important issues to meet the demands of small communities,  that they will resolve problems important to specific regions.    [Correspondent] President, do you not think that a possible  victory of the Polish Peasant Party may halt the political  reform and decentralization of the state?    [Walesa] This is unlikely and is not possible because the  circumstances are different. That is the first reason. The  second reason is that the system operates itself now.  Politicians are not in the position to do much harm. They can  make it difficult but not sufficiently difficult to destroy what  has already been started.    [Announcer] Correspondents from all over the country report  that the elections are taking place peacefully. Interest has  not been great so far. On average, there are eight candidates  for one seat in multiseat constituencies, and three candidates  in single-seat constituencies. In Chelm and Elblag Provinces,  Senate by-elections are also being held.</p>

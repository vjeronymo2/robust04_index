			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] The negotiators at the peace talks here in Lusaka  woke up very early today. No one was on bed by 0600. There was  intense movement at mediator Alioune Blondin Beye's hotel room.  First, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the  government negotiating team, which included General Kopelipa,  special envoy of President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos  Santos. Gen. Kopelipa arrived here in Lusaka last evening.    Then, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the  negotiating team of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA]. No one knows what was discussed  during these meetings.    Then the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA  went  to the conference hall to discuss alone the document on swearing  in UNITA members of parliament. The government presented UNITA  a new document containing all guarantees. UNITA says it wants  to study the document. All that is known is that the parties  are near to reaching an agreement.    Meanwhile, yesterday, UNITA made an official statement  saying  that it accepts the government offer on its participation in  different levels of government. The government agrees that it  received UNITA's document, but the only thing is that it was  astonished when it opened the envelope. UNITA says it accepts  but it has changed all the government's proposals at the level  of district governments. It wants to legally possess the  districts it occupied illegally. It wants Soyo and Canfunfo.  The government says there is time for jokes. Its offer is not  negotiable. Either UNITA should say yes to the government offer  without amendments or it says no.</p>

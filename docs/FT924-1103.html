			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gold continues to lose its allure . . .  - At a Glance GOLD'S PRICE seems almost certain to end the year close to its lowest level for five years because speculators in Europe, Japan and North America have almost completely lost interest in it. The precious metal is also locked into a very narrow trading range, with record demand from the jewellery industry this year being offset by producers hedging and selling forward any time the price attempts a significant break upwards. Another factor holding down the price in 1992 is central bank selling. Central banks have huge stocks of gold which earn practically nothing and they now seem more willing to let some go into the market. Analysts suggest this phenomenon will weigh heavily on the price for some time to come.</p>

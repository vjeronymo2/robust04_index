			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Books: Movie mogul fetishes THALBERG: THE LAST TYCOON AND THE WORLD OF MGM by Roland Flamini Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 302 pages WALT DISNEY: HOLLYWOOD'S DARK PRINCE by Marc Eliot Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 296 pages Was Walt Disney the illegitimate son of a Spanish washerwoman? Did Irving Thalberg, MGM's boy-wonder mogul, enjoy evenings of cross-dressing with actress wife Norma Shearer? Did Walt himself dress up in his mother's clothes (assuming she was his mother) during his strange, tortured childhood? Film biographies are a law unto themselves. Studio chieftains may be boring administrators with one eye on the balance sheet, the other on getting home for dinner: but not if their portraitists in print can help it. Here, in two movie monographs, are two of the season's likeliest controversy-stirrers. Or rather one stirrer and one gentler probe - Roland Flamini's Thalberg - with a few gossipy grace-notes. Irving Thalberg was the model for F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'last tycoon' and the most meteoric figure in movie management history. A top Universal executive at 20, he was running MGM, with a little help from LB Mayer, at age 23. Frail of health, he was small and thin but handsome-featured, with a faint resemblance to Fitzgerald himself. The novelist worked for Thalberg during a brief galley-slave interlude in Hollywood and obviously saw a mirror image in this tragic showman who would die young (37), after a life spent trying to beat some quality into that vulgar beast called cinema. But how much do we prize that 'quality' today? When we look at Thalberg's movies - The Barretts Of Wimpole Street, Romeo And Juliet, Marie Antoinette  -we seem to be talking more about Quality Street: a confectioner's parade of literature-based period goodies, in which brave men and noble women (usually played by his wife) stand up and accost the camera with deathless prose. And when not turning MGM into a movie-world Madame Tussauds, Thalberg volunteered for critical execration when he pushed Erich Von Stroheim off the Mayer payroll. He famously sacked the actor-director for going over budget on his 1922 extravaganza Merry-Go-Round. Then later, when accident brought the Teuton back into Thalberg's orbit, the young executive sliced Erich's five-hour 'masterpiece' Greed - to posterity's horror - to 2 1/2  hours. But Flamini offers some counter-attacking facts. Thalberg pressed for many projects that the prudish Mayer thought too risque. He brought writers like Fitzgerald and Faulkner to Hollywood. And he persuaded Mayer - for which all else might be forgiven - to sign up the Marx Brothers. As for the private Thalberg, Flamini peers and guesses. He sees a gentle, undersexed man who escorted Norma through a married life of such amorous uneventfulness - apart from some sketchily-sourced garment-swapping - that after his death Norma went on a crazed promiscuity spree. But the book also suggests that Thalberg's repressed libido found expression in a liking for kinkier, more 'daring' movie projects than Mayer favoured. Thalberg approved the foot fetishism and other piquancies in Stroheim's films - it was the prolix director's 'footage fetishism' he lost patience with. And he encouraged Jean Harlow to bring some much-needed earthiness to MGM. Indeed if it had not been for Norma and her costume parades, the Thalberg filmography might be a lot more interesting and outre than it seems today. Can you name an illegitimate French-Hispanic American who became an FBI informant in the brief intervals between drinking to excess and indulging what we may call the Lady Macbeth Syndrome: obsessive hand-washing. He was also a union-basher, a childhood cross-dresser and an anti-semite. Yes, it is Walt Disney. And there is more. According to Marc Eliot's Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince, the creation of Donald, 'the sexually provocative, libidinous duck,' represented 'a full-scale merging of Disney's psychic lifeblood with his animated inkworld.' And what Eliot says about Snow White and the dwarves we will leave to your imagination. All this should be a surprise only to those not steeped in now-it-can-be-told biographies. We know that JM Barrie, AA Milne, Beatrix Potter and other children's artists were deeply sick people, who would probably have been serial killers if not tempted sideways by literature. So why not Walt? Some of Eliot's book is well-sourced, though not actually new. Much of it is wild speculation: especially the illegitimacy and the psychosexual movie interpretations. But perhaps we are none of us harmed by the occasional adventurist rip into the hygienic fabric of the Disney ethos.</p>

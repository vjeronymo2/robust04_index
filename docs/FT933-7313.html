			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / German politicians brace for a roller-coaster ride THE great beer tent at the fair on Hamburg's Heiligengeistfeld heaved and shuddered every few minutes as a roller-coaster thundered down its precipitous track only yards from the tent door. The roar hit the walls of the tent like the waves of a storm at sea. But inside, the capacity crowd was impervious to all distractions from the fun of the fair. They had come for a different and more exclusive experience. All attention was fixed on a sober-suited, dapper, white-haired gentleman, speaking from the platform under a giant portrait of a grinning ox. Here was a face and a voice from the past. Mr Helmut Schmidt, former West German chancellor, was back on the bandwagon for the first time in more than 10 years, throwing his political weight into an election campaign for his Social Democrats. He was on home ground, in his native city, back from self-imposed political exile. And they loved it. Mr Schmidt personifies an image that the SPD is desperate to recapture, only months before the marathon election year of 1994, with no fewer than 19 local, state, national and European polls: that it is a party 'capable of government'. It is a message they need to put across in Hamburg, too, in spite of having ruled the city council almost uninterruptedly since the war. For the SPD is in danger of losing its absolute majority in the city-state in an extraordinary election it is having to fight through no fault of its own. And all eyes will be on the poll result on September 19 to see clues for next year's big campaigns. Yet Mr Schmidt's message was grim enough. 'Above all, get out and vote,' he urged, 'for the very existence of our republic is at stake.' Voting for the SPD itself was only his secondary theme. His greatest concern is that too many will either stay away from the polls or cast a protest vote against the political establishment, for the extremes of left or right. 'Whoever dares to vote for a fringe party, to throw away his vote on a party of the far left or right, is making the same mistake many of our parents and grandparents made in 1931 and 1932, with terrible consequences,' he warned. 'For God's sake, don't give them a single vote, those people who have a sneaking sympathy for skinhead murder gangs. This coming election year will be the greatest test yet faced by our generation.' There is a real fear in Hamburg, in spite of prosperity, that protest voters and stay-at-homes will undermine all main political parties in the poll. For a start, the election is a bit of a nonsense. It has been ordered by the local constitutional court, half way through the life of the current city council, because the losers last time - Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union - were found undemocratic in the way they selected their party candidates. And yet it is the SPD that could lose most in the re-run. In 1991, the SPD won a wafer-thin absolute majority of one, with 48 per cent of the vote, against 35 per cent for the CDU. Opinion polls last week put the SPD on 42 per cent and the CDU down around 34 per cent, with a sharp increase in support for protest parties such as the Greens and far-right Republicans. 'The one certain thing is that the SPD will lose its absolute majority,' says Mr Wolf Brocke, election campaign agent for the CDU. 'There is also a real danger that a far-right party will gain some seats in the council.' So far, it looks as if the main beneficiaries of protest votes will be the Greens, whose support is up from 7.2 per cent to at least 10 per cent. But the Republicans are bumping just under the 5 per cent barrier which they must cross to get into the council, and another far-right party, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), is also pushing for support. Just to complicate the picture, there is a special party for the disaffected, the so-called Statt Partei - a play on words, meaning it stands 'instead of' the traditional parties - founded and led by Mr Markus Wegner, the 40-year-old publisher and former CDU member who brought the court case challenging the last elections. The polls suggest he will only pick up 2 per cent but nobody really trusts the polls - most are just phone surveys. Mr Ernst-Ullrich Bottcher, a clerical worker in a Bremen trading house who heads the Republicans' list of candidates, is confident he will be sitting in the council chamber next month, with between 6 and 8 per cent of the vote  -in spite of a very low profile on the city streets. Few voters know his name and few have seen his posters, but the fear of the majority parties is an effective advertisement. Just as the SPD is desperate to prove itself capable of government, the Republicans are desperate to prove themselves 'house-trained' - capable of being civilised members of a democratic society. Mr Bottcher bends over backwards to deny any hint of xenophobia in his campaign. 'I was born in 1948, and no one can accuse me of being a Nazi or a neo-Nazi,' he says. 'I have four nephews and nieces who are Egyptians, and four who are Italian.' There is a chance the right-wing vote will split between the Republicans and the DVU, leaving neither with the necessary 5 per cent. Indeed, if that happens and the Free Democratic party also fails to cross the 5 per cent barrier, the SPD could hang on to power with a vote of around 44 per cent. But no one really believes it. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary leader of the SPD in Bonn and another son of Hamburg, knows the eyes of the world are on the rise of the right. 'Six or eight per cent would be too much,' he says. 'It might be all right in France or Italy. It certainly is not in Germany.' That is Mr Schmidt's message, too. And that seems to be why he has decided to come back to the political platform and call for a steady hand. 'Anyone in Hamburg who votes for the far left or the far right will endanger the republic itself, and the outward-looking tradition of our state,' he said. 'Hamburg is a European metropolis. Our international reputation is at stake.'</p>

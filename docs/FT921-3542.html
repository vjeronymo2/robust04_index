			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Tories fight off assault over tax THE government secured a majority of 145 in the Commons last night to defeat an attempt by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs to block the introduction of a 20p lower rate income tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, closed the two-day debate on the Budget with a confident assurance that a Conservative election victory would not result in any reversal of policy. To cheers from the government benches he insisted: 'Our tax cuts are sustainable - they are going to last and they are the ones which can be afforded.' The challenge to the 20p lower rate income tax band was defeated by 351 votes to 206. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, was among the chancellor's former cabinet colleagues who cheered the outcome. In an earlier vote on a key Budget resolution the government secured a majority of 143 (351-209). Mr Lamont underlined the welcome given to the Budget by the CBI and other business organisations. He described it as a Budget for 'sustained recovery and prosperity' which would enable the British people to do as well in the 1990s as they did in the 1980s. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, won sustained cheers from the Labour benches when he attacked the chancellor's failure to take any action to curb the growth in unemployment. He said: 'If there is no stop to rising unemployment there is no start to economic confidence, and if there is no beginning to economic confidence there is no end to recession.' Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, claimed the Budget would set the Conservatives on course for a fourth successive election victory as well as speeding the end of the recession. 'It's a Budget that will increase incentives, encourage enterprise and help employment to grow,' he said. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, branded the measures a 'last ditch Budget' from a beleaguered government incapable of ensuring recovery for the British economy. Mr Brown clashed repeatedly with Mr Lamont and Mr Howard during aggressive electioneering speeches. Mr Howard angered the opposition benches by citing the views of Mr Eric Hammond, former leader of the electricians' union, in support of the government's condemnation of Labour's proposal for a statutory minimum wage. The minister said Mr Hammond had told Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that a statutory minimum wage 'simply won't work'. Mr Bob Cryer (Lab Bradford South) shouted: 'Hammond is a Tory'. Mr Howard contended that if a statutory minimum wage led to the restoration of existing pay differentials 'up to 2m jobs would be destroyed'. Challenged by Mr Jim Wallace for the Liberal Democrats to explain how the Budget would enable the unemployed to secure work, the minister forecast that 'over a period of time' job creation in the 1990s would be on a similar scale to that achieved in the 1980s.</p>

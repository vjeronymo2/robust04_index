			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan and China formally  sealed a deal Tuesday [7 June] under which Beijing will provide  a couple of young Japanese crested ibises for a breeding program  which hopes to preserve the nearly extinct species in Japan.    Chinese Forestry Minister Xu Youfang, who arrived in Japan  on  Monday, and Japan's Environment Agency chief Toshiko Hamayotsu  signed an agreement covering a three-year lending period for the  rare white birds following talks in the afternoon.    The last two Japanese crested ibises remaining in Japan,  27-year-old Kin and about 20-year-old Midori, are considered too  old to reproduce -- in human terms they would be over 80 years  old.    China will send the ibis couple in late September to their  new home at the newly built Sado Ibis Preservation Center in  Niiho, Niigata Prefecture, which since last autumn has also been  the home of Kin and Midori, hoping to see the first chicks hatch  next spring at the earliest.    Transport during the breeding period from February to June  and during the hot summer season could harm the birds, which are  said to be very sensitive to changes in their habitat.    During their first month in Japan, the birds will be looked  after by four Chinese experts including two feeding specialists,  who will also train staff at the center in the latest breeding  methods.    China is the only other country in the world where the  Japanese crested ibis survives. Following the hatching of an  artificially incubated ibis egg in a Chinese zoo in 1992, a  world premier, China succeeded in incubating 12 chicks, bringing  the total ibis population to around 50.    Ibises usually breed in March or April laying two to four  eggs. Under the agreement, China will get the first hatchling,  while Japan may retain every second ibis chick being born  through the breeding program.    It will be the first time China has loaned a pair of ibises  to another country. The ibises have not been selected yet, but  will most likely be inexperienced in reproduction matters  because so far none of China's ibis couples has had offspring  naturally.    The ibis project took shape when former Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his official visit to China  in March, asked his Chinese counterpart Li Peng for help in the  preservation of the rare bird.    Four breeding attempts by Kin or Midori and a Japanese  crested ibis from China have failed over the last decade.    However, Japanese experts plan to preserve the genes of Kin  and Midori after their death in a bid to reproduce the birds  through the use of biotechnology in the future.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A CRUEL TALE IN 'RAT CATCHER'  </P> <P> The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Contemporary Documentary Series  continues at UCLA Melnitz tonight at 8 with Andrzej Czarnecki's 22-minute "The  Rat Catcher" (1986) and Frank Heiman's 55-minute "Paradise Camp" (1986).  </P> <P> The first is a creepy stunner, a close-up, deadpan look at Poland's only  industrial rat exterminator at work, an ordinary-looking, heavy-set middle-aged  man who takes justifiable pride in his work, which involves getting his prey to  trust him. No doubt this man is invaluable, but Czarnecki disturbingly  confronts us with the repelling yet clearly seductive and gratifying aspect of  his work as a mass killer.  </P> <P> Since "The Rat Catcher" so easily functions as parable, it's tasteless to have  paired it with a film in which humans, not rats, are the victims. "Paradise  Camp" is the usual mix of interviews with Holocaust survivors and archival  materials, but there's a difference. The camp in question is Theresienstadt, a  quaint walled city in Czechoslovakia, which, in cruelly deceiving propaganda --  including even a faked documentary -- the Nazis passed off to the Swiss Red  Cross as a paradise for Jews and typical of all concentration camps; survivors  attest to the fact that it too was a hell on Earth.  </P> <P> The New Beverly Cinema is presenting on Wednesday and Thursday (with the recent  and exquisite "Sorceress") a rare revival of Robert Bresson's "The Trial of  Joan of Arc," a terse, 65-minute, documentary-style courtroom drama in which  the heroine's speeches come verbatim from historic transcripts and which  derives its impact from Bresson's dry detachment. Florence Carrez is the  resilient Joan, who may weep in private, but who answers her inquisitors with  an almost monotonous matter-of-factness.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 938-4038.

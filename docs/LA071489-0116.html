			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> REFRAINS OF FAMILY SKIRMISHES HEARD IN 'SONGS OF WAR'  </P> <P> The title of Murray Schisgal's new play, "The Songs of War" (at the indoor Gem  Theatre of the Grove Shakespeare Festival), appears to have two meanings.  </P> <P> It refers to the patriotic ditties and other American pop tunes from the eras  of the two World Wars, heard throughout the show. But it also refers to the  relentlessly argumentative refrains that were the skirmishes in the war between  Saul and Bertha Sakowitz, the unhappily married parents of our narrator, Calvin  Saks.  </P> <P> Yes, this is another Jewish-family-gone-sour play. Although the songs signal a  nostalgic look back at the era of the narrator's youth, the nostalgia seems  fraudulent. Schisgal doesn't show us a single moment when these people were  functioning as a happy family.  </P> <P> The result is a muddle. Schisgal is working at cross purposes with himself.  </P> <P> The trouble begins with the role of the narrator. Calvin tells us about his  teen years from the perspective of himself at 60. Perhaps Schisgal wanted to  avoid charges of imitating Neil Simon, whose trilogy about his own youth in a  similar time and place ("Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues," "Broadway  Bound") was told from the perspective of a young man who had recently lived  through the events he describes.  </P> <P> There is no other reason to present Calvin at such an advanced age, and there  is a big reason not to do so. Calvin's obsessive search to discover which  parent was more responsible for his unhappy youth is something you would expect  from a relatively young man. By the age of 60, most people have come to terms  with such issues -- especially when, as in Calvin's case, the answer is so  obvious: Both parents were responsible, and so was the culture in which they  were raised. Next subject, please. It's petty for a 60-year-old to devote a lot  of time to agonizing over which parent he can blame most intensely for his  troubles.  </P> <P> But Schisgal compounds this basic miscalculation by making it almost impossible  for us to see the kid within this 60-year-old. Calvin is dressed in white tie  and tails. While this makes him look dapper during the show's musical  interludes, it makes him look ridiculous when he plays the kitchen-sink scenes  from his youth.  </P> <P> The selection of Steeve Arlen to play Calvin makes matters even worse. Arlen  was born in Wales, and he sounds like it. Picture a 60-year-old man with a  Welsh accent, wearing white tie, playing a 16-year-old kid from Brooklyn. It's  bizarre.  </P> <P> Perhaps Schisgal was going for a light absurdist effect. There are occasional  snatches of dialogue -- when the parents' bickering breaks into a battle of  nursery rhymes, for example -- that would also indicate this. But this use of  stylization is inconsistent and feels arbitrary.  </P> <P> The same can be said for the songs themselves, the likes of "K-K-K-Katy,"  "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," "Der Fuhrer's Face," "Remember Pearl Harbor,"  and a few from the World War I era (Calvin's father was a veteran of the Great  War).  </P> <P> Occasionally they serve the story, as when Calvin's embittered mother  (full-throated Connie Danese), anxious about the possibility of an affair with  a neighbor, Roy, (Raymond Lynch), sings "My Buddy" straight from the heart at a  war rally. But more often the songs seem designed primarily to give the actors  a chance to sing and dance.  </P> <P> Of course, they also set the mood for the period, but two or three of them  could have done that, while there are a dozen or so in the show. Maybe the  sunny optimism of the era, as heard in its music, is supposed to be in ironic  contrast to the domestic squabbles between Saul and Bertha. But without more  diligent work connecting the story to the songs, the irony dissipates.  </P> <P> Furthermore, this couple's marital problems transcend the period. These two  would have been at each other's throats in any era (and indeed, we get glimpses  of them still at odds in their old age).  </P> <P> Except for Arlen, director Jerome Guardino's cast is at home in these somewhat  stereotyped roles. Paul Keith plays the tormented Saul with a hangdog look that  is transformed when he remembers his single days in Paris, and Juliet Landau is  winsome as Calvin's frail but plucky sister.  </P> <P> Hale Porter plays Calvin's Zada (grandfather), chilly and remote. We're told  that Zada killed pigeons and served them as appetizers at a wedding. We  half-believe it.  </P> <P> The set design, by Christa Bartels, is meant to evoke a rehearsal room rather  than a real Brooklyn household. Schisgal obviously wants to tell his story  outside the boundaries of realism. But he hasn't figured out how to do it yet.  </P> <P>  At 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, Wednesdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., ending  Aug. 5. Tickets: $10-$20; (714) 636-7213.  </P> <P> </P></p>

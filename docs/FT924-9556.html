			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Consortium extends ITN offer THE OFFER for 80 per cent of Independent Television News has been extended to November 18 after yesterday's deadline passed without agreement. The consortium of four companies - Carlton Communications, Central, London Weekend and Reuters - agreed to the extension after what they described as 'positive and constructive' discussions with representatives of existing ITN shareholders. The consortium has agreed to buy the 322,596 Pounds 1 ITN shares not already owned by its members at par and inject up to Pounds 30m, mainly to cover a projected deficit of Pounds 25m over five years on the lease of ITN's London headquarters. The proposal terms have not yet been changed. But the fact that the deadline extension is designed to 'allow possible amendments to the offer to be explored further' is a sign they might be. The talks will focus on two areas - the price of the shares and percentage of the news organisation to be held by non-consortium members. The price of Pounds 1 will not be acceptable to ITN shareholders who do not want to stay in. The 20 per cent available to non-consortium members is too small to accomodate shareholders who want to stay in. Thames, Granada, and probably Yorkshire want to remain shareholders and are unlikely to accept less than 10 per cent each. Unless there is movement on price and size of the available stake it seems likely that the offer will fail. ITN's articles of association will have to be changed to enable such a deal to happen. That would need a 75 per cent majority.</p>

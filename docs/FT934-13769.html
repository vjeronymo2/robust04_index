			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Gilts rally on auction gap THE BANK of England's announcement yesterday that there would be no gilt auction in November triggered a sharp rally in the government bond market, as dealers speculated that October's auction may be the last this year. The December long gilt future reached a new contract high of 114 13/16 , closing  1/32 lower but still up more than half a point on the day. The record size of the October auction, slated at Pounds 3.5bn, and the government's well advanced funding programme sparked some speculation that the Bank might also cancel the December auction. The Bank said that no gilt auction would be held next month because it would be too close to the Budget on on November 30. 'I can't help feeling the Budget was used rather as an excuse to cancel the auction,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with SG Warburg Securities. The Treasury is well ahead in its funding and market participants estimate that, including next week's auction, the Bank will have financed some Pounds 40bn of the projected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. Moreover, many analysts expect the PSBR to come in lower than forecast, at Pounds 45bn-47bn. If an auction is held in December - and the bank is keeping its options open  -it could be held earlier than the traditional last Wednesday of the month, which would be in the middle of the holiday season. 'They could easily hold an auction in the first half of the month,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst with UBS. But some traders said that the Bank might be reluctant to hold an auction mid-month, when market conditions can be volatile amid the regular raft of monthly data releases. But even if there were no more auctions until January, 'that doesn't stop them from selling taps in the meantime,' said Brian Plaistow, head of gilts trading at Nomura International. 'They could do as much funding through tap sales as if they were holding an auction,' said another dealer. If the Budget was well received by the gilts market, the Bank could make substantial tap sales with relative ease. This year's bull run in the gilts market has facilitated the funding of the UK's growing PSBR. The yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt has fallen sharply to 6.78 per cent from 8.15 per cent in January. The bonds to be sold at this month's auction will carry a 6 per cent coupon and mature on August 10 1999. Lex, Page 20 International Capital Markets, Page 29</p>

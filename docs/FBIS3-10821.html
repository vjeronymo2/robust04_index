Once again it has  demonstrated its democratic spirit. It showed the guerrillas at  the polls that it wants peace. Amid a climate of calm, it  elected the people who will make up the Senate and Chamber of  Representatives in the new Congress. As for the Liberal  primary, partial returns from the National Civil Registry Office  indicate Ernesto Samper Pizano won. He referred to his victory,  as follows:    [Begin Samper recording] I have received the message. I  interpret the triumph in the primary as a mandate for social  change. To achieve it, we must transform the Liberal Party so  that it will again be a faithful interpreter of Liberal ideals.  The party cannot continue to be a representative of old  policies, which citizens want to change. [end recording]    Although Samper's presidential candidacy must be ratified  and  confirmed by the Liberals' 18 March convention, it is taken for  granted he will receive his party's support.    For its part, the Conservative Party was pleased with the  progress achieved in the parliamentary elections, as was stated  by Conservative Party Director Cornelio Reyes.    [Begin Reyes recording] The exit poll results announced by  Caracol indicate the Conservatives are getting more than eight  Senate seats. It will have 10 new seats in the Chamber of  Representatives. [end recording]    Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate and leader of the  New  Democratic Force, described today's elections, as follows:    [Begin Pastrana recording] It is a triumph of democracy over  violence. I think this is very important, that the people went  out to vote, despite the fact--we say sadly--we did not get the  results we wanted. Abstentionism is still very high. I hope I  can convoke the Colombians, as I intend to do, so that on 8 May  we can defeat abstentionism in Colombia. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / NHS 'is little improved' by reforms National Health Service reforms have so far done little to improve quality of service or patient choice, one of the most extensive studies of the service concludes today. The study, by the King's Fund Institute healthcare think-tank, suggests that this may be the result of the massive scale of organisational change that the reforms generated. New systems that have been put in place, it concludes, offer the potential for real gains over the next few years. The reforms, based on dividing responsibility for purchasing healthcare from its provision within an internal market, came into effect in April 1991. Seven research projects were funded by the King's Fund, with the results published today by Professor Ray Robinson, director of the Institute of Health Policy Studies at Southampton University, and Professor Julian Le Grand, who lectures on health policy at the London School of Economics. Only GP fundholding is identified as having produced benefits, notably in improving the responsiveness of hospitals to GPs' views. The report acknowledges that there is anxiety about the possibility of fundholding GPs' patients getting preferential treatment, but says this might simply be a transitional problem. Forming NHS trusts to manage hospitals and other services offers the potential for greater efficiency through competition, says the report, although claims that trusts have led to greater efficiency are hard to substantiate. Patient involvement in the choice of hospital to which they are referred has always been low and, at least during the early years of the reforms, this does not appear to have changed. Services for elderly people have not improved in terms of choice, accessibility, communication or quality. Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, said changes to the structure of the health service were not yet fully in place. Much streamlining had yet to be achieved. Sir Duncan added that the report recognised the problem of a systematic evaluation of the reforms. Evaluating the NHS Reforms. BEBC, PO Box 1496, Poole, Dorset BH12 3YD.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emission permits must be prominently displayed at all times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in boats operating in the FIP area under this proposal. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will enforce this permit system through the inspection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits at boat ramps, marinas, and other access points, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through patrols of boating areas. EPA will have the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to inspect boat engines, permits, and any other required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation. Failure to display the proper daily or annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit, falsification of a permit or of any documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to get a permit, or failure to surrender documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or allow inspection of a boat or engine will be strictly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited and will be punishable by fines of up to $25,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 110(c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that the state could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take. As Section 209 of the CAA does not preempt states from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating the use of marine engines, EPA believes that it,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acting on California's behalf in the context of the FIP, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt this fee program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Measures for Nonroad SI Engines over 19 kW and CI Engines under 37 kW. The Agency will decide whether to propose and implement national control programs for emissions from heavy-duty SI nonroad engines greater than 19 kW and small CI nonroad engines under 37 kW by November 1996. These small CI engines are used in such types of equipment as generator units, pumps, air compressors, welders, and pressure washers. The heavy-duty SI engines are used in forklifts and a small percentage of farm tractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal does not contain provisions for controlling emissions from these engines except for certain SI engines over 37 kW. The Agency does not today have information sufficient to determine whether such engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be regulated in the context of section 213 (a)(3). The Agency solicits comments on the greatest degree of emissions reductions which may be achieved from these engines through the application of various technologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the costs of such technologies; the time period within which manufacturers could implement technologies; and the safety, noise, and energy implications of such technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Nonroad Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over 37kw. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is proposing an enhanced in-use compliance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonroad engines that is intended to apply to most of the larger nonroad engines, both compression ignition (CI) and spark ignition (SI). More specifically, it covers all nonroad engines at or above 37 kilowatt (kw)(50 horsepower (HP)) in size except for engines used in aircraft, locomotives, underground mining equipment, SI engines used in recreational marine engines and low speed CI (diesel) engines used in oceangoing ships. Most of these engine categories are dealt with in other portions of this FIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal is very similar to the program for new heavy-duty onhighway engines. The program will contain tighter NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for the FIP areas. It will also have an HC standard and evaporative free requirements to prevent a shift to engines operating on high volatility fuels, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline. Finally, a ``normal maintenance'' recall program and engine rebuild requirements will be applied. Readers should refer to the onhighway descriptions of these programs (contained in Sections A. and B. of Appendix I) as well as Appendix I, Section C., regarding nonroad, for more information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These nonroad engines are proposed to be regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of their significance to the FIP area emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventories. In 1990, emissions from nonroad engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituted 24 to 27 percent of the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the FIP area concerned. NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions of 40 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 70 percent are required for attainment of the ozone standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These reductions are well beyond those expected from the soon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be adopted Federal nonroad standards. EPA's data shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that without control beyond the national standard, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage contribution of these engines will increase by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> almost one-third in each FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards being proposed are the same as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for onhighway heavy-duty engines. Since the engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved are often derived from onhighway engine designs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies used for compliance in the onhighway sphere can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be applied here. These rules ensure that similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringency is applied across engine categories in the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the provisions for nonroad engines that are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed are similar to EPA's earlier proposed Federal nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. That program was proposed in May of 1993 (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28809, May 17, 1993), and when finalized will provide details  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding definitions, test procedures, general certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement protocols. The reader is referred to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal for further information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

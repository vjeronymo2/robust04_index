			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Fair view of Names' losses Sir, You continue to suggest (Survey of Lloyd's of London, March 30) that external Names will bear a significantly greater share of the 1989 underwriting account losses than vocational, or so-called 'insider' Names. A comparison of the performance of individual Names should be based on the bottom line result of each Name's overall premium limit rather than on a small selected sample of syndicates. That is, the result should relate to each Name's overall premium limit and syndicates should not be compared in isolation. On this basis, for the 1989 underwriting year we are responsible for accounting to 1,617 Names who have a combined capacity of Pounds 658m. At this juncture our forecasts show that average losses of our external Names are only 0.4 per cent worse than the estimated loss of working Names through this agency. This position was also reflected in the actual figures for the 1988 account. Statistics can be manipulated to emphasise a particular point, but it should be clear that the above is the only equitable measure of performance comparison.

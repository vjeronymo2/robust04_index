			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Finance chiefs agree to step up liaison on market innovation Finance ministers from 11 large industrial nations yesterday agreed to increase international co-operation in the gathering of information about innovative segments of the financial markets. The move follows recent turbulence on international bond markets. A communique issued after a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of 10 said they agreed on the need to improve knowledge about financial innovation and co-operate in gathering relevant statistics and assessing their implications for the global financial system. The statement did not specify the areas of G10 concern. But the communique was issued in response to an oral report by Mr Lamberto Dini, a senior Bank of Italy official and chairman of the G10 deputies, on such developments as the growth of derivatives trading and the actions of highly leveraged hedge funds. The G10, which in fact consists of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries plus Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, reviewed the recent turbulence and increase in yields on world bond markets and agreed that no systemic problems had emerged. It said the financial markets had functioned well, coping with an increased volume of transactions without creating tensions in payment or settlements systems. But these soothing words could not conceal disquiet about the sharp increases in bond yields. Although Sunday's G7 meeting recognised there were economic reasons for this year's rise in long-term interest rates, several ministers, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, have suggested that innovative financial practices have exacerbated market turbulence. A widely voiced opinion at both the G7 and G10 meetings was that the rise in long-term rates had been overdone. US concern about derivatives has mounted in recent days with disclosures that some leading US corporations have incurred losses from investing in such instruments. Last week Mr Eugene Ludwig, US Comptroller of the Currency, disclosed that his agency was investigating whether it should take further regulatory action over the use by chartered banks of 'exotic and complex derivatives instruments'. Yesterday's G10 communique noted that work to gain a better understanding of financial innovations was already underway in several groups. These include the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements and the Group of 30, a Washington think-tank. While pressure in the US is mounting for greater control over derivatives, the UK remains sceptical of such action because of the importance of financial innovation to the prosperity of the City of London. After the G7 meeting, Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor, said UK banks had controlled risks associated with new financial instruments.</p>

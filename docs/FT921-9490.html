			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / DTI fails in attempt to wind up insurer THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday failed in a petition to wind up Secure &amp; Provide, a Hull-based insurance company, on 'public interest' grounds. Secure &amp; Provide traded briefly in early 1991, promoting an unorthodox 'pyramid selling' scheme for personal insurance packages. Its activities were halted when the DTI appointed inspectors. A provisional liquidator was appointed by the court last March. Mr Justice Hoffmann said yesterday he was not satisfied that the public interest required the company to be wound up. It would be 'unjust' and 'grossly disproportionate' to do so in response to the errors Mr John Tyzack, who headed the business, had admittedly made in launching his scheme. The judge dismissed the petition and ordered the DTI to pay costs. He directed that Pounds 40,000 raised from subscribers and held by the liquidator should be returned to the company. Mr Tyzack said the money would be released back to subscribers. Subscribers paid a Pounds 75-a-month premium for a personal insurance package - including health, accident, medical treatment, world travel and personal liability - with an inducement to earn commission by recruiting others to buy. It was not alleged that any aspects of Secure &amp; Provide's marketing scheme contravened the 1973 Fair Trading Act regulating pyramid selling, and there was no evidence that the company misapplied any premium money. In launching his scheme in January last year, Mr Tyzack ran into problems when Lloyd's pulled out and he had to try to arrange underwriting from other insurance companies. This was after a brochure had been printed describing the scheme as 'underwritten at Lloyd's'. The DTI alleged that this and other statements put out about the company amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation by Mr Tyzack. But the judge said he accepted Mr Tyzack had acted in good faith. Until mid February 1991, Mr Tyzack honestly believed that the main elements of his scheme were underwritten by Lloyd's, and he did not intend to deceive, said the judge. The judge added: 'Once Lloyd's had withdrawn, Mr Tyzack took steps to ensure that customers were made aware that cover would not be with Lloyd's and gave anyone who was dissatisfied with the change the opportunity to ask for his money back. After that date he also made it clear that alternative cover was in negotiation and not yet settled.' The DTI said later that yesterday's case was only the second 'public interest' petition it had lost in recent years. The first time the DTI failed to get a winding-up order was in 1987, but it won that case on appeal a year later. The DTI has not yet decided whether to appeal against yesterday's judgment.</p>

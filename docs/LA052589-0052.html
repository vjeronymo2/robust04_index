			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUVENILE CURFEW IN U.S. CAPITAL VOIDED BY JUDGE  </P> <P> A federal judge on Wednesday barred the District of Columbia from enforcing a  juvenile curfew law aimed at curbing drug-related violence in the nation's  capital.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said that the law, which would have kept  people under age 18 off the streets from 11 p.m to 6 a.m., violates the  constitutional rights of thousands of the city's juveniles. The curfew would  have begun at midnight on Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> The Temporary Curfew Emergency Act of 1989 "subjects the district's juveniles  to virtual house arrest each night" and "is a bull in a china shop of  constitutional values," Richey said. "However laudable the objectives which  motivated its adoption, the act is invalid on its face and may not be  enforced."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Law Contained Exemptions  </P> <P> The curfew statute, signed on April 14 by Mayor Marion Barry, would have been  in effect for 90 days. It contained exemptions for teen-agers returning home  from work, school or church-sanctioned functions and for those traveling with  parents.  </P> <P> The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union obtained a temporary  restraining order against the law on April 20, and the district government  agreed to an extension until the court reached a final decision.  </P> <P> The law "was more of a response to political pressure than it was a realistic  approach to the problems," Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the local ACLU,  said. Barry was not available for comment.  </P></p>

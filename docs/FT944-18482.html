			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / French caution on 'superhighways': Trials planned to test demand for information services The French government is preparing to launch trial communications and computer services in selected towns to determine whether to proceed with ambitious proposals to develop a national information superhighway linking French businesses and households. The move reflects a growing debate within the government and France Telecom, the state telecommunications operator, about the technology and investments required to develop autoroutes d'information. The debate has been fuelled by a report commissioned by the government from Mr Gerard Thery, former managing director of France Telecom. The report is currently being studied by the prime minister's office and is expected to be published within weeks. Mr Thery's conclusions favour a substantial investment in the infrastructure needed to build a national information superhighway over the next 15 years. The aim would be to connect 5m households and businesses to information networks by the the year 2000. The cost of the infrastructure, including the extension of fibre optic cables to households and businesses, is estimated at about FFr10bn (Pounds 1.2bn) each year. The scale of the proposed project, however, has drawn a concerned reaction from France Telecom and some industry observers. The state telecoms operator, which would be expected to shoulder a significant burden of the investment under Mr Thery's proposals, is struggling to reduce a debt burden which totalled FFr105bn at the end of last year. It also believes that the technology required is still evolving and that such a large investment in fibre optic networks may be premature. 'Mr Thery's prescriptions are very bold, but potentially risky,' says one telecoms analyst in Paris. 'The government is tempted by the idea of a grand, populist project, but it is also anxious to have some idea of the potential demand for services.' Behind such concerns lie the experience of the Plan Cable, the government-backed scheme of the early 1980s to develop a nationwide cable network. Despite FFr30bn of investment by the government and the private sector, however, cable services remain relatively underdeveloped in France, with operators continuing to suffer losses. The aim of the trial services would be to ascertain the level of demand for new services, from scientific and communications databases to interactive entertainment systems. The sites for the experiments have yet to be selected, but each trial is expected to involve several thousand homes and businesses.</p>

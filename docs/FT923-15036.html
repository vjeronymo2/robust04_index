			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines on weak June jobs data Wall Street FOLLOWING a hectic trading session, US share prices ended lower yesterday after an extremely weak June employment report had proved a bigger influence on market sentiment than the reduction in interest rates that it inspired, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.81 down at 3,330.29, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.11 to 411.77 and the Nasdaq composite lost 5.64 to 563.35. New York SE turnover amounted to 220m shares. The morning started firmly as investors welcomed the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate from 3.5 to 3 per cent in the wake of some extremely bearish jobs data. The June employment report showed that the civilian unemployment rate had risen from May's 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent in June - its highest since 1984 - and that non-farm payrolls had fallen by 117,000 in the month. The figures shocked the market, which had expected a rise in payrolls and little change in the headline jobless rate, and confirmed that the weak economic recovery is having no effect on labour conditions, which continue to deteriorate. The initially positive reaction to the rate cut soon gave way to pessimism about the state of the economy and the outlook for corporate earnings. Moreover, the Dow had risen more than 70 points earlier in the week, so the rate cut had already been discounted. Even a jump in bond prices failed to cheer the equity markets. Banks were a rare bright area as investors bought in anticipation that the new lower bank prime rates (which were reduced from 6.5 to 6 per cent after the Fed's move) will boost earnings. Chase Manhattan gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 3/8 , Citicorp Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 , Chemical Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 7/8 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 , Banc One Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 and BankAmerica Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 46 1/4 . Other financial issues were also higher on hopes that lower interest rates will boost business, including Federal National Mortgage, Dollars 2 stronger at Dollars 64 3/8 , Salomon, Dollars 2 1/2 ahead at Dollars 37 5/8 , and Merrill Lynch, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 51 7/8 . On the way down were IBM, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 96 7/8 , Minnesota Mining, Dollars 2 1/2 weaker at Dollars 96, and Walt Disney, Dollars  5/8 off at Dollars 36 1/8 . Advanced Micro dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 7 3/4 in turnover of 2m shares after warning that price pressure on its 386 microchip line will leave second-quarter revenues 15 per cent below the first quarter. Canada TORONTO closed higher, as the market was influenced by Wednesday's advance on Wall Street, having been closed that day for the Canada Day holiday. The US Fed's rate cut added a positive tone to the market, but had already been largely discounted. The TSE 300 index put on 20.4 to 3,408.1, while advances led declines by 302 to 216 after volume of 24.8m shares.</p>

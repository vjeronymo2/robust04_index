			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: Monteverdi Vespers - Concert The 'BOC Covent Garden Festival of Opera and the Musical Arts' is the full title of a new initiative occupying six of the halls, churches and theatres in the Covent Garden area with festive music-making over the next 14 days. Whether London, a city still in the grip of recession and already over-supplied with competing musical events, really needs another such is yet to be established (by audience numbers, for one thing). But the bill of fare itself is full of bold strokes, unusual combinations, meriting sympathetic attention. A specially mounted Magic Flute in the Freemasons' Hall and G &amp; S Trial by Jury in the Bow Street Magistrates' Court may prove to be brilliantly imaginative feats of planning, or else merely gimmicky; less showy but assuredly substantial are the programmes of music-theatre in the Donmar, the masterclasses and recitals at the Royal Opera House, and the choral concerts (enticing ones: the Monteverdi Vespers, Purcell's Fairy Queen, Handel's Belshazzar) in St Paul's Church. And indeed, any festival launching itself - as this one did on Monday - with Monteverdi followed by a firework display in the Covent Garden concourse must have its heart in the right place. St Paul's is a fine location for the 1610 Vespers, intimate yet sufficiently resonant; and since those features of ambience seemed to chime exactly with the stylistic tenets of the performance by Paul McCreesh's Gabrieli Consort and Players, the experience was continuously cogent, gripping, expertly co-ordinated. McCreesh opted for small forces, particularly avoiding 'additive' scoring; his consort of singers functioned equally efficiently in choral or solo roles, and his directorial tread was unfailingly nimble. As ever in these spare, British-accented accounts of Monteverdi currently in vogue, certain essentially Latin qualities tended to go missing - grandeur, thrusting boldness of colouring, a sense of elating instrumental and vocal virtuosity. Only in the tenor-voice statement-and-echo phrases of 'Duo Seraphim' were they in any way evoked: the singers, Charles Daniels and Mark le Brocq, achieved at last the frisson, the mysterious lightning-flash of drama-in-music for which I had been longing all evening.

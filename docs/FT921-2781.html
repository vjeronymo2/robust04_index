			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Education by opt out THE Conservative education manifesto contains measures to promote parental choice and schemes to suppress local democratic control. Selection, managerial autonomy and state-funded places in private schools will be - or stay - in. But the local education authority will disappear in its current form, as all schools are encouraged to opt out of local authority control - including primary schools, which are to be allowed to opt out in groups. It is an unwholesome combination. If implemented, it could inflict severe harm on the education system. The plight of Stratford School, east London, ought to have put paid to the policy of opting out. Stratford, a grant-maintained secondary school with a substantial Asian intake, gained independence from its local education authority last year. Its governors, a majority of whom are claimed as supporters by the London Collective of Black Governors, are currently attempting to dismiss the head teacher. The school is in turmoil; accusations of racism and intimidation abound; the case is in the courts; and the only recourse is to Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, who has so far had to intervene three times in the governing body's deliberations. Ultimate control The moral is clear: if local education authorities wither through the Conservative distrust of local government, they will have to be recreated. It is not an issue of day-to-day intervention, but of ultimate control and funding. Mr Clarke could not conceivably act as the court of appeal for 25,000 schools; nor could the education department itself monitor and allocate funds to so many institutions. If many more schools opt out, it will need regional councils for the purpose. We will end up with education quangos akin to the regional health authorities. Such centralisation by the back door will affect more than the health of local democracy: it could lead to the widespread return of selection for entry to secondary schools. For Mr Clarke has indicated that he will treat sympathetically applications by grant-maintained schools to reintroduce formal entry tests. At present, a mere 159 grammar schools survive in England; they could soon be reappearing across the country by a haphazard process of governor initiatives. And where grammar schools appear, secondary moderns must inevitably follow for their rejects. Prepared experiments This is no way to proceed. The comprehensive school is not universally admired; there is a good case for allowing schools to specialise and provide for particular needs. But it should be argued nationally, with carefully prepared experiments to test options. Elected local authorities could play a part in this. Reform should not be the result of random selection by school governors, with no democratic check other than the sanction of a remote minister in London. Opting out is not to be confused with autonomy: under the local management of schools initiative, supported by both opposition parties, institutions are rapidly gaining freedom to manage their own budgets, appoint their own staff and organise their own priorities, within the context of the national curriculum and entry policies determined for them. This is as it should be. It has an important side-effect: in tandem with other policies - like the national curriculum and reforms to teacher training - it is helping to blur the division between the state and independent sectors. State schools are gaining much of the self-control - and with it the self-respect - that independent schools rightly value, while the private sector is coming increasingly to share a single curriculum, professional and regulatory structure. The dialogue between the two sectors needs strengthening. That, perhaps, is the strongest reason for continuing the Conservatives'assisted places scheme, which pays all or part of the fees of more than 30,000 children attending private schools. It is not a question of privilege, but of extending choice and quality - and facilitating the process of mutual learning between the two sectors without which both will be impoverished.</p>

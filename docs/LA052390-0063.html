			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SEES 2 BALTIC CHIEFS, REFUSES TO YIELD;  </P> <P> SECESSION: LITHUANIA HALTS GASOLINE SALES FOR PRIVATE USE. IN ESTONIA,  PRO-MOSCOW STRIKES ENTER THE SECOND DAY.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a step toward dialogue with the  Baltics on Tuesday by meeting with the Estonian and Latvian presidents, but he  stuck to his hard line against independence, reports said.  </P> <P> Lithuania, struggling with an economic blockade the Kremlin imposed to weaken  its independence campaign, said gasoline sales for private cars will be banned  as of today.  </P> <P> But a government spokesman said the Lithuanian Cabinet has rejected any idea of  suspending the republic's independence declaration to placate the Kremlin.  </P> <P> The Soviet president, who met last week with Lithuania's prime minister, sat  down for 20 minutes with Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia and Arnold  Ruutel of Estonia, the Estonian News Service reported.  </P> <P> Gorbachev reportedly told them the same thing he told Lithuania's Kazimiera  Prunskiene: The Baltic republics must either suspend or revoke their  declarations of independence.  </P> <P> The Estonian News Service, an independent information agency, quoted Ruutel as  saying there was a common understanding of the need for dialogue, but he  characterized the meeting as "unpleasant" for both sides.  </P> <P> Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are in varying stages of efforts to restore the  independence they enjoyed before the Soviet Union forcibly annexed them 50  years ago. The Kremlin has declared the independence declarations illegal. It  imposed a blockade of oil, gas and other supplies on Lithuania, which led the  independence movement with its March 11 declaration.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Lithuanian legislators debated measures on holding the economy  together during the blockade and on adopting an approach toward Moscow, the  Parliament's information bureau said.  </P> <P> Starting today, gasoline will be sold in Lithuania only for ambulances, police  cars, fire trucks, food trucks, armored cars, hearses and agricultural  equipment, Algirdas Brazauskas, head of the government's anti-blockade  committee, told Parliament. Some gas will be available for limited public  transport, Brazauskas said.  </P> <P> A strike by pro-Moscow forces in Estonia was in its second day, with workers at  two more plants joining the protest against the republic's independence drive,  a strike committee spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Tass news agency said the strike has spread to coal mines, shipyards and  the Krengolmskaya manufacturing mills, the republic's largest light industry  enterprise.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials said Tuesday that American businesses can help  rescue the Soviet economy, but they warned that a trade accord could be  imperiled if Moscow continues to enforce a blockade against Lithuania.  </P> <P> "If sanctions are still being applied in Lithuania . . . it is going to be very  difficult to persuade the American Congress to let the commercial agreement go  into effect," U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock told a meeting of the  U.S-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council in Moscow.  </P> <P> Under a tentative agreement, reached earlier this month, Washington would lift  the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act, extend most-favored-nation  trade benefits to the Soviet Union and ease restrictions on transfers of  technology to Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

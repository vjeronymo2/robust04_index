Cultural work departments at all levels should pay  close attention to this work and do it in a down-to-earth manner.    The appealing, edifying, and educational role of art and  literature is reflected mainly by literary and artistic works.  The practice of the various historical periods in which our  party has led the masses in their struggles shows that  outstanding literary and artistic works can play a tremendous  and irreplaceable role in elevating the ideological realm of the  masses, in encouraging them to be united and to struggle, and in  promoting social progress. Therefore, producing outstanding  literary and artistic works is the central issue in improving  cultural work and in enriching socialist art and literature.    Different times put different demands on the content of  outstanding literary and artistic works. Comrade Jiang Zemin's  speech at the National Propaganda and Ideological Work  Conference demanded that contemporary literary and artistic  creations "augment the main theme" [hong yang zhu xuan lu 1738  2254 0031 2467 1774]. So what is the main theme of our times?  The following make up the main theme that drives us to progress  and develop: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line; patriotic, collectivist, and socialist ideas and spirit;  ideas and spirit that are conducive to reform and opening up, to  the modernization drive, and to solidarity among the  nationalities, social progress, and the well-being of the  people; and all kinds of ideas and spirit that encourage  striving for a good life through honest labor.    Propaganda departments and cultural work departments at all  levels should make great efforts to properly plan and organize  the production of literary and artistic works that reflect the  main theme. They should stick to the orientation of "serving  socialism and serving the people" and the principle of "letting  a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought  contend," creating a fine environment for the flourishing of  literary and artistic creations. They should make meticulous  plans for important literary and artistic activities, and for  promoting the upgrading of creations. They should strive to  produce a number of outstanding films, television programs,  works of literature, dramas, songs and dances, operas, and art  works that are loved by the masses so as to meet the daily  increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses, arouse  their enthusiasm and working vigor, and promote reform and  opening up and the modernization drive. The "five-ones project"  (each year, propaganda organs in various localities should  produce one good book, one good drama, one outstanding film, one  outstanding television drama series, and one or several  convincing good articles that bring out original ideas,)  implemented in recent years has played a positive promotional  role in augmenting the main theme. Literary and artistic works  that reflect the main theme also must participate actively in  competition in the cultural market. This demands that these  works be both outstanding in ideas and content, and excellent in  form of expression and artistic manner. Only this can really  attract and inspire people. It is necessary to make great  efforts to plan and develop news and publications, radio and  television broadcasting, literature and art, and social  sciences, as well as all cultural undertakings -- including mass  community culture, the culture of villages and small towns,  enterprise culture, and campus culture -- thus laying a solid  foundation for augmenting the main theme. It is necessary to  continue to increase input in the sphere of propaganda and  culture, and to further improve conditions for the development  of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We should support and  finance outstanding and elegant literary and artistic works.    While augmenting the main theme, we should pay attention to  variety. The variety we are mean demands, on the one hand, that  the literary and artistic works reflecting the main theme should  be varied, interesting, and vivid in topic, form, style, and  means of expression, and that they meet the many and multilevel  cultural needs of the masses. Every work that educates and  edifies the people, and that amuses and gives the enjoyment of  beauty should have a place.    Cultural work must be deepened continuously in order to meet  the needs of a developing socialist market economy. It is  necessary to further deepen the structural reform of performing  organizations and the reform of other cultural units, and to  progress and make breakthroughs in them, and through reform, to  bring into play the initiative for creation and performance. It  is necessary to promote cultural legislation, to perfect the  system of laws and regulations for the cultural market and the  rules for market behavior, to continue unswervingly implementing  the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to enriching  culture and wiping out pornography," to vigorously straighten  out various problems in the cultural market, and to wipe out  unhealthy things. It is necessary to be good at using such  forms as literary and artistic criticism and theoretical  criticism to guide public opinion and to promote the healthy  development of literary and artistic creation. In the course of  promoting the development of the cultural market, propaganda and  cultural organs at all levels must handle properly the  relationship between the social efficacy and economic returns of  literary and artistic works. It is proper and necessary to  stress economic returns. If economic returns are good, they can  promote the development of the cultural undertaking. However,  the value of a spiritual product is reflected more importantly  by its social efficacy. Therefore, we surely must foster the  idea of considering the situation as a whole, consider questions  by placing social efficacy first, and make efforts to achieve  the integration of economic returns and social efficacy.    The broad masses are earnestly expecting the continuous  production of inspiring, outstanding works. With the guidance  of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, with a good contingent of writers and artists,  and with the motivation of the lively and bustling lives of tens  of thousands of people amid reform and construction, we believe  the time surely will come when literature and art will flourish  all the more!    The masses are the creators of history -- the masters of  reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. Our  propaganda and ideological workers come from among the people  and serve the people. They should learn from the people and  rely heavily on them. "Arming people with scientific theories,  guiding people with correct opinions, shaping people with a  lofty spirit, and inspiring people with outstanding works" are  important tasks for the propaganda and ideological front. In  the final analysis, they represent the interests of the people  and reflect their demands. Only by relying on the masses in  everything and by respecting the will and the originality of the  masses can we complete them well. We should always bear in mind  the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people and continuously  improving our political quality and professional expertise, and  should work conscientiously and struggle hard in order to  complete this great and glorious task entrusted to us by the  great times!</p>

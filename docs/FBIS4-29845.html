			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-ranking government official has termed as an  affirmative sign the realization of the summit talks that North  Korea agreed to hold a preliminary contact for the South-North  summit talks at Panmunjom on 28 June, as proposed by our side.    This official said: North Korea has replied to our side's  proposal as quickly as in two days in the form of a telephone  message in the name of the prime minister--in the same manner as  we did--without any revision to our proposal. I think that this  confirms, first, the sincerity of the North Korean side which  put forth the proposal for the summit talks.    The official said: The fact that the reply message is very  businesslike--without any harangue or hidden meaning--makes us  have a hopeful expectation for the success of the talks.    Another government official concerned said: The only  procedure left before the preliminary talks is for the South and  North to exchange lists of delegates and entourage members.    Regarding the selection of the delegates to the preliminary  talks, the official said: The two sides will fine-tune  procedures behind closed doors at Panmunjom. I think our side's  delegation will consist of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for  national unification affairs, as the head delegate; and Chong  Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and  national security at Chongwadae [presidential offices]; as a  delegate, and others.</p>

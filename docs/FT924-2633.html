			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Pilkington raids reserves for dividend: Sales fall - Losses increase to Pounds 29m / Chairman says group feels 'optimistic' PILKINGTON, the glass group, surprised the stock market by maintaining its 2.93p a share interim dividend, although the Pounds 22.9m payment had to be made entirely from reserves. In all, the group recorded a Pounds 29.2m retained loss for the half-year to end September compared with a Pounds 15m loss. The shares rose 3p to 87p on relief that the payout had not been cut. However, the group cut 1,500 jobs in the half-year, of which 300 went in the UK, and about another 4,000 will go within two years. Group sales in the half-year were Pounds 1.2bn, down from Pounds 1.3bn, and pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.1m, down from Pounds 50.6m. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said: 'We feel marginally more optimistic than we did. Everything we are seeing is trending in the right direction.' In June the group cut its dividend and then Sir Antony said that there was no sign of a recovery in trading conditions. Yesterday Sir Antony said that a decision on the total dividend for the current financial year would be made in June when annual results are announced. The group also announced plans to sell Sola Group, its spectacle lens business, to cut borrowings which stood at Pounds 780m at September 30, up from Pounds 659m at the year-end, excluding Pounds 100m of finance leases. Sterling's fall added Pounds 50m to borrowings on translation of overseas debt. After high levels of spending over recent years, the group now aimed to keep capital expenditure at 80 per cent of the depreciation charge, now around Pounds 140m a year. Analysts criticised the decision to hold the dividend, calling it imprudent. They said the planned disposal of Sola, which made a trading profit of Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 85m in the half-year, was a matter of selling a good business to prop up the balance sheet. Analysts estimated Sola could fetch Pounds 150m to Pounds 200m. Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's new chief executive, said the downward trend in glass prices had been less steep in the half-year, although prices were down 8 per cent between September 1991 and this September. He said a 1 percentage point movement in prices was worth Pounds 7.5m to profits. In the UK, the fall in sterling since mid-September was helping Pilkington to rebuild its UK market share which had suffered because of imports. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 25</p>

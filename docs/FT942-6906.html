			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Statoil valued at up to NKr80bn Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has been valued at between NKr72bn and NKr80bn (Dollars 10.1bn-Dollars 11.2bn) by an independent assessment. The appraisal, commissioned by the government from Goldman Sachs International, the US investment bank, and Fiba Nordic Securities, a domestic firm, was designed to assess the group's value and relative performance within the global petroleum industry. The valuation could be seen as part of the process in the lead-up to a part-privatisation of the state-owned group, although the controversial issue is not on Norway's political agenda. Should Statoil be privatised, it is widely-expected that the government would base the move on that of the ownership structure of Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, in which the state holds a 51 per cent interest. Fiba valued Statoil at NKr80bn, or 17 times expected 1995 earnings and three times book value. Goldman Sachs, which valued the oil group at between NKr72bn and NKr78bn, ranks it, outside government control, as the seventh largest independent oil company in the world. The US bank put Statoil's market capitalisation at between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 15bn, ranking it as a mid-tier oil company among the top 15 to 20 in the world, close to the size of Phillips Petroleum, the US group. In terms of independent oil groups, Statoil's size is closest to that of Enterprise Oil in the UK, according to Goldman Sachs. Enterprise, however, has a rising production profile while Statoil's is declining. Goldman Sachs forecast Statoil's 1994 operating profit at NKr12.43bn, unchanged from 1993.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Banco Santander ahead but Banesto slips back BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish commercial bank which owns 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and which recently bought 13.3 per cent of First Fidelity Bank in the US, said yesterday its first-quarter net consolidated profits increased 21 per cent to Pta20bn (Dollars 187m). Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), one of Santander's main Spanish rivals, reported a 17.15 per cent drop in net first-quarter profits for its financial group (which excludes its industrial corporation) to Pta12.99bn, largely because of a sharp fall in extraordinary profits. Santander, which recently sold control of Electra de Viesgo, a northern electricity utility, for Pta40.5bn, giving it a net profit on the deal of Pta14.8bn, said its cash flow in the first three months of 1991 had increased 65.46 per cent to Pta54.4bn, almost half of which had been made over to provisions and reserves. Santander said shareholders would receive its second 1990 dividend payment - Pta100 - on April 30, making the total payout for the year 16.22 per cent higher than in 1989. Banesto's lower results were due to sharply reduced extraordinary income which usually involves disposal of assets. Banesto's financial group made Pta2.9bn from such sales in the first three-quarters of this year against Pta8bn last year. Gross operating profits for the financial group rose, in contrast, by 12.5 per cent to Pta19.3bn due to a 9.8 per cent rise in the financial margin to Pta42.9bn and to strongly increased income from commissions which were up by 51 per cent to Pta11.6bn. Operating costs were up by 19.5 per cent to Pta35.3bn. Total consolidated assets of the financial group, which exclude those of Banesto's industrial conglomerate, increased by 26.4 per cent to Pta5,399bn in the first quarter. A notable feature of this figure was a 29.7 per cent rise in loans to Pta2,606bn. In the first three months of 1990, loans to the private sector were limited to a 10 per cent increase under the government's credit restriction policy. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest bank, said yesterday it had bought a further 6 per cent of the large Catalan water utility, Aguas de Barcelona, to take its stake in the group to 14.5 per cent. The bank bought the extra stake from the Catalan gas utility, Catalana de Gas. Its efforts to form a giant Catalan energy and resources group were frustrated last year when Repsol, the state-owned oil conglomerate, and La Caixa, the Barcelona savings bank, combined to take control of Catalana de Gas and merge it into Repsol's growing gas interests. The government, however, has been keen to prevent Aguas de Barcelona falling into French hands and will have actively supported BBV increasing its stake.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO on Friday  [29 April] signed an accord here setting out future  Israeli-Palestinian economic relations under Palestinian  self-rule. The accord was signed by Israeli Finance Minister  Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', head of the Palestine  Liberation Organizations's economic department. French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe attended the signing ceremony.    In a statement, Juppe hailed "the courage and determination"  of the two delegations which reached the accord after protracted  negotiations which began here last November. In an eighth and  final round of haggling Thursday, negotiators managed to agree  on several contentious issues, notably customs tariffs.    "It's a good agreement which upholds Israel's economic  interests and allows the Palestinians to develop their own  economy," Shohat told Israeli radio in an interview from Paris  before signing the accord. "It's a historic moment. Life  depends on economic relations, investments, trade and improving  living standards," he said.    The economic accord followed an announcement by Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday that Israel and the  PLO would next Wednesday sign an overall agreement to launch  Palestinian self-rule. The deal covers banking, finance,  employment, customs duties, tourism, agriculture, industry,  energy, and insurance. The Palestinians will be able to control  the quantity of imports and tariffs imposed on them.    The PLO has foregone demands for an independent central bank  but could create its own monetary authority to control and  monitor the banking and financial sector.</p>

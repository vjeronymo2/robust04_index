			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A top government economist  said Friday [18 February] it is desirable that the U.S. dollar  rise back above 110 yen for the time being.    Tsutomu Tanaka, administrative vice minister at the Economic  Planning Agency, told reporters that the yen's latest advance  against the dollar is somewhat excessive in light of economic  fundamentals in Japan and the United States. "I'm concerned  that this level will linger and do damage to economic recovery,"  he noted.    The dollar finished at 104.57 yen in Tokyo Friday, up 1.09  yen from Thursday's close but still far below the 110 yen level  seen before the weekend Japan-U.S. summit in Washington.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Both Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah  speak of a breakthrough achieved in a series of meetings between  the two organizations' senior officials, and there is now talk  of mutual respect and of an imminent agreement between the two  organizations.    The most recent meeting was held five days ago. A senior  Hamas official, who wished to remain anonymous, said his  organization will seek to participate in all Palestinian  institutions, such as health and education bodies, provided it  is granted a fair slice in the future Gaza Strip rule.    A Fatah source has also confirmed the meeting, saying that  his organization intended to permit Hamas to take an active part  in the process, alongside Fatah, in a bid to solve together the  Palestinian population's everyday problems. At the meetings,  Hamas representatives expressed a desire to take part in the  Palestinian police, when one is established. They are our  brethren, a Hamas source said, and we will cooperate with them  in a bid to ensure the Palestinian people's safety, and we are  certainly not against participating in the Palestinian police  force. The source added that Hamas welcomes the recently  returned Gaza Strip deportees.    Another important decision made at the last meeting was that  more meetings should be held to permit a discussion of various  vital issues. A date for one such meeting was set for the next  few days.    The rumors about the Fatah-Hamas meetings have generated  great excitement in the Strip. The headline of yesterday's  AL-QUDS, one of the leading newspapers in the territories,  pronounced: Numerous Reactions to Fatah-Hamas Dialogue. The  Strip residents now hope that with the autonomy implementation,  they will be able to attend to all their affairs as one united  front.</p>

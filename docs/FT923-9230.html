			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's CP market set to resume growth JAPAN'S domestic commercial paper (CP) market will grow again, but credit risks will rise, Moody's Investors Service said in a study released this week, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Growth will resume because of more liberal market regulations, Japanese corporations' increased use of domestic CP for working capital purposes and of Japanese banks' reduced ability to offer either competitive short-term lending rates or CP investor protection, the study said. Yen CP outstandings grew to a peak of Y15,800bn (Dollars 124.16bn) in 1990, falling to Y9,400bn in June 1991, and was about Y9,700bn in March 1992. Until 1991, about 90 per cent of yen commercial paper was issued for financial arbitrage, where issuers ploughed the funds back into higher-yielding investments. Such arbitrage has become more difficult, causing volume to taper off, Moody's said.</p>

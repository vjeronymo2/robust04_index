			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 22 May -- Georgia's Defense Minister  Lieutenant General Vardiko Nadibaidze issued instructions today  on the introduction of military patrols in places where all six  of the republic's military garrisons are deployed -- Tbilisi,  Kutaisi, Rustavi, Akhaltsikhe, Telavi, and Gori.    This measure, adopted by the recent deputy commander of the  Group of Russian Forces in the Caucasus, is aimed at preventing  crimes by the rank and file and officer corps of the Georgian  Army.    The situation as far as violations of the law is concerned  is  complicated by the fact that there are no legislative acts in  Georgia regulating the ownership of short-barrelled weapons.  Thus, citizens have free access to pistols and revolvers.</p>

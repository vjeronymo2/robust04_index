			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Whinney Mackay-Lewis cuts losses to Pounds 195,000 A stronger second half helped Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architect and interior and urban designer, cut losses from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 195,000 for the year to April 30. Turnover slipped to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 3.45m) but operating losses were cut to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 477,000). The pre-tax result last time was after a Pounds 1.55m loss on the disposal of freehold property, restated in accordance with FRS 3. Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said that after three years of recession, turnover was increasing again. The current level of fees represented construction costs of about Pounds 80m a year and there were signs that steady growth would continue. He said an encouraging number of instructions had been received in recent months from new clients. Losses per share were 2.8p (34.6p restated).</p>

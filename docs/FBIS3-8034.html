The Czech side has received a report that this problem was  discussed yesterday between the Austrian ambassador and the  president of the bank and some U.S. senators. Vaclav Klaus  stressed that the government is following all of the activities  of the Austrian side closely; he said he assumes that Austria's  negative attitude will not be accepted, and guarantees will be  dealt with positively in the congressional debate on 10 March.    The government also accepted a report on the situation of  the  customs union. Vaclav Klaus said:    [Begin Klaus recording] The Czech Government is apprehensive  about the latest development.

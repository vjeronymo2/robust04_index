			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Dey Eth, Cambodia, June 22 (AFP) -- A government  amnesty programme for Khmer Rouge [KR] defectors is losing  appeal with guerrillas and numbers are declining sharply, former  guerrillas said Wednesday.    Ex-Khmer Rouge fighters spend eight to 10 weeks at this  military-run re-education camp just east of the capital before  graduating with the offer of a post, and possible promotion, in  the Cambodian army.    Some 600 defectors finished the first course of re-education  in November but the figure was down to 198 in May and only 51  former guerrillas are currently enrolled.    Much of the initial success of the programme was attributed  to heavy publicity.    Co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen made  regular  public appeals for guerrillas to defect and helicopters  air-dropped leaflets with the same message into Khmer  Rouge-controlled zones.    Defectors at the camp, however, said that while they were  still attracted by the government's call for national  reconciliation, the centre itself had acquired a bad reputation.    "We heard that people were not treated well by the military  in the camp," one defector said, adding that some guerrillas had  escaped back to the jungle and advised their comrades not to  enroll.    A human rights organisation which investigated the programme  said it had been "marred by corruption involving top army  commanders and cases of ill-treatment," but camp commandant  General Say Khon dismissed the criticisms as outdated.    "We did have complaints of bad treatment, fake defectors and  corruption earlier, but since the end of the first course we  have had no problems," he said.    "The programme is going well," he added, but declined  comment  on the allegation that the number of defectors is down sharply.    Defectors agreed that there were no longer any cases of  serious ill-treatment but they complained of strict discipline  and few perks.    "We have no money even to buy cigarettes. Life in the jungle  was easier than this," a former guerrilla said.    The programme ran into controversy soon after the first  re-education course started and it was discovered that several  hundred participants were only pretending to be Khmer Rouge.    Civilians and demobilised soldiers had bribed corrupt army  officers or middlemen to be enrolled as Khmer Rouge defectors in  the hope of landing a job with the national army.    A number of the imposters complained to human rights groups  of beatings and other humiliating punishments and more than 200  men, including several genuine guerrillas, later escaped.    The programme was further discredited in January when a  Khmer  Rouge division commander, his deputy and some 92 other defectors  were expelled as imposters.    "Most of them were real Khmer Rouge and felt betrayed. They  returned to the forest and rejoined the Khmer Rouge," said a  human rights official who asked not to be identified.    The programme now holds so little attraction that most Khmer  Rouge who want to defect simply slip away quietly or surrender  to local authorities, a defector said.    "Most would prefer to return to their villages and families.  Only those who have no alternative come here," he said. The  Khmer Rouge control some 10 to 15 per cent of the country and  continue to wage a guerrilla war against the government  installed following last year's UN-supervised polls.    Although government officials say some 3,000 guerrillas have  defected since the amnesty programme started, the Khmer Rouge  have still caused significant battlefield upsets for the  government forces.    The radical faction is also on a recruitment drive to  further  boost the strength of their forces, government officials said  recently.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Corning starts year firmly Corning, the US glass and high technology manufacturer, matched market expectations in the first quarter of the year with a 12 per cent rise in underlying earnings per share. The advance came from the optical fibre and cable business, as well as environmental substrate. This more than offset what Mr James Houghton, chairman, called 'a significant loss of revenues' in its clinical testing business. Net income rose to Dollars 58m or 28 cents a share from Dollars 49.8m or 26 cents (25 cents before a one-off item) the year before. Sales advanced to Dollars 949m from Dollars 817m, with half the growth due to the acquisition of Damon in the second half of last year. The contribution from joint venture companies doubled to Dollars 16.5m. It reported a strong performance from Dow Corning, the joint venture company at the centre of a global breast implant settlement which last quarter caused Corning to take a Dollars 203m charge against profits.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Greenway back in the black with Pounds 2.77m Greenway Holdings, the waste oil recycling business formerly known as Kingston Oil &amp; Gas, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.77m for the 15 months to end-March. The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 4.11m for the previous 12 months, struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 4.49m against the carrying value of its investment in its discontinued US oil and gas operations. The company has changed its year end to tally with that of the DCC Group, its principal shareholder. Turnover for the 15 months totalled Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.1m) and included Pounds 701,000 (Pounds 1.58m) from discontinued operations. Earnings per share emerged at 14.54p (31.44p losses) and a final dividend of 1.5p (nil) is proposed.</p>

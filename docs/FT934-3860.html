			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Paramount proposed Thorn EMI take-over Paramount Communications, the US entertainments group, proposed a take-over of Thorn EMI, the UK-based music and rentals group, in November last year, but nothing came of the idea. Thorn said last night that for two to three years prior to the takeover proposal, it had had discussions with Paramount about collaboration between Thorn's music arm and the US group's film interests. The plans were scheduled to be discussed at a two-day meeting in November last year but Thorn said it brought the talks to a premature close when it became clear that Paramount wanted to take it over. Thorn said that it told Paramount that if it wanted to proceed it should present a formal takeover proposal. Thorn's directors would then be duty-bound to consider the offer. Nothing further was heard, Thorn said. Paramount is currently the subject of two opposing takeover bids from Viacom and QVC Network. News of the contacts emerged in documents filed with the Supreme Court in the US state of Delaware in connection with the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount between cable company Viacom and television shopping group QVC Network. On Thursday the court will hear an appeal by Paramount against a lower court ruling blocking an agreed merger between Paramount and Viacom because Paramount had not given due consideration to a hostile offer from QVC. The court documents also reveal extensive contacts over potential deals between many US media companies in the months leading up to the Paramount battle. These included discussions between Paramount and Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable service provider, over the possible Paramount purchase of a large stake in Turner Broadcasting, the owner of the CNN cable news network.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> WAR GAMES: Top-ranking Marine Corps generals gathered in mid-May for a secret  two-day session to simulate what the Bush Administration has insisted is not in  the cards: direct U.S. intervention in the South American drug war.  </P> <P> The war game, directed by Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., was  described by sources as a highly realistic exercise that pitted "blue" armies  of the United States and the three Andean nations against "red" forces of  narcotics traffickers. While details of the simulation remain classified, one  officer said commanders considered a variety of possibilities because "you  can't nail down a good counter-narcotics war scenario."  </P> <P> Marine Corps officials insisted that the Quantico, Va., session was designed  merely to educate, not plan. But other Administration sources said the meeting  was part of a broader Marine effort to gain a leading role in an expanded  military anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> Noting that the Marines had lost out when the Colombian government vetoed a  plan to station rapid-deployment troops on U.S. carriers off its coast, the  sources said the corps had made clear its determination to find another niche.  "This is the biggest game going," one official said, "but so far, the Marines  have mostly been sitting on the bench."  </P> <P> NEWS MANAGEMENT: A series of backfires involving efforts to manage the news  have set the White House to grumbling.  </P> <P> White House aides traveled to the Houston economic summit primed to ballyhoo a  new environmental initiative by Presdient Bush. Fact sheets had been prepared,  and press releases were ready to go. The initiative -- a new global treaty to  protect the world's forests -- was designed in part to counter negative  publicity about Bush's refusal to allow strong language on global warming to be  put in the summit's final declaration.  </P> <P> But Chief of Staff John H. Sununu refused to allow White House staff members to  announce the new plan until the other six summit leaders had agreed to it. The  result? The initiative was overshadowed by other issues on the last day of the  summit and largely ignored.  </P> <P> The same fate befell another Bush initiative -- on Latin America -- two weeks  earlier. The plan was to be released before the summit.  </P> <P> But when Bush announced his decision to favor a tax increase, the White House  rushed ahead with the release of the Latin American plan the next day. Sununu,  aides said, hoped to divert attention from the tax flap. Instead, Bush's Latin  plan was widely ignored.  </P> <P> "We're not getting any kind of ride on our good stories," said one dismayed  White House aide. Sununu, he added, "just wants to do it his way."  </P> <P> WHAT, BUSH TIRED? After nearly two weeks on the road, President Bush spent the  weekend at Camp David. And for the first time in recent memory, he admitted in  public to being tired.  </P> <P> After parrying reporters' questions for a few minutes before leaving the White  House on Friday, he finally begged off, saying, "Hey, I'm tired. Come on. And  so are the rest of you guys. I can tell by the quality of the questions."  </P> <P> "You're actually tired?" a reporter asked incredulously of the 66-year-old  chief executive, who seemed to think nothing of flying overnight to London,  meeting there with allied leaders and then taking off about 30 hours later for  a late-night flight to Houston.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'm tired. I am tired," Bush conceded.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Philippines reaches deal on rescheduling Dollars 5.3bn debt to banks THE Philippines has reached a new deal with its leading creditor banks on rescheduling Dollars 5.3bn of the country's debt to commercial banks. The agreement, which must be put to the rest of the banks, replaces a deal last September which foundered as the Philippines missed economic targets set by the IMF, and Manila failed to win an accord securing the future of US military bases in the country. The government of President Corazon Aquino recently received IMF approval for a new economic programme after forcing measures through the legislature. Bankers believe the debt deal will provide significant relief to the new government which will take office after elections in May. A significant difference from the previous proposals is that banks will not be able to lend money through a co-financing arrangement with the Asian Development Bank. The US objected to commercial bank financing being secured in this way. Otherwise, the terms are similar. The Philippines has obtained lower interest rates on bonds being offered to the banks, reflecting the general drop in dollar interest rates, though the cuts are not as great as some bankers feared. The package gives bank creditors the option to exchange loans for new bonds carrying low fixed interest rates or to tender their existing Philippine loans for a cash buy-back at a sizeable discount. Banks may also opt to provide new money to the Philippines. Philippine monetary authorities estimate that the programme will generate more than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in fresh funds and debt relief over the next six years. The country's foreign debt totals Dollars 29bn. Bonds to be offered in exchange for existing loans include new money bonds with a maturity of 17 years and an interest rate of London interbank offered rates plus  13/16 percentage point. Interest reduction bonds with a maturity of 15 years will carry interest for the first two years of 4 per cent, rising to 5 per cent in the next two, and to 6 per cent in year six. From the seventh year until maturity date, the interest will be Libor plus  13/16 per cent. A third option will be principal collateralised interest reduction bonds to mature in a repayment in 25 years, initially carrying 4 1/4 per cent interest.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Mexican airport rights go on sale next year THE SALE of concessions to run Mexico's 61 airports will go ahead next year, with the airports grouped together in three or four packets, according to reports in the newspaper El Economista. Each packet will comprise profitable and loss-making airports and one of the big airports of Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey or Cancun. The state-owned company Airports and Auxiliary Services will be handed over to the Finance Ministry by February next year. Several Mexican and foreign investors - including the Dutch airport Schiphol, and the Mexican Grupo Industrial Hakim - are interested in bidding, according to the report. Mexico's airports are expected to handle 25m passengers this year, of whom 10m will be international travellers. Of the 61 airports, around 12 are responsible for 90 per cent of the passengers. The government's aim is to use these generally profitable airports to attract private investors to manage the smaller, often loss-making ones. The airport privatisations are part of an ambitious programme to hand over responsibility for investing in Mexico's transport infrastructure to the private sector. The government has awarded concessions to the private sector to build around 3,500km of toll roads, and passed laws to encourage the private sector to invest in the water system. On Wednesday, the Mexican Senate passed a law which will facilitate private-sector investment in the electricity sector. The law will enable private concerns to build and own electricity plants, but they will have to sell electricity to the state-owned Commission of Federal Electricity. Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state oil company, has appointed JP Morgan, US investment bank, to advise it in privatising some of its secondary petrochemical plants. JP Morgan will advise Pemex on the valuation of the plants, the structure and promotion of the sales.</p>

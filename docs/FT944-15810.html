			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Lamont resigns from Bow Group Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor who sparked a row at the Tory conference, has quit the Bow Group after 30 years' membership. He is believed to have quit the Tory think-tank because he was angry about its refusal to stage his speech at the party conference fringe last week in which he suggested Britain could leave the European Union. He eventually made the speech at a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon Group. The Bow Group said: 'We didn't want to give him a platform because we gave him one at last year's conference and he delivered his alternative budget. We're a broad-church organisation . . . and we didn't want to be seen to be giving Norman Lamont a platform every time he asked for it.'</p>

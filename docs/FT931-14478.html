			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / BA close to revised deal for a 20% holding in USAir BRITISH Airways is expected shortly to announce a revised partnership deal with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. The companies could unveil a deal this week, following the inauguration on Wednesday of President Bill Clinton, who criticised the original proposal during his election campaign. That partnership agreement - blocked in December by a US-UK government dispute over liberalising air services between the two countries - would have given BA a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 488m). The new deal would give BA about 20 per cent, for an investment of Dollars 340m, and voting rights of about 20 per cent. BA, which last week apologised for waging a 'dirty tricks' campaign against rival Virgin Atlantic and paid out about Pounds 3.6m in damages and costs, confirmed yesterday that discussions were continuing with USAir on some form of alliance. BA is believed to have dropped its demand for a right of veto on important spending decisions - a factor which hindered approval of the original agreement. The new deal stands a better chance of being cleared by the US authorities than the earlier, more ambitious proposal. In pitching for a stake and voting rights of less than 25 per cent, BA will hope the US Department of Transportation will nod the deal through. In its initial proposal, BA argued that its stake of 44 per cent would only carry a 21 per cent voting right, but big US carriers objected. These US carriers may well continue their campaign against the revised deal. American, United, and Delta put intense pressure on the US government to insist the UK opened up London's Heathrow Airport to more US airline services in return for approving the original deal. United said yesterday it could not comment on a new BA deal without knowing the details. It said it saw any agreement between BA and USAir as a chance for the UK and US to develop more liberal open skies policies. BA and USAir would become closely integrated, carrying out joint marketing. BA sees the alliance as the means to take advantage of deregulating markets in Europe and across the Atlantic, giving it unrivalled access to the US east coast compared with European competitors.

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Payment dispute over Danish terminal FRAUGHT negotiations over financing for a new DKr8.5bn (Pounds 859m) airport terminal at Copenhagen are expected to start in the next few days between Scandinavian Airlines System and Copenhagen Airports, the state-owned Danish airports authority. Neither Copenhagen Airports, nor SAS, which wants exclusive use of the new terminal, appears willing to pay for the building. The terminal is planned to have a capacity of between 15m and 20m passengers a year. The airport, the main hub of SAS's traffic system, has an annual capacity of 15m but at present handles only 12m passengers a year. Mr Peter Hoeland, managing director of SAS Denmark, said: 'We do not see ourselves as airport investors. No airline, apart from Alitalia, is investing in airports. We expect the airports authority to do this.' SAS has recently presented Copenhagen Airports with its plans for the highly sophisticated and automated terminal which could make Copenhagen more attractive to transit passengers. SAS wants the airport to become northern Europe's main hub. It is at present Europe's 8th largest in terms of passengers. Mr Neils Boserup, chief executive of Copenhagen Airports, said: 'Only SAS can justify an investment of DKr8.5bn. The proposed terminal is so advanced, it's not a building, it's a machine. An airline might be able to afford it, but we can't' Copenhagen Airports made pre-tax profits of DKr169.2m on turnover of DKr1.2bn for the 15 months to December 31 1991. SAS reported pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1992 at SKr502m on turnover of SKr16bn. Mr Boserup is proposing an alternative terminal for use by all airlines. This building, which he describes as modern but more conventional than SAS's plan, would add about 7m passengers a year to existing capacity and would cost about DKr2bn. He said that if the SAS terminal was not started during the next year, he would go ahead with the alternative plan. An investment of DKr8.5bn might cast a shadow over the future of Copenhagen Airports, which is due to be partly privatised.</p>

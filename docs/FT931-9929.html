			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / US ready to support Bosnian peace effort with troops THE US last night committed itself to the international effort to end fighting in Bosnia. It named a special envoy to assist the efforts of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC negotiators. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, also said the US was prepared 'to do its share to enforce a settlement'. Without discussing details, he said this could mean sending US forces, along with UN and Nato counterparts, to ensure that any peace agreement was sustained. The US plan was warmly welcomed in New York by Mr Vance and Lord Owen. When they arrived a week ago at the UN for a final negotiating push, both had feared the US would opt to rearm the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Christopher said this had been seriously considered but rejected after consultation with Britain, France and Canada, which advised that their forces already in Bosnia would be 'gravely endangered' by such a move. Similar considerations, he added, constrained the present use of US air power. As Mr Christopher outlined it, the US approach involved 'active engagement' in the Vance-Owen plan, 'bringing the full weight of US diplomacy to bear.' He said: 'We do not expect a miracle but we believe we can make a difference.' Mr Christopher conceded that he had feared that the Vance-Owen plan might be imposed on the warring parties. 'We will not arrive with a map and we have no prescribed solution,' he said. The US special envoy to the negotiations will be Mr Reggie Bartholomew, currently US ambassador to Nato, a selection which is understood to have pleased Lord Owen. Mr Bartholomew will first fly to Moscow to confer with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. President Bill Clinton discussed the US plan with Mr Yeltsin by phone. The Russian leader was supportive, Mr Christopher said. President Clinton is also sending a message to all the warring parties that only a negotiated settlement can end the conflict and that one will not be 'imposed'. But, in an explicit warning to Serbia, he is seeking tighter economic sanctions to deter a widening of the war. Mr Christopher would not be drawn on any US military commitment, but stressed that any agreement should contain 'quite viable enforcement procedures'. He said 'our conscience revolts' at the evidence of Serbian ethnic cleansing, murders, rapes, shelling, the forced displacement of peoples and 'atrocities committed by others as well'.

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Improved bonds trigger bounce in Nikkei A rebound in the government bond market encouraged late afternoon bargain hunting by investors, which led equities to recover most of the losses they sustained in small-lot arbitrage selling during the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was finally marginally lower, losing 59.21 at 19,839.18 after falling to 19,665.67 and bouncing to 19,894.29. Most investors remained inactive ahead of the March futures and options settlements tomorrow. Foreign investors, a major force of the Nikkei's recent rise, were absent; investment trust funds took profits as clients cancelled their accounts. Volume remained flat at 300m shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.83 at 1,605.49 and the Nikkei 300 finished 2.49 down at 295.90. Declining issues outscored advances by 615 to 393, with 169 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.64 at 1,329.70. Some traders do not expect the futures settlements to trigger volatile price movements. 'Investors seem to want to keep their shares until the March year-end, to receive dividends,' said one broker. Blue chip steels encountered bargain hunting. Kawasaki Steel, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y5 to Y351 and Nippon Steel edged forward Y2 to Y344. Profit-taking depressed high-technology shares. Hitachi receded Y5 to Y920, NEC Y10 to Y1,010 and Sony Y30 to Y6,190. Kajima, the leading construction company, dropped Y35 to Y918 on large-lot selling. The company is alleged to have bribed Mr Kishiro Nakamura, the former construction minister, who quit the Liberal Democratic Party yesterday due to increasing scrutiny from the prosecutors and the media. Other construction issues were also weak, with Shimizu down Y25 to Y894 and Obayashi losing Y11 to Y672. Financial stocks were lower on arbitrage linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,250 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y20 to Y1,930. Sakura Bank, which announced it would issue Y100bn in preferred stock, weakened Y40 to Y1,410 on fears of increased supply. Brokers also lost ground, Nomura Securities dipping Y30 to Y2,230 and Nikko Securities Y30 to Y1,280. In Osaka, the OSE average was off 67.56 at 21,890.38 in volume of 98.4m shares. Profit-taking left Aoyama Trading Y110 down at Y5,710. Roundup Worries about overseas markets were a depressing feature in the region. HONG KONG saw light profit-taking, and the Hang Seng index declined 70.20 to 10,224.38 after a rise of 554 over the previous three trading days. Turnover was weak at HKDollars 3.8bn, down from HKDollars 5bn. Conglomerate Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 62.50 as a rumour circulated that the company might drop its listing in Hong Kong. MANILA suffered one of its heaviest falls this year, fuelled by uncertainty over interest rates and political doubts. The composite index dropped 130, or nearly 5 per cent, to 2,507.33. KARACHI finished at a record high on brisk trading of financial shares before a six-day holiday. The Stock Exchange 100-share index climbed 19.75 to 2,562.06. SINGAPORE fell victim to fears over US interest rates, the Straits Times Industrial index dropping 17.33 to 2,222.85 and the All Singapore index losing 2.70 at 581.22. AUSTRALIA found that renewed pressure on the bond market rebounded on equities, taking prices broadly lower. The All Ordinaries index ended 24.9 down at 2,146.8, just off its intraday low of 2,143.5, in modest trading. KUALA LUMPUR saw an early positive trend reversed in later trading, leaving the Stock Exchange composite index with just a slight rise on the day of 0.13 at 1,056.43. BOMBAY had an early rally and the BSE index closed 102.78 up at 3,847.39. The improvement came after falls in six consecutive sessions since the budget. JAKARTA experienced slow trading and bearish sentiment before an annual holiday. Overseas selling helped push the index down 6.60 to 514.57.</p>

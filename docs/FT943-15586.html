			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Spread of nuclear weapons Sir, Bronwen Maddox raises some excellent points in her critique of the International Atomic Energy Agency ('Soft bark and a weak bite', July 4). However, even if her call for the watchdog to 'be more alert than in the past' were heeded, it would do little to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Given the conflicting nature of the IAEA's charter, in which it is specifically called upon to promote peaceful uses of nuclear power, regulate nuclear safety and control proliferation of nuclear weapons, it is doubtful that increased vigilance will do the trick. It is impossible to promote civilian nuclear technology without increasing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. As the 1946 Acheson-Lilenthal report to President Truman stated: 'The development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and the development of atomic energy for bombs are in much of their course interchangeable and interdependent.' This connection continues today, as illustrated by Bronwen Maddox's example that new technology makes it increasingly easy to convert uranium and plutonium from commercial grade to weapons grade. The IAEA's current position is analogous to the fox guarding the hen house. To resolve the dilemma, the IAEA will need to abandon its role of promoting nuclear technologies - which would require amending its charter. It is not simply a question of waking up the fox, as Maddox suggests.

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonds bonus for savers SEVERAL institutions have recently launched fixed interest rate bonds, which allow those who want to keep their money in the building society a way of obtaining a guaranteed rate for a given period. Portman Building Society is offering a fixed-rate bond paying eight per cent gross for one year. The minimum investment is Pounds 500, the maximum Pounds 10,000. Portman claims a deposit of Pounds 10,000 or more would be needed to obtain a higher fixed rate at the top 20 building societies. Withdrawals are not allowed and the bond is available until Tuesday, November 30 only. Abbey National has also launched a fixed-rate bond this week, paying 6.7 per cent gross until December 1, 1994 for deposits over Pounds 10,000. Withdrawals are not allowed before maturity, with early closure subject to 180 days' loss of interest. Given the high penalty and the relatively unattractive fixed rate, the bond may not have wide appeal. Two issues are hybrids, giving some element of guarantee, diluted with a variable component. Skipton Building Society has launched the third issue of its Imperial Bond, which is paying 8.5 per cent gross (6.38 per cent net) fixed for seven months until June 30, 1993. After this period, the rate until maturity on May 5, 1995 is guaranteed to be at least 1.5 per cent higher than the gross variable rate paid on the Pounds 5,000 band of Skipton's Sovereign Shares Account. The rate on this account at the moment is 5.5 per cent gross. Withdrawals are allowed after the first 30 days and, although notice is not required, they will be subject to 30 days' loss of interest. Skipton Financial Services, a subsidiary of the building society, launched the second issue of its Deposit Bond with Providence Capitol this week. This is a single-premium investment bond and is of little use to non-taxpayers, since tax cannot be reclaimed. It does, however, give top rate taxpayers the opportunity of deferring payment of tax. The bond guarantees to pay a half point above the average gross rate paid by the top five building societies on Pounds 25,000 in their instant access investment accounts. The guarantee lasts until October, 1996. The rate on the deposit bond at present is 10 per cent gross (7.5 per cent net) on a minimum of Pounds 10,000. During the first two years, minimum withdrawals of Pounds 1,000 can be made, subject to 30 days' loss of interest. Penalty-free access is allowed after that but the balance must not fall below Pounds 5,000.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> We watched a recent telecast of "Entertainment Tonight" because it was going to  feature Alex Trebek explaining how very careful steps were being taken by  "Jeopardy!" and himself to see that contestants were properly isolated. What a  joke. The film clips showed about 30 seconds of Trebek, and the rest of the  story focused on different contests held years and years ago such as "The  $64,000 Question" and "What's My Line?"  </P> <P> Mr. and Mrs. Steve Courso,  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

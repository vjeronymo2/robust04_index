			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Chaos puts aid effort at risk: Ted Bardacke on rebuilding the Haitian nation without a government Government in Haiti has all but ceased to exist. So, when millions of dollars in foreign aid follow the planned return this week of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, getting it to those who need it most will be no easy task. And, when business groups prepare for the restoration of a normal economy, knowing whom to negotiate with and trust will also be difficult. The military government the US came to remove is no longer functioning. Except for levies on consumption, no taxes and tariffs are being collected; bills from the state-owned electricity company are unpaid. The national government has an annual budget of just Dollars 125m (Pounds 79m), 35 per cent of which went to the armed forces. In the three years of military rule, there has been virtually no spending on education or public works. 'The Haitian budget has a very low impact on the country's economy,' says Mr Raymond Lafontant, head of the Haitian Industrial Development Association. 'If they closed all the ministries, the country would still work.' A senior official at the ministry of economy and budget says he has had no contact with the Aristide team that will take over the management of the economy. Upon President Aristide's return, he says, he will 'not necessarily' have a job. Between Dollars 450m and Dollars 770m in aid is due to be disbursed over the next several years. While the government - a government - is set up again to administer it, several solutions are being offered to keep aid money under US control so that it gets to the people who need it in this country with an annual per capita GDP of Dollars 250. The United States Agency for International Development, which will control many of the new assistance programmes, wants much of the money to go through local government officials. To do this they must wrest the control of local administration from the dreaded so-called Section Chiefs, rural strong men appointed by the military regime. So USAID will immediately look to fund the December local elections, where it is hoped that the Section Chiefs will be swept into oblivion. 'Those elections are the insurance policy for our aid,' says one USAID official. The US occupation force is also doing its part. One of the mandates of Special Forces troops operating in rural areas is to determine development priorities for the new government, and in the capital army doctors are designing a plan to convert an abandoned hotel into a hospital. 'The government has no absorption capacity,' says Mr Dieter Hannusch of the United Nations Development Programme. 'The best situation would be for the government to oversee the projects without having government employees do the actual work.' Many of the humanitarian assistance programmes would be contracted out to Haitian non-governmental organisations (NGOs), while infrastructure works would fall to the private sector. Haitian NGOs were given much responsibility under the Aristide government but were accused of being partial to Aristide supporters. Since the coup, USAID has been working with leaders of those NGOs, many of whom had gone underground, identifying those considered 'trustworthy and independent'. Haitian business groups, while happy to win contracts from international aid groups and to have the UN economic embargo lifted, say that the Aristide government must focus its energies on political stability. 'We can work with anybody as long as they ensure peace and stability,' says one prominent local businessman, while Mr Lafontant estimates that with political stability half the country's 45 export-oriented assembly plants will be functioning within six months. 'Aristide understands that an infusion of capital directly depends on the level of stability in the country,' a senior US official said during a visit to Haiti last week. The embargo has created an unprecedented level of pent-up domestic investment capital. 'People who made a lot of money off the black market are eager to invest in concrete projects,' says Mr Robert Stryhanyn who owns concerns in cement and transportation. At the country's only iron and steel foundry, owner Mr Gilbert Bigio is constructing new sales offices to handle the expected growth in business. Yet many businessmen complain that the market is too free and that to sustain economic growth beyond what the initial aid and euphoria will bring, the government must start to do something about the high hidden costs associated with the breakdown of economic order. For instance, moving goods through the capital's port costs three times as much as it does in the neighbouring Dominican Republic because of corruption, even though most cargo comes in tax free. Private security services, which make up for a lack of police protection, are a big cost.</p>

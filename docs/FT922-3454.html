			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (4): The vulture investors make money out of bankruptcies / A look at the growth in the use of Chapter 11 protection BIDS ARE out; bankruptcies and restructurings are in. That may be a crude oversimplication of the shift in business trends between the 1980s and 1990s, but it carries a large measure of truth. For the US investment community - from bankers to lawyers - this sea-change has meant a substantial reallocation of resources. M&amp;A departments have been scaled down, while restructuring teams have been built up. Arbitrage activities have been reduced, while 'vulture funds' (which invest in distressed securities or bankrutpcy claims) have been either expanded or launched. And so on. All of which reflects a bankruptcy process which is substantially different from that generally pertaining in the UK. One of the US's more endearing philosophical commitments is to 'the right to a new life' - an axiom which dates back to the Pilgrim Fathers. In the narrow context of corporate affairs, this has evolved into the 1978 US Bankruptcy Code and its 'Chapter 11' process. Very broadly, this allows a company to file for court protection from its creditors. Assuming the courts agree, the company's assets cannot then be seized; the debtor is allowed to suspend certain interest and debt repayments and to cancel certain contracts; legal suits against the debtor can be pursued only as claims through the bankruptcy court. Once Chapter 11 protection is operative, the debtor and its creditors - who usually form a 'committee' to represent often-disparate interests  - try to agree on a restructuring plan. This may involve the sale of assets, creating a cash pool which can be used to pay claims, at least in part. But creditors are usually offered some interest in the ongoing business as well. Reasons for the growth in the usage of Chapter 11 are largely self-evident - the recessionary climate and the large amounts of debt taken on by many US corporations during the 1980s. To a lesser extent, some companies have found the ability to abrogate contracts useful and others - such as Manville - have filed in the face of massive legal claims. The bankruptcy process often looks attractive to non-US observers. After all, jobs are preserved and, in the most successful cases, creditors have enjoyed substantial recoveries. The downside is the time and money which Chapter 11 can eat up; some cases have dragged on for over half a decade, and fees can consume hundred of millions of dollars from the debtor's estate. LTV, the steel company, is a good example: fees are estimated at over Dollars 150m during a stay in bankruptcy which has now dragged into its sixth year. Already, some judges are scrutinising expenses intently - in turn, making bankruptcy work far less lucrative for the professionals than, say, bid activity. In the Southmark case, for example, the judge chopped Dollars 3m off a Dollars 54m bill. The potentially litigious Drexel bankruptcy, meanwhile, was hassled along by a ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton Pollack. As a result, the bankruptcy was completed in two years, a time limit few thought possible when the proceedings began. Suggestions over how the Chapter 11 process might be reformed to reduce time and expense vary widely. However, one commonly voiced notion is to shorten the 'exclusivity period' - that is, the window when the debtor has the sole right to produce a reorganisation plan. By giving the creditors an entree earlier in the proceedings, some lawyers argue, months could be clipped away. A more controversial 'time-saver' is the pre-packaged bankruptcy - used, for example, by Mr Donald Trump with his Taj Mahal casino property. Here, debtors and creditors in effect agree on a restructuring plan before the Chapter 11 filing is made. Chapter 11 is then used to implement the restructuring scheme, and the debtor's stay in bankruptcy is confined to a few months. But it is arguable whether this is how the process was meant to be used. In some cases, the presence of professional bankruptcy investors can also speed matters along. Since most claims are transferable, 'vulture investing' has become a fairly sizeable industry - with players ranging from specialists Mr Michael Price at Mutual Shares and Mr Sam Zell at the Zell/Chilmark funds, to mainstream fund management group T. Rowe Price and to former corporate raider Mr Carl Icahn. Even Goldman Sachs got in on the act, raising its Dollars 783m Water Street fund in 1990, but then aborting the project when conflicts of interest surfaced. Foreign investors have not been bypassed, either: Credit Lyonnais has backed Apollo Partners, the restructuring business run by Mr Leon Black, formerly an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Together, the French bank and Apollo acquired most of the junk holdings of Executive Life, the Californian insurer. The book value of the portfolio was over Dollars 5.3bn. By giving creditors a potential market for their claims, and bringing well-honed negotiating skills to the restructuring process, these investors arguably serve a useful purpose. Final labour negotiations in the long-running Wheeling-Pittsburgh bankruptcy, for example, were oiled by Mr Ron LaBow - who had acquired virtually all the bank claims and stood to become the major equity holder under the steel company's reorganisation plan. It is not just vulture investors who have been making money out of bankruptcies. Another lucrative spin-off business has been the provision of debtor-in-possession financing. DIP loans are new facilities provided to companies once there have filed for bankruptcy protection. These usually rank at the forefront of the creditors' queue for repayment, should the company be forced to liquidate - so security is relatively good. Yet terms are usually attractive to the lender - earning 2 to 4 per cent above a standard business loan, with perhaps 3 per cent upfront as a fee. Conversely, it is not the cost of bankruptcies which provokes criticism. The process leaves much to the discretion of judges, and some are felt to be more sympathetic to a debtor's position than others. It has been argued, for example, that this explains a number of filings in Delaware, where there is just one bankruptcy court judge, so the debtor knows at the outset who will be assigned to the case. But perhaps the biggest question-mark hanging over the process is its effect on other healthy companies operating in the same sector. By keeping a bankrupt company alive - and, indeed, giving it some operating advantages - industrywide distortions can occur. This has been most marked in the airline industry, where bankrupt carriers have undercut hugely, in a desperate attempt to secure cashflow (regardless of profitability). Some relatively sound airlines have been obliged to match this competitive pricing - and the sector generally has faced a flood of red ink.  --------------------------------------           US COMPANIES FILING            UNDER CHAPTER 11  -------------------------------------- 1980                    6,348 1981                   10,041 1982                   18,821 1983                   20,252 1984                   20,252 1985                   23,374 1986                   24,740 1987                   19,901 1988                   17,690 1989                   18,281 1990                   20,783 1991                   23,989  -------------------------------------- Source: American Bankruptcy Institute  --------------------------------------</p>

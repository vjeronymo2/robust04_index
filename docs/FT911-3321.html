			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Eni posts annual profits of L2,072bn ENI, the Italian state-owned energy and chemicals group, made consolidated net profits of L2,072bn (Dollars 1.61bn) for 1990 compared with L1,613bn in 1989. Sales rose to L50,033bn from L36,470bn in 1989. However, the increase in last year's net earnings is a mere 0.8 per cent when adjusted for the full ownership of Enimont, the former public-private chemicals joint venture. Eni bought Montedison's 40 per cent stake in Enimont last November, and has since tendered for the remaining 20 per cent of the shares floating in the market. Restated for the full consolidation of Enimont's figures, net earnings in 1989 amounted to L2,057bn. Similarly, sales in 1989 were L44,503bn, meaning that turnover rose by only 12.4 per cent in 1990 on an adjusted basis. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, said a good performance in the group's energy sector last year had offset poorer results elsewhere, notably chemicals. Plans for the current year include a substantial rise in investment, especially on the energy side. While higher business volumes could offset lower margins in the oil sector in 1991, he warned that higher taxes and borrowing costs meant that group profits this year could fall. Adjusted net borrowing went up by L4,047bn to L23,735bn.</p>

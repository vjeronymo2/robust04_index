Anatoliy Sobchak warned the West against believing in a  Russia where reforms are at an end and where the nationalists  hold power when he met the press in Oslo City Hall as one of the  heavyweight figures in Russian political life. "Before I travel  home on Monday I am going for a medal for the Russian team,  because 60 percent of them come from the St. Petersburg area."  He is patriotic on behalf of the 5 million people in the  metropolis that was long called Leningrad.    "The fact that half the officers and soldiers voted for  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the nationalist is a protest with a  nonpolitical content directed against the conditions facing the  soldiers who are being brought home from abroad. Often they  have nowhere for themselves and their families to live; some of  them have to move into tents out on the plains. These are  people who in other countries have been used to good living  conditions and some of their wages in hard currency. The  important thing now is to get them good homes, also with help  from the West. They must also be guaranteed civilian jobs, and  here the authorities have set in motion a rapid program for the  handing out of free land to officers and soldiers, and this is  helping," Sobchak told AFTENPOSTEN.    "The important thing that has happened in Russia -- as  important as the revolution in 1917 -- is that in the elections  in December we also adopted a new democratic constitution. This  put a final end to the Soviet era; for the first time a Russian  constitution contains guarantees of fundamental human rights.  This -- and the fact that we had elections that were fought  between several parties -- means more than Zhirinovskiy, whom  the media in the West have blown up out of all proportion," he  said.    [Udgaard] But economic policy has been changed. The IMF is  skeptical.    "It has not been right to give loans from abroad to the  government. It has not succeeded in using this money in a  sensible way. Loans from abroad must be given directly to  enterprises, to those who can increase production and earn money  again quickly," Sobchak said.    Now Norway's Kvaerner and a group of firms in St. Petersburg  -- former military enterprises which today are looking for a new  role -- are to come together to build a new installation for  waste treatment in St. Petersburg, he said after a meeting with  the Kvaerner management. He is prioritizing closer ties with  neighboring regions in the Nordic area, and said with manifest  pride that the borders are now so open that in 1993 for the  first time there were more Russians who visited Finland than  there were Finns who crossed the border in the opposite  direction.    This week Sobchak, along with his counterpart from Moscow,  has been taking part in Oslo local council's conference on  industry and commerce and he is hoping for more economic  contacts.    "I have met with Mayor Ann-Marit Saebones and we will try to  bring the exhibition of Edvard Munch's portraits over to St.  Petersburg. We ourselves want to send works from the Hermitage,  the czar's magnificent art collection, and from the Russian  Museum to Oslo," Sobchak said.    Sobchak's stay in Oslo will last almost a week, with a  detour  to Lillehammer. But it is in fact NATO's supreme commander at  Kolsas, British General Sir Garry Johnson, who has brought him  to Norway -- and into the mountain where the alliance sits on  its secrets. Not many Russians have been there as yet, as far  as we know. Sobchak has taken part in the "closed" conference,  Viking Review, and spoken on the subject of collective security  in northwestern Russia and the Baltic Sea region.</p>

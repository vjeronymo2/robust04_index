The question is, when? Following three  years of drastic restructuring, the sector remains in a state of  turmoil. Add to that the crippling impact of soaring costs and  it's not surprising that analysts are sourly predicting slow  growth at best for the industry in 1994.    The only glimmer of hope on the horizon appears to be  housing  construction, which began to show signs of life in the third  quarter of 1993. Demand for new homes will presumably sustain  growth in this sub sector, but for the rest of the industry,  little is likely to change this year.    Construction output, which has declined the past three  years,  will remain stagnant, while the industry will continue to  furiously downsize.    "A number of smaller firms will not be able to survive what  will be a sweeping of the market," said one construction company  manager.    Of all of the industrial sectors, the construction industry  was one of the first to feel the impact of the country's  economic transformation. Most of the gigantic state-owned  concerns employing 10,000 or more workers collapsed. At the end  of 1989, 158 construction companies existed in the Czech  Republic. Of these, 77 were state-run enterprises with an  average workforce of between 2,000 and 6,000. Construction  output made up about 10 percent of national production,  generating an annual turnover of around 65 billion Kc ($2.2  billion).    Privatization of the industry, however, has changed these  figures dramatically. Currently there are about 1,200 companies  with 25 or more employees, and several thousand enterprises  employing 25 or fewer workers. There are only 18 active  companies that have a workforce of over 1,000 employees. A list  of the more prominent companies now includes Metrostav, IPS  Praha and Vodni stavby Praha.    These changes have given the industry a structure that more  closely resembles Western European countries than a former  Soviet satellite. In Germany, for example, there are about  35,000 companies employing up to 10 workers, and approximately  100 enterprises retaining a workforce of over 5,000.    The downsizing of the construction workforce has been  paralleled by a similar reduction in construction revenues.  Compared to 1990 (calculated in 1992 prices), the total volume  of construction work declined from a value of 128 billion Kc to  93.5 billion Kc (in 1993). This development resembled the arc of  a playground swing: the largest decline occurred in 1991, 89  billion Kc. The following year the total increased to 103  billion Kc, and last year slipped to the aforementioned level.    Construction capacity is currently running at about 48  percent. In 1990, construction output was valued at 83 billion  Kc. Supply costs reached 48 billion Kc (representing 57.9  percent of total overhead), while wage costs were over 14  billion Kc (accounting for 17.7 percent of total costs). Profit  surpassed a level of 6 billion Kc. The following year, output  increased by 350 million Kc, while wage costs decreased by 660  million Kc and supply costs rose by 3 billion Kc.    As a result, profits dipped to 2.92 billion Kc. In 1992,  output plummeted to 67 billion Kc; however, supply and wage  costs also fell, to 42.8 billion Kc and 10.5 billion Kc  respectively. In turn, profit was only 1.8 billion Kc.    Absolute numbers have a tendency to drop. The reduction in  profit was more dramatic than the fall in costs. This shouldn't  come as a surprise, however. In 1990, costs accounted for about  90 percent of the value of production. Two years later, they  rose to a level of 97.2 percent.    Even though 1993 figures are still not known, they are  unlikely to stray far from the past year's trend. Of course, the  rate of inflation will influence these figures, but it's a given  that enterprises have still not reached a proper level of  efficiency.    Although the amount of private capital invested in the  construction industry is rising (in 1992 it represented 13.9  percent of the total investment in the sector), the state still  has the final word. Its share of the investment in the sector  reached 74.2 percent in 1992. The money covers large public  works projects with a budgetary burden of over 100 million Kc.    Through the first half of 1993, the state was involved in  913  projects representing a cost of over 213 billion Kc. Attention  has been focused on environmental and socially oriented works  projects, transportation construction, and investment falling  under state administration.    It is this rise in government investment, however, that has  prompted analysts at Austrian-based Girocredit Research, a  branch of the investment bank Girocredit, to declare it is  "generally bullish on the construction sector [of the Czech  Republic]."    While many former East bloc countries have looked to  international markets for help, construction firms in the Czech  Republic have stayed at home for the most part, concentrating on  the domestic market. This has helped shield Czech companies from  the declining markets of Eastern Europe, according to Girocredit.    Others are also predicting steady, if not spectacular  growth,  in the industry. David Lawn of the Prague office for Gleeds  International, a construction consulting firm, is guardedly  optimistic about the future.    "If the needed investment comes into the country, it bodes  well for the construction industry, since a growing economy  needs construction. A few large projects will really have a  great effect on the sector's future," Lawn says.    If domestic markets are helping Czech firms prosper, success  could stand in the way of international gains. As the Czech  Republic's economy catches up to those of other countries, so  too do costs. Already some of the competitive cost edge that  Czech firms had over their Western counterparts has been lost  due to rising wages.    Now countries like Ukraine hold an advantage in this  respect,  with the gap only expected to rise. This could force even deeper  cuts in the industry as efficiency becomes more critical for  survival.</p>

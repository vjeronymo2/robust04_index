			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Christoph Bertram; place and date not given: "It Is a Tightrope  Walk"]    [Text] [Bertram] Mr. Woerner, you have always advocated  determined action by the West in the Balkans. Does the recent  measure correspond to your ideas of energetic action?    [Woerner] It is a first and, as I believe, very useful step,  which, however, must be followed by others. Military action is  not a purpose in itself. The goal must remain, and that is  improving the safety of the people -- in all parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and contributing to a peaceful agreement  among the parties.    [Bertram] The military intervention by NATO may have started  some movement in this respect. Do you think that further  military steps by the West are necessary?    [Woerner] For me, it is not military steps that are in the  foreground but the political efforts -- and at all levels: at  the level of the United Nations, then at the level of the two  big powers United States and Russia, but also at the level of  the NATO members. These political steps will, however, be  successful only if they continue to be accompanied by the  determination of taking military measures when necessary and  wherever nothing else helps. In this respect, our primary  concern in NATO is that we do not gamble away the reputation we  have gained by precipitate and insufficiently planned  operations. We are engaged in some sort of tightrope walk here.    On the one hand, the stimulus must not be lost. We must use  it. What we have done in Sarajevo must not remain a unique  operation. On the other hand, what is done now must be planned  just as thoroughly and must then be implemented with equal  determination -- perhaps with different methods.    [Bertram] Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, is  calling for more ground forces. He needs an additional  3,000-5,000 blue helmets just to stabilize the situation in and  around Sarajevo. What are the prospects of getting these  3,000-5,000 men from the NATO countries?    [Woerner] I fully sympathize with General Rose and he has my  support -- first, for the determined way in which he is acting  and second, for his demand for more troops. However, I do not  see where they are supposed to come from at the moment. I get  the impression that our member countries, which are already  providing the majority of troops there, are very restrained in  this respect.    [Bertram] If there is something like a private opinion of  the secretary general, who is German: Are you convinced of  Boon's arguments that German soldiers must not or should not get  more actively involved in peacekeeping in Bosnia?    [Woerner] My personal opinion: Most of these arguments have  not convinced me. I have never considered the constitutional  argument correct, and the other arguments must be weighed  carefully. However, I would be very restrained about using  German ground forces in areas where German troops operated in  World War II. This applies in particular to the areas where we  are dealing with Serbs. This is a necessary consideration.    [Bertram] There are also other possibilities....    [Woerner] There are other possibilities, in which I would  recommend to be more generous.    [Bertram] If the West does not send any more troops, will  then Russia not be virtually invited to jump into the breach?  How do you assess Russia's role in this conflict?    [Woerner] One will be able to come to a final assessment of  Russia's role only when it is clear how the Russians themselves  define their role. I hope very much that they do not understand  themselves as the Serbs' protective power but as a power that is  trying to tackle the problem impartially.    [Bertram] Do you welcome the presence of Russian troops in  Bosnia?    [Woerner] When some people complain today that Russia is  becoming active there, I do not share this view at all. First,  I think it is unavoidable. Second, I even think it is helpful  since it has been done with the intention of making the Serbs  give in. I believe that we have to include the Russians in such  a way that they continue to use their influence in the spirit of  a solution that is acceptable for all parties.    [Bertram] And what if they do not let themselves be  included? Does Moscow then have a veto right?    [Woerner] It is out of the question that Russia is going to  gain a certain influence on the actions of NATO. We have done  what we considered appropriate and correct, following a decision  by all our member states, and we will continue to do so. We are  ready and interested in cooperating with the Russians and also  in consulting them. However, the Russians are not a member of  NATO. And just as Russia has interests, this also applies to  NATO. One must not confuse Russia's welcome role as a  participating big power with a right to veto NATO actions.    [Bertram] The West has for a long time hesitated about  getting militarily involved in the Balkans. Is NATO now  irrevocably involved -- after the ultimatum and after the  enforcement of the flight ban?    [Woerner] I think so. This was unavoidable anyway; this  just had to come. This is also part of NATO's tasks in our  time. We are the only functioning collective defense alliance  in the world. We are the central factor of stability for all of  Europe. One cannot just claim this role, but one must make a  specific contribution in situations of crisis. We have done  this and we will continue to do so.    [Bertram] Do you sometimes ask -- perhaps with a bit of  bitterness -- why action was taken only now? What could have  been avoided if action had been taken earlier?    [Woerner] Here I once again answer as Manfred Woerner and  not as secretary general. I do indeed ask myself this question  -- more and more every day. My own conviction was and is:  Timely intervention would very probably have prevented an  expansion of the conflict and would have facilitated a political  solution. At least, now we have taken determined action.</p>

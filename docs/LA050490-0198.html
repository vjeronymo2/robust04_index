			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIN FOREST FUNDS  </P> <P> I would like to congratulate the students and teachers of Willow Elementary  School in Glendora for their wonderful contributions to save rain forests in  Central America ("Pennies for the Planet," Metro, April 25).  </P> <P> It is truly gratifying to see young children learning free market solutions to  ecological problems instead of the typical coercive solutions pressed by many  environmental activists and government officials. Organizations like the Nature  Conservancy and students like those at Willow Elementary School give me great  hope for the future of our planet.  </P> <P> GAIL LIGHTFOOT  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> Libertarian Party of California  </P> <P> San Dimas  </P></p>

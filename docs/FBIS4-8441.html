			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  told journalists today that he had prepared four broad topics  for discussion during the meeting of the seven Central European  presidents on Saturday [16 April] and Sunday in the east  Bohemian town of Litomysl.    The first topic Havel proposes is the question of  cooperation  in Central Europe, the definition of the Central European space  and the discussion of its character and prospects.    The second is the context of Central Europe in Europe  itself.  Theme three, Havel said, is Russia and the Balkans, because  every discussion of Europe has to include these regions.  Lastly, the present state of Europe, its problems, tasks, the  dangers it faces and the prospects of its integration.    The main significance of the event, however, will be the  opportunity it presents for informal discussions, during which  differences of opinion need not be harmful, he said.    The six presidents Havel will be playing host to are from  Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and Germany.  Although Germany has only got "one foot" in Central Europe, as  Havel said, its president, Richard von Weizsacker, was in office  during Germany's reunification and several other moments crucial  for Central Europe. Germany's participation may also help the  country to formulate its relationship with its immediate eastern  neighbors, he said.    Havel said he hoped the location of the meeting would  contribute to the renewal of the spirit of regionalism which  characterized the Czech lands in the time before communism, when  the Czech republic became "just Prague and its surroundings".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Rwanda: Vatican Proposes </F> International Peace Talks"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, April 27 -- The Vatican on  Wednesday [27 April] asked that an international peace  conference on Rwanda be organized, to be attended by the two  rival tribes in the central African country, the heads of state  of neighboring countries and the Western countries most involved  or interested in the region's development.    The appeal was issued by the Vatican's "Cor Unum" Papal  Council, which is headed by Roger Etchegaray and deals with  relations between Catholic organizations and international aid  bodies.    In its statement, the council also urged the international  community "to intensify its presence in the field and diplomatic  mediation, since one cannot remain indifferent or passive in the  face of this genocide."    Cor Unum officials on April 25 met officials from about 30  Catholic organizations and from the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss ways and means of  allowing relief aid to reach Rwandan refugees who are fleeing  attacks from Hutu and Tutsi tribes.    "To understand the seriousness of the conflict," the  Vatican's statement said, "one must remember that the largest  exodus is taking place since the Gulf War, involving hundreds of  thousands of people in flight. Victims are innumerable,  especially among civilians."</p>

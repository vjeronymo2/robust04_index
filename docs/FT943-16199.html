			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Japanese tax cuts promise confirmed Japan's new government yesterday confirmed it plans to cut income tax, in a bid to stimulate domestic demand and curb the trade surplus. 'By promising tax cuts for next year, we have made clear our consideration of the economy,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister. He was, however, unspecific on how to fund the tax cut beyond indicating there would be a rise in the 3 per cent sales tax at an undefined later date. In the meantime, the government would avoid issuing deficit-financing bonds 'too easily', he said. The tax cut is expected to be of the same order as this year's one-off Y6,000bn (Pounds 39bn) income tax rebate which was decided by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and was to last for one or two years. This indicates the new government is going for an expansionary economic policy, to reinforce the signs of a fragile upturn from Japan's longest recession since the second world war. The prospect of a resultant fall in the trade surplus helped the yen weaken slightly yesterday, closing at Y99.5 to the dollar in Tokyo, from Y98.67 the previous day. However, fears that the government will have to issue more debt provoked a sharp drop in government bond prices. An outline tax plan will be presented at the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in Naples at the end of the week and the government hopes to draft details of overall tax reform by the end of the year. A rise in sales tax would be doubly controversial for the three-party coalition. The government is already unpopular because of the manner in which it seized power last week. The Social Democratic party of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, prime minister, opposed the introduction of sales tax in 1988 and is loth to increase it. Uncertainty over future funding is unwelcome to the Finance Ministry, which has always argued that an income tax cut and sales tax increase must be decided simultaneously. It fears the budget deficit could rise out of control at a time when Japan's ageing population is set to make increasing demands on social security spending. Tax revenues fell short of spending in 1993 - by Y568bn - for the third year in a row, the ministry said yesterday. It will make up the shortfall by borrowing from a state fund set up for this purpose.</p>

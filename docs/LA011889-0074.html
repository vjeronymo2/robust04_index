			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> INS DENIES CHARGES OF STALLING ON AMNESTY OK NOTIFICATIONS  </P> <P> Charges by immigrant advocates that as many as 20,000 amnesty applications have  been stalled in bureaucratic "limbo" were denied Tuesday by immigration  officials, who said that they have begun implementing measures to better update  applicants on the status of their cases.  </P> <P> Susan Alva of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles charged  that though the applications have been approved, the Immigration and  Naturalization Service has failed to notify applicants or provide them with  their temporary residence cards. She said this has caused some to lose their  jobs because some employers have refused to continue accepting temporary work  permits that were issued to them earlier, pending a decision on their amnesty  applications.  </P> <P> "Some have been waiting up to a year to hear the result of their cases," Alva  said at a morning press conference. "When they go to INS to ask, they're just  told to go home and wait some more."  </P> <P> At a press conference later in the day, INS officials said the applications in  question belong to immigrants who have moved and failed to notify the  government of their new address. They said the 20,000 represent a tiny fraction  of the more than 1 million applications filed in the INS western region during  the one-year amnesty program that ended last May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'New Address'  </P> <P> "If you haven't heard from us and you've moved . . . it's your responsibility  to make sure the INS has your new address," said Western Regional INS  Commissioner Harold Ezell, noting that change-of-address forms are available at  government legalization offices.  </P> <P> He added that the agency plans to conduct a public information blitz during the  next two weeks to encourage applicants who have moved to fill out the address  cards.  </P> <P> The agency also plans to provide master lists of approved applicants so that  immigrants can check for themselves on the status of their cases, he said. The  lists will be available sometime in March at legalization offices, he said.  </P> <P> Ernest Gustafson, the INS' Los Angeles district director, said the status of  applications is available through computers at INS legalization offices and  that INS workers have the capability to make these checks for applicants.  </P> <P> Despite the offers, however, immigrant advocates contend that applicants often  find it difficult getting assistance from clerks at understaffed legalization  offices.  </P> <P> "These may be things proposed by INS, but it's just not happening," Alva said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who backed the coalition's  demands for improved notification procedures, added that "we're not here to lay  blame" for the applications that are "in limbo."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residence Cards  </P> <P> "But people who have qualified for amnesty deserve to receive the (temporary  residence) cards due them," he said.  </P> <P> Ezell said that in an attempt to address such concerns, the agency plans to  open a "problem window" at each legalization office by the end of the week to  handle complaints.  </P> <P> The INS officials also noted that applicants may telephone the INS hot line --  (800) 643-4800 -- for further information or the INS regional processing  facility -- (714) 643-4800 -- for updates on the status of their applications.  </P></p>

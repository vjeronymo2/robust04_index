			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel  Castro said that for his country, there is no possible  alternative to the preservation of sovereignty and a solution to  the economic crisis than to maintain socialist principles.    At the closing of a session of the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP], which approved guidelines for the  strengthening of the country's finances, Castro said it is  necessary to make concessions to adapt the country to a world  dominated by capitalism, but without moving away from the  country's principles.    Speaking to more than 550 deputies and several dozen foreign  and Cuban guests, he ruled out the possible application of  neoliberal formulas because, according to him, these measures  have not solved problems such as unemployment, which continues  to increase even if the economy grows. In his opinion, the  world is in the hands of the multinational companies and  capitalism, and this situation will continue for a relatively  long time, a reality that the Revolution will have to bear in  mind. He pointed out that Cuba is willing to make concessions  but only the indispensable ones to survive and develop.    Fidel Castro noted that the survival of socialism in Cuba,  almost four years after the disappearance of the USSR, is also  taking place at a time in which the country is blockaded by the  United States and its anti-Cuban policy.    He pointed out, however, that despite this situation, the  number of foreign companies interested in investing in Cuba has  increased because the nation occupies an important position  among the countries considered safe for investment.    The Cuban president said the current problem is not limited  to domestic finances, a topic that was debated by the ANPP,  because the scarcity of foreign exchange considerably limits the  purchasing of food, medicines, fuel, raw materials, and spare  parts to keep the economy running.    He noted that the reactivation of the economy is a difficult  process because the agriculture sector has to work with a  shortage of pesticides, fertilizers, and the country lacks the  resources to purchase steel with which to manufacture plows.    Cuban President Fidel Castro said, however, that the country  is not discouraged and is facing the difficulties under complex  conditions. For example, he said sugarcane cutters do not even  have the appropriate shoes, workers are poorly dressed, and  workers are not eating the proper foods for the jobs they  perform.    In this regard, he described as an example of courage the  agreements reached today by the ANPP to create an integral tax  system, to increase the prices of certain products, to eliminate  certain free services and subsidies because of company losses,  as well as to recover the value of the peso, without ruling out  the exchange of money to achieve it.    He pointed out that the government will not rest in applying  this measure designed by the ANPP; it will do so gradually but  without delay because it will begin this week with the passage  of a decree on the confiscation of illegally acquired property.</p>

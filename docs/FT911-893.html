			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush opens US ports to E Europe PRESIDENT Bush, in an important revision of US policy, yesterday threw open all US ports to former Soviet satellite nations and declared his intention 'to stimulate commercial trade between the US and the region'. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said the decision was another step towards ending Cold War restrictions and welcoming eastern Europe into 'the international community of democratic nations'. The action had been taken, after an intensive inter-agency review, 'in recognition of the progress these countries have made toward democracy. The new port policy follows other recent moves to expand US trade with eastern Europe. Last month duty-free trade benefits were extended to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. The new port policy maintains the same delineation between the Soviet Union and the eastern Europeans that the Bush administration has retained on other trade matters. Export controls, for example, have been liberalised towards the eastern bloc more than for the Soviet Union. The new port policy opens all US ports for commercial, cargo, passenger and fishing vessels from eastern European nations. In the past, access for ships from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania was severely limited. They could not enter 12 'high security' ports at all and they were required to give two weeks' notice for other ports. Now the six will be required to give only 24 hours' notice for any ports. Soviet ships must give two days' notice at 49 ports and two weeks' notice at others. Access to 12 high security ports is still denied to Soviet ships.</p>

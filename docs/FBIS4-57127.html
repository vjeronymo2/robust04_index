			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 12 May.    In 1993, Brazilian industrial productivity grew by a record  18.78 percent with respect to 1992, when it grew 4.86 percent  with respect to 1991. This information was released on 5 May by  Yolanda Ramalho, chief of the Economic Department of the  National Bank for Economic and Social Development. Ramalho  explained that the productivity rise caused unemployment to grow  1.7 percent among industry workers, while the dollar value of  salaries paid in 1993 grew 10.88 percent. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO  DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 6 May 94 p B4)    During the first quarter of 1994, Brazilian electric power  consumption grew 2.8 percent with respect to the same period in  1993. This growth rate did not reach the expected 4 percent  rate that had been estimated by Eletrobras' [Brazilian Electric  Power Company, Inc.] market department. (Sao Paulo GAZETA  MERCANTIL in Portuguese 5 May p 14)    The April inflation rate measured by Getulio Vargas  Foundation totaled 42.46 percent. It was 2.3 points lower than  the March rate. The Agricultural Wholesale Price Index in April  totalled 36.88 percent, almost 12 percent less than in March.  Industrial prices remained stable, decreasing from 42.06  percent in March to 41.90 percent in April. Compared to March,  retail sales prices, however, increased 2.1 points in April,  ending at 45.57 percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in  Portuguese 10 May 94 p 3)    The level of employment in Sao Paulo industries fell 0.26  percent in April, with 5,792 industrial workers being dismissed.  (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 May 94 p 10)    The profile of the Brazilian trade balance in the first  quarter of 1994 shows that imports in general increased.  Capital goods imports increased 41.5 percent and totalled $2.35  billion, while consumption goods imports increased 29.8 percent  and totalled $645 million. Brazilian exports from January to  March reached their second best level in the country's history,  totalling $8.8 billion. Brazilian exports to the PRC, however,  decreased 67 percent during the quarter, totalling only $98.2  million. Brazilian sales to Latin American Integration  Association member countries, except Argentina, dropped 6.74  percent, showing that the developing countries, which always  supported Brazilian sales abroad, are responsible for a 91  percent drop in overall Brazilian exports.

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Patten defends Hong Kong democratic reforms MR CHRIS PATTEN, governor of Hong Kong, yesterday defended his much-maligned democratic reform proposals for the colony by indicating that they were part of 'the minimum values' which Britain could not honourably abandon. In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Mr Patten said a credible though not necessarily completely democratic Legislative Council (Legco) was part of 'the framework of the rule of law' to which both Britain and China had subscribed in their 1984 Joint Declaration. 'The minimum value that we should hold on to is that the last election under British rule (in Hong Kong) should be clean and fair and not rigged. Should we allow the bottom line to be moved every time people disagree with us?' In spite of his attachment to bottom lines, however, the governor said Britain did not want to impose solutions on the Hong Kong people which they did not themselves favour. 'Our position remains as it was. We don't wish to go further than the people of Hong Kong wish to go, but also not less far than they want.' He also continued to adopt a flexible attitude towards the Chinese government and professed to be puzzled by Beijing's refusal to hold early face-to-face talks with Britain. There was no disagreement between the two sides that the talks should be between the present and future sovereign powers in Hong Kong, Britain and China, nor was there any dispute over holding them in Beijing. As far as Mr Patten was concerned, they could start 'this afternoon.' The governor was well aware that such talks would be 'extremely difficult indeed.' Nevertheless, they would offer the Chinese the opportunity of explaining 'what they would like to do about the 1994 and 1995 elections (for district councils and the legislative council).' 'I hope that talks can start very soon and in a spirit of sincerity by both sides,' Mr Patten said. However, if the Chinese did not agree to direct talks, his proposals for democratic reforms would be put to Legco. Mr Patten once again declined to fix a deadline for submitting the reform plan to the council.</p>

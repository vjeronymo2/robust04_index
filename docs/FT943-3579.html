			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coles Myers denies buy-out hitch Coles Myers, one of Australia's largest retailers, has moved quickly in an attempt to quash suggestions that its planned buy-out of the 21.45 per stake in its equity currently held by Kmart, the US stores group, was running into shareholder opposition. In a statement to the stock exchange yesterday, Coles said it had received almost 12,000 proxies, covering more than one-fifth of its shares. It said these were overwhelmingly in favour of the deal. Coles, which is due to release its profit figures today, added that 'the company's chairman and chief executive officer have recently visited many of the major institutional shareholders . . . and the response to the proposed transaction . . . has been consistently and overwhelmingly supportive and affirmative'. The deal comprises a direct buy-back and cancellation of just under half the Kmart stake, and the possible purchase of a Kmart subsidiary which holds the remaining 11.45 per cent, with the method of disposal for these shares yet to be decided. A meeting to approve the deal has been called for September 19. However, Coles' task of persuading shareholders to back the deal has not been made easier by its falling share price, which closed down another 12 cents at ADollars 3.98 yesterday, compared with the ADollars 4.55 at which the Kmart interests would be bought in. Conversely, the fact that directors and associates own or control around 28 per cent of the equity could be to Coles' advantage.</p>

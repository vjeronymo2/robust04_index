The National Police Press Office told ACAN-EFE the explosive  devices, filled with leaflets from the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR),  one of four organizations that make up the URNG, detonated in  two Guatemala City zones.    The source said the leaflets from the FAR, an armed group  operating in the northern region under the leadership of  Commander Pablo Monsanto, marked its "32 years of revolutionary  struggle."    Several unidentified people dynamited the foundations of the  San Juan bridge, which is located at km 20 of the Atlantic-bound  highway, early this morning. The incident, besides causing  property damage, created serious traffic jams.    The Army dispatched a delegation to the site to investigate  if the guerrillas perpetrated the attack, which destroyed the  bridge, and to estimate property damage.    The terrorist attack and the bomb explosions are occurring  as  the government and guerrillas are meeting in Mexico to end the  oldest internal armed conflict in the region.</p>

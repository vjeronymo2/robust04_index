			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pioneer ahead at halfway Higher first-half profits from its core building materials and products division offset lower earnings from petroleum refining at Pioneer International, and allowed the Sydney-based group to report a 15.2 per cent increase in after-tax profits in the six months to end-December. Pioneer said that it made ADollars 73.6m (USDollars 52.9m) in the period, compared with ADollars 63.9m previously, on sales of ADollars 2.84bn, against ADollars 2.65bn. Operating profits were little changed overall, at ADollars 159.4m compared with ADollars 156.5m a year earlier. However, this conceals a sharp improvement in the building materials and products business, where earnings before tax and interest rose by 45 per cent, to ADollars 120m. Major contributions came from Australian interests, at ADollars 67.5m up 44 per cent, Europe, also up 44 per cent to ADollars 34.5m, and the US, rising 103 per cent to ADollars 22.1m. The Asian operations, by contrast, registered a loss of ADollars 4.1m, largely due to a fall in concrete prices in Hong Kong. The pre-interest contribution from Ampol, the company's petroleum products subsidiary, fell 27 per cent to ADollars 63.7m. Pioneer blamed a stock loss of ADollars 13.2m, resulting from falling crude oil prices. Excluding the stock loss, profits would have fallen by around 12.4 per cent, on a 6.4 per cent sales increase. Looking ahead, Pioneer said that it expected that the full-year contribution from the building materials side would be satisfactory, with a growing contribution from its Asian and Eastern Europe operations over the next 12 to 18 months. But it warned that the petroleum activities 'remain extremely difficult with continued discounting in the retail petroleum market and a further deterioration in the international refiner margins over the past two months'.</p>

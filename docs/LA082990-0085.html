			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESPERANZA POISED TO END LOS ALAMITOS' FIVE-YEAR REIGN  </P> <P> Simple numbers tell the story of Los Alamitos High School's reign in the Empire  League over the past five seasons. Consider:  </P> <P> * The Griffins have won 20 consecutive league games; their last loss came in  the opening game of the 1986 season, 25-8 to Loara.  </P> <P> * Four league titles in the past five years, including three straight with  quarterback Todd Gragnano in the lineup.  </P> <P> * An overall record of 52-9 and two appearances in the Southern Section  Division III championship game.  </P> <P> * Five consecutive victories over Esperanza, consistently one of the top teams  in the county. "I can't think of anyone we've ever lost to more than three  straight times," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said.  </P> <P> Will Los Alamitos continue its domination into the '90s following the  graduation of Gragnano (University of Nebraska), tailback Erik Mitchell  (Colorado), linebacker Brian Havens (Nebraska) and lineman Hartwell Brown  (Stanford)?  </P> <P> "We'll be good, but you have to favor Esperanza," Los Alamitos Coach John  Barnes said. "They have every one of their skilled players returning and all  those buffaloes (linemen) to go with them. They have the best team in the  league."  </P> <P> Naturally, Meek picked Los Alamitos to win the six-team league based on its  past success and his team's inability to beat the Griffins.  </P> <P> "No doubt, we want to win the league, and in order to get the championship,  we're going to have to beat Los Alamitos," Meek said.  </P> <P> The five-year drought could end in the league opener -- Thursday, Oct. 11 --  when Esperanza plays host to Los Alamitos. The winner should go on to win the  title in a league of haves and have-nots.  </P> <P> Esperanza has compiled a 17-13-1 record over the past three years after going  9-2-1 in Meek's first season. Meek has utilized an I-formation, Pro Set and,  finally, the Delaware Wing-T in an effort to find the right offense.  </P> <P> "We feel most comfortable with the Wing-T," Meek said. "We're able to throw  better out of this formation and run some misdirection. We've always been a  good trap blocking team, so the offense really suits us well."  </P> <P> Keith McDonald, starting his third year at quarterback, will be passing to two  returning all-league receivers, tight end Reid Pullen and wide receiver Jarod  Smith. Pullen caught three touchdown passes last year against Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> "We're going to score some points and we have excellent team speed on the  defensive side," Meek said. "I'm expecting big things from Keith and Pullen is  one of the best receivers we've ever had here."  </P> <P> Mark Parlin, who rushed for 517 yards as a junior, also returns and Meek is  excited about the prospects of 200-pound fullback Gerrick Emry joining Parlin  in the backfield.  </P> <P> "I expect Gerrick to carry a lot of the offensive load," Meek said. "Parlin  will be used primarily as a linebacker."  </P> <P> The imposing task of replacing Gragnano and his 6,140 career passing yards at  Los Alamitos goes to John Collins, who started every game at flanker last year.  "He's going to be very good," Barnes said.  </P> <P> This should be the year that running back LaQuan Beckton finally fulfills the  lofty expectations that many had when he first appeared on the varsity as a  sophomore. Beckton played in the shadow of Mitchell's speed last year.  </P> <P> "He's on a mission," Barnes said. "He's grown to 200 pounds, bench-presses 375  pounds and vertical jumps 36 inches. He's worked very hard to improve his speed  and is hoping to have a big year."  </P> <P> The best athlete on the team is Tyler Cashman, who can play split end, tight  end or free safety and also doubles as the team's punter. A player to watch for  the future is sophomore free safety George Segan, whom Barnes said "has as much  athletic ability as anyone I've coached here."  </P> <P> Loara, coming off an 8-2-1 season, will begin a new era under Coach John  deFries after the retirement of Herb Hill and the graduation of running back  Coy Collins, who broke six offensive school records during his three-year  career.  </P> <P> "Everybody is wondering about the transition from Herb Hill and what changes  John is going to make at Loara," Barnes said. "They had an awfully good  sophomore team (9-1) last year, so you know they have a lot of young talent  coming up."  </P> <P> CYPRESS -- The Centurions were the surprise team of the league last year,  battling for a playoff spot until the final week of the season and shutting out  Los Alamitos for three quarters before losing, 14-7.  </P> <P> "We started the season with 22 players and finished with 25," said Coach John  Selbe. "We didn't quite get it done because we had so many injuries  offensively. It was encouraging to have 40 players come out this year."  </P> <P> Selbe calls speedy slotback Sean Dangaran "our secret weapon." Dangaran had the  team's longest run from scrimmage, a 60-yard touchdown, last season. Youssef  Semaan figures to rarely come off the field, playing flanker and defensive back  and also punting.  </P> <P> Three standouts on Cypress' defensive line last year -- Jayson Bern, Ramon Reid  and Joe Toohey -- are now assistant coaches.  </P> <P> EL DORADO -- The county's worst team last year should be the county's most  improved team this year. El Dorado had only two players with varsity experience  entering the 1989 season, but 22 lettermen assure the Golden Hawks of a more  experienced team.  </P> <P> "It was a challenge all season long, but the kids never gave up," said Coach  Rick Jones. "We had a good off-season in the weight room and some success in  summer passing leagues."  </P> <P> El Dorado's season opener should be memorable against Century, a two-year-old  public school in Santa Ana playing its first season of varsity football.  </P> <P> "You've got one team that didn't win a game last year and another going for its  first win in school history," Jones said. "I see two teams who are going to be  very hungry."  </P> <P> ESPERANZA -- Here's a switch. There's only one starting lineman weighing more  than 225 pounds but two sophomores, Travis Kirschke and Brian Werner, should  continue Esperanza's tradition of having the biggest linemen in the county  before they graduate. Kirschke is 6-foot-2, 220 pounds and Werner is 6-foot-4,  240 pounds.  </P> <P> "We don't have anyone 6-5 and 250 pounds on the line like we've had in the  past," Meek said. "But I like our team speed on the defensive side and our  offensive guards run well."  </P> <P> Meek, on linebacker Mike Burns: "He ran a 4.6 in the 40 as a 190-pound  sophomore and he still runs a 4.6 as a 237-pound senior. He could turn out to  be the best big player we've ever had."  </P> <P> KATELLA -- Score two-year starting quarterback Dennis Briggs' decision to quit  football last spring, "E-5" after the all-Southern Section third baseman told  Coach Larry Anderson he wanted to concentrate on baseball last spring.  </P> <P> Briggs subsequently changed his mind but lost his starting position to Chris  Reed. Anderson, an assistant baseball coach, said he had a "falling out" with  Briggs but later welcomed the veteran back to the team.  </P> <P> Anderson needs all the experienced help he can get with only four starters  returning. Katella had its worst defensive unit in Anderson's three seasons,  but added, "Athletically, we're a little better than last year."  </P> <P> Don Popovich, an assistant baseball coach at Rancho Santiago College, will  teach special education at Katella and assist the Knights' freshman football  team.  </P> <P> LOARA -- DeFries, a 12-year assistant under Hill from 1971-83, admits he hasn't  coached a defensive team in seven years as he gets acquainted with his  linebackers and secondary through two-a-day drills.  </P> <P> Offensively, Charlie Gipson will move from wide receiver to quarterback and  David Kang, the chief blocker for Collins last year, will be the primary  ballcarrier. DeFries' major change will be to allow Gipson to develop into more  of a dropback passer and become a little more active in the Saxons' offense.  </P> <P> "I'm going to do things pretty much the same way Herb did," deFries said. And  where's Hill been during two-a-day drills? "He's fishing in Montana," deFries  said.  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS -- Barnes and his staff have established Los Alamitos as one of  the top programs in Southern California, compiling a 78-38-5 record in 11  years. "Year in and year out, the staff at Los Alamitos does the best job in  the league," said John Selbe, Cypress coach.  </P> <P> Depth could be a problem with only 45 players on the roster but 54 players  reported for the sophomore team and six will play on the varsity.  </P> <P> The offensive line will be anchored by tackle Kevin Kropf and guard Justin  Stewart, who played every down last year, and returning all-league linebacker  Ed Leiva is the strongest player on the team.  </P> <P> "It's hard to imagine Los Alamitos with better skilled-position players than  they had last year," Anderson said. "But they're very good again this year."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE EMPIRE LEAGUE; DIVISION III  </P> <P> Cypress  </P> <P> Coach: John Selbe (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 5-5, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 13  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Bryan Dawson, RB, 6-0, 175, Sr.; Sundance Smith, RB/LB, 5-11,  170, Sr.; Sean Dangaran, RB/MG, 5-11, 185, Sr.; Youssef Semaan, WR/DB, 5-11,  175, Sr.; John Teutimez, WR/DB, 5-5, 150, Jr.; Gary Kakalia, TE, 6-3, 180, Sr.;  Brandon Caldarella, DB, 5-8, 155, Sr. and Kevin Smith, OT, 6-2, 180, Jr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Robert Robles, OT, 6-2, 300, Sr.; Gabe Garcia, QB, 6-0, 175,  Jr.; Ralph Williams, TE/LB, 5-11, 165, Jr. and John Bradaric, LB, 6-0, 160, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: It has been 10 years since Cypress advanced to the playoffs. Cypress  allowed an average of 12.6 points per game in 1989, but eight defensive  starters graduated. Dawson, a two-year all-league star, was hampered all year  by an ankle injury suffered in the season opener but is fully recovered. Semaan  was the league's top punter last year, averaging nearly 40 yards per kick.  Garcia won the starting quarterback job in the spring, edging out senior Joe  Groover.  </P> <P> </P> <P> El Dorado  </P> <P> Coach: Rick Jones (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 0-10, 0-5  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 22  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, five on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jason Bluth, QB, 5-10, 145, Sr.; Steve Smith, C, 6-1, 190, C;  Armando Lopez, OT, 6-0, 247, Sr.; Mike Roth, TE, 6-0, 170, Jr.; Scott  D'Antuono, LB, 6-1, 161, Sr.; Travis Thompson, FS, 6-2, 165, Sr.; Joe Lee, NG,  5-9, 225, Jr.; Bill Thomas, DT, 6-4, 205, DT and Coulter Marshall, DE, 6-1,  171, Jr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Bill McAdam, WR/DB, 6-4, 195, Sr.; Paul Algarin, FB, 5-11, 173,  Jr.; Danny Hickey, DT, 6-3, 192, Sr. and James Capellino, RB, 5-4, 180, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Rick Jones replaced Carl Sweet only 10 weeks before the '89 season  opener and the results were predictable; El Dorado scored three touchdowns in  10 losses. "I was still trying to figure out personnel in midseason," Jones  said. "Hopefully, we've learned and grown from last year. Now, we have to learn  how to win." Bluth started five games last year and D'Antuono will be the  defensive captain. The good news is that El Dorado's freshman team was 8-2 and  league champion last year, so help is on the way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Esperanza  </P> <P> Coach: Gary Meek (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 6-5, 3-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 23  </P> <P> Returning starters: Six on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Keith McDonald, QB, 6-2, 205, Sr.; Mike Burns, LB, 6-3, 235,  Sr.; Jarod Smith, WB, 5-10, 170, Sr.; Mark Parlin, LB/FB, 6-1, 225, Sr.;  Gerrick Emry, FB/LB, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Reid Pullen, TE/DE, 6-2, 207, Sr.; Chad  Richter, OT, 6-2, 240, OT, Rich Gutierrez, 6-0, 240, Sr.; Ian Stewart, C, 5-10,  203, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Josh Gale, DE/HB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Jason Long, DB/WR, 5-11, 170,  Jr.; Chad Madrick, OT/DT, 6-3, 223, Jr.; Travis Kirschle, DT/OG, 6-3, 225, So.;  Al Medyn, DT/OT, 6-2, 230, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: After three average seasons, Esperanza should return to championship  form with some of the county's top skilled-position players and a strong  defense. Meek anticipates McDonald passing 20 times per game and compares the  two-year starter to El Toro's Rob Johnson. Burns is the team's most heavily  recruited player and reminds Meek of former Mission Viejo star linebacker John  Pease. Burns missed five games last year with torn ligaments in his ankle but  has fully recovered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Katella  </P> <P> Coach: Larry Anderson (fourth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-6-1, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: Two on offense, two on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Chris Reed, QB, 6-2, 180, Sr.; Dennis Briggs, SS, 5-11, 170,  Sr.; Art Vance, WR/FS, 5-11, 160, Sr.; Eric Hicks, CB, 5-10, 170, Sr.; T.J.  Fletcher, FB, 5-9, 170, Sr.; Vince Farace, DE, 6-1, 250, Jr.; Bryan Castro, LB,  5-7, 160, Jr. and Johnny Bowers, 5-10, 175, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Ryan Irving, TB, 5-7, 160, Jr.; Jim Gladwin, C, 5-10, 190, So.;  Steve Rutherford, OG, 5-10, 205, Jr.; Scott Joest, OG, 5-11, 200, Jr.; Steve  Young, TE, 6-1, 180, Sr. and Gary Henessey, FB, 5-10, 170, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Reed will start the opening two games at quarterback after two-year  starter Dennis Briggs quit the team last spring and then changed his mind.  "Dennis wanted to concentrate on baseball, then decided he made an error,"  Anderson said. "I felt I owed Reed two games as the starting quarterback." Last  year's offensive line graduated and five juniors off a 4-6 sophomore team will  start. Katella starts two speedsters, Vance and Irving, off its track team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loara  </P> <P> Coach: John deFries (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 8-2-1, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, two on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Carl Habis, C/NG, 5-11, 202, Sr.; Bryant Jackson, OG, 6-1, 298,  Jr.; David Kang, 5-9, 180, FB/DE; Charlie Gipson, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Brian  Blanks, CB, 5-11, 165, Jr. and John Carrer, TE/DE, 6-2, 190, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Sean Carne, OT/DT, 5-9, 206, Sr.; Kirk Arnold, OT, 6-0, 210,  Sr.; Dan Bokelman, WR/SS, 5-7, 145, Sr.; Jason Wright, LB, 6-1, 220, Jr. and  Jason Ortiz, LB, 5-11, 183, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: DeFries, a seven-year assistant line coach at Rancho Santiago College,  replaces Herb Hill, who was the county's winningest coach when he resigned.  DeFries, on the transition to high school football: "You're a part-time parent,  baby-sitter, academic adviser and personal counselor besides being a coach.  It's a lot more work." Six players off a 9-1 league championship sophomore team  will start, including Jason Wright, younger brother of former all-county  linebacker Chris Wright. Loara has more players (62) than any team in the  league, but nine starters will go both ways.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P> <P> Coach: John Barnes (12th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 9-2, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 23  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Tyler Cashman, WR, 6-4, 210, Sr.; Ed Leiva, LB, 5-11, 215, Sr.;  LaQuan Beckton, TB, 5-9, 200, Sr.; John Collins, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Justin  Stewart, OG, 6-2, 220, Sr.; Kevin Kropf, OT, 6-3, 205, Sr.; Matt Ragland, OG,  6-2, 225, Sr.; Ryan Eagle, DT, 6-1, 235, Sr.; Aaron Garrido, DE, 6-2, 190, DE;  Josh Beeney, CB, 5-9, 170, Sr. and Eric Wallace, PK, 6-0, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Andrew Fuentes, WR, 5-9, 185, Sr.; Ed Dominguez, C, 5-11, 205,  Jr.; George Segan, FS, 6-1, 185, So. and Alex Lin, LB, 6-1, 205, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Barnes is predicting that Collins, a converted flanker, will be the  school's next successful quarterback following J.T. Snow, Tom Williamson and  Todd Gragnano. "He scrambles well and throws very well," Barnes said. Collins,  a honor student, led Los Alamitos to the championship of the 20-team Cerritos  College passing tournament. Cashman is being recruited by USC, Penn State and  Miami.  </P></p>

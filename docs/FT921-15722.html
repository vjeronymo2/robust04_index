			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Invoice errors cost Whitehall Pounds 2.7m GOVERNMENT departments have been overcharged by millions of pounds through invoice errors by Whitehall's main equipment supplier, including a Pounds 6,100 demand for a job that cost Pounds 61. In a catalogue of criticisms aimed at PSA Services, the National Audit Office complains in a report published yesterday of charging errors, a failure to recover costs satisfactorily and weaknesses in operating a stock control system for supplying security filing equipment to Whitehall. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general and head of the NAO, the main watchdog on government spending, has qualified his certification of the 1990-91 PSA Services accounts because demands for Pounds 65.6m of work incurred have not been accepted by the agency's clients. The NAO estimates that customers, mainly government departments, were overcharged by up to Pounds 4.7m by PSA Services, formerly the Property Services Agency and currently a candidate for privatisation. Sir John said his examination of charges to customers for directly employed labour revealed 'a high level of error' both in the number of errors found and their scale. Two examples given are an actual charge of Pounds 61 for replacing a cistern that was invoiced at Pounds 6,100, and an actual charge of Pounds 20 for rewashering taps that had been invoiced at Pounds 920. On the sample examined, the audit office found 1,100 errors valued at Pounds 1.1m. 'On this basis, I estimate the total level of error to be Pounds 2.7m . . . but the overcharging may have ranged from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 4.7m,' Sir John says. PSA Services argued it would not be economic or practical to identify and repay to customers many of the overcharges, and with Treasury agreement, Pounds 2.7m has been surrendered to the government's consolidated fund. The report also highlights discrepancies of Pounds 5.7m over the provision of security furniture, such as locks, safes and filing cabinets, for securing classified Whitehall documents. There was no question of a security risk or unauthorised access to classified material in sensitive departments, such as defence and the Cabinet Office, as codes and lock combinations were not kept. However, the stock control and financial accounting system governing the purchase, storage, issue and charging for the equipment had severe teething problems. An internal audit found poor management control and unreliable data, and an inexperienced officer had virtually unlimited control of the system and was not effectively supervised.</p>

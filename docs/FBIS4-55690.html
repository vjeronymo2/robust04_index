			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(mfs)": "The State Guarantees Have Made It </F> Possible To Obtain Better Credit"]    [Text] Prague--Of the overall budgeted costs, amounting to  68.8 billion korunas [Kc], for the completion of the Temelin  nuclear power plant [JETE], a total of Kc35.1 billion had been  invested by the end of last year.    In this context, Miroslav Novak, director of communications  at the Czech Energy Enterprises [CEZ] power company, which is  the investor for the JETE project, told a CESKY DENIK reporter  that the final budgeted costs, even with the implementation of  the U.S. safety system from the Westinghouse company, should in  no way exceed the sum of Kc70 billion. The Czech Government's  state guarantees for the delivery of automatic control systems  and nuclear fuel for the first two JETE blocks amount to Kc12.2  billion. This involves, first and foremost, a loan from  Citibank, with a guarantee from the U.S. EXIM bank and the  Belgian ON'D. The state guarantees made it possible to obtain a  longer-term dollar credit with a date of maturity of 14 years  given the lower interest of up to 5 percent. The other costs,  apart from the loan from Investicni banka [Investment Bank]  amounting to Kc1.1 billion, which is already more than half  exhausted, come from CEZ's own resources.</p>

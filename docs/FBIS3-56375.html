This Was How Boris Yeltsin  and Bill Clinton Assessed Their Talks in Moscow"]    [Text] All's well that ends well. In accordance with this  Russian popular saying, the participants in the Russian-U.S.  summit completed their dialogue with a whole range of joint  documents. As Boris Yeltsin said at the press conference, the  aim was to "get a result."    The list of agreements and statements signed indicates that  relations between Moscow and Washington have now indeed entered  the phase of mature strategic global partnership in all spheres.  The fundamental element in this partnership is enshrined in  particular in the Moscow Declaration signed by the presidents,  which, as Boris Yeltsin said, "reflects and enshrines the  historical improvement in Russian-U.S. relations in Eurasia and  the world as a whole." The two countries' cooperation in  strengthening strategic stability and security is also given new  substance. "A milestone that it proved possible to overcome in  Moscow was the adoption of a decision leading to the elimination  of nuclear weapons in Ukraine," Boris Yeltsin said. He  described this decision by the Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian  presidents as an "historic document from which everyone stands  to gain, particularly the Ukrainian people." The accord on  eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine saves money, removes  disagreements, sets other countries a good example, and bolsters  the Russian-U.S. statement on the nonproliferation of  mass-destruction weapons.    The lofty assessment of the "Partnership for Peace"  initiative adopted at the NATO Council in Brussels recently was  also evidence of the harmony between Russia and the United  States. Bill Clinton briefed his Russian partners at the talks  on the content of this initiative. The Russian president  pointed out that this initiative contains the "beginnings of  Russian-U.S. joint activity." It precludes the argument of  unequal security and the possibility of new demarcation lines  forming "from Vancouver to Vladivostok." The Russian side sees  this idea as "one, but not, of course, the only scenario for the  development of a new Europe." Yeltsin expressed willingness to  "fill this channel for cooperation with concrete substance."  The U.S. President also agreed to that approach. "I came to  Europe in the hope of starting to build new security based on a  common commitment to democracy, a free economy, and mutual  respect for security and territorial borders," he said at a  press conference. "I dream of Europe being politically and  economically integrated from the security viewpoint." Bill  Clinton confirmed that the United States wants "to be an equal  partner in relations with Russia." Backing Boris Yeltsin's  reformist course, particularly in the social sphere, and noting  that Russia is a great country, the U.S. President said that  "the whole world and Europe want Russia to be successful in its  reforms."    The concerted approach was also backed up by specific  actions. The heads of the two states made pointed statements in  support of human rights and on nuclear weapons nonproliferation,  while the leaders of the foreign policy departments ratified  with their signatures several agreements improving cooperation  between the two countries in the sphere of public health,  environmental protection, and air transport, as well as a  memorandum on export controls.</p>

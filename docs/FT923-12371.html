			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Would leaving the ERM help Britain? How the economists line up 'THE ERM is not working as Britain thought it would. The plan was that low inflation would bring low interest rates and lead to prosperity. But due to the special circumstances of German unification we have high interest rates throughout Europe, which are inappropriate given the weak economies of many countries. 'With the UK still in recession, most economists would agree that base rates at 10 per cent are too high. Britain should cut interest rates by 2 percentage points and see what happens. If the pound fell below its ERM limit, and direct intervention failed to move sterling back within its bands, then the UK should either devalue or leave the system altogether. In Britain at the moment, as in other countries such as France and Denmark, all you get for lower inflation is more pain.' 'I DO NOT accept that a reduction in inflation takes 100 per cent priority over other objectives. There is an alternative to existing policies. There is no sign of any recovery in the economy and unemployment is still rising. I don't believe there will ever be a recovery fast enough to reduce unemployment if there is not both a devaluation and a reduction in interest rates. 'I deny that a devaluation, if large enough, would result in higher interest rates. If the ERM is an obstacle to devaluation, Britain should withdraw. Experience does not support the view that devaluations are ineffective. The depreciation of the early 1980s was accompanied by falling inflation and improved competitiveness. Devaluation would add something to inflation but perhaps not all that much with unemployment so high and rising.' 'MEMBERSHIP of the ERM has been used to prolong the biggest monetary squeeze in Britain since the 1930s. Britain needs a cut in interest rates of at least 3 percentage points. To allow this, Britain should suspend its agreement to support sterling within the ERM. That would mean allowing sterling to fall to a value set by the market. We must get away from the idea that there is a 'correct' value for the pound. Other European countries would perhaps try to make us feel guilty. 'But Britain has got to be tough and follow its national interests. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might well be damaged by a decision to leave the ERM. But they are faced with a tough choice: either pull out or end up in a nasty situation due to the deteriorating economy.' 'REALIGNMENT of sterling within the ERM would make things worse. History shows that currencies realigning downwards in the ERM have higher interest rates. Floating the pound is a more serious option. But with government budget and balance of payments deficits and underlying inflation over 4 per cent at present, the UK would have to take tough measures to gain credibility for such a policy on the foreign exchange markets. 'So staying where we are is the least worst option. But if the recession intensifies, while German rates stay high, Britain will need to find a way of decoupling UK rates from those in Germany. The best way would be to float the D-Mark until the strains of unification have subsided. If that proves politically impossible, floating the pound may yet have to be reconsidered.' 'TO ONE side in this debate, floating exchange rates possess magical qualities: to the other side fixed rates are an absolute imperative. Such disputes are theological. Policy should depend on the practical circumstances of the time. It was right for sterling to join the ERM at a testing exchange rate. Without this we could not have reduced inflation. 'But now it is falling, it is dangerous to stick with this same policy, when the risk facing Britain is not inflation but slump. The best solution would be a D-Mark revaluation. Britain should be working for this behind the scenes. It was dismaying to hear Mr Major apparently ruling this out. Failing this, if by December the UK economy shows no recovery, German rates show no sign of coming down and UK inflation is low and falling then we should devalue.' 'THE LBS remains strongly opposed to a devaluation in itself. But in the circumstances of the recession, a case can be made for combining devaluation with a large cut in the public sector borrowing requirement. This package was ruled out for electoral reasons, but may now be politically feasible. 'Our (economic) model simulations suggest that the benefits of devaluation, even with the above measures, are far from clear. But devaluation may also be consistent with low inflation provided that the PSBR cuts are deep enough and if credibility can be helped by an independent Bank of England. Since political pressure for devaluation may increase if the ERM comes under strain, this increases the case for giving priority to an independent Bank and fiscal consolidation.' 'A FREE float for sterling, which would succeed in getting base rates markedly lower, would now be such a political setback for the chancellor and the prime minister that it would only be contemplated in the most extreme economic circumstances, probably involving a systematic collapse in the financial sector. 'These dire circumstances have not arrived yet, and are unlikely to do so until next year at the earliest. The outlook is for continuing political discontent, but discontent which is not powerful enough to force any of the possible ERM resolutions in the near term. This is likely to leave the financial markets permanently fretting that a sterling devaluation or free float may be just around the corner until there is much firmer evidence of economic recovery.' 'IF BRITAIN left the ERM, overseas investors would find it difficult to trust the UK government's word in the future. Without the promise of government action to support sterling, the pound would lose its friends in the investor community. The large selling of sterling would force much higher UK interest rates. Without these, there would be the danger of the pound falling so low that it became a non-currency. 'Britain must stick with the ERM, taking the French route of gradually building up credibility in its currency. German interest rates are going to remain high for some time because of the circumstances of unification. Britain has had two years of recession. We may have to go through a few more years of penance to atone for the high borrowing boom conditions of the late 1980s.'</p>

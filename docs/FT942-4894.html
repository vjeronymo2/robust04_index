			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Advance in profits at Axel Springer Axel Springer, publisher of the German title Die Welt and the mass circulation Bild daily, yesterday reported a rise in profits for 1993, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. Group profits rose from DM57.2m in 1992 to DM71.4m (Dollars 42.2m). However, turnover dipped by 1 per cent to DM3.44bn. This was partly blamed on a 4 per cent fall in advertising revenue, to DM1.52bn. Sales to eastern Germany also weakened. Overall, total newspaper turnover rose 2.8 per cent to DM1.06bn. The company invested DM229.9m, compared with DM409.8m the previous year, when it was acquiring new titles. Last year, it also introduced a restructuring programme aimed at cutting costs. Gustav &amp; Grete Schickedanz Holding is selling its 97 per cent interest in brewer Patrizier Braeu, Reuter reports from Nuremberg.</p>

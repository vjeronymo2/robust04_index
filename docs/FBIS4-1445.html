			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Plan and Economy Minister Augustin </F> Ngirabatware by Eugene Lambene in Libreville on 27 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Ngirabatware] I brought a message from the  president of the Republic, which I delivered yesterday, and I am  going on to another African country. However, I am not on an  African tour. This is not a media campaign because we do not  have the time yet to undertake such actions. It is absolutely  necessary for us to explain some issues concerning the political  and military situation in our country. The Rwandan Patriotic  Front's [RPF] media campaign and that of its acolytes is such  that -- if I can say so -- the world has received information  solely from the RPF which, we know, is often full of lies. Our  experiences gained since the beginning of the war in October  1990 can testify to this.    [Lambene] What is your government saying about the  massacres?    [Ngirabatware] The RPF is directly and indirectly  responsible  for these massacres. Undeniably, the RPF -- probably with  external support -- assassinated President Habyarimana. All the  other massacres that followed in Rwanda and the ethnic troubles  originated from the assassination of the president of the  Republic. A private radio in Rwanda had mentioned the  assassination plot earlier and people (?argued) that the  president knew very well that he was being trailed and that he  was running the risk of falling victim to a very fatal  assassination plot. The only difference is that he never knew  whether it was going to happen on the road, in his house, in the  office, or in the air. At any rate, people never thought of it  happening in an aircraft, especially as Kigali International  Airport and its suburbs were under the control of the Belgian  contingents of the UN peacekeeping force.    [Lambene] Investigations are going on. Are there any facts  so far to establish which side is responsible?    [Ngirabatware] Up until now, the Rwandan Government has not  accused any side. However, many factors can be put together to  establish that the RPF, with the support of others, is  responsible for this assassination.    [Lambene] Which supporters, for example?    [Ngirabatware] We cannot mention them just like that, but  what we do know is that the RPF's military equipment does not  include SAM-7 missiles which were used in killing the president  of the Republic. We also know that the RPF does not have  specialists who can handle such missiles and we have noticed  that on the battlefield even white soldiers were counted among  the dead. So, there is other external support apart from the  usual support from Uganda. Certainly, the RPF has other  supporters, probably mercenaries or supporters from other  circles.    [Lambene] Presently, the massacres are continuing in the  field and unfortunately enough, they will continue further. The  problem is, it is easy to enter a civil war but it is very  difficult to get out of it. What steps have you taken to get  out of it?    [Ngirabatware] Getting out of this civil war in Rwanda will  be a complex issue. We are saying this because, now, the  civilians are clearly behind the soldiers, behind the Rwandan  Armed Forces. This means that, even if a great number of  civilians are armed with cut and thrust weapons and with modern  weapons, the ultimate goal of this provisional government is to  get out of this conflict. The first objective of the present  transitional government headed by Prime Minister (Jean Kambanda)  is to renegotiate with the RPF to which he has offered a  cease-fire. Second, we want to bring peace to the country  because there is fire on almost all the hills of Rwanda. We  adhere entirely to the Arusha peace agreements even if there are  still imperfections in this agreement. Nevertheless, we believe  that it is only through negotiation and peace that lasting peace  can be achieved in Rwanda. We are also telling the RPF to cease  fire first and to let us sit around the same negotiating table  so that we can talk about peace again in Rwanda, especially as  the government is convinced that the RPF cannot take power in  Rwanda by the force of arms.

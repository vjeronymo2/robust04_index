			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DOLLY'S HUBBY AVOIDS LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> It's been 24 years since Dolly Parton and her husband, Carl Dean, have appeared  together on stage, and that's the way he wants it.  </P> <P> Her Dec. 21 Christmas special on ABC, "Dolly Parton . . . Christmas at Home,"  will include her mother, father, six brothers, five sisters, about a dozen  aunts and uncles and 15 or so nieces and nephews -- but not her husband.  </P> <P> "He's very shy, and not the least bit interested in show business," she says in  next week's TV Guide.  </P> <P> They last appeared together in 1966, the year they were married, when Parton  had to attend a music awards ceremony in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Carl rented a tuxedo for the night, and I won an award for best song of the  year," she said. "But when we got home, he said, 'Dolly, I think you're  terrific and talented, and I wish you the best, but don't ever ask me to  anything like that again.' "  </P> <P> Dean does not accompany Parton on the road, preferring to remain in Nashville,  where he owns an asphalt-paving business.  </P></p>

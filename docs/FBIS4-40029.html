			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 June broadcast the nine-minute  "Details" program which is presented by Nikolay Svanidze, and  reports on the news conference given by President Yeltsin on 10  June. It includes brief interviews given to Svanidze by  Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar, Gennadiy Burbulis, former  Security Council state secretary, and Deputy Prime Minister  Anatoliy Chubays. The video is confined to these items.    Gaydar is asked why the reform process appeared to slacken  in  the summer of 1992 when he was Russian prime minister. He  replies that a "powerful anti-reform coalition" had emerged at  that time arguing for money to be pumped into the economy as a  way out of the crisis. He points out that inflation was at the  same level in 1994 as it was then and output was down by 30  percent. He asserts his faith in the need for reform.    Burbulis is asked if he has any advice to give Yeltsin  today,  and he says he would tell him not to listen to those who were  saying that "those young democrats, including Burbulis, know  nothing and are not capable of doing anything and cannot be  trusted behind your back. I would try my best to warn Boris  Nikolayich Yeltsin against those well-wishing loudmouths who, in  my opinion, have already been very successful in their work."    Burbulis is then asked if a recent press report by  correspondent Fedor Burlatskiy alleging that "the decision to  divide up the USSR was made by a few young politicians, namely  yourself and Shakhray, in a bath house" is true. He replies  that he was impressed by Burlatskiy's ability to hide under a  bath house bench and imitate a tub, and adds that "no one could  ever have thought up a formula for bringing down the Soviet  Union. The Soviet Union fell apart."    Chubays, interviewed in a corridor, is asked for his  reaction  to Yeltsin's statement that he should leave Moscow Mayor Yuriy  Luzhkov in charge of privatization in the capital. Chubays  says: "Everything is okay. The situation is like this: I am  sure that the transfer of authority over privatization to the  mayor of Moscow will lead to all those dramatic results that are  already taking place in Moscow today, and will naturally now be  intensified. Therefore, I believe that the results will be  serious, but my position is clear -- I submit to the president."    Svanidze then asks Chubays if Yeltsin's statement at the  news  conference was a surprise. He replies: "Of course not, of  course not."</p>

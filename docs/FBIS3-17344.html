This was stated by Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul  Guliyev at today's session of the Republic's National Assembly  (Parliament). The session continued to discuss the tragic  incidents in Baku in January 1990.    According to the parliament chairman, the involvement of  these two former high-ranking officials in the Baku massacre has  been proven. The archives that came to light show that on the  night of 20 January 1990 Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, the first  secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist  Party, was in the headquarters of the Army unit stationed in  Baku and, together with the former Soviet Defense Minister  Dmitriy Yazov and the former Soviet Interior Minister Vadim  Bakatin, directed the deployment of the special purpose  detachments in the Azerbaijani capital.    The investigation has also revealed that Ayaz Mutalibov  asked  the former Soviet leadership to urgently send an additional  contingent to Baku. The dispatch of this contingent resulted in  a greater tragedy. Mutalibov exploited the situation to take  power.    Claims to the effect that the Republic's leadership was  unaware of the introduction of a state of emergency and the  deployment of troops in Baku were also exposed as lies. The  documents and witnesses attest that they knew of these  developments a day before the tragedy.</p>

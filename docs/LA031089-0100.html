			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHARGED WITH STEALING PETS FOR EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> Prosecutors filed felony charges Wednesday against three San Fernando Valley  residents accused of luring pet owners into giving away dogs and cats that were  then sold to medical laboratories.  </P> <P> Subsequently, most of the animals died in experiments at the laboratories,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Barbara Ann Ruggiero, 25, Frederick John Spero, 43, both of Sylmar, and Ralf  Jacobsen, 25, of Chatsworth were charged with 40 counts of felony theft of an  animal for medical research purposes and with conspiracy to steal an animal for  medical research, Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman Montrose said.  </P> <P> The three were charged with 73 misdemeanor theft and conspiracy charges Sept.  8. However, those charges are expected to be dismissed when the three  defendants appear for arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court on March 16,  Montrose said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Felony Charges  </P> <P> The felony charges were filed at the request of Ruggiero and her attorney,  Robert Swanson, Montrose said. Deputy City Atty. Norman T. Wegener, one of the  prosecutors in the case, said the stepped-up charges have some potential  advantages for the defendants.  </P> <P> Wegener said the felony charges entitle the defendants to a preliminary  hearing, which would give them a chance to have some of the charges against  them dismissed before going to trial. But Wegener said that if convicted of the  felony charges, the defendants could face stiffer penalties.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Jacobsen and Spero said the felony charges were filed over their  clients' objections.  </P> <P> The defendants were scheduled to appear for arraignment Thursday, but Ruggiero  and her attorney were not present.  </P> <P> Ruggiero, the owner of two defunct Sun Valley kennels, along with Spero  operated Biosphere, a company licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to  sell animals for medical research.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that Ruggiero and Spero hired Jacobsen to obtain animals for  free that were then sold to three Southern California research facilities for  as much as $500 apiece.  </P> <P> Jacobsen got the animals by responding to classified advertisements offering  free pets to good homes, according to prosecutors.  </P></p>

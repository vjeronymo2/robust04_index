			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER TO OFFER AIR BAGS ON ITS MINIVANS IN EARLY '91  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. said Monday that it would start equipping its minivans with  optional driver-side air bags in February, becoming the first U.S. auto maker  to offer the safety devices on the popular vehicles.  </P> <P> For customers who don't want them, Chrysler will refund $500.  </P> <P> From Feb. 1 to March 31, Chrysler will offer minivans with driver-side air  bags. Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said it hasn't been announced what will  be done after that.  </P> <P> Chrysler could make the devices standard equipment, keep them as options or  discontinue their availability.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the company began an incentive program Monday with a $500 cash  rebate offer for buyers of 1991 model Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager series  minivans through the end of January.  </P> <P> Through Dec. 10 of this year, Chrysler's minivan sales have dropped 4% from  last year, to 346,944. Chrysler holds 43% of the minivan market.  </P> <P> Chrysler made driver-side air bags standard equipment starting with its 1990  cars. General Motors Corp. makes them standard on about 15 car lines, while  Ford Motor Co. puts driver-side air bags on its major lines, or about 1 million  cars.  </P> <P> The federal government, which requires automatic seat belts or air bags in cars  being made today, will require passive restraint systems in light trucks by the  1995 model year. Minivans fall under that category.  </P></p>

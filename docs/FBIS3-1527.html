Mrs. Mferri Bongo joined the government in June 1991, when  she took over the post held by Ali Bongo, another one of  President Omar Bongo's children.    In the cabinet formed by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba on  25  March, former Mines Minister Jean Ping became the new foreign  minister. However, the title of his post is simply "minister of  foreign affairs and cooperation," while that of Mrs. Mferri  Bongo used to be "minister of foreign affairs, cooperation, and  francophone affairs."</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rights issue for BK Vision BK VISION, the Swiss investment holding company specialising in financial companies, is raising SFr220m (Dollars 151m) in its second rights issue in less than a year. BK, which was formed by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank in October 1991, recently attracted attention by contesting decisions by the board of Union Bank of Switzerland. BK is the largest UBS shareholder with a 15 per cent stake worth SFr820m. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, manager of BK, said that the rights issue would enable the company to increase its investments and would increase the liquidity of its shares. The issue is on the basis of one for every five registered or bearer shares held at 220 per cent of nominal values; that is, SFr1,100 for each new bearer share and SFr220 for each new registered share. The net asset value of BK, which also holds shares in Zurich Insurance and Leu Holding, has jumped from SFr728m when its last rights issue was launched in August, 1992 to SFr1.27bn (SFr1,273 per bearer share) on Friday. Mr Schiltknecht said BK believed that financial shares would continue to perform well. The economies of most industrialised countries were bottoming out, interest rates would continue to fall and restructuring in the banking sector was accelerating. He said trading in BK shares had picked up significantly in recent months, partly in response to the company beginning to market itself in Germany, and the directors were uneasy about the price of the bearer share, at SFr1,275, being so close to the net asset value. BK's strategy, which has aroused controversy in Swiss financial circles, is to hold significant stakes in a small number of financial institutions with a view to having some influence on their strategic direction. Early this year, the company publicly objected to the decisions of the UBS board to evict a director and to create new capital that could be used without prior shareholder authorisation. In its latest interim report to April 30, BK said only that it regretted the UBS decisions. Mr Schiltknecht said yesterday that the directors were still assessing what, if any, further action to take.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bulmer to distribute Amstel AMSTEL LAGER, one of Europe's top five selling beers, is to be distributed for the first time in the UK next year by HP Bulmer, the cider maker. Heineken, which owns the Dutch lager, has appointed Bulmer sole UK distributor of Amstel, which will be launched into the take-home sector early next year with an on-trade launch in 1995. Amstel will be an important addition to Bulmer's expanding portfolio of premium lager brands which already includes San Miguel, Red Stripe and DAB, and further strengthens the cider market leader's position in the beer market. The new agreement will also help compensate Bulmer for the loss of the Perrier and Buxton mineral water distribution agreement in the UK from March next year. Bulmer, which retains distribution rights to the fast growing Volvic mineral water brand, lost the Perrier brands distribution agreement to Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages after Nestle's acquisition of Perrier last year. Commenting on the Amstel agreement, Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said, 'Amstel is one of Europe's most famous beer brands with a long established heritage. 'Heineken's choice of Bulmers as sole UK distributor and agent is an endorsement of our marketing, sales and distribution skills and further proof of our reputation and track record in the promotion of new brands in the UK market.' Amstel, which is sold in 60 markets worldwide, has been sold in the UK for the past 12 months on a limited basis through a specialist off licence chain and has reportedly achieved high rates of sale.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / West balks at UN call for more troops: Extra forces sought to help monitor Serb withdrawal from Sarajevo Western European governments yesterday shied away from a United Nations request to send more troops to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The uncertainty over plans to reinforce UN troops came as Russia hardened its opposition to Nato air strikes to enforce the withdrawal of Serbian positions around the city, and the collection of heavy artillery. General Sir Michael Rose, the British UN commander based in Sarajevo, wants an immediate addition of 3,000 troops to help monitor the collection of weapons held by Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government forces, supervise their storage, and demilitarise the city. More than 30,000 UN troops are based in the former Yugoslavia, the majority in UN-protected areas in Croatia. The withdrawal and collection of all heavy artillery pieces must be completed by midnight on Sunday, otherwise the UN commanders on the ground can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. British and French officials were last night reluctant to commit any more troops, while Washington and London believed 'several thousands of ground troops' would be required to act as peacekeepers once the city has been demilitarised. The US has no ground troops in the former Yugoslavia. In London, British officials said Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had not yet decided whether to redeploy some of the 2,500 troops already based in Bosnia, or send additional forces. A Downing Street spokesman said last night that 'nothing could be ruled out', but would not confirm if a decision would be made at a cabinet meeting today. Mr Hurd told the BBC from Moscow: 'There must be a fair division of responsibilities - we have carried out really more than our fair share.' In Paris, Mr Richard Duque, the French foreign ministry spokesman, said the government had no plans to bolster its forces. France, with the largest contingent, has 6,000 troops in the former Yugoslavia, of which 2,000 are based in Sarajevo, about 2,000 in other parts of Bosnia, and the remainder in Croatia. The Dutch government said its 2,400 troops were more than proportionate to the size of the Netherlands. Military experts in London and Paris said any delay in responding to Gen Rose's request would be seen as 'weakness' on the part of the west Europeans, adding that reinforcements could be quickly redeployed from Croatia. These would, however, have to be replaced to prevent Serb or Croat forces exploiting a vacuum. 'We have to maintain the momentum,' an adviser to Nato said, adding that any large-scale demilitarisation of Sarajevo would require tens of thousands of troops. In Moscow, Mr Sergei Lavrov, a deputy foreign minister, told parliament that the Nato ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw artillery or face strikes was 'illegitimate and contradictory to UN decisions'. Mr Lavrov said Mr Yuri Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to Nato, had been instructed to object to air strikes if the guns were not removed before the deadline.</p>

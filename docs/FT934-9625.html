			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Refugees total up by 10,000 a day WORLD refugee numbers increased by 10,000 a day last year, according to a report published yesterday by Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Overall refugee numbers have risen from 2.5m in 1970 to 18.2m at the start of this year. The report, 'The State of the World's Refugees', says the numbers refer only to those who have become internationally recognised refugees by crossing an international border. At least 24m are 'displaced persons', who have fled their homes but are still within the borders of their own countries. Taking those into account, 'roughly one in every 130 people on earth has been forced into flight'. Increasingly, UNHCR is involved in trying to protect internally displaced people as well as transnational refugees (operations in northern Iraq and Bosnia are best known examples). But its concept of prevention, outlined in the report, goes further. While insisting on refugees' right to asylum (UNHCR's traditional focus), the report recognises 'the climate of receptivity for refugees has cooled in many asylum countries'. The causes of refugee movements must now be addressed, it says, or the foundations of international protection could be 'overwhelmed, if only by sheer numbers of claimants'. UNHCR has adopted a strategy of 'comprehensive response' which, instead of simply protecting refugees after they have fled, seeks to address all the problems which cause them to flee, and which make it difficult or impossible for them to go back. Examples described in the report include the 'plan of action' for Vietnam, the 'success story' in Cambodia and the 'integrated approach' in Tajikistan. This strategy emphasises 'the need to strengthen the state's responsibility for its own citizens', with human rights 'the link between state responsibility and the international agenda'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazunori Ishiguro in the Point of Argument </F> column: "Time To Review `Special Consideration Given to U.S.'"]    [Text] It is necessary to consider future Japan-U.S. trade  friction in terms of the period beginning around the time of the  "breakdown" of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February.    The problem is a U.S. trade policy that insists on  establishing numerical targets (or results-oriented policy).    Through the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, the United  States strongly pressed Japan to increase its share of  foreign-made (in actuality, American-made) semiconductors to 20  percent, and somehow that target was achieved.    As a result, the United States has sought to apply this  approach to all areas. Japan strongly opposed this, resulting in  the "breakdown" of the summit talks.    After Japan said "no," it was perplexed about how to  proceed.  Perhaps this was because it was not used to saying no. In any  event, a kind of "scapegoat hunt" began.    From the United States came the view that the bureaucrats  were to blame, and in Japan there was a related trend.    While this was going on, Japan-U.S. friction over cellular  phones, which had been smoldering since last summer, suddenly  flared up. The United States began brandishing the U.S. Omnibus  Trade Law's Super 301 clause (the so-called telecommunications  clause). And in the end, on 12 March, like Pavlov's dog, Japan  swallowed U.S. demands, bringing a "resolution" to the problem.    In this course of events, however, there are some important  matters that are being half forgotten. First, Japanese  bureaucrats are not the only ones who have been strongly opposed  to a trade policy based on numerical targets. Last September, a  group of Japanese and American economists, centered around an  American, Professor Bagwati of Columbia University, issued to  Japanese and U.S. leaders a letter strongly opposing a policy of  managed trade. Then, this January, there was a declaration to  the same effect from a subcommittee, to which I belong, of the  Industrial Structure Council, the body that issues the "Unfair  Trade Report." And subsequently, a similar declaration was  issued by a group of Japanese economists, legal scholars and  others.    It was in this context that the "breakdown" of the summit  talks occurred. To the extent that the United States insisted on  a trade policy based on numerical targets, the "breakdown" was a  natural outcome and unavoidable. For Japan to have pliantly  compromised would clearly have been contrary to the spirit of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which is the  same as the free trade philosophy of the World Trade  Organization (WTO).    Here it is necessary to thoroughly consider the meaning of  the "resolution" to the cellular phone friction. This friction  arose directly from the contention that the investment plan of  IDO, a private Japanese company, was inadequate for popularizing  the Motorola type of cellular phone in Japan. In the evolution  of this friction, Japan and the United States had signed an  agreement in 1989 whose main purpose was to allocate additional  frequencies for the sake of the Motorola-type phone (different  from the existing NTT type). The United States now claimed that  this agreement had been violated.    No matter how much you read this document, however, you'll  find nothing written in it other than that the above-mentioned  allocation of new frequencies must be based on: transparency,  national treatment, equal market access (comparable market  access), and non-discriminatory principles.    Based on the words "equal market access," the United States  contended that, if the same market share as held by the NTT type  of phone was not immediately secured for the Motorola type, it  would be a violation of the 1989 agreement--a contention that  was clearly unreasonable.    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (the ministry  that bore the brunt of the friction), through consultation with  the other related ministries, solidified its policy of  immediately bringing a case before GATT should the United States  enact sanctions against Japan through Super 301. Fully employing  the mass media, it also sought to remove the U.S.  misunderstanding. "Please read the agreement calmly," it  requested, in what was in actuality almost a scream of grief.    On 12 March, however, the two countries signed the  document--the "resolution" of this friction. It states that the  Japanese Government will take all possible measures to realize  the quite unreasonable investment plan that IDO ultimately  swallowed. Also, the Japanese Government acknowledged that this  series of disputes was "related to" implementing the 1989  agreement. That the agreement could not lead to such a  conclusion, however, was the foundation on which everything had  been predicated.    Thus, in the end, Japan not only swallowed U.S. demands for  a  trade policy based on numerical targets, but also made a strange  promise again. Using this as "unshakable proof," the United  States, at the resumption of the economic framework talks, may  again try to force Japan to swallow a policy of "numerical  targets." Should that happen, how will the new administration  respond? It is high time to calmly consider how far the momentum  of the irrational "special consideration given to the United  States" can be allowed to go.    I strongly hope that zJapan will again take a stance firmly  based on GATT principles. "The world" is now demanding more than  ever that Japan take such a resolute stance. With that in mind,  the significance of the 1994 "Unfair Trade Report," which will  soon be released, should be recognized anew.</p>

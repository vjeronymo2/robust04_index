			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: Why Jewish girls raged A PRICE BELOW RUBIES: JEWISH WOMEN AS REBELS AND RADICALS by Naomi Shepherd Weidenfeld Pounds 25, 336 pages IMAGINE European history with no royal families, no national revolts, no feudal nobility and no Christianity. Where would women come in? No queens, no revolutionaries like Joan of Arc, no martyrs, no lovely ladies wooed by chivalrous knights, and no escape into honourable celibacy for those unwilling or unable to find a husband. That, says Naomi Shepherd, is how history looked to Jewish women until the 19th century. In the small Diaspora communities, women were little more than chattels traded between families in arranged marriages; historically, they were faceless. Christian culture has romanticised biblical heroines like Judith and Esther, but they belonged to a period when Jews existed as a political entity. For centuries, Jewish society reflected rather the words of the Talmudic sage, that 'a woman before marriage is a shapeless lump, and concludes a covenant only with him who transforms her into a useful vessel'. And once married, religious law, going back to a time when rabbis had even dictated sexual habits for different workers (twice a week for labourers, once a week for ass drivers, once a month for camel drivers), dominated every aspect of private life. No wonder, then, that by the 19th century, intelligent Jewish girls were frothing with rage against their orthodox families and were among the first to embrace the revolutionary politics that promised to do away with social and sexual repression. This enlightening new book tells the story of the most extravagant and exciting of these women, and of how their Jewishness inspired and complicated their radical lives. Here is Rosa Luxembourg, the Spartacist murdered in Berlin in 1919, landing like a comet from Poland and churning revolutionary passion through the sedate socialist parties of western Europe. Here is Manya Shochat, shooting men and posting bodies to fictitious addresses in Odessa, smuggling pistols in false-bottomed suitcases across Europe, holding up wedding canopies with rifle butts, and then exporting Utopian socialism to Palestine and the first kibbutz. Here is neurotic, civilised Bertha Pappenheim, Freud's 'Anna O', unleashing her frustrated sexuality on a campaign against Jewish prostitutes. And here is the wild girl Emma Goldman, agitating for anarchy and sexual freedom in East Side New York, a symbol of terror to fascinated Americans before she was deported to Russia in 1918. Each of these lives makes a noisy, bloodcurdling and satisfying tale, through which Ms Shepherd threads her observations on the way ideology and culture translate into political action. How did revolutionary women reconcile Jewish culture with Marxist internationalism and anti-Zionism? How did reformers from within, such as Pappenheim, cope with anti-Semitic prejudice from without? How did early feminists resolve their relations with male revolutionaries? To many such questions, still relevant today, Ms Shepherd brings a firm historical perspective and an open mind. One reservation. By over-emphasising the Jewishness of her heroines, Ms Shepherd sometimes seriously loses sight of how some women saw themselves and their goals. She is indignant that Emma Goldman, pacifist and anarchist, opposes the second world war and Zionism. Luxembourg, revolutionary and feminist, was simply not interested in things Jewish; Shepherd's suggestion, that she 'suppressed' her Judaism only to seek, in her death, 'the personal sacrifice expected of the Jewish women, implicit in Jewish tradition', is nonsense. But these are small flaws in an always entertaining and original piece of social history.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL AGREES THAT MORE POLICE NEEDED  </P> <P> Concern about youth gangs in the Oakview section of the city dominated  discussion of public safety issues at the City Council's daylong study session  Friday.  </P> <P> Police Chief Ronald Lowenberg told council members that gang activity is  increasing, "but they are presently under control."  </P> <P> He added, however, that more police should be hired and a police substation  should be located in Oakview to deal with the gang problem.  </P> <P> The Oakview area is roughly bounded by Beach Boulevard, Warner and Slater  avenues and Gothard Street.  </P> <P> City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the council that preliminary budget  forecasts for next year indicate the city cannot afford all of the increased  personnel Lowenberg has requested.  </P> <P> It was not disclosed during the public session how many people Lowenberg is  seeking.  </P> <P> "As I understand what the chief was telling us, he said that if we don't do  something, we're going to lose in our efforts to keep down the gangs,"  Councilman Wes Bannister said. "I don't want to see the gang situation get out  of control."  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Silva said he spent an evening riding with a police officer and  had seen firsthand that there is a shortage of police available to handle gang  incidents.  </P> <P> The council did not vote on specific budget items at the study session. The  budget itself will not be formally presented to the council until late this  month or early June. But the council majority indicated it will be receptive to  Lowenberg's request for more police.  </P> <P> "We're going to find that money somewhere," Bannister said. "We don't want this  problem to get out of hand." BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

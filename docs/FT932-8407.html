			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Looking outside the McAlpine clan Nigel Turnbull, 50, who headed the Rosehaugh property group in the final months before it went into receivership, has resurfaced as finance director of Newarthill, which controls the privately-owned construction business of Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons. Newarthill, named after the Scottish birthplace of founder Robert McAlpine, is the bigger, but more private of the two construction companies connected with the McAlpine family. The company, which was taken private in 1989, has been hard hit by the recession and reported a Pounds 21.5m loss on turnover of Pounds 267.8m in the year to end-October 1992. Although a minority of Newarthill's shares are still publicly traded, the company has long been run along the lines of a family partnership dominated by members of the McAlpine clan. However, since the end of its financial year it has strengthened its board with two new non-executive directors - Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of BET, and George Grover, a former senior partner of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks - and it has now appointed its first finance director. The company declined to comment on the new appointment. However, it marks a return to reasonably familiar territory for Turnbull, a lawyer and chartered accountant. After a stint at Scottish merchant bankers Noble Grossart, Turnbull joined the privately-owned property and construction firm Hunting Gate Group, as financial director in June 1982. In 1991 he moved to Rosehaugh, one of the stars of the 1980's property boom, which was already in serious financial trouble. Less than a year after joining, he found himself in the chief executive's seat as part of a management reshuffle prompted by the group's increasingly worried bankers. However, attempts to refinance the group foundered and less than a year after Turnbull was made chief executive, Rosehaugh was in the hands of the receivers.</p>

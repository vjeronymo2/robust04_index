			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Peruvian police confimed  today the arrest of drug trafficker Moises Zamora, leader of the  "Zamora Brothers" gang, which regularly supplies cocaine paste  to the Colombian drug "cartels."    Zamora, aka "Uncle Mocho", was arrested on 25 May in a  luxury  apartment house located in the Miraflores residential  neighborhood in Lima. His arrest was kept secret until today so  as not to obstruct investigation proceedings.    Zamora had his base of operations in the jungle town of  Uchiza. It is located in the heart of the Huallaga valley, the  most important cocaine paste production center in the world.  Zamora sent huge cocaine shipments from Uchiza to Colombia.    Zamora's arrest was possible as a result of information  supplied by a Shining Path [SL] leader who confessed that drug  traffickers had "donated" money and guns to the Shining Path.    SL Leader Alejandro Estelita, arrested in the northern town  of Trujillo a few days before Zamora's arrest, was a member of  the "Huallaga Regional Committee" and "coordinator" of the  agreements reached between the SL and several Peruvian drug  trafficking gangs.    Estelita confessed he was in charge of collecting funds in  cash, food stuffs, guns, medicines, and vehicles that drug  traffickers supplied to the SL in exchange for protecting drug  shipments.    Estelita informed the police that during the last meeting  with Zamora, the drug trafficker handed him $25,000 for the  purchase of various supplies. Estelita added that Zamora handed  the terrorists about $100,000 per month.    In addition, Zamora assisted the terrorists in finding  hideouts and planes, to hide or flee each time the security  forces conducted antiterrorist operations in the Huallaga valley.    In compliance with the Peruvian law, Zamora will be tried  for  terrorist crimes and sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail.  This is the same sentence that was given to drug trafficker  Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," in March.    Moreover, the police presented to the press a cocaine paste  shipment of more than 500 kg, valued at $10 million that was  found on 5 June in Vainillas-Chacra San Insidro, in the Huallaga  valley.    The drug was found hidden in pits covered with excrement.  Also found hidden in the pits were nine rifles and three  machine guns. It is believed these guns belong to the Ecuadoran  security forces.    According to the police, the shipment had been stored by a  drug trafficker known as "Picaflor." He was supposed to deliver  it to the drug trafficking gang led by "Lucho Culon," one of the  Colombian cartels major cocaine suppliers.</p>

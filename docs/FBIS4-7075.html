			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  met with Canadian Governor-general Ramon J. Hnatyshyn Thursday  to discuss promoting bilateral relations.    Kim and Hnatyshyn shared the view that their nations can  cooperate closely in various fields and agreed to forge a  "special partnership."    Hnatyshyn conveyed his government's decision to waive visa  requirements for Koreans entering Canada for no more than six  months, and Kim expected that the move will boost bilateral  exchanges.    Kim explained that Seoul is studying ways to resolve the  North Korean nuclear problem peacefully while acknowledging  Canada's support for his government's position.    Hnatyshyn noted that Ottawa will continue to back Seoul's  stance.    They agreed that the domestic reforms in the two nations  pushed by their new governments will ultimately contribute to  the development and deepening of bilateral relations.    Canada, with its abundant natural resources and advanced  technology, and South Korea, which possesses human resources and  expertise in manufacturing, have complementary economic  structures and should thus develop practical links.    Hnatyshyn, the first Canadian governor-general to visit,  arrived in Seoul earlier in the day at the invitation of  President Kim and is scheduled to stay here until Monday.    Kim hosted dinner for Hnatyshyn Thursday evening.</p>

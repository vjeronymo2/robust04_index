			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dutch group aims for a promising package - Merger has created a new force in the European paper industry TOMORROW will witness the emergence of a new player in the European paper and packaging industry. KNP BT, a product of the merger of Holland's top three competitors - KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - will have annual sales of Fl 13bn (Dollars 7.2bn) and fits just behind Stora of Sweden in the European league. It will be the EC's leading paper merchant, its leading producer of fine coated papers, and a dominant player in solid board, used primarily to package fruit and vegetables. Though positioned to cash in on any upturn in the unified European market, KNP BT is emerging in a dismal economic environment. Virtually all players are suffering from over-capacity and flaccid demand, and it is unclear whether the current hopeful glimmerings will translate to more vigorous growth later this year. In 1992, each of the three partners saw their profits slump, even if none actually spilled red ink. Mr Robert van Oordt, the former Buhrmann-Tetterode chairman who is stepping up to be the new chief, admits he is 'not terribly optimistic about 1993. Next year might see an upturn.' KNP BT, whose costs are denominated in 'hard' guilders, 'can never predict such things as devaluations in Scandinavia or revaluations elsewhere. These can radically change the business overnight,' Mr van Oordt observes. KNP BT believes greater diversity through integration will insulate it against cyclical fluctuations and generate cash-flow sufficient to strengthen the balance sheet plus finance investments and acquisitions. The new group has two business arms: KNP and BT's paper and packaging production, which will be joined into a new Industry operation, and BT and VRG's complementary activities in office products, graphic paper and systems, plus information systems, which will be folded into a new trading and distribution arm. 'If you look carefully . . . a lot of what we do is paper, but certainly not the majority,' Mr van Oordt says. Only about 16 per cent of KNP BT's turnover up to the six-month point of last year came from paper production (roughly one-fifth of total operating profits); packaging output accounted for a further 30 per cent of sales and over half of profit. KNP BT's fine branded papers are under heavy price pressure. Demand - steady for most grades through much of last year - has been weakening. For all players, 'the name of the game now is to absorb the excess capacity,' says Mr van Oordt. Margins in packaging are also under pressure, although both fine papers and packaging may be among the first to benefit from any cyclical upswing. A new strategy will come in the office products market. BT's existing activity in the US ranks second after Boise-Cascade, with annual sales of Dollars 420m. After establishing a strong regional base, BT spread nationwide to form what today represents one of the new group's few real growth markets. The ambition is 'to replicate' the achievement in Europe. Mr van Oordt sees particularly synergies emerging in office products and information services, using overlapping customer lists to offer complementary services. At present, office products account for a relatively small slice of the merged business - 7 per cent of turnover but less of total operating profit. Nevertheless, Mr van Oordt says, 'we have acquisition plans - very targeted and focused. You will not see huge investments in capacity or acquisitions in the next few years, but strategically-placed expansion in areas like office products, information systems and, possibly, packaging.' Among the benefits of the merger, Mr van Oordt stresses accelerated rationalisation above closures, 'better planning of inventories, better logistics and distribution, better use of existing production capacity.' The graphic systems division faces stagnant demand and a serious product overlap. BT sells 25 per cent of the printing machines produced by Germany's Heidelberger. VRG is a leading agent for MAN Roland. The new group is thus in the odd and unsustainable position of acting as exclusive agent for two competing players. 'Obviously very difficult,' says Mr van Oordt. The EC merger taskforce, in the second phase of investigating the deal, agrees. 'On the basis of our discussions with . . . Brussels, we've concluded we will have to make a choice in the Benelux (between Heidelberger and MAN Roland). We will try to resolve this situation in the first half of this year.' One resolution may lie in a management buy-out of the VRG/MAN Roland franchise, analysts suggest. Another concern lies in paper merchanting, where BT has traditionally traded on its independence from big suppliers. Will its amalgamation into the new KNP BT combine prove counter-productive? 'The merchanting arm will have the same independence as before,' insists Mr van Oordt. 'We will still buy 75 per cent of our paper requirements outside our own network.' However, he is careful to add: 'The world moves on. Closer relationships between suppliers and distributors have become more common . . . than they used to be.' Whether the merger will deliver the hoped-for benefits remains unclear. Among the outstanding concerns is the clash of personalities and management styles involved in joining three former competitors. However, coming when the likes of truckmaker Daf, electronics giant Philips and aircraft producer Fokker are either drastically scaling down or falling prey to foreign buyers, the KNP BT merger has the important domestic virtue of being a uniquely 'Dutch solution'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Joint service, which is defined by the Commission's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations as *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;an agreement between ocean common carriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating as a joint venture whereby a separate service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is established which: (1) Holds itself out in its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct operating name; (2) independently fixes its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, charges, practices and conditions of service or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to participate in its operating name in another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement which is duly authorized to determine and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement such activities; (3) independently publishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its own tariff or chooses to participate in its operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name in an otherwise established tariff; (4) issues its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own bills of lading; and (5) acts generally as a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier. The common use of facilities may occur and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no competition between members for traffic in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agreement trade; but they otherwise maintain their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate identities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 46 CFR 572.104(n). While the introduction of a joint service into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a trade by outside lines may increase the level of competition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the range of services available for shippers, there can be negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects on competition and service if the joint service is formed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by lines that up to that point had been competing in the trade, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially if the new entity would have substantial market power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;``Capacity management'' or ``capacity regulation''. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively new technique for dealing with overtonnaging and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depressed rates limits the availability of vessel space to shippers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but does not reduce the real capacity of the carriers. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such programs have the potential to perpetuate economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inefficiencies and unnecessary costs for shippers, particularly if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they remain in place beyond short-term cargo declines or surges in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. Agreements authorizing such programs have sufficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious ramifications under the 1984 Act to warrant thorough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulation or discussion of service contracts. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements engaging in this activity are conference agreements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would already be covered by the ``ratemaking'' criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above. However, agreements among non-conference lines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may include authority to confer and to reach ``non-binding''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements on service contract terms, and such authority may well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diminish price and service competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

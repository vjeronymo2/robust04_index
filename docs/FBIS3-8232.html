At the same time, they called on  both sides to continue negotiations in the United Nations.  Following the end of the two-day ministerial meeting, Skopje  Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski expressed his satisfaction  with the communique and repeated his desire for dialogue with  Greece. Asked if a goodwill gesture can be expected from  Skopje, Crvenkovski replied:    [Begin recording, in English] [Crvenkovski] I think that our  position is quite clear. We are absolutely for them and for  continuing negotiations. We favor developing good relations  between the two countries and we are strongly interested in  obtaining good relations with....    [Dheliolanis, interrupting] There will be some goodwill  gesture on your part?    [Crvenkovski] There have been many goodwill gestures in the  past few years and I think that now is the time to sit together  at the table and continue negotiations in New York. I think the  only way to solve any problems between the two countries is to  sit together and talk. [end recording]    The Skopje minister, however, avoided answering a question  about the thinking that led his country to adopt the Sun of  Veryina as a symbol. Finally, in an interview with a local  newspaper today, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta  said that he does not worry about Greece's anger with the  planned transportation axis north of Greece.</p>

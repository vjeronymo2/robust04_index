			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: TV cannot offer depth of written history Sir, Christopher Dunkley ('A season of excellence from the BBC', November 10) claims that television can be a better medium than the written word for presenting modern history. There is no doubt that the series upon which he bases this idea (Thatcher: The Downing Street Years) is a remarkable piece of television, and, more than that, a devastating expose of the former PM's style of government. But surely no television programme, however well-balanced and illuminating, can ever approach the depth of a written history? A span of time needs to pass before the Thatcher years can be analysed and their full impact assessed. In 50 years, when an arm's length survey is written, a historian will certainly be able to use the material presented in the television series, and may even draw upon Thatcher's autobiography (though that would seem to be of limited usefulness), but one hopes that he or she will employ an equal scepticism in viewing the contributions of all participants in those tangled times.

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Korea market 'impenetrable' European car makers have called on the EC Commission to reconsider South Korea's trading terms with the Community, complaining that protectionism makes the Korean market 'impenetrable', writes John Griffiths. In a report released before trade talks next week between the EC and Korea in Brussels, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) protested that Korea's high duties and taxes on imported cars hampered entry. The report said cars imported into Korea cost up to 41 per cent more than locally-produced cars. In addition, a 15 per cent purchase tax was levied on imported cars worth over won 70m (Dollars 76,700). No Korean-made cars were liable for this tax and Korea's car exports to the EC were exempt from duty because of its developing nation trade status. The Korean barriers are not confined to tariffs, the report protests. It cites paperwork delays of up to five months, lengthy and obstructive vehicle emissions and noise testing and lengthy customs delays as being among other obstacles. The report reflects concern of Europe's car makers at rapidly rising sales volumes being achieved in the EC by South Korea. In the first nine months of 1992, Korea exported 563,330 cars to the EC while only 593 EC-made cars were sold there.</p>

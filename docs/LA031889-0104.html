			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHADOWY, EXTREMIST ISRAELI GROUP STALKS PLO TALKS' BACKERS  </P> <P> A shadowy, extreme-rightist group using a Latin name is stalking prominent  Israelis who support dialogue with the PLO, police said Friday.  </P> <P> The Sicarii, who take their name from Jewish zealots who murdered collaborators  with the Romans in ancient times, claimed responsibility for an arson attack  Thursday on the home of broadcaster Dan Margalit.  </P> <P> They also tried to burn the home of a relative of leftist parliamentarian Yair  Tsaban in the same building.  </P> <P> In a telephone call to an Israeli newspaper, a man claiming to speak for the  group said: "We blew up the apartments of Dan Margalit and Yair Tsaban -- may  they be wiped off the face of the Earth -- because Margalit invited Faisal  Husseini to appear on TV and because Tsaban met with the PLO abroad." Husseini  is a prominent Palestinian in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> The attacks caused slight damage and no injuries.  </P> <P> They were the latest in a spate of arson attacks and threats against leading  Israeli doves.  </P></p>

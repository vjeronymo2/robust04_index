			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Reaction to the Atrocities Against Muslims"] </F>   [Text] Warren [Zimmermann], director of refugee programs in  the U.S. State Department, has resigned in protest over U.S.  policy in Bosnia. In his letter to U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, he said the United States is not ready to do  anything more to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia; hence, he is  resigning his post.    In Bosnia, Serbian and Croat forces are committing brutal  atrocities against the innocent Muslims there. Muslims are  rapidly being deprived of all the basic necessities, and Bosnia  is not allowed to buy arms from any country. The situation has  reached such an extent that even some UN observers and soldiers  have committed excesses against Muslim women in Bosnia. Serbian  and Croat forces are being provided with arms by Yugoslavia and  other Western countries. In Bosnia, Russian soldiers are  fighting along with the Serbs.    But the doors to all sorts of assistance have been closed to  Bosnian Muslims. When Iran tried to supply the Bosnian Muslims  with arms, the Egyptian authorities seized them at the Suez  Canal. Of course, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure, Pakistan  provided Bosnia with 250 million rupees in assistance and a  large loan. Recently, during his visit to Bosnia, Mohammad  Nawaz Sharif set up an aid fund worth 20 million rupees.  According to the Bosnian president, if the 150,000 Muslim  soldiers had arms, they could turn the tide of the war within a  few days. The United States and other Western countries are a  major obstacle to this; they are not ready to tolerate the  existence of a Muslim state in Europe. The Western countries  that champion the cause of human rights and human values keep  silent about the repeated Serb violations of cease-fire accords.    It is a dismal fact that even the Muslim countries, except  for Pakistan and Iran, have not raised an effective voice in  support of Bosnia. Recently, mass Muslim graves have been  discovered in Croatia. The Muslim world's silence regarding  these atrocities is tantamount to insensitivity of the first  order. If the Muslim countries were to unite and exert pressure  on the United Nations, and if there was a shift in the policy of  the United States and other Western countries, the Bosnian  Muslims could be saved from the Serb atrocities, and have their  freedom protected as well.</p>

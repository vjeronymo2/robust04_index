			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Fears over effects of business rate reform COMPANIES will face serious inequities in their tax burdens if the power to set the business rate is returned to local councils, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the independent research group. Councils lost the power to set business rates in 1990. Since then the government has set a uniform business rate based on a revaluation of property, the first since 1973. This has broadly favoured businesses in the north and the Midlands and adversely affected those in the south. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats propose to return power to set business rates to councils should they win power in the general election. The business rate will raise nearly Pounds 15bn this year, so its return to councils would greatly expand the local tax base. The IFS warns, however, that if the pre-1990 system of locally varying business rates is re-introduced with no allowance for the degree of business concentration within each local authority, tax burdens on businesses will be unfairly shared. Those in areas of low business concentration will be discriminated against. To counter this, the IFS report's authors Mr Kevin Denny and Mr Michael Ridge urge consideration of schemes designed to ensure fiscal neutrality between businesses across the country. One proposal is to relate local-business taxes to council expenditure per business establishment, rather than per head of population as before 1990. The report suggests using employment levels as the basis for calculating tax rates might further improve the system. A redistribution of government grant to councils to provide a broadly uniform business tax base might also be necessary. The report notes 'a general confusion' among businesses as to the real effect of the 1990 changes. Fiscal Studies, February 1992. IFS, 7 Ridgmount St, London WC1E 7AE. Pounds 8.</p>

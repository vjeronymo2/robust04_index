			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports from Prishtina confirm that at about 1100  today, large Serbian forces blocked all entries and exits to the  market of the capital of the Republic of Kosova. Thousands of  people were in the market simply trading, the majority preparing  for the [Muslim] festival of Bairam. This Serbian police  operation lasted for more than four hours. It is reported that  the Albanian traders had more than 500 German marks stolen. In  addition to this thievery, the Serbian police arrested many  young Albanians and sent them to the command headquarters of the  Serbian security bodies in Prishtina.</p>

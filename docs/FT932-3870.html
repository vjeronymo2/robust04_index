			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Lasmo issues Dollars 250m of preference shares LASMO, the UK oil company, has launched a Dollars 250m issue of perpetual cumulative preference shares, with a gross dividend of 10 per cent, in the US market. The deal is being arranged by Merrill Lynch. The issue is made up of 10m shares with a nominal value of Dollars 25 per share and is callable after five years. The deal virtually completes the refinancing of the bank debt taken on by Lasmo in connection with its acquisition of Ultramar. Lasmo had already raised Dollars 350m through a Yankee bond issue at the end of last month. The issue will be treated as equity in Lasmo's balance sheet for the purpose of computing balance sheet gearing. Because the proceeds are being used to repay debt, the financing will substantially reduce the company's gearing. Mr Michael Pavia, finance director of Lasmo, said that the refinancing has helped extend the average maturity of the company's debt to 8 1/2 years, from 5 1/2 years as at the end of last year. As part of the company's efforts to broaden the distribution of its shares in the US, its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. ALSO in the US preferred stock market, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish bank, has launched a Dollars 200m issue of preference shares, its third such offering. Unusually, the non-cumulative preference shares will also be offered in Europe. In particular, underwriters are targeting Spanish investors. The securities will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will form one single global tranche. The preference share issue, arranged by Kidder Peabody, counts as Tier 1 capital under new bank capital rules. The deal is expected to be priced next week, to offer a dividend of 8-8 1/8 per cent.</p>

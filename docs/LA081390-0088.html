			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSENT LAW FUELS STUDENTS;  </P> <P> ABORTION: THE ISSUES RESULTING IN THE 'BECKY BELL-ROSIE JIMENEZ CAMPAIGN' ARE  DRIVING SOME YOUNG WOMEN INTO ACTIVISM.  </P> <P> The symbols -- bracelets commemorating the dead, the face-etched grief of a  heartland couple -- are in place. The video has been made. The press  conference, at least the one in Los Angeles, has been held.  </P> <P> All that is needed now is a million volunteers -- mainly women, college- and  high-school students -- to demonstrate, sit in, vote and otherwise salvage  victory in a losing battle for public opinion over one aspect of this country's  prolonged, divisive abortion controversy.  </P> <P> Allyson Wagner plans to be among the first of that million -- or whatever the  number ultimately may be.  </P> <P> A 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, Wagner was one of  about 30 students attending the initial Los Angeles organizing meeting in  support of "The Becky Bell-Rosie Jimenez Campaign."  </P> <P> This is a nationwide effort that seeks to repeal parental consent laws that  require minors to get permission from one or both parents before having an  abortion.  </P> <P> Thirty-three states, including California, have passed laws requiring parental  consent or notification before minors may receive abortions.  </P> <P> The California law, as well as those in some other states, is now tied up in  the courts. But large majorities -- up to 80% -- have supported the notion of  parental consent in public opinion polls.  </P> <P> Named for two young women who died from complications of illegal abortions, the  Bell-Jimenez campaign was announced last week by the Fund for the Feminist  Majority, a national women's group headed by Eleanor Smeal, former two-term  president of the National Organization for Women.  </P> <P> The fund has enlisted as spokespersons Bill and Karen Bell, parents of Becky  Bell, 17, who died in 1988 of complications after an illegal abortion in  Indiana, a parental consent state. The Bells' daughter chose that route rather  than diminish herself in their eyes, her parents say.  </P> <P> The names of Becky Bell and Rosie Jimenez (whose death is blamed on a cutoff of  federal aid for abortions for the poor) will be among those engraved on  "memorial bracelets" similar to those worn in remembrance of Vietnam prisoners  of war; the fund plans to distribute the bracelets in large numbers. Supporters  will be urged to wear them until consent laws are changed.  </P> <P> The fund also has produced "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives," a  29-minute video recounting the case of Bell and other facets of the fund's  arguments against parental consent laws. The group also plans to distribute  thousands of the videos, as well as sending the Bells and Smeal to campus  forums nationwide.  </P> <P> But the ambitious campaign's success or failure ultimately hinges on the  long-term commitment of students like Wagner, who says she is a political  novice.  </P> <P> Wagner, who spent the summer in Los Angeles as an intern with a group that  works on population control strategies, sees the abortion issue as a possible  political ignition spark for her generation: "It's an issue I can't ignore any  longer. . . . For too long now we've been labeled an apathetic generation.  Abortion or the environment may be creeping up on (students) as a rallying  point."  </P> <P> Wagner added that she was nudged toward activism last year when her campus was  galvanized by debate over a stringent abortion law passed by Pennsylvania  legislators. A further spur, she said, was a disagreement with a friend over  whether one person can make a political difference, a dispute that she clearly  wanted to win.  </P> <P> Katherine Spillar, the fund's national coordinator, said that mobilizing a  million student volunteers -- comparable to the anti-Vietnam student protest  movement of a generation ago -- is "very realistic."  </P> <P> Students accounted for about a third of the estimated 800,000 supporters of  legal abortion who turned out for demonstrations in Washington, last April and  November, she said, citing the figures as evidence that students are ready to  be mobilized as abortion-rights advocates.  </P> <P> In its opening phase, Spillar said the fund has targeted Massachusetts, the  first state to adopt a consent law, and Indiana, the Bells' home state.  </P> <P> In Indiana, the fund announced plans to challenge judges who hear requests of  waiver from parental consent requirements. The fund argues that Indiana judges  are biased and grant only about a dozen waivers a year.  </P> <P> Other targeted states include Michigan and Oregon, where consent laws are being  considered, as well as California, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and  Rhode Island.  </P> <P> Opponents of abortion think the fund may have some success with its strategy  but doubt that students will be important soldiers in the protracted war over  abortion.  </P> <P> "They'll be more successful at drawing them (students) out to rallies than  getting them down to the nitty-gritty," said Janet Carroll, associate director  of the National Right to Life Committee's Western office.  </P> <P> Carroll contended that students are "a very transient population" and that  voting-age students are "not great at getting out and voting."  </P> <P> The nub of of the argument over parental consent laws is whether such measures  foster or inhibit communication between parents and daughters. Anti-abortion  forces argue the laws do promote such communication, while abortion rights  advocates counter that they drive a wedge between children and parents.  </P> <P> And this is where the Bells figure importantly in the fund's strategy against  consent laws.  </P> <P> Bill and Karen Bell said their daughter was "afraid her parents wouldn't want  her" if they learned she was pregnant. Becky also told a friend that she  couldn't "tell mom and dad because I love them too much," they explained during  one of several appearances in Southern California.  </P> <P> Bill Bell added that he and his wife are "living proof that no matter how  loving a family is . . . we have no guarantees that our daughters will come to  us in this time of crisis."  </P> <P> Thrust by a personal tragedy into a national controversy, the Bells seem  ambivalent about their role. They say that the whirlwind of speaking and  touring that now consumes their lives has its "healing" aspects. But Karen  Bell, in Los Angeles for four days, said she was "so homesick I could cry right  now."  </P> <P> Yet in ways they seem tailor-made as symbols in American politics. At 47, he is  a former high school football and basketball player and was his high school  homecoming king. She is a former cheerleader and high school homecoming queen.  </P> <P> Before her daughter's death, Karen Bell, 46, also was a full-time housewife  with little interest in the world beyond her suburban Indianapolis home, she  said. Bill Bell said he left his job as an office products salesman and will  devote full time to campaigning against consent laws for about a year. After  that, he will decide what to do next, he said.  </P> <P> Until their daughter died, under circumstances that remain somewhat mysterious,  the Bells said they were unaware that Indiana had a parental consent law. Nor  did they know that their daughter was pregnant or that an abortion had been  performed; they learned this from the coroner, who listed their daughter's  cause of death as infections stemming from a "septic abortion," they said. The  person who performed the abortion has never been found.  </P> <P> Abortion foes dispute the Bells' story, citing the testimony of a friend of  Becky who maintains that Becky did not have an abortion, that she may have died  of a miscarriage that resulted in a massive infection.  </P> <P> Carroll of National Right to Life referred to this testimony before, adding  that Becky "certainly did not have to choose an illegal abortion, if that is  what happened."  </P> <P> The Bells dismiss these questions, saying they are satisfied with the autopsy  that indicated complications from a "botched" abortion as the cause of their  daughter's death.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, they hope that through their involvement in the fund's campaign they  can counterbalance the oppressive weight of their daughter's death.  </P> <P> "I don't want her lying in that grave for nothing," Karen Bell said.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / SDR48m IMF loan agreed for Senegal The International Monetary Fund yesterday moved to help the countries of French-speaking west and central Africa get over the pains of January's devaluation of the CFA franc by agreeing to lend Senegal 47.6m special drawing rights (about Pounds 46m). The loan is the first agreed since the countries of the franc zone decided on January 11 to cut the value of their currency, fixed at 50 CFA francs to the French franc since 1948, by 50 per cent. The IMF board is expected to discuss similar loans to other franc zone countries, starting with Niger, Ivory Coast, Comoros and Cameroon, over the next month. The loan agreed yesterday will back up the policies Senegal's government has adopted since the devaluation to boost its economy, including cuts in customs tariffs, administered prices, and the pursuit of a moderate wage policy. Figures from the Senegal government and the IMF show the country's economy shrank by 0.8 per cent last year, but is projected to grow by 2.7 per cent in 1994 and 5.0 per cent in 1995. Inflation is projected to climb to 39 per cent this year before dropping to 7.8 per cent in 1995. In a statement issued yesterday the IMF called for external aid to Senegal, including debt relief. France has already agreed to cancel its remaining debt from low-income member countries and to halve outstanding debt from middle-income countries.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Observer: Hot seats and musical chairs What should be a routine game of musical chairs at the European Commission, following the recent reshuffle of commissioners, is starting to become rather fun. It seems that the Germans are having second thoughts about how they want to play the 'name-your-director-general' part of the game. Each member state gets to fill a chair. The Germans had been expected to use Dieter Frisch's departure from the EC development policy directorate - he couldn't get on with his prickly Spanish commissioner Manuel Marin - to appoint its own man as DG in charge of the new common security and foreign policy division. Gunter Burghardt, Jacques Delors' highly regarded foreign policy adviser, seems to have been under the impression that the job was his for the asking. However, the latest word is that the Germans now have their eye on a different DG post, the newly created job of overseeing the internal market. That would disappoint both Burghardt and the British, who want the job for John Mogg, Sir Leon Brittan's private secretary during the Westland affair and now deputy DG of the industry directorate. Bonn's leading candidate is Johannes Beseler, head of the Commission's anti-dumping division. He would be a distinctly odd choice. A talented empire-builder, Beseler hardly ranks as an economic liberal. Under his aegis, anti-dumping has developed into the EC's most powerful protectionist weapon, which critics say has often been used to shelter uncompetitive producers at the expense of consumers. Surely that's not what the internal market is supposed to be about?</p>

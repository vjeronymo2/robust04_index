			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop North Korea's Provocations"] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  decided on 21 March to submit the issue of nuclear inspections  of the DPRK (North Korea) to the UN Security Council [UNSC].  Depending on how North Korea behaves, the UNSC may discuss how  to deal with the DPRK, with the imposition of economic sanctions  being a possibility. It will not do the DPRK and the  international community any good if this problem deteriorates  any further. We repeat our call on North Korea to contemplate  the situation coolheadedly and realistically.    During the recent IAEA inspection tour, North Korea  obstructed the inspection of a number of its nuclear facilities  which are suspected of being involved in developing nuclear  weapons. The IAEA objected to this and demanded that the DPRK  accept inspections immediately. North Korea refused, and thus,  IAEA decided to bring the issue to the UNSC. The UNSC is  expected to adopt a resolution demanding the acceptance of  nuclear inspections, and there is a strong possibility that  economic sanctions may also be considered.    In response, North Korea objected strongly to these moves,  and it has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is the second time that it  has made such a threat, and this is the second time that the  UNSC has taken up this question. The international community has  been at the mercy of North Korea. As Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa told Premier Li Peng during his visit to the PRC, "the  international community" has reached the limit of "its patience."    The international community is still forced to treat the  DPRK  with discretion because it is concerned about the military  action that the Kim Il-song regime might take. At the stalled  working-level meeting on the exchange of envoys between North  and South Korea, the North even made remarks about the  possibility of war. On the other hand, there is also a sense of  urgency because the issue has to do with nuclear "deadly  weapons," and it might be too late if something is not done  right away.    However, it is not advisable for the international community  to be twisted around the DPRK's finger and to panic every time  it does something. If this happens again and again, there is  the danger that the DPRK will always lead the international  community by the nose. It might be necessary to take a more  detached attitude.    The United States has decided to deploy Patriot antimissile  missiles in South Korea. It is also considering resuming joint  military exercises with the ROK. These are obviously deterrent  measures to stop the North from making a wrong move. We also  hope that the channels for a solution through negotiations will  be kept open.    If a UNSC resolution and economic sanctions come to pass,  North Korea's reaction will be even more defiant. However, the  DPRK is already very isolated, and its economy is in very  serious trouble. There is no need to rush even if economic  sanctions are to be imposed.    China's leaders are not eager to take tough measures against  North Korea. They seem to believe that progress through  negotiations is still possible. If so, we hope that China will  exercise its influence to bring about tangible results.</p>

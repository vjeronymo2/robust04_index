			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / East hails prize of fast Nato expansion Former communist nations in central Europe yesterday hailed the prospect of early incorporation as full members of Nato, despite the strong objections that Russia has signalled. Western nations also reaffirmed their plans, mapped out on Thursday, for a rapid expansion programme, and they hoped misunderstandings with Russia could be cleared up soon. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister, told a meeting of the 16 Nato countries and their former adversaries in the Warsaw pact that there was no reason why anybody should object to Nato's enlargement. 'Nato is not a war machine, and applying cold war terms to Nato is a misunderstanding or an expression of bad faith,' the minister said. Western nations continued to express astonishment yesterday at Russia's last-minute refusal on Thursday to launch a long-awaited co-operation programme with Nato. Moscow said its refusal was a gesture of concern over Nato plans for accelerated expansion. Western officials suggested yesterday that the dramatic gesture by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was a carefully prepared piece of theatre. They said the outlines of Nato plans for faster enlargement were well known to Russia, despite Mr Kozyrev's claim that he had found dubious elements in the Nato plan 'at first glance'. However western officials said they were confident that misunderstandings with Moscow would in due course be cleared up. 'Co-operation between Russia and Nato is too important to both sides to be allowed to let slip,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. East European nations expressed understanding of the west's need to accommodate Russia and they avoided directly criticising Russia themselves. But several said privately they viewed Russia's behaviour as a bad omen for future security arrangements in Europe. US officials said they had been led to believe at the US-Russia summit in September Moscow would not object to a 'gradual and transparent' enlargement procedure.</p>

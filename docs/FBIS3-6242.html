The overall wholesale price index came to 93.5 against the  base of 100 for 1990.    On a year-to-year basis, the index slid 3.2 percent.    Domestic wholesale prices in February were unchanged from  the  previous month but retreated 2.0 percent from a year earlier.    Export prices for February fell 0.1 percent from the  previous  month on a contract currency basis and moved down 3.3 percent in  yen terms.    Import prices edged up 0.8 percent on a contract currency  basis but declined 2.3 percent in yen terms from January.    A Bank of Japan official said export prices on a contract  currency basis fell for the first time since December 1992 as  price-raising moves following the sharp appreciation of the yen  against the dollar last year came to a halt.    Import prices on a contract currency basis moved up from the  month before due to higher commodity prices overseas but they  declined in yen terms because of the yen's appreciation, he said.    The dollar averaged 106.25 yen in the month, falling 4.8  percent from January and down 12.3 percent from a year before.    The official said domestic wholesale prices remain stable  and  attributed the levelling off from the previous in contrast to  continued declines since last July to higher overseas commodity  prices.    But commodity prices are already coming down, the official  said, adding that the index is unlikely to continue moving up.    The wholesale price index for rice stood at 112.0 against  the  base of 100 for 1990, continuing to stay high since last autumn  because of the poor harvest, the official said. The index was  102.2 in August, before it began to go up.    It remained unchanged from January, however, in spite of  higher prices reported at the retail level. The statistics do  not include prices of imported rice, the official said.</p>

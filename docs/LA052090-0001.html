			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUZZY LOGIC  </P> <P> I wonder if perhaps the only thing fuzzy is Kosko's scientific perception and  understanding. There is nothing inherently wrong with Western theorizing.  </P> <P> Western science purports that every continuum in science and nature, whether it  be the transition from hot to cold or from heavy to light rain, can be  described as a function, or a system of functions, based on a series of yes or  no responses.  </P> <P> Kosko states: "I'd be the biggest atheist that ever lived." As the term atheist  is itself absolute, is this not an extreme attitude for one who does not deal  with either/or interpretations?  </P> <P> For goodness' sake, Bart, turn down the heat in the hot tub, even if it's a  little bit at a time.  </P> <P> MARVIN W.

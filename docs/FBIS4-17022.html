			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "NEGA reports" column] </F>   [Text] Crimea -- Deputies of the Crimean Supreme Soviet  elected from the Russia bloc as well as deputies supporting the  bloc's program have held a closed meeting. There are 61 such  deputies (out of 94). The meeting decided to create a deputies  group. Deputy Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Republican Party  of Crimea, which is affiliated with the Russia bloc, proposed  that this deputies group fully support the president of the  Crimean Republic. "Because this group effectively has a  constitutional majority in the future parliament, any decision  can be made ignoring the Crimean Tatar deputies (whose number is  the new parliament is 14)," Tsekov said. This was decisively  opposed by Vladimir Klychnikov, coordinator of the Russia bloc;  and deputies Boris Kizilov and Vadim Mordashov.</p>

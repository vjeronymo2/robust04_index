			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- More than six million  cadres throughout China took part in various training classes to  study Deng Xiaoping's theories about building socialism with  Chinese characteristics last year.    An official from the Organization Department of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said that 2.139  million of the cadres studied in party schools at various levels  or cadre-training institutes for over one month and 2.6 million  attended different short-term training classes, while 1.232  million are still studying in party schools.    They mainly studied the Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping and books on the socialist market economy  and on modern science and technology.    During the period from October last year to May this year,  the CPC Central Committee held four theory symposiums, which  were attended by 175 leading officials at provincial level.  They discussed important issues related to China's socialist  modernization drive.    Special attention was paid to training young cadres. Nearly  800,000 young cadres have received various kinds of training in  party schools at various levels.    As a result, a swathe of personnel who know how to manage  the  market economy and are familiar with an export-oriented economy  have been brought up.    The CPC Central Committee has paid great attention to  construction of cadre training centers. By 1993, there were  6,944 party schools and management institutes with over 109,000  specialized teachers.</p>

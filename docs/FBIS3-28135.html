			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  remain apart after talks Thursday [3 February] between U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii, a senior Japanese official said.    "There are some differences," the official told KYODO news  service, but declined to say whether progress was made.    The official described the talks, which stuck to their  30-minute schedule, as "short and friendly." A finance ministry  official, briefing reporters, described them as "serious."    Kantor called the discussions "interesting" as he left the  ministry, but declined further comment.    The briefer said both sides agreed to instruct their  negotiators to put more "efforts" into successfully concluding  the bilateral trade framework talks before a February 11 summit  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill  Clinton.    But he said Kantor made no demands for politicians to  override the Japanese bureaucracy to forge an agreement. The  briefer said both sides decided not to disclose further details  of the talks.    White house aide Bowman Cutter, who participated in the  talks  with Fujii, has publicly called for a decision on the thorny  trade talks from someone with political responsibility.    As Fujii greeted Kantor [words indistinct] early Thursday,  Kantor responded, "We all welcome this as a step in the right  direction." The U.S. Government has not had a chance to review  all the details of the plan, he said, but added that Washington  expects "continued steps" by Japan to boost domestic demand and  promote global growth.    Fujii said he expects the government will be able to  formally  announce its economic stimulus plan Thursday night,  incorporating the tax plan, which links the cuts with a new 7  percent "national welfare tax" to replace the current 3 percent  consumption tax.    But the timing of the stimulus package appeared in doubt as  the governing coalition's biggest member, the Social Democratic  Party, has threatened to quit the coalition unless the tax plan  is revised.    Socialist officials said the party would decide whether to  quit the coalition by the end of the day.    Fujii laughingly noted to Kantor that the "political weather  is bad" after Kantor mentioned Thursday's clear weather in Tokyo.    Kantor responded that "the political weather is always  difficult."    During their meeting, the two did not discuss the Japanese  political situation, the ministry briefer said.</p>

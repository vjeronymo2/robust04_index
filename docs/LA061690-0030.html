			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A'S RALLY DENIES WHITE SOX FIRST PLACE, 5-4  </P> <P> The surprising Chicago White Sox were all set to take over first place in the  American League West Friday night to the delight of 40,417 fans at Comiskey  Park.  </P> <P> The White Sox, boasting the most effective bullpen in the league, had built a  4-1 lead through seven innings. Furthermore, the Athletics were without  slugging Jose Canseco, and Mark McGwire, though playing, wasn't swinging with  authority because of a chest injury.  </P> <P> Left-hander Greg Hibbard had given up only four hits and appeared to have the  slumping World Series champions at his mercy.  </P> <P> There was no cause for concern even when Mike Gallego and Walt Weiss opened the  eighth inning with singles. In came Barry Jones, who was 7-0.  </P> <P> But Dave Henderson, who homered earlier, doubled in two runs and Terry  Steinbach singled in two more and suddenly, the Athletics had a 5-4 victory and  a two-game lead.  </P> <P> The uprising made a 10-game winner out of Bob Welch, who had one of his poorest  outings. Welch (10-2) won his seventh in a row, though he barely survived the  first three innings.  </P> <P> Welch issued five walks in the first three innings, fell behind, 3-1, and never  did look the part of a winner.  </P> <P> The White Sox scored one run while hitting into a double play, another on a  wild pitch and the third on a passed ball. They scored another run in the  seventh when Ivan Calderon singled, Dan Pasqua walked and Carlton Fisk singled  to make it 4-1.  </P> <P> If the White Sox had won their second in a row from the Athletics, they would  have led by five percentage points.  </P> <P> Before Dennis Eckersley got the final out for his 21st save in 22  opportunities, Gene Nelson and Rick Honeycutt followed Welch to the hill.  Eckersley gave up a bunt single to Calderon before getting Pasqua on a grounder  to end the game.  </P> <P> Until the winning rally, the Athletics had been unable to capitalize on their  chances. They left 10 runners stranded in the first six innings of Thursday's  3-2 defeat.  </P> <P> They had runners on second and third with one out in the second, but two  brilliant plays by Chicago third baseman Robin Ventura prevented any runs from  scoring.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, New York 4 -- The Blue Jays, leading the East, decided to give third  baseman Kelly Gruber a night off at New York.  </P> <P> But with the bases loaded, two out in the eighth inning and the Yankees  leading, 3-1, Manager Cito Gaston summoned Gruber to pinch-hit.  </P> <P> Gruber tripled to left-center to put the Blue Jays in front and enable them to  stay 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston.  </P> <P> The victory went to David Wells (5-1), though he appeared to be on his way to a  defeat. Tom Henke gave up a run in the bottom of the eighth, but still earned  his 10th save.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Baltimore 3 -- Without Wade Boggs and Marty Barrett, the Red Sox have  to scratch for runs.  </P> <P> In this game at Baltimore, it was Danny Heep who came through. Heep, batting  .178, hit a two-run double in the second inning to give the Red Sox the lead.  </P> <P> Wes Gardner, who can't beat anyone else, is a perfect 5-0 against the Orioles.  Gardner (1-3) gave up two runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings to win. He also  lowered his earned-run average from 7.79 to 6.65.  </P> <P> "Maybe I should only pitch against the Orioles," said Gardner, whose lifetime  record is 16-22.  </P> <P> Pete Harnisch (6-3) faced 15 batters and threw 60 pitches before leaving after  1 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Milwaukee 3 -- A promotion-night crowd of 63,546 at Cleveland --  -- largest in the majors this season -- -- cheered Tom Candiotti (7-3) to his  second win in a row.  </P> <P> An oil company promotion, in which free tickets were given for fillups,  accounted for the big crowd.  </P> <P> Candiotti gave up seven hits before Doug Jones took over with one out in the  ninth. Jones retired the last two Brewers for his 21st save in 23  opportunities.  </P> <P> Jerry Browne and Candy Maldonado hit run-scoring doubles in the first inning to  spoil the Milwaukee debut of former Dodger Dennis Powell.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Minnesota 1 -- The only team playing worse than the Royals these  days is the Twins. Kansas City took advantage of Minnesota's slump to win its  second in a row at home.  </P> <P> Danny Tartabull hit a three-run home run and Kevin Appier held the Twins, who  lost their eighth in a row, to five hits in eight innings.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson doubled home a run in the fourth when the Royals jumped to a 2-0  lead against rookie Tim Drummond (0-2).  </P> <P> Tartabull's home run in the fifth was a 410-foot blast and was his third in the  last eight games.  </P> <P> Texas 4, Seattle 3 -- Manager Bobby Valentine had run out of relief pitchers,  so he told Kevin Brown he had to go the distance at Seattle.  </P> <P> Brown (8-4) managed to go all the way, but just barely. He gave up seven hits  and the Mariners scored a run in the ninth and had the potential tying run on  second when center fielder Gary Pettis made the final putout.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia drove in two runs for the Rangers.  </P> <P> Brown cooled off hot-hitting Ken Griffey Jr., who went 0 for four and dropped  below .333 for the first time this season.

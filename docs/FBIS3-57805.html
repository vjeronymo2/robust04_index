In a written  statement made in the Turkish Cypriot side of Nicosia yesterday,  TUPI leader Ahmet Gunes claimed that the media of the world have  neglected and overlooked the existence of Turkoman people in  Iraq. He said: "We expect the public in Turkey and the media  organs in the world to be more sensitive on the matter and to  help us remove the Saddam administration's oppression and  pressure."    Recalling that the Hammer Force protects the Kurds in  northern Iraq, including those who live in areas below the 36th  parallel, Gunes lamented that all the Turkoman people, including  those who live in al-Mawsil and other areas to the north of the  36th parallel, have been ignored. He said: "The Turkomans in  Iraq urge the Turkish Government and the entire world to have  all the Turkoman people, including those in al-Mawsil Province,  protected. We also urge them to help us create an opportunity  for ourselves to live like human beings and maintain our  political identity."</p>

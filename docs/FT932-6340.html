			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chevron reshapes downstream side CHEVRON, the California-based oil company, yesterday announced a substantial reshaping of its US downstream oil business. It will involve the sale of two refineries and service stations in several states east of the Rocky Mountains. It will take a Dollars 550m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings to cover losses on the sale of fixed assets and inventories, and provisions for environmental site assessment and redundancies. The company said its new refining and marketing organisation would concentrate on resources in the west, south-west and south. Mr Dave Hoyer, president of its US products business, said increasing regulation, mandated capital spending and rising taxes imposed 'enormous added risks and burdens' on a refining and marketing business as large as Chevron's. The plan involves selling refineries in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Port Arthur, Texas. The company will also concentrate on investing in its service stations east of the Rockies.</p>

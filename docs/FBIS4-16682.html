			<p>BFN     [Text] [Deputy Foreign Minister] Vitaliy Churkin has  dismissed rumors of an alleged rift between him and [Foreign  Minister] Andrey Kozyrev about a solution of the Yugoslav  conflict. However, Churkin said he has witnessed the events in  the Balkans and has something to say about it. On his return to  Moscow on Monday, Churkin sharply criticized the Bosnian Serbs.  He told journalists that Bosnian Serbs are using Russian policy  as a shield.</p>

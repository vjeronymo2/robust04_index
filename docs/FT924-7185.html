			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Diary of despair in war-torn Krajina: The UN is powerless to prevent a campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' BY THE standards of mindless barbarity that have been set in the former Yugoslav republics over the last year and a half, the recent incidents recorded in the south of the Krajina region might seem almost petty. But, laid down in prosaic police reports, they provide graphic evidence of how a vindictive campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' can be pursued under the noses of international forces in a United Nations Protected Area. 'A Croatian woman born 1929 stated that three men in uniform came to the field in front of her house and shot her cow. They loaded the cow on a trailer and went away,' says a recent report by UN civilian police (Uncivpol) sent to monitor local police work in this Serb-controlled area of Croatia. Another incident in the same village, Maovice, involved a 75-year-old Croatian. 'Five armed men came to her house stole two wheelbarrows, two wall-clocks, washing powder and soap.' All the reports conclude by saying the local milicija, which serves as a police force, had been informed and the case was being followed up. But the UN is almost powerless. The same Uncivpol station described a robbery in the Vinalic area. 'Six men, two in civilian clothes and four in local milicija uniform, came to a Croatian woman's house and threatened her with rifles. They stole one colour TV and shot her dog. The six people came from the village of Certina. Before they left they told her to leave the village, otherwise she would be killed. Local milicija informed ..' In Jezevic-Corici, 'five men entered four houses owned by old Croatian people. They stole 700kg of wheat, 10kg salt, washing machine, coffee, candles, eight hams and a table.' The reports are from Sector South - one of the four UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) set up earlier this year after the ceasefire in Croatia - and from the adjacent 'pink zone'. This is additional territory the Yugoslav army had taken by the time the UNPAs were properly established. The UN plan is to restore this 'pink zone' step-by-step to Croatian authority. But no progress has been made towards this goal. Nor has the UN succeeded in its aim of 'demilitarising' and disarming the protected area, where it has 2,300 French, Czechoslovak and Kenyan troops. Sector South forms part of the self-proclaimed 'Republic of Serbian Krajina', and UN officials describe their mission there as 'quite frustrating'. Although neglected and economically backward, Krajina is strategically crucial since it virtually separates Croatia's southern Dalmatian region from the rest of the country. All main road and rail links pass through it. Tension is particularly high at Drnis, in the 'pink zone' to the south of the region. Up to last year Croats made up a large majority. But, according to UN officials, most have gone and Serb refugees from other areas have been moving into the empty houses. A typical case reported by the Uncivpol's Drnis station reads: 'On October 29 an old Serbian woman, aged 79, was threatened at night by four men in civilian clothes to leave her house in Badanj ..She thinks that because she was married to a Croat, they may believe she is also a Croat. Local police informed. To be followed up.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Bolivian Catholic Church, which has  maintained a "protest silence" over amendments to the education  system, spoke out during the Corpus Christi celebrations  yesterday. In a homily against the government, it demanded that  society be allowed to participate in the drafting and  application of laws to change the country.    In a homily to celebrate Corpus Christi, La Paz Archbishop  Luis Sainz Hinojosa said: "A better distribution of wealth, a  real opening to allow the participation of society, and the  drafting of a modern education system requires the participation  of all Bolivians."    President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Vice President  Victor  Hugo Cardenas, who attended mass accompanied by their wives and  ministers of state, listened carefully to the Archbishop's  homily.    From the pulpit, Sainz Hinojosa faced the highest Bolivian  authorities. He did not miss the opportunity to ask the  government to focus its attention on "improving salaries and job  opportunities, and thus improving the living standards of the  Bolivian people."    He reiterated the demands of the Bolivian Episcopal  Conference Education Commission, whose main representative  protested because the National Education Council (Coned) drafted  alterations to the Education Reform Framework law.    Referring to the amendment -- which was made without any  consultation -- to the framework law that was submitted to  Congress for approval, Sainz stated: "The Education Reform,  which will change the education of our people, is a national  priority and a social responsibility that needs the unselfish  participation of all."    The points about making municipalities responsible for the  education service, eliminating teachers schools, and the  drafting of an ideological and political framework for the  education system are the most controversial points confronting  the government and the involved sectors that are against them.    Aware of the problems affecting Bolivian society, the La Paz  archbishop urged Bolivians to reconcile their viewpoint in favor  of the unity of the country, which is affected by a serious  economic crisis.    As he stared at the government officials praying before the  alter, Sainz said: "The Body of Christ invites us to be united,  to cooperate, to wholeheartedly serve our people who must be  rescued from so much slavery, so many sins, and so much  corruption."

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts The latest cut in interest rates strengthens the investment argument in favour of index-linked gilts. With the government evidently determined to restore growth at any cost, buyers of fixed-rate gilts might be forgiven for worrying about inflation. The equity market, meanwhile, has already discounted a strong recovery in corporate earnings. Index-linked gilts offer a haven from unexpected inflation and economic disappointment. Judging by the Pounds 250m stock issued on Wednesday, the authorities are aware of the funding opportunity. Even so, index-linked bonds are unlikely to play more than a supporting role in the government's funding programme while bond market investors remain so relaxed about the long-term inflation threat. The yield differential between fixed-rated and index-linked gilts - a rough measure of inflationary expectations - has hovered at around 5 per cent since sterling was forced out of the ERM. Equally, the yield on equities is not out of kilter with the real return on index-linked gilts. Institutions are reluctant to buy index-linked bonds unless this arithmetic changes. Given the tax advantages, private investors may be buyers as they switch out of cash deposits. But the government has good reason to tread carefully. The recent spate of index-linked issues has done little to improve liquidity. Yields would rise quickly if the market was asked to take more paper than could be readily absorbed. That would have a knock-on effect in the rest of the gilts market the government must want to avoid.</p>

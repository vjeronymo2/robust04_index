			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron creditor threatens to challenge refinancing A CREDITOR of Heron, the property group headed by Mr Gerald Ronson, is threatening to challenge the group's financial restructuring and has called on other creditors to join the action. An advertisement placed in yesterday's Financial Times was signed by a company called First Eastern Developments. It said the documents Heron had issued in connection with the refinancing omitted important information. Heron said the advertisement 'would appear to have been placed on the specific instructions' of Stratagem Development Corporation, which is suing Heron over the development of a property in New York, claiming damages of Dollars 22.25m (Pounds 14.4m). Heron said that it and its advisers 'deny that there is any omission of important information from the scheme document'. It said the document contained all the information creditors needed to make an informed decision and 'there is no question of Heron's banks receiving an 'inappropriate preference'.' Heron has denied the allegations Stratagem has made in its law suit and has made counter claims. The move adds to unhappiness among some of Heron's bondholders about the refinancing. Heron has said that if the refinancing deal is not acc-epted then it would be forced to start bankruptcy proceedings, leaving creditors with less than they would obtain through the refinancing.</p>

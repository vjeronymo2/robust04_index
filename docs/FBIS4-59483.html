			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Basil Abu-Sumayah from the occupied territories] </F>   [Excerpt] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  be the first Western official at the foreign minister level to  visit the Palestinian self-rule area in Jericho. Christopher is  scheduled to arrive in the city on Tuesday [17 May] to meet, in  the headquarters of the Palestinian National Security Forces,  with the commander of these forces, Brigadier Hajj Isma'il;  senior Palestinian officers; and leading Palestinian figures,  including Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, a member of the Palestinian  authority. The U.S. secretary will also meet with Palestinian  figures in East Jerusalem.    In a related development, Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former  spokeswoman of the Palestinian delegation has stressed that she  will not participate in the Palestinian authority that is  charged with the running of the Gaza sector and the Jericho  area. She told our radio that she will give priority to the  Independent Palestinian Commission for Citizens Rights.  'Ashrawi is the secretary general of that commission.    'Ashrawi urged Palestinians, including the opposition, to  join in building Palestinian society, both in the national  authority, the administrative agencies, and the institutions.  She said members of the authority must have competence and  credibility and be able to show commitment and will power so  they can win the approval of all segments of Palestinian  society. She said: There must be an integrated plan for  reconstitution with the participation of all. No one can escape  their responsibilities and the future challenges. [passage  omitted]</p>

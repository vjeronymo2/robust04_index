			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Bonn springs to defence of monetary union THE German government yesterday launched a passionate defence of European economic and monetary union in an attempt to counter a rising tide of domestic criticism of the Maastricht treaty. In an outspoken speech Chancellor Helmut Kohl's principal economic adviser, Mr Horst Kohler, answered point by point the doubts raised by leading state members of the governing council of the Bundesbank, and by politicians on both left and right. He presented the treaty as a great success for German economic and monetary policy. 'We managed to achieve far more in my view, in the economic and monetary union, than could ever have been expected at the beginning of the negotiations.' And it was achieved, he stressed, because the negotiating brief was agreed 'word for word' with the Bundesbank. Mr Kohler, who is the state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Mr Kohl's 'sherpa' for the summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations and the leader of Germany's negotiating team in the Emu talks, delivered his public address to a meeting in Karlsruhe. He said that Germany was not bound to join a monetary union if its partners did not interpret the economic preconditions for control of inflation and government spending 'according to the spirit and letter of the treaty'. He cited Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, as supporting an immediate monetary union between Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. 'So why should it be wrong to realise a monetary union, with comparable convergence criteria, at the latest by 1999?' he demanded. He insisted that no German politician, given the fundamental passion of the German voter for monetary stability, would accept any watering down of those criteria. He also rejected fears about the future stability of the Ecu, compared to the D-Mark, insisting the currency would be bound by even more austere stability requirements than the German currency. At the same time he ruled out any budget increase of the size proposed by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, to help finance the consequences of the Maastricht treaties.</p>

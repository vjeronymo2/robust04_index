			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Lamont rules out 'kickstart': Cutting inflation stays at heart of economic policy, chancellor tells MPs MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday underlined that UK economic policy would continue to aim at cutting inflation and rejected any idea of 'kickstarting the economy' to produce faster growth. In a dogged performance before the all-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, the chancellor said the government would pay very careful attention to the sterling exchange rate in formulating monetary policy. Stressing that the UK had no exchange rate target now that it had left the European exchange rate mechanism, he nevertheless said he would 'attach particular importance' to the pound's movements against the Bank of England's trade weighted index of currencies. He also said that Britain's inflation rate - currently 4 per cent on the Treasury's measure of underlying inflation - would have to 'come down further'. The UK had to compete with countries with lower inflation. Mr Lamont's evidence, given in an occasionally barbed two-hour session, shed no new light on how the government would use the various monetary and financial indicators it has chosen as guides to monetary policy when setting interest rates. He did not say when sterling might return to the ERM, insisting only that it would be 'quite impractical' to rejoin the mechanism before economic and monetary conditions in the UK and Germany were more compatible. In what could be a move to give the government leeway before re-entering the ERM, he repeatedly said that the UK would be able to ratify the Maastricht treaty on closer European union without first having sterling back in the mechanism. The emphasis the chancellor placed on curbing inflation and the need to avoid a free fall in sterling persuaded some City commentators that he would be in no rush to cut interest rates further. Opinion on the domestic money market has been moving in the direction of a cut in rates in recent days. Three months money, a key indicator of how the market thinks base rates are moving, closed at around 8 per cent yesterday compared with bank base rates at 9 per cent. Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist of UBS Phillips and Drew, the City securities house, said he thought the government would now 'keep markets waiting' for interest rate cuts, but would act after periods of stability or strength for sterling. By avoiding any serious mistakes in his testimony, Mr Lamont appeared to have reassured Tory MPs yesterday that he could give a robust justification for his economic policies. But although he emerged from the cross-examination by MPs with his standing at Westminster at least no worse than before, speculation continued over how long he could remain at the Treasury. Conservative MPs appeared content with his apparent no-score draw. 'I don't think that there was anything today that undermined his position and I would have thought that he would probably have strengthened it,' Mr John Watts, the committee's Tory chairman, said. But Mr Lamont is vulnerable to attacks from Labour that there is a vacuum in his economic policy. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said on Channel 4 News the chancellor's performance was 'appalling'. The chancellor had said 'not a word about growth, about bringing down unemployment and strengthening industry'. However, Mr Lamont told the committee that he did not believe in 'kickstarting the economy by artificial stimulus'. He rejected higher public spending and although he said that the government would do its best to safeguard capital spending, 'at the end of the day' it was the overall control of public spending that mattered. Questioned about the circumstances of Britain's departure from the ERM, Mr Lamont denied the substance of reports that the UK's EC partners had suggested a broader realignment of the ERM, including a devaluation of sterling, during September 12-13 when the Italian lira was devalued. However, the controversy looks set to continue after Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry, said that Britain refused an offer to realign sterling in the ERM before Black Wednesday. Talking on BBC TV's Panorama last night, he said: 'Together with the Bundesbank we came to the conclusion it would be the right decision to make a broad realignment in the EMS, including the lira, the British pound, and maybe other currencies, in order to ease tensions. The British government took a different decision,' he added. 'They were not prepared to contribute in a broad realignment.'

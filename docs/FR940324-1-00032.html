			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposal discusses several regulatory programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered by EPA which provide for the importation of vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the United States. Section 203 of the Clean Air Act (Act),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 U.S.C. 7522, provides the statutory authority for regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the importation of new motor vehicles <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle engines which are not covered by a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity. Sections 203(a)(1) and 203(b)(2) provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory authority for the regulations in today's proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, section 203(a)(1) prohibits the importation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles not covered by a certificate of conformity by any person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except as provided by regulation of the Administrator. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception for regulations of the Administrator in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 203(a)(1) refers to the grant of authority in section 203(b)(2),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which states that a vehicle not covered by a certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity and offered for importation shall be refused admission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the United States unless the Administrator, by regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for deferring final determination regarding admission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle offered for importation upon such terms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions as may appear appropriate to insure that any imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle will be brought into conformity with applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, requirements and limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The word ``vehicle'' hereinafter refers to a motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle and motor vehicle engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To implement section 203(b)(2), EPA has established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures regarding the importation of vehicles not covered by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of conformity. EPA first promulgated regulations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1972 (37 FR 24314) which allowed individuals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import vehicles and perform modifications subsequent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation. This regulatory structure was replaced on July 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1988 with a new regulatory program promulgated on September 25,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1987. This program established the independent commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer (ICI) as the entity responsible for the importation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonconforming vehicles. The primary purpose of this NPRM is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose additional provisions regarding the importation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles intended for sale in Canada but identical to U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified configurations. See section II for a discussion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation of Canadian vehicles. This proposal also includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to the procedures governing the importation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonconforming vehicles generally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the regulations administering the importation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of vehicles pursuant to section 203(b)(2), EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to regulations which implement section 203(b)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act. Section 203(b)(1) states, ``[t]he Administrator may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon such terms and conditions as he may find necessary for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training or for reasons of national security.'' To implement this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the Act, regulations were initially promulgated on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 10, 1974 (39 FR 32609), codified at 40 CFR part 85,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart R, to provide for a program allowing manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply for and receive exemptions for vehicles that were used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purposes specified in section 203(b)(1) of the Act. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations were amended on March 3, 1980 (45 FR 13733) to extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of exemptions under section 203(b)(1) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and other non-manufacturers. On July 14, 1982 (47 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30482) these regulations were amended to reduce the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in a manufacturer's exemption application. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations were also amended on August 27, 1985 (50 FR 34797) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that a claim of confidentiality accompany information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to EPA that is covered by such a claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments to the regulations, codified at 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 85.1703, implement section 203(b)(1) of the Act to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of a motor vehicle; to clarify the definition of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precertification vehicle in contrast to a vehicle subject to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing exemption; and, to revise the regulations regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining a display exemption pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 85.1707. These proposed changes are discussed in section V,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Amendments to subpart R.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background for Canadian Importations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The framework of EPA's current Imports regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes, with some limited exceptions, that only independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial importers (ICIs) holding a valid certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity may import nonconforming vehicles into the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. An ICI bears the responsibility not only for performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all necessary modifications and testing, but also for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the vehicle it imports complies with United States emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the vehicle's useful life. In effect, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposes on the ICI the same emission requirements the Act imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 24, 1987, potential importers of Canadian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles for resale in the U.S. petitioned EPA <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  to reconsider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations as they apply to the commercial importation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle models originally designed and built for sale in Canada  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are identical to vehicles certified by EPA for sale in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States. The petitioners maintained that, although these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles may not be labeled by the OEM as meeting United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission requirements, the vehicles do not have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanically modified to comply with such requirements and do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present air quality concerns similar to those presented by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported nonconforming vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the petition may be found in the docket at A&hyph;89&hyph;20.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Medina, chief of the Subdivision for the </F> Development of New Economic and Financial Structures of Russia's  Ministry of Economics: "Between the Past and the Future"]    [Text] Today, in order not to be bogged down in the  current chaos of events and to select the correct direction and  key positions for a systematic implementation of advanced  economic policy, it is necessary to become aware of the  objective cause-and-effect relationship and direction of the  global processes that have shaken our country's economy.    It must be admitted that the dying away of investment  processes was the main reason for the downfall of the  administration and command economic system. The existing scheme  for distributing investment resources and bringing them to the  investment process came into conflict with the scale and  complexity of the serviced system and became an obstacle to  expanded reproduction and further economic development. The  continuation of its vital activity led to the fact that the  system ate itself away, thereby destroying its future, that is,  the future of the next generations. All of us know well the  symptoms of this: inefficiency, total deficit, corruption, and  so forth.    Thus, the need for a fundamental change in the system from  the standpoint of providing new opportunities for its economic  growth was the objective reality. First of all, this implies the  birth of a new scheme for the functioning of investment  resources in it and for the appearance of new subjects of the  investment process.    Attempts at cosmetic corrections through the introduction of  cost-accounting elements into the old system could only delay  the necessary changes and aggravate the process.    The transformations begun in the economic sphere in 1992,  which were connected mainly with the transformation of property  relations and included price liberalization, privatization,  demonopolization of the economy, and so forth, in the end were  supposed to serve the establishment of the necessary base for  investments from the standpoint of the formation of their  subjects. Real results in this area are quite tangible and do  not need additional comments.    Costs in the course of practical implementation of the  presented directions were largely due to the fact that at the  moment of the break-up of and impossibility for creative labor  flaws and processes serving the goals of destruction in any  system, that is, money-grubbing, corruption, group and  individual egoism, crime, and so forth, were manifested in  hypertrophied form.    As a result, in the absence of rational control of processes  a situation has been created, in which the economic system is  being destroyed to a level exceeding the limits of its viability.    This is expressed in the fact that the economic crisis  experienced by the country is characterized by a decline in  production and by a scale of destruction of the economy  unprecedented in their depth. In the last 4 years the general  decrease in production has approached 50 percent of the mark and  in individual sectors the decline has reached 70 percent. There  is an especially difficult situation in science-intensive  sectors of industry, which are the basis for present economic  growth. The rapid drop in competitiveness of Russian industrial  output, destruction of cooperative ties and technological chains  in the manufacture of complex types of products, and increase in  the export of raw-material goods with a reduction in the export  of goods with a high degree of processing point to the growing  trend toward the country's deindustrialization and  transformation of the Russian economy into a raw-material  periphery of the world market.    However, the main danger lies in the fact that an  uncontrolled complete stoppage of production processes can  entail, as a minimum, the elimination of the viability of entire  cities and even regions. It is a question of fully civilian  sectors, beginning with the textile industry and so forth. At  present the maintenance and normal functioning of the social  infrastructure serving the population can be ensured only at the  expense of operating enterprises. Mass unemployment and poverty  as a direct consequence of the indicated process can serve as  the basis not only for a sharp rise in crime, but also for a  powerful social explosion, which will eliminate any opportunity  for revival. Furthermore, the fact that in a number of cases  production stoppage requires procedures for a reliable  suspension of technological processes should be kept in mind.  Taking into account the scale of the possible process, the state  does not have funds for these purposes. As a result, there is a  real threat of ecological disasters.    Our task is to avoid such a tragic development of events!  The  uniqueness of the moment is that at present the scale of the  calamity has not yet acquired an irreversible nature. However,  the fact that it is still possible to embark on a steady path of  progressive development of the national economy is the chief  thing.    Confidence in this is based on existing--with respect to a  number of questions still in the form of concepts--new  approaches to the economic policy of the postprivatization  period developed by specialists of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Economics with the participation of practical  workers and scientists.    The essence of the proposed measures lies in the following:    1. It is necessary to carry out work on the determination of  priorities of structural policy. At the same time, as the basic  goal-oriented task it is necessary to utilize, on the one hand,  the demand for the preservation and support of advanced  technologies and, on the other, the inevitable suspension of  especially harmful and ecologically dangerous backward  technologies.    Only by promoting advanced technical thought and destroying  and rendering obsolete technological processes harmless, can we  hope to bring about a new technological spurt and on this basis  to hold a leading place in the world economic community.    It is this process that should form the basis, in the first  case, for investment projects developing and strengthening  existing production and, in the second, for investment projects  servicing procedures for clearing up finances.    2. It is necessary to bring the formation of the base for  the  implementation of investment processes to conclusion with a view  to ensuring the transfer of enterprises into the hands of  individuals, who carry out on the basis of guarantees  responsible management of the property transferred to them,  thereby ensuring at enterprises a transition to a management  regime stimulating a real saving of expenditures.    Without this the launching of any investment project is a  utopia and a deliberately inefficient expenditure of funds.    The process of transition to responsible management can be  carried out:    --through the transfer of rights of ownership of the managed  facility to a real, not washed away, owner, for whom the  investment attractiveness of a given enterprise is already  obvious and who is prepared to carry out investment activity, at  the same time, becoming its "efficient" owner. The  responsibility of the indicated individuals for an efficient  development of investment processes should be ensured by a  sufficient amount of capital invested by them in a given  enterprise.    For this purpose it is necessary to think out procedures for  investment bids and for secondary emission of privatization  enterprises, as well as for privatization for money;    --through the transfer of property for responsible  management  to individuals carrying out investment activity at enterprises  in the process of clearing up their finances under conditions of  strictly regulated responsibility for the results obtained.    In this case there is a need for a legislative base ensuring  the regulation of procedures for responsibility and the  conditions of its occurrence.    3. For the purpose of determining real sources and volumes  of  available state investment resources, it is necessary to  reexamine the distribution of budget funds assigned for the  realization of investment policy and to provide for their  allocation strictly on the goal-oriented programmed principle  according to the established priorities of economic  restructuring.    Taking into consideration that today large national private  capitals and funds of foreign investors are drawn into the  investment process with great caution and that it is naive to  count on their mass inflow until a really existing favorable  investment climate is created, it is necessary to pay special  attention to the population's funds accumulated in various kinds  of accumulating organizations--mainly check investment funds,  nonstate pension funds, and so forth.    With regard to check investment funds we must realize that  the system of accumulation of the population's funds with  mandatory current payments established on their basis at present  under conditions of inflation and the economic crisis does not  meet the constructive goals of its establishment--to be the  social guarantor for the population.    In order to survive, in a short time funds must be  transformed from the apparatus of accumulation and  redistribution of privatization rights in the form of vouchers  into a mechanism of an efficient redistribution of real capital.    In all cases, only by servicing real social needs and being  oriented toward the population's vital interests, not by getting  off with current handouts, can accumulating organizations of any  type and direction acquire a long-term perspective for their  activity.    4. As the main factor permeating the entire investment  infrastructure, it is necessary to apply the new scheme for  bringing investment resources to their direct consumers. Under  existing conditions of inflation and the decline in production  currently existing channels--direct investments and investment  credit--cannot launch the investment process.    Direct investments as a system are not fully justified from  the standpoint of attaining some efficiency. With regard to  investment credits, under the existing procedure of their  allocation, first, they differ little from any other forms of  distribution of "cheap" state funds and, second, are a direct  channel for forcing the inflationary flow. The lack in the  country of investment banks with strict restrictions on the  performance of any other, except investment, operations under  conditions of the difference--incomparable in profitability--in  credit servicing of various spheres of activity inevitably  pushes funds, which are allocated through the credit system for  investment purposes, into the sphere of financial, trade, and  any other business affording the opportunity to obtain a higher,  even to the smallest degree, norm of profit. Thereby, the more  funds for good investment purposes we allocate through the  credit system, the bigger the inflation spiral that we will  eventually get.    In this connection the scheme of portfolio investments is  the  only way of bringing investment resources to investment  processes without system losses. It is necessary to establish a  system of state guarantees for private investments on the basis  of the use of stock market tools, because the stock market is  the main regulator of investment processes in a market-oriented  economy and can reliably protect funds allocated in such a way  against nonpurposeful use.    Establishing and developing a liquid market of securities  with state guarantees issued for real investment processes, we  will be able to initiate the inflow of funds of private  investors (including the population). The indicated approach was  discussed on pages of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, No 14 of this year.  Therefore, we will not further dwell on its description.    The nature of the present state of the stock market, which  fully reflects all the problems of the national economy,  confirms the need to turn to it as to the key tool of  implementation of state investment policy.    On the whole, describing Russia's stock market in 1994, the  crisis unpredictability of its development on the threshold of  the voucher's departure from the arena of actions should be  recognized.    This is evident from the increasing volume of proposals and  rise in the rate of highly risky and unreliable securities.  Attention should also be drawn to the emerging tendency toward  the expanded practice of emission of promissory notes by  commercial banks. In essence, this signifies an additional  uncontrolled monetary emission, which can successfully service  settlements among subjects and blow up monetary circulation in  the country, which is undermined as it is. The intentions of  local authorities in a number of regions, whose finances have  been affected by the nonpayment crisis, to accept bank  promissory notes as tax payments and to pay for their own  expenditures with them are the symptom of this.    On the part of the state a feverish, unsuccessful search for  a financial tool capable of replacing the voucher on the stock  market and of saturating exchange turnovers with a mass liquid  and reliable security continues on the part of the state.  Experiments with the gold certificate and state treasury bonds  do not yet give the proper result.    The obvious inadequacy of the legislative base, which  regulates the activity and development of the stock market and  guarantees the property rights of private investors, who are  owners of securities, creates the possibility for unprecedented  deceptions of the population and dirty speculations.    In order to prevent a future crisis on the stock market  under  these conditions, it is necessary to carry out the intervention  of part of the budget funds, which are intended for the  investment replenishment of the economy, in the establishment of  a liquid stock exchange on the basis of securities guaranteed by  the state and connected with real investment processes, in which  the state is interested. In contrast to the credit mechanism of  investments, a preferential use of the stock market mechanism  for these purposes under present conditions gives three  significant advantages:    --the rate of turnover of invested funds increases sharply;    --a recoverable nature of investments is guaranteed, because  securities for investment projects purchased by the state with  its shareholding are transferred to government agents, who are  responsible for the realization of a given project, for  responsible management with the right of their sale or option.  In this case securities with state guarantees through stock  market channels can be gradually placed among small investors,  or will be transferred to the ownership of the indicated private  structure as an investor;    --the return on investments increases, because the mechanism  of the stock market automatically, on a fair competitive basis,  ensures the selection and financing of the most profitable  investment projects.    The following can be specific stock market tools, which  realize state guarantees for investment projects with state  shareholding:    --shares with guarantees of buyout or the payment of  dividends for specific technologies depending on the periods of  realization and other characteristics of the project. Such a  variant can be envisaged in case of the realization of a new or  the development of an already existing technological process;    --promissory notes with a regulated recording procedure and  a  discount rate guaranteed by means of a certain regulation. These  kinds of schemes can be used in case of the realization of  investment projects connected with the clearing up of finances  at enterprises. It must be stated that the first tests in this  direction are already being performed. In April Russia's  Ministry of Finance began the preparation of the output and  organization of a secondary circulation of a new state  security--the state treasury bill.    The development of the transparency of the stock market,  which is connected primarily with an improvement in the  operation of stock exchanges both on a professional plane and  from the standpoint of their technical support, is the most  important and necessary component of success of the proposed  approach.    5. The proposed concept of state investment policy should be  realized by giving wide powers, which also presuppose increased  responsibility, to organizers of investment processes as  represented by nonstate structures--government agents  establishing their guaranteed funds on the basis of state  guarantees. The essence of these powers can lie in the right to  choose specific investment projects of commercial interest  within the framework of investment programs approved by the  government according to the priorities of structural policy.    In order to ensure state guarantees in the form presented  above, along with the use of funds allocated from the budget for  investment purposes, it will be necessary to include the  resources of Russia's Central Bank as an insurance reserve for  the coverage of possible losses. The indicated credit could be  determined in the ratio of 10:1 with respect to the total amount  of security obligations guaranteed by the state.    The state should guarantee responsibility for a successful  realization of an investment project not to its organizer and  direct implementer, but to persons attracted as passive  investors, who have entrusted their funds to this process. A  government agent should undertake the remaining responsibility  and, accordingly, guarantees in exchange for the powers  delegated to him.    The multiplicative effect of guaranteed securities, when  everyone along the vertical line, beginning with the state and  ending with commercial banks, begins to act as a guarantor, is  possible only on this basis. The formation of rational and  efficient financial and industrial groups concentrated around  the investment process and assuming their share of  responsibility is possible only on this basis.    6. For the purpose of a complete realization of the  expressed  approaches, which excludes distortions, it is necessary to carry  out significant preparatory work on the establishment of the  necessary legislative base, primarily on problems of setting  rules of responsibility for actions carried out within the  framework of the indicated processes and of the conditions of  its onset.    It is necessary to work out legislative norms regulating  responsible management of property (not its transfer to  trusteeship), implying by this all possible variants and objects  of management.    The urgency of such a formulation is determined by the fact  that the sufficiency of guarantees in any case, with the  exception of the state, is ensured primarily by strong judicial  and legal protection based on existing legislation. The solution  of the problem at the level of subordinate legislation is not  sufficient as a legislative base during court examination. In  this connection it is a matter of the development of an entire  package of legislative acts with the indicated direction.    In conclusion it must be said that any of the proposed  schemes can be doomed to failure if we, each of us, do not  realize that only by treating the matter from the standpoint of  responsibility, not personal mercenary interest, only by feeling  personal responsibility for our country's future, will we be  able to build a new society worthy of our children.    We have no other choice!</p>

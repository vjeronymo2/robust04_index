			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI FEST HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'A Taxing Woman's Return'  </P> <P> Japan, 1988, 127 minutes  </P> <P> 9:00 p.m.  </P> <P>  Once again Nobuko Miyamoto plays that most implacable of tax inspectors, but  this time her husband Juzo Itami's comedy is actually more accessible than the  original. Instead of spoofing the specific foibles of the inscrutable Japanese  tax system Itami this time comments with pitch-dark, fatalistic humor on  widespread corruption at the highest levels of government. As before, Itami  displays unflagging energy and panache as Miyamoto zeroes in on the sleek head  of a lucrative religious cult, played suavely by the veteran Rentaro Mikuni.

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'New agenda' on crime urged THE silent majority must speak up against crime, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, told the Police Federation conference in Blackpool yesterday. He called for a new national consensus based on the principles of partnership and shared responsibility where 'police, public and politicians work together to construct a modern agenda for safer communities and to turn despair into hope.' Mr Blair won a more enthusiastic reception from the conference than Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, when he addressed it on Wednesday. Delegates cheered loudly at the end of a speech in which Mr Blair said an entirely new approach was needed in the fight against crime. Public morale on the issue was low, the Crown Prosecution Service was under pressure and court procedures were outdated. Parts of the criminal justice system were teetering on the brink of collapse. 'A country that prides itself on its standards and its civilisation is tolerating a dangerous and growing sickness that makes a mockery of those standards and undermines those civilised values.' Mr Blair said that while only a fool would excuse the commission of crime on the grounds of an individual's upbringing, only a bigot would deny the impact of broken homes, poverty, unemployment, poor housing and lack of education. Attacking the government's record, he said there was no point in complaining about juvenile crime and then shutting down residential home places; or admitting that there was a relationship between the economy and crime and then cutting 300,000 training places since 1981. The federation's first debate on freemasonry yesterday led to the defeat of a motion declaring that membership of the movement was not conducive to the independence of the police. Proposers of the motion had sought a compulsory registers of freemasons in the police service.</p>

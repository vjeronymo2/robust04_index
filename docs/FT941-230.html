			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / How the British blundered in Brussels Britain's decision to pick a fight with her EU partners over voting rights is more than a political disaster for Mr John Major. As the British prime minister battles for survival in London, the view is gaining ground in Brussels that his government's tactics during the enlargement negotiations could turn into a serious long-term diplomatic setback in Europe. 'There's nothing new about Britain being criticised about her attitude to European integration,' said one senior Commission official yesterday. 'What's new is that Finland, Sweden, Austria, and Norway thought they had a British friend, but in the end their friend turned out to be Germany.' Germany is the big winner as a result of enlargement. Vigorous Bonn diplomacy has kept prospects bright for bringing in four wealthy neighbours into the European Union by January 1, 1995, lightening Germany's burden as the paymaster of Europe and expanding her role as the power-broker at the heart of the Continent. As a champion of a wider Europe, Britain was well-placed to take joint credit with Germany for expanding the Union from 12 to 16 new members. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, passed up a mouth-watering opportunity: instead of standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, Mr Hurd found himself trapped in all-night arguments in Brussels, arguing a brief in which he had little confidence. How did this come about? Aside from political misjudgements by the UK cabinet inside Downing Street, it seems that the British Foreign Office fundamentally miscalculated in their assessment of how their European partners would respond to UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules in an expanded Union. These rules prevent two large countries and one small member state being out-voted, with 23 votes at present needed to muster a 'blocking minority'. For the past six months, senior British officials, including Sir John Kerr, the permanent UK ambassador to the EU in Brussels, held out hopes of persuading the large member states to sign up to the 23-vote blocking minority. Ironically, they placed most of their bets on Germany on the grounds that Bonn would agree to almost anything in the interests of keeping enlargement on track. UK policy rested on five other assumptions. France, Spain and Italy would support enlargement, but not if it further distorted the relationship between a country's voting strength and its population. Increasing the blocking minority from 23 to 27 would mean that a combination of smaller states could out-vote large states representing 40 per cent of the population, an important democratic principle which the majority of member states would not ignore. Most states were at best neutral on voting rights, with only federalist Belgium, Holland, and 'plucky little Luxembourg' arguing strongly for an increase. Rising French and German concern about encroachment by Brussels strengthed the case for making EU decision-making more difficult. The flaw was that while France and Germany shared many of these doubts, neither wanted to open up the question of power-sharing ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. 'We don't want another constitutional debate,' said one senior French official. Bonn in particular expressed horror at the idea of linking population to voting weights, because it would mean a more populous Germany acquiring more votes than France, thus jeopardising relations with its closest ally. In one Brussels session, German officials warned the British that they risked stirring up German nationalism in an already sensitive election year. Lastly, no member state wanted to be accused of jamming the EU's decision-making. After labouring to ratify Maastricht, 'the member states are committed to making the treaty work', said a senior EU official. Mr Peter Ludlow, head of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, believes that the Foreign Office's misreading of the intentions of her EU partners on the voting rights issue is as serious as any since 1945. Britain can still claim that though it lost a battle, it may win the war. Voting rights and institutional reform will be tackled 'root and branch' at the 1996 conference, combined with planning for a Union of 20-25 member states, including the east Europeans, according to Mr Hurd. The EU's tilt eastward has already aroused misgivings in France. These may grow as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic press to join the Union by the end of the century, and the Baltic states take encouragement from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for their own candidacy. At this point, Britain is likely to face a choice much more difficult than the argument over voting rights. For all British diplomats' claims that the UK is relaxed about the shift eastward, their views rest on the assumption that 'widening' will not mean 'deepening'. The setback in this round of enlargement means that Britain's hand will be much weaker - and Germany's much stronger - than it might have been ahead of the 1996 review.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Kallinikou] </F>   [Excerpts] Nicosia and Athens yesterday expressed  satisfaction with the contents of the UN secretary general's  report to the Security Council, whereas [Turkish Cypriot Leader]  Rauf Denktas launched an attack against Butrus Butrus-Ghali.  Most Cypriot political parties also expressed satisfaction with  the fact that the report very clearly blames the impasse on the  Turkish side and that, for the first time, the Turkish side's  lack of political will has been recorded. However, AKEL  [Restorative Party of the Working People] expressed concern and  the Free Democrats Movement [former President Yeoryios  Vasiliou's party] expressed the view that...the Turkish side has  been reinforced. [passage omitted]    AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he  does not believe that we should be happy with the report because  the secretary general admits that the package of  confidence-building measures is clearly in favor of the Turkish  Cypriot side and that among the alternative actions more weight  is given to the option of continuing the discussion of the  confidence-building measures, even though the report refers to  taking strong measures against Denktas. Khristofias said: "We  would combine the discussion of the substance of the Cyprus  issue with the assumption of practical and strong measures,  which would force Denktas and Turkey to discuss the substance of  the issue on the basis of UN resolutions." He also added that  no one has the right to celebrate about anything.    DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said: "At  first glance, it is evident that the UN secretary general's  report clearly blames the lack of agreement on the  confidence-building measures on the Turkish Cypriot side. He  says that there is no political will, but he does not mention  Turkey clearly. He should have had the courage to name Turkey.  He also refers to others in the region who do not have the  political will. I want to believe that he implies Turkey, and  not anyone else." Kiprianou also stressed the need to remind  the international community that the Cyprus issue is a problem  of invasion, occupation, settlement, and violation of human  rights.    EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Vice Chairman Takis  Khatzidhimitriou stressed that the report does include, at least  theoretically, the possibility for measures to be taken against  Denktas. Khatzidhimitriou said that in his report the secretary  general appears, even if only a little, to imply that Turkey  does not have the political will for a solution to the Cyprus  problem. For the first time, he said, there is also a reference  to measures, something we are not used to hearing from the  secretary general. He added that the report is lenient but the  reference to possibilities that could be used in the future  gives our side the opportunity to assume initiatives.    Liberal Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis described the UN  secretary general's report as exquisite. He said: "In his  report, the secretary general stressed his clear concern for  Cyprus and the lack of progress on the problem. The worst  alternative for our side is the withdrawal of the United Nations  from Cyprus as a peacekeeping force and as a political presence;  the second worst alternative is to return to Butrus-Ghali's set  of concepts; the third worst is to continue with the  confidence-building measures and some other plan, including an  idea to take measures against the Turkish Cypriots. It is clear  that if President Glavkos Kliridhis had not followed the policy  he did our position now would have been difficult, and I think  that the only alternative now would have been for the United  Nations to withdraw from Cyprus."    Free Democrats Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou described the  report as objective. However, he added that the report shows  how big a mistake it was to get involved in the dialogue on the  confidence- building measures. Vasiliou said: "The report is  objective, but it does not give anyone the right to celebrate.  On the contrary, it shows how big a mistake it was to begin  these negotiations on the confidence-building measures and how,  as a result of these negotiations, the Turkish Cypriot side has  been reinforced and our side has become weaker."    Finally, ADISOK [Democratic Socialist Renewal Movement]  Chairman Mikhail Papapetrou expressed satisfaction with the  report because it clearly blames the Turkish side for the  impasse and states that the lack of political will by the  Turkish side systematically blocks all the efforts for a  solution to the Cyprus problem. In addition, he said, for the  first time the report mentions measures to pressure the Turkish  side. Furthermore, Papapetrou said that the UN secretary  general's report creates future prospects for the issue and also  confirms the correctness of the political forces that have  supported the confidence-building measures.

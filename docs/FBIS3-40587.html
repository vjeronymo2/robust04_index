The failure has led Islamabad to announced that as result it  is not ready to schedule future talks with New Delhi though in  principle it agrees that dialogue is the only answer to Kashmir.    This is indicated in the sketchy joint statement released to  the media which appears as a mere formality but which Shaharyar  M Khan described as a "step forward even though it was a small  step".    "We are as far apart on the core issue (Kashmir) as we were  earlier. Because of this divergence it is correct to say that on  the central issue there has been no forward movement. We shall  not schedule any talks at the Foreign Secretary or any other  level unless there is a qualitative and visible change in  Kashmir" commented a determined Shaharyar M Khan at the  Islamabad Airport after seeing off his Indian counterpart J N  Dixit.    The latter agreed when he said, "We are in the same position  as we started. But it is not necessary to accomplish something  for achievement. To say that there has been no accomplishment is  a valued judgement".    In all nearly six hours were consumed in the four rounds  between the two countries wherein both sides maintained their  traditional stands. Official sources here described the talks as  "those which in no way made any headway and nor did the Indian  side give us andy assurances". They also maintained that  Pakistan had a choice either to announce these parleys as a  "failure" or to keep the option in its hand for the future. It  opted for the latter which is indicated in the last paragraph of  a joint statement which says that "the two sides will consult  each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign  Secretary or other level".    Earlier both Shaharyar and Dixit met with the media flanked  by their two High Commissioners and senior officials of the  Foreign Office, Shafqat Kakakhel and Munir Akram.    Dixit disclosed that he had held some preliminary discussion  on some suggestions which both sides will now ponder over on how  to proceed further with.    Shaharyar elaborated that in about two weeks time they  (Indians) will come back to them on other outstanding issues  like the Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage and Sir Creek. "We will  look at the position papers but Pakistan's position is well  known and we will now see the position adopted by India. We will  take position after that", Shaharyar added.    The media was unprepared for the manner in which Dixit chose  to reply to their queries. It is rare that the press is faced  with such "diplomatic rudeness" in response to some very  relevant questions. The Indian Foreign Secretary last his [words  indistinct] when [words indistinct] Delhi's stand ond the UN  Resolution on Kashmir. Earlier he had not elaborated on the  issue except to say that: "Indian position on the relevance of  the UN Resolution has been articulated more than once. The  provocative question does not need an answer."    However Shaharyar made it a point to meet with the media  once  again after his Indian counterpart had left for home to  elaborate Pakistan's point of view. Referring to the UN  Resolution on Kashmir he said "I made it very clear that no  matter how old the UN Resolutions are, they are as valid today  as they were before. The same argument goes for the Simla  Accord. If it has not led to any result one does not say that it  cannot be applied. We are ready to discuss the modalities of the  UN Resolution."    Dixit refused to come to terms with the conditions, that  Pakistan insists are the Prerequisite for any meaningful  dialogue on Kashmir. He felt. "We are aware of these four  conditions. I conveyed to the Foreign Minister that when you are  negotiating an intractabable problem you cannot do so without  preconditions. "Source indicate that the Foreign Minister did  not mince his words on his government's stand in his meeting  with the visiting Secretary.    Shaharyar later said that for Pakistan the people of Kashmir  are the "central players" and pointed out that Pakistan believed  that everyone concerned at the Secretary level talks agreed with  this. Dixit felt that "for any any political solution the people  of Jammu and Kashmir would be taken into confidence." Shaharyar  reiterated tht plebiscite was essential for the people of  Kashmir. Dixit was informed that lowering of tensions meant that  first the Kashmiri jailed leaders should be released. "People of  Kashmir should be allowed to breathe and put across their point  of view. We believe that as elsewhere the leadership should  participate in their destiny", he said.    Shaharyar in the presence of Dixit maintained that Pakistan  retained its option to table its resolution on human rights  before UN which it had withheld so far. Dixit did not let this  opportunity pass when he added, "the government and people of  India are ready to live with the UN Resolution whether it is  tabled or not."    Pakistan meanwhile still sees a silver lining in future  talks  as Shaharyar said, "as long as we can sit and talk the other  dangers would recede."</p>

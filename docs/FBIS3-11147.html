			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the visit by  Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for  inter-American affairs, was very important and beneficial for  Nicaragua and that it shows U.S. President Bill Clinton's full  support for the Nicaraguan democratic process and the Violeta  Barrios de Chamorro administration.    [Begin recording] [Lacayo] We believe the visit was very  beneficial, productive, and good for Nicaraguans. Mr. Watson  clearly expressed the Clinton administration's policy on  Nicaragua in his speech at noon yesterday. He also reaffirmed  what Ambassador Maisto said here in September.    Watson said problems in Nicaragua should be resolved by  Nicaraguans for Nicaragua. This is indeed a great advancement,  because previous U.S. administrations had another way of looking  at things.    He also said this administration should end its  constitutional presidential term normally and turn the  government over to the duly elected president in the same way  that [words indistinct] elected. He thus expressed total support  for the democratic principles, the institutionalization of the  electoral process, as well as his clear support for the  government of Violeta de Chamorro, prompting it to continue its  path toward peace, democracy, and the improvement of our economy.    We are very happy with Watson's visit and believe he was  also  quite satisfied with the talks he held with several sectors. I  think the visit has improved relations between Nicaragua and the  United States and has committed the Clinton administration to  supporting the work done by Nicaraguans.    [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Lacayo] We, through our foreign minister, have already  expressed the government's point of view on the human rights  report. We believe the report is outdated and does not reflect  the real situation in Nicaragua. It is written in very obscure  language and does not reflect the efforts made by the government  and all Nicaraguans to live in peace. The people who wrote the  report were not objective. We stated our position more than a  month ago when the report first came out, and I reiterate it on  this occasion. We also understand that other sectors in the  country commented on the report to Watson. [end recording]    Engineer Lacayo also touched on the topic of the massive  evictions and said such issues are basically handled by the  judicial branch.    [Begin Lacayo recording] It is a matter that concerns the  judicial branch exclusively. The judges are responsible for  such issues. The National Police force, in accordance with the  law, responds to a judge's call when he requests the support of  the police. We are, however, very concerned because we have  seen a [words indistinct] and it could be that judges have acted  illegally in certain cases. That is very dangerous. We have  already contacted the Supreme Court [words indistinct] to  express our concern and [words indistinct] that all the judges  are acting in accordance with the law. [end recording]</p>

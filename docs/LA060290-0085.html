			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON PLANS UNLEADED LOW-EMISSIONS GASOLINE  </P> <P> Chevron Corp. is test-marketing a lower-emissions gasoline in Florida and plans  to introduce a version of it on the West Coast in the near future, Chevron  dealers said Friday.  </P> <P> The new gasoline, to be called Chevron Unleaded Plus, is similar in composition  to Atlantic Richfield Co.'s EC-1 gasoline, the first of several lower-emissions  gasolines to hit the market in the last several months, dealers said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Arco confirmed that it may come out with another reformulated  gasoline to accompany EC-1 as soon as this fall. EC-1, which was introduced in  September, is sold to cars that previously used only leaded gasoline.  </P> <P> Arco's new lower-emissions gasoline, code-named EC-X, would be marketed to cars  that use unleaded gas, possibly as a premium grade such as Shell's new SU  2000E.  </P> <P> Few other details concerning Chevron's new gasoline were available, and a  Chevron spokeswoman in San Francisco declined to comment.  </P> <P> If Chevron proceeds with plans to market such a gasoline, it will join seven  other major oil companies marketing some form of so-called reformulated  gasoline in various parts of the country. Exxon Corp. began selling a  reformulated gasoline in 20 Eastern and Gulf Coast states on Friday.  </P> <P> At least two more refiners are planning similar introductions.  </P> <P> In an interview, George H. Babikian, president of Arco's refining and marketing  subsidiary, said the company had not made up its mind yet on how to proceed  with its new gasoline.  </P></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: A theme for success - Alastair Macaulay looks back at McMaster's third Edinburgh If you go to the Edinburgh Festival to cover just one art form, you miss the point. And, in particular, you miss the point of the festival as it has been directed for three years now by Brian McMaster. This is particularly clear in the case of this year's theatre. Chances are if you went only to plays this Edinburgh, you had a mediocre time. And yet there was excellent drama to be seen in the official Edinburgh festival this year, though not in the area strictly labelled theatre. Two of the 1994 operatic stagings - Tim Albery's Fidelio and the Jeremy Sams-Michael Wilcox version of Chabrier's Le Roi malgre lui, both receiving their world premieres here - were better than any of the official plays: better in creating coherent stage worlds and in catching all the various moods present in their respective dramas. And the most potent and imaginative and daring theatre of all occurred in the Merce Cunningham double bill, Mark Morris's L'Allegro, Penseroso, Moderato, and four of the Miami City Ballet Balanchine productions - Emeralds, Rubies, Serenade, The Four Temperaments. If you wanted to find out that movement in time and space could be profoundly expressive this summer, Edinburgh was the only place in the world to be. But everything about McMaster's Edinburgh suggests that for him music is the holiest of the arts; or, at any rate, everything about his festival confirms my belief that music is the holiest of the arts. This must be why McMaster keeps inviting Morris back to give us more each year, and why it now seems to us that Morris belongs in the Edinburgh Festival. For dance people, this year's Edinburgh was, of course, a bonanza. Or, to put it another way, if bombs had dropped on the three main companies appearing here this year, there would be next to no dance left in the world worthy of the name. For those of us who love human movement, there were other places to find it memorably presented: for example, in the Albery Fidelio. I have never seen the finale so vivified - achieved by revealing musicality. But let us try further to read the McMaster mind as it presents itself in his festival. He likes to have themes, and two of this year's theme artists  -Goethe and Beethoven - were wonderful choices. Beethoven was covered in depth - all nine symphonies, all five piano concerti, a Fidelio day, five programmes of his string quartets, five concerts of piano sonatas - and the pleasure of this was that one can discover different Beethovens. Goethe was not shown in anything like his full range, but was shown as a potent influence on music: in Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust, in the second half of Mahler's Eighth Symphony, and in songs by Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf and even Verdi. And  - whether or not you admire it as a play, or admired the production it received here - everyone can or should agree that his Tasso is just the kind of play that is ideal for revival in a festival such as this. The beauty of the Goethe-Beethoven combination goes further. It ties in with the concurrent exhibition of The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990; and so light is cast on the past two centuries of German culture, and on all Romantic and post-Romantic art. McMaster's other musical theme this year was Chabrier. The more honour to McMaster, for, although this is the centenary of Chabrier's death, no such celebration is occurring in his native France. But more planning could have gone into this. Chabrier's considerable and delectable output of songs and piano music was confined to a mildly gruesome late-night cabaret, narrated in ponderously mellow tones by Dennis Quilley and sung in pinched English tones by Linda Kitchen and Philip Salmon. Not until Jeremy Sams's Gilbert-and-Chabrier revision of Le Roi malgre lui did I encounter Chabrier as I had hoped; and the degree to which Sams and his co-librettist Michael Wilcox have let Chabrier's music be their guide was (especially when you hear this music) a minor miracle. In these respects, despite this or that, McMaster seems to direct a festival from a core of belief and interest in the arts. But a different McMaster emerges when we examine the spoken theatre he has presented this year (and last year too). The only theme here is Director's Theatre. I would hate to see Edinburgh in competition with Salzburg or anywhere else to become the latest smart showcase for next-wave ways of directing theatre. McMaster began two years ago by having two theme playwrights, and it would surely be truer to the spirit of Edinburgh - truer, I hope to the spirit of McMaster too - if he returned to this. If he can give us four different programmes of dear little Chabrier, he might consider doing the same by (say) Goldoni, or Pinter, or Lope de Vega, or Marlowe, or Marivaux. But what 'makes' the Edinburgh festival is its least-buzzed aspect; its concerts. Even though this festival taught me that there a few famous works by Beethoven I am in no hurry to hear again, the Beethoven experience - the continuing discovery of the extraordinary diversity of Beethoven's mind - kept growing as I went from one concert to the next. No festival could be more physically exhausting than McMaster's Edinburgh, or more spiritually invigorating.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHULER TO INTERVIEW FOR POST WITH CLIPPERS  </P> <P> Mike Schuler, the National Basketball Assn. coach of the year in 1986-87 with  the Portland Trail Blazers, is expected to come to Los Angeles later in the  week to be interviewed for the vacant Clippers' position, team officials  confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> He would become the only person to meet with Clipper officials about the job  besides Don Casey, the interim coach since Jan. 19.  </P> <P> Schuler, who could not be reached for comment, spent 2 1/2 seasons with the  Trail Blazers before being fired on Feb. 18. He joined Golden State as a scout  for the final months of the season, and had a standing offer to join the  Warriors as one of Don Nelson's assistant coaches for 1989-90 if he wanted.  </P> <P> A former assistant under Nelson at Milwaukee and Larry Brown at New Jersey,  Schuler became the ninth coach in NBA history to win 100 games in his first two  seasons, guiding the Trail Blazers to a 102-62 record (a 62.2 winning  percentage). But on-going reports of friction with players, especially star  Clyde Drexler, led to his firing. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER  </P></p>

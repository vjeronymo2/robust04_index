			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Members of  Ukraine's working delegation to Washington attended a briefing  at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 17 May. Ukraine's Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the delegation, believes the  signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding between the  governments of Ukraine and the United States on the transfer of  missile equipment and technology has become an important step in  Ukraine's accession to the world distribution of labor in the  implementation of space programs, since no country owns a  complete production cycle in this area. The document also  illustrates the fact that "Ukraine has joined the group of  civilized countries, instead of falling to the level of Iraq or  North Korea."    In the course of negotiations, the Ukrainian side managed to  persuade the United States to lift the clause in the agreement  on space cooperation between the United States and Russia that  concerns the countries of the former Soviet Union as one which  infringes upon the rights of the third party.    Giving a generally favorable assessment of the trip's  results, Valeriy Kazakov, deputy minister of machine-building,  military- industrial complex, and conversion, said that despite  U.S. assurances of a fine state of relations between the United  States and Ukraine, economic cooperation and work in the sphere  of conversion is proceeding slowly. A great deal of attention  during the visit was paid to the intensification of conversion  programs. For example, it was possible to agree to a list of 35  enterprises subject to immediate restructuring. The U.S. side  has allocated 20 million dollars to this end.    Asked by UNIAN to comment on the breakthrough in the U.S.  attitude to Ukraine, Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said  it reflected international reality and our country's consistent  policy stance. Tarasyuk emphasized that this change began after  the signing of the trilateral statement by Ukraine, Russia, and  the United States.</p>

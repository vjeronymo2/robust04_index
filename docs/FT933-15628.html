			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hail to the cabbie The Regent, London's newest luxury hotel, officially opens its doors today. A magnificent reconstruction of the Great Central, one of Victorian England's grand railway hotels, the Regent, on Marylebone Road, retains much of its original stained glass and boasts an eight-storey, glass-roofed atrium. The problem is that few people know where it is. To counter this, the Regent, part of the Canadian Four Seasons group, began a campaign late last year to ensure that guests who asked to be taken to the hotel were not greeted with blank incomprehension by London's taxi drivers. The hotel placed an advertisement in Taxi Newspaper, journal of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, last December offering readers a free packed continental breakfast if they came to the hotel between 5.30 am and 7.30 am. The offer was repeated in February. Seven hundred breakfasts were served. Each driver who brought a coupon from the ad was also given three books of receipts to give their customers. The receipts had the Regent's name on the back. On Park Lane, a better-known hotel district, the Inn on the Park, also part of the Four Seasons group, has turned to taxi drivers, too. The Inn on the Park is one of London's best-known and most highly-regarded hotels. Five years ago, it changed its name to The Four Seasons Inn on the Park, but most people sensibly ignored this mouthful and continued to use the old name. Last week the hotel shortened its name to the Four Seasons, raising the prospect of further confusion. A few weeks ago, the Inn on the Park placed an advertisement telling Taxi Newspaper readers it was changing the name. The hotel followed up with a competition, asking questions about six other cities which have Four Seasons hotels. The winner gets a week for two at a Four Seasons hotel in the US, along with Dollars 300 (Pounds 200) to spend on taxi fares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduardo dos Santos' criminal agenda includes a  highly inhuman plan -- to prevent at all costs the residents of  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA]-administered territory from receiving any humanitarian  assistance. Accordingly, the regime has instructed its air  force to bomb the airports of several cities controlled by UNITA  with a view to destroying them. The residents of Uige have  already been hit, following an attack on the airport of N'gage.  [passage indistinct]    In Bie Province, the Luanda regime's fighter bombers  massacred civilians in Calucinga Commune at 1400 on 6 May.

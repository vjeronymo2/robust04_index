			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- According to  UNIAN, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to  Ukraine, Ukraine's foreign affairs minister was given a  memorandum that explained the official U.S. position with regard  to cooperation with Ukraine in the missiles and space sphere.  The document, in particular, concerns the obligatory terms  under which the United States will consider it possible to  establish mutual relations between the two states in the  above-mentioned sphere: Ukraine's accession to the Missile  Technology Control Regime (MTCR), to the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and its refusal to  manufacture offensive missile systems according to MTCR  categories and classifications. Stressing that the United  States ``will not assist and will not engage in trade if such  activity contributes to the development of systems in the MTCR  category and even space carrier rockets,'' the U.S. side noted  Ukraine's interest to accede to the MTCR which has recently been  established and is ready to assist Ukraine in this.    During William Perry's visit, a preliminary agreement was  also reached about the fact that the U.S. side would, at the end  of April, conduct further talks with Ukraine on these issues.  On 12 April, during a news conference on the occasion of World  Aviation and Cosmonaut Day, in reply to a question from a UNIAN  correspondent whether such talks would take place, Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov said that work in this area was  underway. Ukraine in particular is ``attempting to convince the  U.S. to be somewhat more considered in its attitudes to the  realities that Ukraine finds itself in.'' The deputy prime  minister stressed, in particular, that directness and  unambiguity in the talks could lead to Ukraine losing its rocket  technology and personnel, and it is not known where Ukraine  would end up tomorrow. In Valeriy Shmarov's words, in the last  few days, a letter was received by him from William Perry in  which the ``U.S. side agreed with us on many things,'' and  undoubtedly by the end of April there would be consultations and  an exchange of views on this matter.    Based on the course of the talks and development of events  in  Ukraine itself, Valeriy Shmarov expressed certainty that Ukraine  would accede to the MTCR and will become the founder of a new  Cocom regime. According to information received by UNIAN on the  same day, as a political step toward Ukraine's full membership  of MTCR, the United States has proposed the conclusion of a  bilateral U.S.-Ukrainian agreement with the aim of acceding to  the main principles of MTCR.</p>

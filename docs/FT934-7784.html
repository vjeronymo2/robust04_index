			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris shares hit by warning of cost cuts SHARES in Philip Morris fell yesterday after the US tobacco and food products group revealed it might take a fourth-quarter charge against earnings. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette-maker, said it would present several options for cutting costs in its tobacco and food operations at a board meeting next Wednesday. The stock closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at 55 7/8 on Wall Street after Merrill Lynch downgraded its rating on the issue. The SEC filing, however, was not unexpected. Revenues from its US tobacco operations have fallen sharply since April, when the company slashed cigarette prices by 40 cents a pack as part of a strategy to stem a declining market share for Marlboro and other premium brands. In the third quarter, net income was down 25 per cent from the 1992 level. In October, the group warned that lower cigarette pricing and the market's continued volatility would 'make fourth-quarter earning comparison unfavourable'. Mr Ron Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson, the New York securities house, said he 'would not be surprised' if the cost-cutting measures under consideration included redundancies and plant closures. He estimated the charge at about Dollars 100m. In the final quarter of 1992, the group posted net income of Dollars 1.9bn, or Dollars 1.34. Last week, Philip Morris said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by four cents a pack, matching an increase by RJR Nabisco and other cigarette manufacturers. Analysts responded to the move by upgrading their estimates of 1994 earnings.</p>

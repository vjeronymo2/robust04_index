			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U. OF FLORIDA ADMITS 6 RULE VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> The University of Florida acknowledged six major rules violations during an  NCAA investigation but disputed an allegation that the infractions demonstrated  a lack of institutional control of the school's football and basketball  programs.  </P> <P> The university's response to an official letter of inquiry detailing 10 alleged  violations concluded that five infractions were the result of conduct by  coaches that could not be detected by the school's monitoring system "or any  other compliance program."  </P> <P> One other violation occurred because of a clerical error, the school said.  </P> <P> A seventh infraction, one not included in the NCAA allegations, was  self-reported and was linked to an apparent misunderstanding of NCAA  legislation.  </P> <P> Officials submitted the response to the NCAA last week but delayed making it  public until today to give attorneys time to delete the names of students  mentioned in 1,100 pages of documents.  </P> <P> The NCAA began investigating alleged wrongdoing in the football and basketball  programs last year. The Southeastern Conference school received an official  letter of inquiry detailing 10 alleged violations -- six of them considered  major -- in May.  </P> <P> Florida acknowledged allegations that former football Coach Galen Hall provided  improper salary supplements to two assistant coaches and arranged the payment  of child support for a former player.  </P> <P> The school also acknowledged that former basketball Coach Norm Sloan arranged  for an airline ticket for ex-Gator star Vernon Maxwell to attend a summer camp  in Boston and that Maxwell hired an agent during his junior season and should  have been ineligible to compete in the NCAA Tournament in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> The response focused on reforms instituted in the athletic department in the  last six years and emphasized the swift corrective action taken when violations  were discovered.  </P> <P> Hall and Sloan were forced to resign last fall within a few weeks of one  another. University President John V. Lombardi believes that hiring Steve  Spurrier to head the football program and luring Lon Kruger from Kansas State  to coach basketball also were moves that demonstrate Florida is headed in the  right direction.  </P> <P> Lombardi said earlier this month that the university's defense would address  the most serious of the charges -- one alleging a lack of institutional control  -- by demonstrating the safeguards built into the athletic department's  monitoring system since 1984, when the NCAA placed Florida on probation for  football infractions.  </P> <P> Although Lombardi has acknowledged that the Gators could be candidates for the  NCAA's so-called death penalty -- the temporary suspension of either or both  sports -- he said he doesn't expect such punishment.  </P></p>

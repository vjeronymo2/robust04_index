			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lhasa, January 12 (XINHUA) -- "Project Hope", which  aims to help school dropouts in poverty-stricken areas to return  to school, has received strong support from the Tibetan  Government and people since it was launched here two years ago.    According to the Tibet Youth Development Foundation, in the  past two years, over 300,000 people have contributed to the  project, involving one-seventh of the region's total population.    By the end of last year, the foundation had raised a total  of  600,000 yuan (70,000 U.S. dollars), 200,000 yuan (23,000 U.S.  dollars) more than in 1992.    Although the project started in Tibet Autonomous Region  three  years later than in other parts of China, it has made remarkable  progress due to support from the local government and people.    "What we gain from `Project Hope' is more than just building  some schools or helping a large number of school dropouts in  Tibet return to school," said He Chongmin, secretary-general of  the foundation. "More important, it has created an atmosphere in  which every one pays attention to education."    In the summer of 1992, when the project started in Tibet,  all  the regional leaders attended a donation function to show their  support.    Yangbai, a Tibetan retired road-mender who had been leading  a  frugal life, donated all the 7,000 yuan (800 U.S. dollars) she  saved over the years when she heard of the project.    Doje, director of the Transportation Bureau in Xigaze, did  not forget to donate 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars) to the project  when he was dying.    In addition, the project has received aid from other Chinese  areas as well as overseas regions.    In 1992, Tibet signed an agreement with the China Youth  Development Foundation, who pledged to help build at least two  primary schools and offered 200,000 yuan (22,000 U.S. dollars)  each year to the region.    A major corporation in Macao also donated 500,000 yuan  (56,000 U.S. dollars) to the project in Tibet.    To properly use the money, Tibet has not copied other  provinces in carrying out the project. Officials found that it  is the huge area and limited number of schools that result in  school dropouts. From some remote pasture areas, it takes three  days on horseback to reach a school.    For education to penetrate into every corner of the broad  plateau, the region has put its focus on building more schools,  although this consumes more money and energy.    By 1995, the region will have set up 22 primary schools.    Meanwhile, the Tibet Youth Development Foundation is  considering earmarking funds for those students in the interior  areas who cannot afford to go to college. Scholarships are also  expected to be established in newly-built primary schools to  promote teaching quality.    So far, eight schools have been built up in Tibet,  recruiting  more than 1,000 school dropouts.</p>

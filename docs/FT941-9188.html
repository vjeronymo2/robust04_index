			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: A new mindset for the manager - Christopher Lorenz reports on the obstacles to change The top management of a very large German company wanted to achieve the Holy Grail of big business everywhere: to make its managers less bureaucratic, more entrepreneurial, more empowered and empowering. All that was needed to change their behaviour, it thought, was for their beliefs and 'culture' to be altered. So it invited a professor, Heinz Thanheiser, to help 'hammer the message into their heads' about the need for change. The fallacy that new beliefs - or 'culture change' - lead automatically to new behaviour is just one of many basic mistakes that companies make when trying to change, renew or 'transform' themselves. Others include lack of sustained leadership of the change process, and too frequent modification of the emphasis and content of the process, according to Thanheiser and Yves Doz, a fellow professor at Insead, the business school near Paris. Another common mistake is to underestimate the extent of the innate barriers against change, which exist in most companies, Thanheiser and Doz argue in a working paper* published under the aegis of Insead's Corporate Renewal Initiative. With few exceptions, big companies suffer a litany of barriers, claim the academics: 'Internal distrust, poor communications, disenfranchised middle management, a low level of employee motivation, stifling of entrepreneurial spirit, slow decision-making, lack of collaboration across internal boundaries, and inhibited learning.' For change processes to succeed against such odds, three complementary steps must be taken, say the academics. Managers need to identify the main external challenge to the company's strategy. The 'organisational context' within which decisions are taken, and the rules governing people's tasks, roles and relationships, must also be altered. And the 'world view', or 'mindset', of managers needs changing by linking it to the company's new strategic thrust. The latter is an especially tough task. In spite of the 'modernisation' of corporate structures and systems, the mindset of most managers appears to have remained remarkably similar to the 'Taylorist' model developed at the beginning of this century (by Frederick Taylor, the 'father' of so-called 'scientific management'). Few modern managers would advocate the exercising of authority in the blatantly coercive ways that Taylor espoused - in order to control 'dumb and lazy workmen', as he put it. But Thanheiser and Doz argue that even in knowledge-intensive companies managers are still influenced by his principles of hierarchical order, narrow specialisation and 'command and control' systems - all of which were designed to achieve the compliance of an uneducated workforce. Modern bureaucracies may use subtler means for achieving compliance, say the duo, but their highly educated managers and 'knowledge workers' are nevertheless 'stifled rather than mobilised to contribute all their intelligence and energy'. This latent energy should be unleashed in almost revolutionary fashion in the change process itself, advise Thanheiser and Doz. Faced with the all-too-frequent barrier of conservatism among senior executives, they argue that 'organisational renewal (often) benefits from the shared expectations, collectively held change agenda, and peer pressure that middle managers can bring'. This is not to say that change processes can only be successful if they start in the middle or near the bottom of an organisation, Thanheiser and Doz emphasise. Unlike many other academics and consultants, they argue that top-down - or 'programmatic' - change can also succeed in certain circumstances. *Regaining competitiveness: a process of organisational renewal.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / US media worries over Clinton sex story: Jurek Martin reports from Washington on how the liberal establishment has reacted to the headline 'His cheatin' heart' Jim Lehrer almost grimaced on the air on Tuesday night. The affable and unflappable co-host of public television's excellent evening news programme told the panel assembled to discuss the latest allegations about President Bill Clinton's sex life that there had been a fair amount of agonising in his shop about whether or not to run with the story. Johnny Apple, magisterial Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, was even more blunt in comments published by the Washington Post. Asked to explain why his newspaper had virtually ignored the story until yesterday morning, when it ran Mrs Hillary Clinton's counter-attack on its front page, he observed: 'I am not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life as governor of Arkansas. I'm certain there are a lot of readers who are interested in that and there are lots of publications they can turn to to slake that thirst.' One is not the Wall Street Journal, no fan of the president and hot on the trail of his financial entanglement with the former chief executive of a now-defunt Arkansas savings and loan institution. Not a word of the sex charges have so far appeared on its pages. The Washington Post itself, the capital's house organ and sometimes arbiter of taste, has been one of the few newspapers to venture an editorial comment. Under the headline 'Once more into the muck', it wrote the charges came 'in tawdry form' and concluded 'the case so far is suspect and far from convincing'. The establishment media is grappling with an increasingly familiar problem - whether or not to play down a story whose sources are extremely suspect, and which has little relevance to governance of the country. The excuse to back into it is any official comment - which has come in the shape of the president's interview with wire service reporters yesterday in which he denied all the allegations and a similar interview with Mrs Clinton on Tuesday - or when it is suggested that the president himself may have intervened to try to pressure or otherwise induce the two Arkansas state troopers not to go ahead with their allegations. It is this latter point which may give the story 'legs', in journalistic parlance. One such 'leg' was apparently removed last night when the troopers said they had never been approached by the White House. This, of course, does not satisfy conservatives who contend that the liberal media establishment is once again protecting one of its own, in the person of a Democratic president. But the generally rough treatment he has received from all media quarters for much of the year indicates a degree of right-wing paranoia. Mr Clinton's die-hard opponents also claim that his alleged behaviour, which they are convinced is not only true but took place during the transition between the election and inauguration, amounts to hypocrisy on a grand scale after he and his wife had assured the public in the wake of the the Gennifer Flowers affair early in the election campaign that their marriage had survived rocky periods and was now in good shape. It may, therefore, have been deliberate that Mrs Clinton, a First Lady like no other before, was chosen, or volunteered, to lead the counter-attack. She did so pungently and with a sense of grievance. Noting that Cliff Jackson, representing the state troopers and understood to be sifting through offers of payment for their stories, had for years been 'obsessed' with her husband, she said: 'I find it not an accident that every time he (Mr Clinton) is on the verge of fulfilling his commitment to the American people, they respond and out comes a new round of these outrageous, terrible stories that people plant for political and financial reasons.' She may have a point. The fullest account of the charges appeared in the American Spectator, the ultra-conservative journal, and was written by David Brock whose previous magnum opus had been a controversial book attempting to debunk Professor Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment against now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The article conceded the corroborating evidence was in short supply and that financial gain, and resentment, appeared to be a motivating factor. It nonetheless devoted 11,000 words to the subject and, in case anybody missed the point, the headline ran 'His cheatin' heart'.</p>

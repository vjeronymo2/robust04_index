			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLISTICS FLAW CITED; MURDER COUNT DROPPED  </P> <P> For the second time in recent months, prosecutors dropped charges against a  high-profile murder suspect because of disputed ballistics work by a Los  Angeles Police Department firearms examiner.  </P> <P> Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped their case against Alex Marti, 27, who had  been charged in the murder of a suspected drug dealer whose body was found in  Bel-Air two years ago. Marti is still in jail in connection with the apparently  unrelated "Cotton Club" case, facing trial along with two others in the 1983  execution of Broadway promoter Roy Radin.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said she sought the dismissal after Sheriff's  Department forensic experts disagreed with LAPD examiner Jimmy L. Trahin, who  said a .45-caliber revolver sold by Marti was the gun that killed Rene Vega two  years ago.  </P> <P> According to Thomas, she and fellow prosecutor David Conn had the weapon  retested in the Vega case after reading about Rickey Ross, a veteran Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputy charged in February with murdering three  prostitutes in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The LAPD arrested Ross after Trahin identified the deputy's semiautomatic  pistol as the murder weapon. When outside experts were called in, however, they  found that Trahin had incorrectly analyzed the evidence and that his tests were  inconclusive. Charges against Ross were dropped in May.  </P> <P> "I think we all take this very, very seriously, and the LAPD takes it very,  very seriously, and the problem is going to be rectified," Thomas told The  Times.  </P> <P> Cmdr. William Booth said that the LAPD concurs with the district attorney's  decision to drop the case against Marti because of a lack of evidence.  </P> <P> As for Trahin's status, Booth said the detective still is assigned to the  firearms section, but he has not conducted any ballistic tests since the Ross  case. Meanwhile, Booth said, the LAPD has ordered an audit "to see if there is  any kind of problem.,"  </P> <P> In the Vega case, Marti, a former security guard for Hustler magazine publisher  Larry Flynt, was connected to the slaying by a witness who told police that  Marti had been asked to supply the gun used to kill the victim.  </P> <P> Marti's lawyer, Richard S. Hirsch, said Wednesday the primary evidence against  his client had been the revolver.  </P></p>

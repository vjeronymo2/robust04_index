			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARKET FOR WASHINGTON APPLES REVIVING;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: GROWERS ANTICIPATE A ROSY YEAR AS SALES INCREASE WHILE THE FRUIT  SELLS AT HIGHER PRICES THAN PREVIOUSLY.  </P> <P> After three years of singing the blues, Washington apple growers are taking  their red and yellow fruit and moving into the black.  </P> <P> The 1990 Washington crop -- 70% of the nation's supermarket apples -- is  heading to market with high prices and less competition from other states.  </P> <P> Consumers can also expect to find smaller-sized apples because of cool growing  conditions in the spring.  </P> <P> Growers were battered the last three seasons by weather damage, the Alar scare  and wholesale prices below the cost of production.  </P> <P> "We're at a point this season where we can return profitability to orchards for  the first time in probably three years," said Keith Mathews of the Yakima  Valley Growers-Shippers, an industry group.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices for Red Delicious apples, the nation's most popular variety,  are nearly double what they were at this time last year, according to the  federal-state Market News Service in Yakima.  </P> <P> Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples are also selling much higher than last  year.  </P> <P> The top grade of Red Delicious is wholesaling for $17 to $18 per 42-pound box,  compared with $8 to $10 a year ago. Goldens and Granny Smiths bring about the  same.  </P> <P> Early season sales of the new crop hit record levels, with 5.2 million boxes  shipped by Sept. 27, compared with 4.3 million by the same date last year.  </P> <P> Washington's share of the fresh-apple market is growing, from 50% to 60% a few  years ago to about 70% now.  </P> <P> That's because ideal conditions in Eastern Washington for growing red apples  have gradually pushed growers in other states out of the fresh-apple market,  Mathews said. Those growers are switching to new varieties or having their  apples processed into juice or other products.  </P> <P> Also, orchards in states such as California are being ripped out for real  estate development, he said.  </P> <P> Loss of the chemical Alar after last year's scare has not reduced the quality  of the crop, Mathews said.  </P> <P> Alar was a growth regulator that kept red apples on the tree longer.  </P></p>

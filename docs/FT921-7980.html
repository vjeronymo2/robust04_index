			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (9): Benefits may outweigh risks - The distribution trend CONTRACTING OUT distribution services to third-party operators by both retailers and manufacturers has spawned a thriving logistics industry in the UK. And many specialist distribution companies, such as NFC, Securicor, Christian Salvesen, Hays and United Transport have grown big and clever in the process. Contracting out has many benefits in terms of creating commercial flexibility and eliminating the need for costly capital investments. But its major potential drawback is that it places an essential business service in the hands of an outside agency. Nevertheless, many companies clearly believe the benefits outweigh the risks and the move towards contracting out has trundled on. 'In the UK there has been no let-up in the trend towards contracting out of transport and warehousing services that has been happening for the past six or seven years,' says Mr Raymond Horsley, director-general of the Institute of Logistics and Distribution Management. One area in which a strong symbiotic partnership has evolved in contracting out distribution services has been the food retailing sector. Working closely with such retailers as J. Sainsbury and Tesco, logistics companies have developed sophisticated distribution skills. Several of them are now touting for business in mainland Europe, offering their know-how to retailing companies which have yet to appreciate the benefits of integrated supply-chain management. But such contracted-out services, particularly in the food business, require enormous trust. On the one side, the retailer entrusts the logistics company with distributing products in pristine condition in an environment in which late deliveries inevitably result in lost sales. On the other hand, the logistics company has to invest substantial sums to build and operate a warehouse that may have little or no alternative use if the contract is lost. For both parties, the relationship touches on delicate areas of commercial activity, requiring an open exchange of sensitive information and a shared responsibility for such emotive issues as food safety and hygiene. One example of such a relationship has been struck up between Waitrose, the supermarket group owned by the John Lewis Partnership, and Hays, the business services company floated on the stock market three years ago. Hays runs an 80,000 sq ft distribution centre at Theale, in Berkshire, delivering short-life food products to 97 Waitrose supermarkets. It receives goods from 200 suppliers and handles 2,500 chilled product lines and 440,000 cases of products a week, or more than 22m cases a year. As an example of the longevity of the relationships required, Hays has concluded a 25-year contract with Waitrose to build another distribution site in Milton Keynes. However, not all are convinced by the virtues of such arrangements. Some retailers, such as T&amp;S Stores, the discount newsagents and convenience stores chain, have retained all their distribution services in-house, believing that the cost advantages of contracting-out are illusory. Significantly, Tesco has also retained full control over some of its vast distribution centres to provide a measure of security and establish a control against which it can judge its third-party distributors. Just as in retailing, a revolution has occurred in the distribution arrangements of many manufacturing companies, spurred on by the arrival of Japanese companies, with their just-in-time mentality. Sony and Nissan have built greenfield sites allowing them to benefit from logistics arrangements, providing them with an advantage over indigenous manufacturers. The Japanese increasingly have been looking to contract out distribution services to the most efficient Japanese distribution companies. That is a prospect that many European logistics companies privately admit fills them with terror.</p>

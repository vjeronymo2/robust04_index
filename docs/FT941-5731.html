			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dell posts 'disappointing year' with 43% decline Dell Computer, the US personal computer maker, yesterday unveiled a 43 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings. But the company, which recovered from losses in the first half of the year, surpassed Wall Street expectations. Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive, said nonetheless fiscal 1994 had been 'a very disappointing year' for the company. Dell's results calmed Wall Street fears of slowing growth in the PC market. On Wednesday, shares of PC companies dropped sharply when AST Research, another PC maker, confirmed slower than anticipated sales growth in February. Dell reported earnings of Dollars 17.7m, or 39 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 742.9m for the fourth quarter. This compares with profits of Dollars 31.3m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 620.3m in the same period last year. For the year, the group posted a net loss of Dollars 35.8m, or Dollars 1.06, compared with net income of Dollars 101.6m, or Dollars 2.59, in fiscal 1993. Sales rose 43 per cent to Dollars 2.87bn in fiscal 1994 from Dollars 2.01bn in fiscal 1993. The 1994 loss resulted from a Dollars 71m second-quarter charge when Dell was forced to withdraw its notebook computer products due to design flaws. Mr Dell said the company's rapid growth over the past two years had secured its position as 'one of the top five PC companies in the world', but also brought 'some serious issues in our systems and processes'. The company has made substantial progress in addressing these problems, he said. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were 18.6 per cent of sales, against 20.5 per cent in the same period last year and 17.9 per cent in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Dell yesterday closed at Dollars 27, up from Wednesday's close of Dollars 24 7/8 . Compaq Computer gained Dollars 3 5/8 to trade at Dollars 98. AST Research edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 .</p>

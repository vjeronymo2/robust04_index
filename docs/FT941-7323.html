			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Property: A health warning - Vanessa Houlder on a report that calls for improved management of property holdings The relaxed approach to property characteristic of many British boards has given way to a more hard-headed consensus: bad property management can damage a company's competitiveness. This sea-change in corporate attitudes is underlined by a study of finance directors' views on property, conducted by consultants Graham Bannock &amp; Partners for Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. 'Many UK companies have only begun to think about the true economic cost of their property assets in the last few years,' says the report, published this week. 'Few companies will be able to neglect the scope for cost savings and enhanced risk-control strategies in this field.' The reasons behind this shift in attitude include changing economic conditions, increased competition, the effects of the UK recession and heightened awareness of the potential risks associated with property. For the three decades after the second world war, corporate planners attached little importance to property. Companies were willing to buy their premises, as low interest rates encouraged borrowing, and they benefited from rising real property values. By the 1970s, the rise in real values meant that many companies owned valuable freehold property in top locations. Moreover, property ownership fitted in with the trend favouring a diversified portfolio of products and services. But in the past 20 years attitudes have again begun to swing. Companies have increasingly seen their property holdings as 'a mis-allocation of scarce resources rather than a solid bulwark of support', the report says. The increase in real property values has slowed since the 1970s. An increasingly competitive business climate forced companies to specialise in a narrow range of core activities, which generally excluded property investment. This more focused approach added weight to the argument that cash locked up in property assets should be released. 'If the rate of return on the company's assets exceeds the expected appreciation of property assets, the latter should be sold and the money invested in the business,' says the report. The recession has sharply increased awareness of the potential risks associated with property. First, the problems of many financially-strapped companies were compounded because they occupied properties with long-term leases and therefore could do little to cut their rental costs. Second, companies were hit by 'privity of contract'  - they were liable for the rent on buildings they had vacated, even if they had passed on their lease to a tenant that had defaulted. Third, companies that owned freeholds were badly affected by the downturn, as banks cut credit for companies with loans secured on tangible assets. Besides market changes, new accounting rules have also forced finance directors to reassess the real economic costs of their property assets. These rule changes include the requirement for more consistency in how fixed assets are represented on a balance sheet. Companies are also becoming more aware of the scope to raise profitability and returns on property assets. In a survey of 111 companies in the report, 26 per cent said there was 'considerable scope' for reducing property costs. The rewards of tighter property management, the report says, are considerable. Success depends on a business's net profit margins. When net margins are only about 7 per cent, a reduction in costs of, say, 0.65 per cent due to better control of property overheads translates into an earnings rise per share of about 10 per cent. The scope for improving property management varies between different companies. The best-run portfolios are those belonging to companies for which property is an integral part of their core business, such as banks and hotels. Another group of companies which tends not to be too concerned about its property costs are those operating on high net profit margins - such as the pharmaceutical industry - or companies where property assets are small in relation to the balance sheet - as in financial services groups. The companies that have the greatest need to address their property costs are those in mature industries. Such companies trade on smaller profit margins and have the widest scope for rationalisation. Moreover, they often have a complex property portfolio as a result of re-organisations, mergers and rationalisation. The report says that improving property management is not easy. Companies may wish for greater flexibility in their leases, but they may be stymied by landlords anxious to retain long leases. Companies operating in a low-inflation and competitive climate will continue to be under pressure to cut overheads. Those with over-extended portfolios have little choice but to get to grips with their property costs.</p>

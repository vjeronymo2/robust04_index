			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Playmates slips to HKDollars 176m at six months PLAYMATES, the Hong Kong manufacturer of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles toys, yesterday reported a 57 per cent drop in profits to HKDollars 175.5m (USDollars 22.7m) from HKDollars 409m in the six months to June 30. In what Playmates officials described as a 'transition' year for the company, interim sales fell nearly 52 per cent to HKDollars 645.5m from HKDollars 1.33bn last time. Directors declared a 7 cents interim dividend, up 16 per cent on last year's 6 cents, but well below the total of 18 cents actually paid. Playmates made a special payout a year ago which amounted to 12 cents a share. In spite of the poor results the company took pains to point out that margins had remained robust - at more than 27 per cent - and new products in the pipeline, together with planned expansion in Europe and possibly the US, would be sources of growth. Earlier this month Playmates announced it was acquiring 37.5 per cent of Ideal Loisirs, France's leading toymaker, for HKDollars 235m. Mr Ian Forsyth, the newly appointed chief financial officer, said the company was considering further acquisitions in Europe and in the US. He pointed out that at June 30 the company had no long-term debt and had HKDollars 1.1bn in cash and marketable securities. 'Clearly what is happening is the maturing of the Turtle's lines,' Mr Forsyth said. 'We have scaled back production - to cut inventories and stocks at the retail level - but we are very confident that sales can be maintained at or above current levels.' He said new lines of Turtles' products and other toys related to television programmes would be introduced. 'We see some growth in the second half but the second half is really a transition period,' he said. Analysts said although Playmates was well-managed it was essentially a one product company. Mr Steven Lee, of Jardine Fleming, said: 'They continue to search for another hit toy (like the Turtles), but it's tough to repeat that success.'</p>

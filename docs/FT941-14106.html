			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Private shareholders threaten to withdraw from Portuguese group Private shareholders who own 25 per cent of Petrogal, Portugal's partially privatised oil company and largest commercial enterprise, have told the government they may withdraw from the company because of difficulties in meeting a commitment to purchase a further 26 per cent of the equity. The private group, dominated by Total, the French oil company, purchased a 25 per cent stake in Petrogal in the first stage of the company's privatisation in 1992. The terms of the sale obliges the group to buy a further 26 per cent by July 1995 for an estimated Es45bn (Dollars 255m). The private shareholders, grouped together in the holding company Petrocontrol, have been trying to negotiate an alternative deal with the Portuguese finance ministry because of difficulties in raising the necessary capital by the deadline. Petrocontrol has indicated that it is prepared to pull out of Petrogal if an agreement cannot be reached. A withdrawal is likely to lead to the purchase of the stake by other private investors. Total holds 48 per cent of the voting rights in Petrocontrol. The remainder of the capital is divided between nine Portuguese institutional and individual investors. Portuguese law prohibits foreign investors from holding, directly or indirectly, a majority of the privately-owned capital of Petrogal. According to the terms of Petrogal's privatisation, if Petrocontrol fails to purchase an additional 26 per cent of the company by the deadline, it will be required to forfeit 6 per cent of its holding and have the option of selling the remaining 19 per cent back to the state at the original price of the privatisation. Mr Luis Mira Amaral, minister for industry and energy, reportedly insists on Petrocontrol agreeing to buy the additional 26 per cent before he will agree to a badly-needed capital increase for Petrogal.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has compiled  the results of an on-site survey concerning the European  research data network which it conducted jointly with the  Ministries of Education, International Trade and Industry, Posts  and Telecommunications, Health and Welfare, and Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries. According to the survey, a move is  accelerating to expand the network throughout Europe beyond  national and agency precincts to provide for effective use of  research resources and the operational and maintenance systems  for the network should be of interest to Japan. The STA will  step up its dialogue with Europe with a view to connecting  Japan's research data network with the European network.    According to the survey report, there are two research data  networks which cover the European region, including "E-Bone"  which has grown from what was once a grass-roots-type network  and "Europa NET" which was built under the sponsorship of the  European Commission. Both have been in existence for one or two  years since beginning official operations, but it is said that  "There is a need to watch future developments and trends in  various nations and agencies." The two systems utilize data  bases such as a research and development data system known as  "CORDIS" maintained and offered for use in a broad range of  applied research and considered necessary for future use by  Japan.    Dialogue between the survey group and the European  Commission  produced a desire for future reciprocal linkage and conduct of  joint research by Japan, the United States and Europe in  expanding Japan's research data network. Further, France  expressed the opinion that, "Since U.S. influence is  disproportionately strong in the area of research data networks,  it is important that Europe and Asia exert greater effort in  collaborating with each other."</p>

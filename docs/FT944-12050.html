			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / People: Constructive careers Hammerson's drive into continental Europe has taken a step forward with the appointment of Oliver Ash as managing director of the group's European operations. Ash, 36, is a committed Europhile, having lived in France, Germany and Italy for the past 11 years. Between 1987 and 1992 he worked for property developer Shaftesbury, building office blocks and retail centres across the continent. When the development markets froze with the onset of recession, Ash set up his own Paris-based consultancy and was happily running his own business when Hammerson approached him earlier this year. He will continue to live in Paris in his new role. Since one of Hammerson's declared aims is to expand its property portfolio in continental Europe, Ash should have sufficient funds at his disposal. The Pounds 250m proceeds from the disposal of the group's Australian interests are widely expected to be reinvested before long, with French shopping centres tipped as the most likely first move. While Hammerson is looking to buy investment properties rather than developments, Ash's experience in development will give the group more options. 'I have no doubt that my developer's keen eye will come in useful,' he says.</p>

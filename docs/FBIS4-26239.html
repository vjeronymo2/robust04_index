			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Yesterday, the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and  ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei separately sent  letters to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and SEF  Vice Chairman Jiao Renhe, suggesting that arrangements be made  for holding talks between persons in charge of the ARATS and the  SEF and between their deputy secretaries and for holding  department director-level talks.    The letter sent by ARATS to SEF noted: After the talks  between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended in  Beijing in February this year, compatriots on both sides of the  Taiwan Strait affirmed their efforts and optimistically  anticipated the fourth routine meeting would yield positive  results. However, the fourth routine meeting failed to achieve  the anticipated objective. We sincerely feel it is necessary  for the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks to  facilitate the ironing out of differences at an early date, to  strive for the conclusion of three agreements, including the  agreement on the "Repatriation of Personnel Who Have Entered  Into the Region of the Other Side in Violation of Relevant  Regulations and Other Related Issues," to discuss other topics  on the agenda as soon as possible, and to expedite ARATS-SEF  affairs. According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and  the System for Their Talks," the dates for the biannual talks  between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, the  quarterly meeting between their deputy secretaries general, and  the quarterly department director-level meeting between ARATS  and the SEF will be due soon. We suggest that arrangements be  made for the above-mentioned talks and meetings to be held at  the same time. We would like to have your opinion on the above.    Tang Shubei's letter to Jiao Renhe noted: After the persons  in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended their talks in Beijing in  February this year, agreements should have been reached as  quickly as possible on the basis of the high degree of consensus  reached during the February Beijing talks, and according to the  "Joint News Draft." However, the fourth routine meeting  encountered various difficulties and failed to achieve the  anticipated objective. Under the circumstances, press circles  on both sides of the Taiwan Strait believed it is necessary for  the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks.  According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and the  System for Their Talks," the dates for meetings between the  persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, and between their deputy  secretaries general will be due soon. I am afraid both you and  I will have to make efforts again to successfully fulfill our  tasks and to continue to promote ARATS-SEF cooperation as well  as the achievement of results in cross-strait relations.</p>

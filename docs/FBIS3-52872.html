			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Progressive Socialist Party Leader and Refugee </F> Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt; place and date not given--read  by announcer]    [Text] Local and regional developments require a pause to  examine certain basic facts and to explain certain points.    1. If the Vatican's policy has been criticized, this is  because we look at the Vatican as one of this world's states.  We distinguish between this state and Christianity, which is  one of the heavenly religions. However, it is our duty to draw  the Vatican's attention to the dangers involved in making peace  or normalizing relations with the state of Israel and admitting,  one way or another, the commission of a sin against the Jewish  people.    The state of Israel was proclaimed as a result of the  Western  Nazi's persecution of the Jewish people. And thence came the  tragedy of the Palestinian people. Today the Vatican recognizes  the state of Israel. This recognition may involve a second  crime against the Arab people, with all their subdivisions and  sects. We are entitled to draw attention to the possible  political, ideological, and cultural implications of that  recognition for the Arab world.    2. The stand taken by the Coptic Church, led by struggler  Pope Shanudah, reiterated that the danger involved in  normalizing relations with Israel--with Zionism--will harm  Christians and Muslims alike. Pope Shanudah's stance is a  historic one that goes back to pharaonic times and the Jews'  exodus from Egypt during Moses' time.    The Copts are the heirs of the Pharaohs, the original  Egyptian natives. Even after Arab and Islamic conquests, the  Copts without hesitation stood by Egypt's rulers, Arabs and  Muslims alike, to confront foreign invasions, Crusades and  otherwise. It is no coincidence that Salah-al-Din built them a  church close to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in  Jerusalem--the Dayr-al-Sultan Church. It is also no coincidence  that Coptic figures assumed high- ranking positions, including  ministers of finance and war during Salah-al-Din's time and  later during Muhammad 'Ali's time. The name of [former Egyptian  Prime Minister] Makram 'Ubayd was associated with that of Sa'd  Zaghlul in rejecting the British mandate. This genuinely  nationalist church has taken many other historic stances. The  latest of these was when Pope Shanudah rejected the Camp David  accords and was exiled by al-Sadat to the desert.    That is why we always distinguish between the policy of the  church, whether in the Vatican or in Lebanon, and the Christian  people. We affirm that the return of the refugees will continue  at the various levels and that it will not be affected by a  statement made here or there.    We appeal to the Egyptian opposition not to attack the  Copts.  Negotiations were forced on the Arabs by the United States. But  the future of Arabs, Muslims and Christians, and the future of  the Islamic region, are still in our hands. If we act properly,  we can stand fast, even in peace, against the Zionist political,  cultural, and economic hazards.    In the cultural fields, it is necessary to consolidate the  cultural immunity, in Asyut and elsewhere. The battle is with  the Egyptian regime, its foolish rejection of dialogue with the  opposition, and its persistence in carrying out executions. The  battle is not and will not be with Egypt's Copts.    3. These historic points make it incumbent on us to draw up  an Arab Islamic confrontation plan that goes beyond tactics for  talks in Washington and elsewhere. This plan should involve the  Christian, Islamic, and even some struggling Jewish sects that  reject racism, in confronting Zionism. Not all Jews are  Zionists; and it is not right to generalize. In history,  prominent strugglers in the communist, socialist, and world  labor movements, as well as imperialism-resisting movements,  were Jews.    A plan to guarantee political immunity must be developed,  because Israel will only seek to destroy the region and divide  its people into tribes, clans, and sects so that Jerusalem can  become another Mecca, or the political and economic center for  Arabs and Muslims.    Containing such a hazard would make confrontation much  easier, even if Israeli flags were temporarily hoisted in some  Arab capitals.    As far as the economic aspect is concerned, only an Arab,  Islamic common market extending from Iran to the Islamic states  in Asia Minor and Turkey can balance the Israeli strategy of  seeking, among other things, to control the Arab and Islamic  market and steal our wealth.    These are some of the basic things that should be developed  before it is too late to protect the Christians and Muslims of  the Orient from the hazards of peace or settlement with Israel.</p>

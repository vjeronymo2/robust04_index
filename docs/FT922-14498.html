			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Businesses in league with art - Sponsorship 'We would not do it if it was not in our business interests' says Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless. Few leading businessmen are so categorical about why they support the arts; yet this hard-headed approach may be better for the long term future of sponsorship than transient do-goodism. Cable and Wireless invests sparingly under its corporate name, but with a splash. It took Ashkenasy back to the Soviet Union; it brought the Chinese ballet to Sadler's Wells. With both countries it has extensive potential dealings which were nurtured through these arts contacts. Last week it helped finance the visit of the English National Ballet to Hungary. The evening in Budapest was a highly successful occasion. The patron of the ENB, the Princess of Wales, was there, which was a tremendous PR bonus; the audience was ecstatic about the performance; and all the right people from the Hungarian government attended. Cable and Wireless is part of a consortium seeking a contract running into many hundred millions of dollars to modernise Hungary's telecommunications. The direct cost of the sponsorship was only Pounds 35,000, although essential extras lifted this to a still reasonable Pounds 50,000. While sponsorship in the UK faces a difficult time, many companies are following Cable and Wireless in pursuing overseas export objectives with the help of the arts. The British Council acts as a not disinterested pump primer and persuaded companies to contribute Pounds 5.5m towards sponsorship initiatives abroad in the financial year that ended last week. Almost two thirds of this went into arts activities: the rest into training and education projects. That was comfortably above target and compares with the Pounds 3.83m brought in during 1990-91. The idea is that the British Council comes up with some cash while business supplies the rest, and more. For 1992-93 it has set itself a target of Pounds 5.8m but so far the response has been encouraging. Glaxo has come up with Pounds 150,000 to make possible an exhibition of sculpture by Anthony Caro in the Trajan markets in Rome in May, while a raft of companies, including British Steel and, would you believe it, the notoriously tight fisted GEC, are contributing Pounds 170,000 towards a Henry Moore exhibition in Paris at the same time. Other sponsorships on line include Chartered West helping the Halle to tour Argentina and Brazil, while Marks and Spencer has added Pounds 30,000 to its original Pounds 60,000 to take a revamped version of the British fashion show All Dressed Up, to the Far East. Not every project succeeds. No sponsor could be found for the CBSO's tour of the US, so the British Council was forced to up its contribution while the artists, and their agents, including conductor Simon Rattle, took a cut in fees. The plight of arts sponsorship in the UK in 1992 was well summed up by Bob Horton of BP at the BP Arts Journalism Awards ceremony this week. The recession, and withering criticism of sponsorship by some commentators, is stripping away corporate support for the arts. BP, traditionally one of the biggest sponsors, has been forced to reduce its budget from Pounds 1.2m in 1991 to Pounds 940,000 this year. What upset Bob Horton most is the entrenched hatred of sponsors by certain critics. Sponsors seem to be remarkably thin skinned in their reaction to such attacks but then they still have to justify their expenditure to Philistine directors inside companies. It suggests that sponsorship still has a superficial hold in many boardrooms. Against the trend Digital, which has concentrated most of its marketing expenditure on sponsorship and, in particular dance, for the past six years, last week announced a 10 per cent increase in its 1992-93 budget to Pounds 550,000. Among the ventures are the financing of two new productions, A Christmas Carol by the Northern Ballet Theatre and Cinderella by English National Ballet. ENB has announced that it exceeded its 1991-92 sponsorship target by Pounds 250,000. It looked for Pounds 340,000 and brought in Pounds 590,000. It expects things to be tougher in this financial year, but with 80 per cent of its backers, including Digital and NatWest, continuing to support the company, it is confident of reaching a modest target of Pounds 400,000. Next weekend sees the climax of the BBC's first and most successful flirtation with outside sponsorship, the broadcast final of Young Musician of the Year competition in association with Lloyds Bank. The bank has committed Pounds 1.3m to the project during five years but is more than happy with its investment, especially the 5m audience expected for next Saturday night. The fact that the competition takes place every two years enables it to feed in additional packages, which will be highlighted in self-contained features during the three hour transmission. This season it added a Lloyds Bank Young Composer competition and a Lloyds Bank Fashion Challenge; the challenge being for young designers to devise comfortable clothes for the finalists to wear. This fitted in neatly with Lloyds sponsorship of a fashion award, which also gets TV coverage. The BBC has had second thoughts about its biggest potential arts tie up. It has dropped its search for a sponsor prepared to put up Pounds 2m to be linked to the Proms. It was not because of a lack of enquiries: rather a decision by the BBC's new director general John Birt, who does not want the flagship Proms to be 'sold' to outside interests. Audi is backing the newly formed London Philharmonic Youth Orchestra with Pounds 160,000 during three years. The 60-strong ensemble of musicians aged between 17 and 23 will perform at least nine concerts each year.</p>

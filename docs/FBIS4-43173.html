			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Navy, Halfway There"] </F>   [Text] Halfway there. That is how the Navy has been left  following the budget cuts that have sunk many of its plans for  renewal and new shipbuilding laid down in the so-called High  Seas Plan at the end of the last decade. What should have been  an ambitious plan to create a Navy of the year 2000, modern and  to the highest European standards, has been reduced to just a  few plans subject to the danger of further cuts, which have also  caused the ships and crews to spend fewer days at sea than are  required for their training.    The Spanish Navy's basic core remains based on the air-sea  group headed by the aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias. This  ship, the Navy's flagship, has performed and will continue to  perform excellently, becoming, according to military experts,  the best ship of its class currently in service.    However, despite the aircraft carrier's excellence, the  air-sea group has become "lame" as far as its escorts are  concerned. The Navy's long-standing aim to have 15 frigate-type  escorts has come to nothing, since right now it has only nine:  five of the Baleares class, which have various maintenance  problems, and four much more modern Santa Maria class frigates.  This shortage means that the Navy has been unable to deploy  more than two frigates at once in the operation to monitor the  embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, since it has to honor  other commitments, such as both national and international  maneuvers, or because of these ships' maintenance cycles.    This situation will be partially alleviated when the two new  Santa Maria class ships enter into service. The first of them  -- the F85 Navarra -- is to do so this year, since it will be  delivered to the Navy by the Bazan National Enterprise 30 May.  The F86 Canarias will be received by the Navy in December. In  any event, future expectations fall far short of what was  envisaged in the Master Plan [Plan Norte], with the construction  of nine F100 class frigates starting from this year.    The budget problems have caused those nine ships to be cut  to  just four, whose construction will not begin until next year at  the earliest, if the most optimistic time scales are fulfilled.  Right now, following the memorandum of understanding signed by  Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany last January, the project's  feasibility stage is coming to a close. These four frigates  should strengthen one of the fleet's weakest points --  antiaircraft defense -- being equipped with a radar system  capable of tracking and firing at more targets simultaneously  than the Santa Maria class frigates can do.    The drastic cuts came at a crucial time for the Navy, with a  gradual involvement in international operations and greater  participation in maneuvers with the allies. Moreover, Spain is  one of those promoting the setting up of a European air-sea  group in the Mediterranean, which undoubtedly means having a  well-equipped Navy.    As in the case of the Air Force, preference is also given by  the Defense Ministry to transport and support ships, although  new shipbuilding is also at a standstill, except for the AOR  [expansion unknown], the supply ship which will be launched  within the next few weeks. The AOR will have the capacity to  transport 6,800 tonnes of diesel oil in order to supply the  Principe de Asturias and its escorts, and 500 tonnes of JP-5  fuel for the Harrier aircraft of the air unit aboard the  aircraft carrier.    The High Seas Plan, drawn up during Fernando Nardiz' time  as Navy chief of staff, envisaged the commissioning of five  amphibious vessels, whereas the situation right now is that both  the Aragon and the Castilla -- the two attack transport ships --  have reached the end of their useful lives without clear  replacements.    The first solution has been to hire from the U.S. Navy two  amphibious vessels with 20 years on their logbooks, due to  arrive in Spain between this year and the beginning of 1995.  Another solution -- that of constructing a Landing Platform  Dock amphibious vessel in Spain -- is also at a critical stage  right now. Naval sources consulted stated that the work order  should be carried out this year, since because this is a joint  project with the Netherlands, which has already taken a decision  to this effect, many of the results of this cooperation could be  lost, with the consequent increase in the project's cost.    The need for these ships, repeatedly expressed by Defense  Minister Julian Garcia Vargas, stems from the support for the  ground forces that have to be transported in carrying out  international missions, as is the case with operation Alpha  Bravo in the former Yugoslavia.    But of there is a part of the Navy where the future is not  at  all bright, it is in the submarine fleet. While the  above-mentioned plan forecast in one of its most optimistic  sections the construction of up to 10 submarines to replace the  Delfin and Agosta class submarines, the harsh reality is that  the designing of this new type of vessel is at a standstill, and  the current fleet of eight vessels could even be halved before  the end of the century.    It is acknowledged by the Defense Ministry itself that the  submarine fleet is experiencing difficulties -- especially the  four Delfin class vessels. In fact, the major refits of the S64  Narval, required in order to guarantee a submarine's safety,  have been suspended, and this in turn is causing major  difficulties in accomplishing the submarine force's operating  cycle. Defense sources told ABC that the S64 will be dropped  from the list of Navy vessels this year, although they  emphatically asserted that it will not be scrapped. The  submarine will be mothballed, as is done by the U.S. Navy with  the units it decommissions, making possible its recovery if  circumstances so require.    For this reason, the Navy could begin the next decade with  just four submarines, although it is a weapon of considerable  deterrent capability because of the danger it poses to shipping  and free movement in ports.    Some sectors in the Navy are in favor of scrapping the  oldest  submarines to make it possible to use the funds earmarked for  their maintenance for other, more pressing, needs.    All this comes four years after Admiral Carlos Vila, Juan  Jose Romero Caramelo's predecessor as Navy chief of staff,  warned when he took office that he was unable with the resources  then at his disposal to ensure the performance of all the tasks  entrusted.    And the fact is that Vila also had to see the Navy part with  a large proportion of its patrol boats, partly because the  Maritime Civil Guard took over responsibility for the  surveillance of territorial waters and because scrapping those  ships made it possible to earmark funds for other, more  pressing, needs. Nevertheless, the Navy has strengthened its  capability as far as deep-sea patrol boats are concerned.    The program to construct four minehunters at the Bazan  shipyard in Cartagena has also been activated. Although the  High Seas Plan put at eight the number of ships for antimine  warfare, their high cost made it advisable to reduce the plan to  the aforementioned four ships.  <H5>  Air Arm </H5>   The Fleet Air Arm has been strengthened through the purchase  for 46 billion pesetas in 1992 of eight Harrier-plus aircraft  that will replace the older models. Nevertheless, the cuts have  affected the helicopters, since the number of SH-60 Seahawks --  six -- has proved too low to meet all requirements, especially  with the entry of more frigates into the fleet.</p>

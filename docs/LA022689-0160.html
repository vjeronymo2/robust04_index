			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEWORK SUGGESTED  </P> <P> Peter Greenberg, who wrote "Nursery at 25,000 Feet" (Jan. 29), needs to do a  lot more homework before writing another such article. First, you cannot  compare a domestic deregulated airline with a government supported  international foreign carrier.  </P> <P> If the mothers would like to have all this help, they and everyone else should  be prepared to pay two or three times the cost of their tickets to pay for the  personnel that would be involved. Two, the size of the aircraft dictates the  space for conveniences such as fold-out changing tables. Contrary to  Greenberg's statement regarding U.S. carriers, Continental for one, has  bassinets that can be attached to bulkheads on all its DC-10s.  </P> <P> Third, as for the mother who was given a seat separate from her child, I would  suggest she arrive at the airport a little earlier. For the mother seated next  to two single parents, be aware that there are only so many oxygen masks per  row and it is illegal to have more people in the seats than there are masks.  </P> <P> Airlines charge full fare for unaccompanied minors as they are legally  responsible for them. The diligent care taken is considerable. However, you  would be surprised at how many of these "concerned" parents are not there when  their child arrives. The airlines and flight attendants try their best to  accommodate special needs, but the passenger has to meet them halfway.  </P> <P> MAGGIE BAKER  </P> <P> Continental flight attendant  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

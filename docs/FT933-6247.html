			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Too many nasty surprises - Harry Hopkins wonders why investors increasingly have been getting the sort of news they didn't want EVERY sensible person, venturing into the stock market, must expect the odd nasty surprise. But not, surely, so many and so often out of the blue. Consider these examples: Hartstone, an up and coming hosiery group, crashed from 277p in February to 30p in April despite having been tipped widely to rise to higher things. Trafalgar House shareholders were 'surprised' in January when profits announced as Pounds 122m for 1991 turned out to be a Pounds 38m loss, after a change in accounting policies. Bimec Industries, riding on a green 'environmental' tide at 75p in February 1991, had plummeted to 6 1/2 p and been forced to seek the attentions of a company doctor by August of that year. The dividend was cancelled suddenly. This week, the group wrote off Pounds 5m of debt in a restructuring, announced it had negative shareholders' funds - and said it would be suing its auditor, Grant Thornton. Queen's Moat Houses, Britain's second-largest hotelier, halted a long course of price fluctuations and rumours by suspending its shares on March 31 at 47p (they were 92p just 10 months earlier) in order to 'clarify the company's financial position.' Now, shareholders must wait until autumn to see what, if anything, is left for them. There must be few investors who cannot quickly add to the above list. Yet, these are not fly-by night gambling counters. Queen's Moat Houses was advancing boldly across Europe with a chain of business hotels while Hartstone, with the well-founded aim of knitting together a fragmented hoisery industry, had already achieved second place in Europe. Far from seeking to conceal information, Harstone's ex-chairman, Stephen Barker, following the suggestions of the Cadbury report, invited shareholders not attending the annual general meeting to send in questions with their proxy papers to be read out, answered at the meeting and then circulated so as to keep everyone in touch. It is the confusion that follows the nasty surprise and the disruption of perspective that, for the investor, as for the workers, must be the traumatic feature. Nasty surprises should regularly be subjected to post-mortems from impartial qualified bodies to determine what went wrong and where the fault lay, and the reports should be made accessible. Such examinations should not leave out the roles of brokers, public relations firms and the press. How far do brokers - and company brokers, in particular, which must experience divided loyalties - play a Pied Piper role in the progress to the cliff? Is everything possible done to make potential investors aware of the risks, even if they have managed to remember the widely-disseminated admonition that 'shares can go down as well as up'? A year or so before Hartstone's nasty surprise, a side table at the company's 1992 AGM featured a batch of research reports that were comprehensive, thorough and lucid. One, from BZW, ran to 41 single-spaced pages with many tables and charts. It was headlined: 'Latest acquisitions give 'brand' new opportunity.' A second, from Morgan Stanley, had nine pages. It was headed: 'Hartstone: one and one make more than two,' and contained a buy recommendation. A third report, from Warburg Securities and dated June 25 1992, also said 'buy.' But its mere two pages did contain a distinct 5-inch paragraph headed: 'Risk areas.' This opened: 'History provides many examples of unexpected setbacks among highly acquisitive small companies. Many of these had previously enjoyed the freedom to employ some highly creative accounting. Management capacity has undoubtedly been stretched . . . As we write, there is an excess hosiery market capacity of some 15 per cent so a price war remains a distant possibility . . .' With hindsight, such a succinct caution might have given one pause. For so many of these nasty surprises seem to derive from the same factor: over-rapid acquisition programmes in times of recession, leaving no leeway for unscheduled developments such as demand falling off suddenly and stocks building in Europe. Or from developments in accountancy's vast hall of mirrors. Perhaps, in the interest of cutting down nasty surprises, even brokers' recommendations should have to carry a risk warning, stated unequivocally in a prominent box. This would at least be an improvement on that patronising slogan 'shares can go down as well as up.'</p>

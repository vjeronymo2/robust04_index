			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Cunard chief set to face angry QE2 passengers: Move to avert threatened sit-in over conditions aboard luxury liner after refit delay Mr John Olsen, chief executive of Cunard, the UK cruise line, was preparing to board the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship in New York yesterday to avert a threatened sit-in by 150 passengers angry over conditions on board. Passengers have complained of 'building site' conditions, 'stinking' swimming pools and closed facilities resulting from delays in completing a Pounds 30m refit. The QE2 was expected in New York at 8pm local time after a stormy crossing. Some passengers were due to disembark and others were scheduled to join the vessel before it continued on its journey to the Caribbean. Mr Olsen, appearing at a press conference in New York, acknowledged that there had been difficulties aboard the vessel. Asked to comment on reports of exploding toilets, he said the biggest single issue had involved the plumbing. 'It's an extremely complicated science to get it right, and there were cases of foreign objects and soiled water in the cabins,' he said. Mr Olsen also acknowledged that two of the public areas, the Lido and the Yacht Club, had been out of action during the voyage, but said they were now open. He said he would be using them to address all the passengers. Mr Andrew Lennox, spokesperson for a protest group threatening not to leave the ship unless Mr Olsen came aboard, said last night passengers would be demanding an official apology from Cunard for the conditions they had faced. They also wanted a promise of compensation, and the chance to express concerns about safety on the ship. 'My aim in forming this group was simply to give everybody the opportunity of facing an executive from Cunard and letting him know what they thought,' Mr Lennox said by satellite telephone from the QE2. Mr Olsen said Cunard originally expected the QE2 to leave New York with about 1,400 passengers aboard. Instead it would only accommodate 750, about 250 of whom had joined it in Southampton and the rest of whom would join it in New York. Among those disembarking would be 300-400 contractors who had been working to complete the refurbishment during the transatlantic voyage. The liner was due to leave New York at midnight. However, Mr Lennox said last night he did not believe those joining in New York could be accommodated, as many cabins were still unfinished. 'Cunard will have a lot of egg on their faces, when everybody gets off the ship and people see the state it is in,' he said. Mr Olsen said the QE2 was like a 'national heritage monument' in the UK and it was astonishing how much attention the ship created. He refused to say whether Cunard would sue the contractors, but said everyone involved in the refit knew the tight time frame and had signed up to it.</p>

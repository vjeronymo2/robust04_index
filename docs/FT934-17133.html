			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Uncertainty uber alles: The German mood three years after unification On the night they announced the results of the competition to host the Olympic games in the year 2000, a casual viewer of German television might have been forgiven for thinking momentarily that Berlin, not Sydney, had won. There were scenes of a German crowd cheering ecstatically as the votes were counted. Then the truth slowly dawned: they were not celebrating the fact that Berlin had won, but that it had lost. It got only nine votes. Two days later, the German press was conducting an agonised post mortem. How could the German capital, host city for the 1936 Olympics, have done so badly? 'Why are we Germans so unloved?' the popular Bild Zeitung deman-ded in a banner headline. One reason, it concluded, was precisely because Germans were so confused as well as so quarrelsome. Nowhere else were members of the Int-ernational Olympic Committee pel-ted with eggs, for a start. The truth is that three years on from German unification - on October 3, 1990 - the country is still suffering from a crisis of identity. National celebrations are planned for tomorrow in Saarbrucken, capital of the state of Saarland, just over the border from France. They are likely to be a subdued, unenthusiastic affair. Unification has called all the comfortable old certainties of post-war Germany into question: not just the assumption of prosperity, but the consensual basis of the political system, the safety of Germany's place locked into western Europe, the EC and the Nato alliance, the suppression of its national identity in a European identity. None is yet fundamentally in doubt, but all are suddenly open to debate. The brief economic boom, as monetary union between the two halves of the country caused an explosion of eastern consumer spending, allowed a unified Germany to buck the trends in the world economy in 1990 and 1991. Now the country is in its steepest downturn since the war, and it hurts. The famed social partnership between workers and employers, a cornerstone of Germany's post-war performance, is under unprecedented strain. For the first time, the engineering industry employers have formally served notice terminating their pay and holiday contracts with IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, as a prelude to a determined assault on costs in the coming wage round. The stage is set for a bitter war of attrition. Suddenly the generosity of the German welfare state is also under attack, as the demands of the east are placed upon it. Millions of new potential claimants expect full benefits, although they are only beginning to pay contributions. Both government and opposition are languishing in the polls, as voters turn to protest parties, or stay at home, to express disenchantment with the post-unification world. In Hamburg, the latest elections showed mass defections from all main national parties. The ruling Social Democrats (SPD) dropped from 48 per cent to 40. More dramatically, Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) saw its vote fall from 35 to 25 per cent. Overall, more than 50 per cent of the city's electorate failed to support the main national parties, either by staying at home, or protest voting. The big winners were the Greens, who almost doubled their vote to 13.5 per cent, and the previously unheard-of Statt Partei  - literally, the Instead of a Party - which won eight seats in the city parliament with almost 6 per cent. Neither the extreme right Republicans, nor their bitter hard-right rivals, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), won enough to get into the city assembly, but between them they won a worrying 7.6 per cent of the vote. Hamburg was a portent of protest-voting in next year's marathon election year, with 19 separate national, state and local elections. Domestic issues predominate, with internal security, the threat to jobs, the lack of housing and immigration main themes. The political leadership, including Mr Kohl, is trying to launch a national debate on external issues to identify where Germany's national interests lie and, indeed, to underline the close identity of the national interest with European integration. For Mr Kohl, German unity and European union are two sides of a single coin. But, for the general public, foreign policy in general, and Europe in particular, seem far removed from their immediate concerns. If west Germans are seeing old certainties wobble, the upheaval they face is nothing against the trauma of their east German compatriots. The early euphoria of unification has evaporated. In 1991, two-thirds of east Germans believed they would have achieved western living standards by 1997. Today, only eight per cent believe that, according to a survey in Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper. In 1990, on the eve of unification, 78 per cent of the eastern population over 18 were economically active. Today that proportion is down to 54 per cent. Soaring unemployment, early retirement and the withdrawal of women from the labour market has seen to that. One in 10 east German workers has been forced to retrain for a different profession. One in five has changed employer in the past three years. And yet, in spite of the traumatic social, political and economic changes, what is most extraordinary is that there has not been more social disturbance or resentment. In 1990, the survey in Die Zeit showed no less than 94 per cent happy to be unifying. Today the figure has only dropped to 84 per cent. The disturbing spread of racist violence still only involves a tiny minority of young skinhead gangs. It has actually undermined support for the far-right political parties like the Republicans, who are tarred with the racist brush. No one is complacent any longer. The rise of the far right is regarded with a deeper horror in Germany than probably in any other European country, precisely because of its Nazi past. Next year's European elections in June will be a critical moment. Voters who fear to stray from the establishment parties in a national election are likely to be less constrained in the poll for the European parliament. And the far right parties are - so far - the only ones seeking to exploit widespread fears over a single European currency. Chancellor Kohl's steadfast commitment to European union, at a moment when the country is overwhelmingly concerned with the internal upheaval caused by unification, may yet prove to be his Achilles heel.</p>

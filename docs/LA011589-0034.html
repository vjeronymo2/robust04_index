			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUNCH WITH BITE;  </P> <P> TO SHAKE THE WEEKEND DOLDRUMS, GO ETHNIC  </P> <P> Shall we "do brunch"?  </P> <P> Oh, no. No, no, no. Not this morning. We can't face eggs Benedict at all today,  and if we have to look one more carved ham in the face we're going to throw a  melon ball at somebody. It won't be a pretty sight.  </P> <P> The very idea is giving us a headache. Well, possibly we already had the  headache, but anyway we've got to get out of the house . . . and get something  to eat, that much is clear.  </P> <P> Not eggs Benedict, though, anything but eggs Benedict. It may be brunch time,  but today we need a Brunch From Beyond.  </P> <P> Caribbean. Aha. Huevos negros: eggs crusted with an ominous black paste of  chiles. They look like truck-stop fried eggs in hell. They also taste like  fried eggs from hell, ferociously hot. Just what we wanted, the exact opposite  of eggs Benedict. With a plate of these little puppies and maybe a hasty gallon  of ice water, we're feeling better already.  </P> <P> This is Cafe Mambo, a bright, informal little place that always has fun art on  the walls. It may be a little loud for brunch, but it's open early and the  eclectic food goes a long way toward curing brunch melancholia. In addition to  spicy things like chilaquiles (eggs, chorizo and tortilla chips scrambled  together) there are hotcakes and more conventional breakfast items. And the  coffee is whimsically flavored with vanilla.  </P> <P> Cafe Mambo, 707 Heliotrope St., Hollywood. (213) 663-5800. Saturday and Sunday  brunch from 9 a.m. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Brunch for  two, food only, $10-$20.  </P> <P> Greek. Oh boy, a show. Waiters with Greek accents are flourishing plates at us.  First there are salads and Near Eastern dips -- hummus, baba ghannouj and  taramosalata (all pretty good, though the hummus could use more sesame).  </P> <P> Then they bring out crisp-fried calamari, a homey dish of pasta baked with  ground beef and cream sauce called pastitsio, rather plain beef meatballs and  grape leaves generously stuffed with beef in a piquant dill-egg-lemon sauce.  The star is a truly wonderful moussaka. Its beef filling is thick and spicy  with cinnamon and clove, and the eggplant layer is topped with the fluffiest  egg custard.  </P> <P> The secret here is to order either espresso or Greek coffee afterward, because  it comes with lumps of "Greek Delight," a jellied rosewater candy that is  perfect for this hour of the morning: not too chewy and not too sweet.  </P> <P> The Great Greek, 13362 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 905-5250. Sunday  brunch from 11:30 a.m. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two,  sparkling wine included, $25.90.  </P> <P> Ethiopian. All right. This is definitely exotic. On weekdays Keste Demena is  your typical little Ethiopian restaurant with travel posters on the walls and  spicy stewed lamb dishes on the menu, but on Sundays it serves five Ethiopian  breakfast dishes, all liberally laced with red pepper and richly aromatic  Ethiopian spiced butter. They're a little bit like nursery food, but definitely  for grown-ups.  </P> <P> Some are a bit like porridge, some are bready. One of the best is shehan fuul,  boiled fava beans topped with chopped onions, tomatoes and green peppers, to  say nothing of lime juice, cayenne and mass quantities of spiced butter. The  most substantial dish, and possibly the hottest, is tire sega, a real caveman  meal of chunks of very tender raw beef served on sourdough Ethiopian injera  bread with a mound of peppery spice paste.  </P> <P> Keste Demena Ethiopian Restaurant, 5779 W. Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. (213)  933-6522. Sunday brunch from 10 a.m. American Express, MasterCard and Visa  accepted. Brunch for two, food only, $5.50 to $14.50.  </P> <P> Cajun. As a meal, brunch has one big failing -- not enough emphasis on  staggeringly rich desserts. We're tempted to stop off and have some ice cream  in order to achieve the proper aesthetic balance for this hour of morning. In  fact, let's.  </P> <P> No, let's not. Instead, we'll go to Patout's. We'll eat homey Cajun food from a  menu that changes every weekend, and we'll listen to a fairly loud  Cajun/C&amp;W band. Oysters Alexander has a slightly peppery shrimp topping,  much like the one on the lima beans and the wonderfully hearty whipped  potatoes. Shrimp creole comes with a thick tomato sauce. And Patout's peculiar  gumbo is rather like plain chicken soup.  </P> <P> All are mere prelude. The whole point of brunch here is the rich Southern  desserts, such as warm bread pudding with bourbon sauce or a sweet potato-pecan  pie with a crisp, biscuit-like crust and a sweet potato filling topped with  plenty of pecans.  </P> <P> Patout's, 2260 Westwood Blvd., West Los Angeles. (213) 475-7100. Sunday brunch  from 11:30 a.m. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two, with sparkling  wine, $36.  </P> <P> Indian. It certainly looks like we're in for brunch here. This pink and  burgundy room with tall mirrors and planter boxes around the walls is  suspiciously brunch-like. It could pass for one of those hotel ballrooms where  brunch might be served buffet-style from . . . hey, they are serving brunch  from steam tables.  </P> <P> But it's Indian food: beef and lamb shish kebabs, lamb curry with lots of  ground onions, chicken curry heavy on the turmeric, and tandoori chicken  (served cold). Lots of vegetarian dishes, too: pilaf heavy on the black cumin,  several mixed vegetable curries, nice light spinach fritters (pakora), yellow  lentils and so on. Nothing is terribly spicy, but the traditional mint chutney  and a sort of cabbage and pea curry comes close.  </P> <P> The best of the Indian sweets is the honey-soaked cake rasgola, for once  neither soggy nor stale. And it's topped with edible silver foil. Yes, you can  actually eat a precious metal for breakfast here.  </P> <P> We definitely feel better.  </P> <P> Gaylord's, 50 N. La Cienega, Beverly Hills. (213) 652-3838. Saturday and Sunday  brunch from noon. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two, sparkling  wine included, $25.90.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE KING TEMPEST  </P> <P> Can San Diego rise above the divisiveness over the convention center name? Many  of us question the wisdom of some adults who listen with their ears instead of  their hearts.  </P> <P> If we are to heed the words of our new President, who espouses "a kinder,  gentler nation," then it is appropriate for San Diego to take a generous giant  step and honor Martin Luther King.  </P> <P> Martin Luther King was a "kind" man. He was a "gentle" man. He was not a  perfect man. People scream that he did nothing for San Diego. He was, is, and  will be a symbol of non-violence. Is that not enough? Did Washington cross the  San Diego River? Did Lincoln emancipate anyone in your community? Yet, we honor  them and rightfully so.  </P> <P> Every weekday it is my privilege to work with high school students in a basic  skills lab in English. They bring their problems in understanding a symbol in a  story or struggle with a thesis statement in writing. Together we tackle the  problems. They learn from me and I learn from them. This small room is a  microcosm of San Diego. We cross many lines of nationality and race. We live in  many areas of the city. We are San Diego.  </P> <P> Behind the protection of a classroom door we are witnesses to life outside the  high school campus, warts and all. We are silent, but we are not deaf.  </P> <P> Imagine what it is like for kids to focus on a hero. Imagine the questions that  arise when other adults attack the hero. How much kinder and gentler if this  time we adults could set the tone for the new era by endorsing a man like  Martin Luther King, by naming our convention center for him. Could we think of  the future generations that will be rewarded with the first step by a kinder,  gentler San Diego?  </P> <P> SANDRA LIPPE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Emerging risks for your portfolio - Serious Money EMERGING markets are so fashionable nowadays that a good contrarian is rightly suspicious. When markets are in fashion, they often rise to unsustainable levels, and those who buy at the height of the trend suffer the most. Certainly, the phrase 'emerging markets' seems to guarantee the success of a fund launch at the moment. Fidelity has raised more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) for its offshore emerging markets fund since its launch in the middle of October. Large sums are flowing into emerging markets from the US, where investors are both dissatisfied with the returns on cash and concerned with the high valuations placed on US equities. According to Micropal, the 100 largest emerging markets funds grew by over Dollars 7bn in the first six months of the year. One sign that the trend might be getting feverish came when the Hong Kong market, seen as the gateway to the ultimate emerging market of China, jumped 20 per cent in five weeks. The market has shown signs of running out of steam in the last few days. Dr Arnab Banerji, who is chief investment officer of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets, reckons that some markets are overheated at present and that 'there will be tears' for some investors. But he adds that the overheated markets are only a small subset of emerging markets as a whole, and he believes the long term investment arguments hold good. The economic case for emerging markets has been highlighted this week by the US House of Representatives' vote in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and by the trade talks between the US and the Asian countries in Seattle. Both indicate the degree of importance the Americans attach to trade with the developing world. High economic growth rates, the presence of increasingly educated workforces and institutional change in favour of free market capitalism all add weight to the argument for emerging markets investment. And Dr Banerji points out that, in spite of the recent inflows, institutional investors still have very little exposure to the emerging markets. Estimates of the correct weighting for emerging markets in their portfolios tend to vary between 10 and 20 per cent; most are nowhere near that levels. Nevertheless, private investors should be cautious unless they can take a long-term view. If you can afford to wait at least five years, and possibly ten, then a broadly based emerging markets fund still makes sense for 10-20 per cent of a capital growth portfolio. An extra layer of safety could be added by investing via a savings scheme. But if you are investing on a one or two year view, the risk of a correction in these fashionable markets is too great. THE UK Equity Income sector may be less exotic than the world of emerging markets, but it remains one of the favourites of private investors. Now that unit trusts are so often bought in the form of Personal Equity Plans, investors will naturally gravitate towards any sector which offers a higher- than-average yield. But the latest report from Fund Research shows what a difficult year it has been. The average dividend paid by UK companies has fallen by 3.9 per cent. Around 95 per cent of trusts in the sector have been forced to cut their distributions over the last two years (a notable exception is the M &amp; G Dividend fund, profiled on page IV). The yield offered by the sector has dropped from 6.2 to 3.8 per cent over the past 12 months, although that mainly reflects the enormous rise in share prices since sterling left the Exchange Rate Mechanism (as share price rise, yields fall and vice versa). This shift has created a problem for the sector's fund managers. To qualify as an equity income fund, they must produce a yield to investors which is 110 per cent above the All-Share. But this yield is measured after charges and as equity yields have fallen, overcoming the charges hurdle has become more and more difficult. Assuming an All-Share yield of 3.76 per cent, Fund Research calculates that managers would have to invest in a portfolio yielding 5.64 per cent to meet the target. Some managers have attempted to bridge the gap by investing in fixed interest securities and convertibles; others seem to have given up the ghost altogether. Fund Research calculates less than half of the trusts in the sector offer the requisite yield. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds is re-examining its guidelines, which might ease the pressure on the managers. There is some good news to report, however. High-yielding shares have performed particularly well since Black Wednesday, and the average trust in the UK equity income sector has outperformed both the All-Share and funds in the UK equity growth sector. Furthermore, Fund Research feels that, in terms of income, the worst is behind the sector and investors can look forward to resumed growth in distributions, although not at the rate which was achieved in the 1980s.</p>

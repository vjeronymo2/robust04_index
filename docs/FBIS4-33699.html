			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Front for Change and Democracy  [FNCD] advises that it has created a democratic space, bringing  together many sectors that are struggling for democracy in the  country. It is called the 16 December Democratic Camp, or K-16  [Kan Demokratik 16 Desanm]. The FNCD congratulates all  organizations that have united to defend the principles of the  16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 elections. The FNCD says it  has taken this opportunity to tell the population that the  solidarity ... [pauses] the political unity called K-16 has not  preempted the autonomy of the organizations that have joined  this movement.    According to a press release issued by the FNCD on 9 June,  K-16 is an assemblage of all organizations that deem it  necessary to unite the people in order to reach an acceptable  solution to the serious crisis the country has been experiencing  since the 30 September 1991 coup. FNCD says it encourages all  people's and peasant organizations, unions, students, pupils,  women, socioprofessionals, and staunch political parties  throughout the nine geographic departments of the country to  cooperate with K-16 in order to activate, and together support,  peaceful political activities so the crisis can be resolved and  so Aristide can return to the country soon, in order to put an  end to the de facto practice.    The FNCD explains to everyone that peaceful political  activities include nonviolent actions, steps that do not  threaten lives and private or public property. Once again, the  FNCD asks General Cedras and his colleagues to resign to release  the country from its suffering and the danger of an invasion by  foreign forces.    Friends, day has dawned. Get up! The cock has crowed. This  must change, the FNCD concludes in a press release signed by Dr.  Turneb Delpe and Evans Paul. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Unemployment unlikely to have a big influence on voters The last time Europeans went to the polls to elect a new European Parliament in 1989 registered unemployment in the region was nearly 5m lower than it is today, writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor. But given the intractability of the jobless problem, and the universal political commitment to resolving it, unemployment may have surprisingly little impact on voting patterns next month. In 1989 unemployment was heading down towards the cyclical low of 8.3 per cent, reached the following year. It is now stabilising at a cyclical high of around 11 per cent. In actual numbers it was then about 14.5m and it is now 19m. But in most large European Union countries the electorate has lived with persistently high unemployment for nearly two decades and any party offering a quick-fix solution would face a large credibility gap. The differences between left and right on the issue have become more not less blurred in the past few years. The right has traditionally stressed labour market de-regulation while the left has placed more importance on active labour market policy and macro-economic stimulus. Increasingly, the policy mix transcends these polarities. Where the left has been out of office, as in Britain, it has been easier to make some running on the issue. But in France, for example, the Socialist party embraced monetary and fiscal orthodoxy and lived with persistently high unemployment. If anything Mr Edouard Balladur, the Gaullist prime minister, has placed the issue closer to the centre of national politics than his predecessors. In Spain, the Socialist Workers' party has lived with the highest unemployment of any of the larger EU countries, and the number is not expected to peak until next year. In Germany the total seems to have peaked at just over 4m, but that figure disguises the fact that many people have dropped out of the labour market and many others are on temporary make-work schemes.</p>

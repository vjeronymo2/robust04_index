			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Bothorel: "Union Ambiguities"] </F>   [Text] Neither Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, nor  Valery Giscard d'Estaing have taken part in the debate started  by Dominique Baudis [head of the majority's European election  list], who does not want to combine votes with those of Philippe  de Villiers [head of a dissident, anti-Maastricht list].  Charles Pasqua and Bernard Pons, however, made it clear that  the votes garnered by the two lists should be combined.    Was such a point worth a debate? The "union of the majority"  is a very ambiguous notion that can easily be turned on its ear.  While such a union can legitimately find its governmental  expression in the shape of a coalition, it has never assumed the  shape of a single party or a single group in the National  Assembly: There were and are the RPR [Rally for the Republic]  and the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. Before the  parliamentary election of March 1993, there was no such thing as  a homogeneous UDF, but an incomplete UDF alongside the UDC  [Union of the Center]. So UDF cohesion is a very recent thing,  and it mostly stems from Valery Giscard d'Estaing's dogged  determination. Moreover, such a cohesion is fragile, and it is  well-known that some people would be delighted to see it killed.    RPR-UDF voters do not delude themselves on the scope of such  a union, whose praises are being sung by every one of its  leaders. In fact, union is an electoral slogan and strategy,  especially as with regard to parliamentary and European  elections as well as, to a lesser extent, municipal elections.  It definitely does not mean that the various partisan families  have merged or disappeared behind a single flag or man.    In such a context, the De Villiers list was bound to find  its  rightful place. In 1989, when Valery Giscard d'Estaing was  leading the union list, Simone Veil played the part of the  dissident. Given the popularity she was credited with, she had  set the mark quite high, between 12 and 15 percent. Very soon,  it appeared she was going to fail. She ended up with 8.42  percent --nothing to be ashamed of -- while Valery Giscard  d'Estaing achieved nearly 29 percent. The parliamentary Right  totaled 37.3 percent of the votes, a result as outstanding as it  was unexpected.  <H5>  Demanding Electorate </H5>   Philippe de Villiers' performance appears to be the opposite  of Simone Veil's. If the last opinion polls that were made  public are anything to go by, he has been gaining ground  steadily, thus becoming a disruptive factor within the majority.  While initially his list was only credited with an estimated 5  percent, it could now match the result achieved by Simone Veil's  list, or even improve on it. That would spell unmitigated  success for Mr. de Villiers. The Maastricht affair has made its  mark, and times have changed.    In short, nobody can ignore Philippe de Villiers today. But  was it necessary to strengthen him by attempting to exclude him  from the majority? As the campaign draws to a close, Dominique  Baudis' opponent is no longer [Socialist Party Secretary  General] Michel Rocard, but Philippe de Villiers. Three weeks  ago, the latter would not have dared dream of such an improved  standing.    He has undoubtedly struck a chord within the RPR and the  UDF.  Evidence of this are the meetings he organized, which were well  attended. To achieve the shift from activist mobilization to  the mobilization of a fraction of the electorate, he only needed  a little help: He has now got it from the leaders of the  RPR/UDF list.    As soon as Monday [13 June] morning, the stage will be set  for the presidential battle. In the majority, contenders for  the top job are already known.    To be sure, the "union" or "rally" theme will be a core  concern and topic for the presidential candidates who, as we  saw, studiously refrained from direct and explicit attack  against Philippe de Villiers.    In fact, while the government and the various parties have  carefully avoided giving the impression that this election had  much importance in terms of internal politics, it might mark the  beginning of serious turbulences both within the Right and the  Left.    As for the Right, if the De Villiers phenomenon is confirmed  by voters on Sunday, it should force the various presidential  candidates to tone down their union-at-all-costs rhetoric.  Voters might be becoming more demanding as to the force and the  nature of commitments. To paraphrase the word of General de  Gaulle on Europe, there is no certainty that repeating,  mantra-like, "union, union, union" will convince anyone.  Especially as everybody knows very well that behind this noble  word lurk significant political differences on issues. Not to  mention feuds.</p>

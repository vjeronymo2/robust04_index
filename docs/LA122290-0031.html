			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GOSPEL OF CLEAR-TV  </P> <P> It is sad that advertisers bend their knees to the threats of boycotts by such  groups in view of the fact that no such boycott has ever cost any company so  much as a dollar in sales.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, like some voodoo witch doctor, Don Wildmon frightens sponsors  into thinking something evil will happen to them if they don't do his bidding.  Again, how sad for the sponsors, since there is a huge untapped market of  consumers in America's 27 million gays and lesbians, their families and  friends.  </P> <P> Wake up, corporate America, you're being had.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SHERE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

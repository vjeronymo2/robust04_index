			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: China opens up retail sector CHINA is opening its retail sector to foreign joint ventures in 11 regions, following high domestic consumption in a number of cities, Reuter reports from Beijing. Foreign businessmen will be able to enter the retail sector in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, Qingdao and the five special economic zones of Hainan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen. Retail sales rose 15 per cent last year to Yn1,080bn (Pounds 122bn). 'The state still needs to control the development of retail businesses run solely by foreigners,' the official China Daily quoted Mr Hu Ping, minister of commerce, as saying. 'But the state. . . will loosen its controls along with the maturity of the Chinese market as a whole.' Details of controls still needed were not given. The regions are among China's most vibrant. While urban residents in the country as a whole have average per capita monthly cash incomes of Yn176.87, the average in Shenzhen is Yn515.80. In Shanghai the average is Yn267.62. Officials admit statistics do not reflect the extra income earned from second jobs and other sources. An official from the State Statistics Bureau said that, on average, the extra income effectively doubled an urban worker's salary.</p>

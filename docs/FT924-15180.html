			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Renault calls for Volvo shake-up and reaffirms alliance VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, must carry out 'a profound restructuring', Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, its French partner, said yesterday. Mr Schweitzer said the restructuring of Volvo, which suffered losses in its car and commercial vehicle operations in the first half of the year, would be 'painful but necessary'. It is understood that Renault expects Volvo to be forced to take action to reduce its present overcapacity, including the possible closure of one or even both its smaller Swedish assembly plants at Kalmar and Uddevalla. The Renault chairman, who took over from Mr Raymond Levy in the summer, voiced support for the alliance. He had 'no doubt of the capacity of Volvo to carry out' the restructuring. He said the alliance, in which the two groups hold substantial minority cross-shareholdings in each other, was 'irrevocable'. 'Renault has no doubts about the benefits of our alliance. There is every reason for both of us to be tightening our relationship.' The alliance would be deepened on the basis of maintaining 'two distinct brand names and identities', said Mr Schweitzer. Renault, which increased its pre-tax profits fivefold in the first half to FFr5.44bn (Dollars 1.13bn) from FFr962m in the same period a year ago, had 'prospects for satisfactory profits for the full year even taking into consideration a considerably more difficult second half'. He warned that there were as yet no signs of recovery in many European markets such as Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. At the same time 'sharp trend reversals' had been seen recently in Italy and Spain, previously the two chief growth markets in Europe in 1992. Renault had improved its productivity by some 50 per cent between 1985 and 1991, he said. The group's debt no longer constituted a 'major handicap'. Renault, which has emerged as the fastest-growing volume car maker in Europe this year, yesterday launched its new Twingo mini car range as a replacement for its Renault 4 small car.</p>

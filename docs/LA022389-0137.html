			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ECLECTIC COLLECTIONS SPAN HISTORY TO WHIMSY  </P> <P> Fanciful crystal hood ornaments, devilish masks, an audio library of  recollections from older San Fernando Valley residents -- Valley museums are  definitely eclectic in nature. Many have captured what life was like a century  ago through preserving or rebuilding structures, then packing them with  artifacts.  </P> <P> Following are museums and historical collections open to the public, many of  them free. Some are surrounded by parks -- just the locale for a post-museum  family picnic.  </P> <P> * The San Fernando Mission, founded in 1797, contains several museums and  gardens, and a cemetery that is the final resting place for early settlers of  San Fernando.  </P> <P> The mission church, originally built between 1804 and 1806, was leveled in the  1971 earthquake. An exact replica was built on the site and contains a  15th-Century statue of St. Ferdinand that was sent to California by the king of  Spain in the late 1700s.  </P> <P> One building, completed in 1822 and also restored after the earthquake,  features 21 Roman arches and four-foot-thick adobe walls. The building contains  a collection of altar furnishings, vestments, Hispanic furniture, and a wine  cellar and vat where grapes were pressed.  </P> <P> A series of dioramas that re-create carpentry, pottery, saddle-making, weaving  and blacksmith trades are near the west garden. An archival center, assembled  for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, is open most weekdays by appointment and to  the public from 1 to 3 p.m. Mondays and Thursdays.  </P> <P> The mission is at 15151 San Fernando Mission Blvd., Mission Hills, and is open  9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Christmas and Thanksgiving. Admission is $1.50  for adults and 50 cents for children ages 6 to 15.

The department will show  more than 100 Mexican and Guatemalan masks through May 26.  </P> <P> The hand-carved wooden masks in the exhibit were used to celebrate traditional  Indian festivals in 20th-Century Mexico and Guatemala. The masks are based on  the human face, animals and devils.  </P> <P> The Anthropology Department is in the Sierra South building, Room 219, at the  Northridge campus, 18111 Nordhoff St. Admission is free.

Hart Ranch and Museum in Newhall served as silent screen star  William Hart's retirement home until he died in 1946. Hart was billed as "the  bad guy who was really good at heart and turned out to be good at the end,"  said Katherine Child, who manages the collection.  </P> <P> Hart's 22-room Spanish colonial mansion on a hilltop has been preserved as he  left it, right down to his boots in the corner and a tuxedo hanging in the  closet. A large collection of Western paintings, including those of Charles M.  Russell and James Montgomery Flagg, are on display. Navajo rugs, photographs  and movie memorabilia are found throughout the home.  </P> <P> A ranch house at the bottom of the hill contains a tack room where saddles,  some edged in sterling silver, are displayed. A public park, which Hart deeded  to Los Angeles County, surrounds the mansion, and includes hiking and nature  trails, a large picnic area, a dog graveyard where Hart's pets are buried, a  farm machinery exhibit and a small barnyard with horses, goats and birds.  </P> <P> The museum is at 24151 San Fernando Road.

"It looks just as if they walked out of it," said Glenn  Hiatt, museum director.  </P> <P> The kitchen and dining room of the main house at the museum still possess their  original adobe dirt floors. Family portraits line the living room walls.  </P> <P> Plummer House, which stood in Plummer Park in West Hollywood for more than a  century until it was moved to the Leonis Adobe grounds in 1983, serves as a  visitors center for the museum.

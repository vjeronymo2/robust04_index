			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Private View: Aristocrat who chose the cloistered life To be born with a fear of heights when your home is a gothic abbey almost as tall as Notre-Dame looks like some kind of divine jest. Not so for Diane d'Allaines, the owner of a former Cistercian monastery in the south of France. Valmagne Abbey is the one place in the world where vertigo does not bother her. Indeed, the proprietress of Valmagne appears altogether undaunted by the place. She was born there and knows it so well, she says, that she can find her way blindfolded. I asked her if she ever saw monks shuffling in the gloom. 'No,' she replied. Yet her tone of voice was ambiguous. Why do you hesitate? 'Because if you go to the cloister, very often you hear voices.' She paused. 'But I don't believe in ghosts.' No, of course. What sort of voices? 'It's - how do you call that in English? - chuchoter. Whispering. Yesterday I went to the cloister and thought 'But there's somebody there]' No. No one. It's a sort of whisper.' Is it frightening? 'Oh, no, no, no] You can't be afraid here.' Valmagne stands on a southern incline within sight of the Mediterranean and the oyster-beds of Sete. It is protected on the north by natural ramparts of white limestone which rise like mammoth's teeth from the rocky scrub, or garrigues. The Cistercians came here in 1138. An ascetic offshoot of the Benedictine order, they picked sites for their solitude, abundant water and for soil suitable for gardening and viticulture. (They could predict the taste of the wine by tasting the earth.) Diane d'Allaines inherited the 900-acre property through the counts of Turenne on her mother's side of the family. They had acquired it in 1838, with the consent of the bishop of Montpellier, from a M. Granier to whom the place had been sold as a national asset after the French Revolution. Granier used the cool church for ageing his wine: the great oak hogsheads that he installed either side of the nave and round the apse stand there to this day. The present owner's privileged predicament is unusual but not unique. She belongs to a small club of French abbey-proprietors - though the abolition of the law of primogeniture in France has ensured that most are joint owners. 'When I was small it seemed to me absolutely normal to live in such a place,' she said. 'I never had the shock you have who come here for the first time.' Do your friends who live in ordinary houses find you different? 'No, I don't think so. If something could make me a bit old-fashioned it's not because of the place, it is because of the education I received.' Part of that education was at a girls' school in Surrey, where she acquired her well-accented English. For all her background in the landed aristocracy, it has required a certain financial and spiritual ascetism on the part of the abbess of Valmagne (as she jokingly calls herself) to rise to the challenge of the place. Do you sometimes feel it a terrible weight? 'No,' she laughed. 'Sometimes I'm tired. But it's not the place, it's the work.' She is strong-willed and a traditionalist, but quite without hauteur. She looks after people in trouble, and her four dogs were taken in as strays. To me, she would only describe herself as a perfectionist who saw untidiness everywhere. You mean you look for cracks in the walls and litter on the ground? 'I see that, but each time I go to the cloister I think it's so beautiful - unless I'm in a hurry or something.' Do you feel the weight of the past? 'Of course. I am very interested in the past of the abbey. And of course St Bernard (spiritual father of the Cistercians) has occupied a lot of my time. I'm very much impressed by St Bernard. Well, he's been criticised for the Second Crusade, which was a mess. But for his writing and his importance in Europe . . . 'Very often I imagine how they built the church - the time it took, the people, the peasants who were just fed and clothed and defended it during the Hundred Years War. Those people worked to the glory of God, and that's all. No money. 'And when I see the world now, how it is that everything is for money; and I see what is going on in France at the moment - it's amazing, like Italy, all those politicians taking money for themselves - I do compare, and say we are living in a very mad world.' Is it a religious impact the place has on you? 'No, not even. It's that I think the world is very ill and I wonder how long it can continue like that.' She contrasted the profits of the pharmaceutical companies with the poverty of those who died because they could not afford treatment. A door opened and the four dogs, spreadeagled on the dining room floor of the private wing, leapt up barking. 'La paix]', shouted their mistress. I asked her about her own budget. 'I do not spend a lot of money for myself - very, very little. I am not very interested in money, really. Of course I used to travel in the old days. I never go for holidays now.' What about clothes? 'Very ordinary clothes. I try to find clothes nice but not very expensive. Well, that and a bit of food when the children are here.' She was referring to the three young children of Philippe her son and Ruth his English wife who live nearby and run the vineyard. 'When my husband died, I got a little pension.' Valmagne was still in some disrepair when Diane d'Allaines took it over from her mother. There were buckets in the rooms to catch the rain. Fortunately, she had the wherewithal to do something about it. She had inherited another property, a chateau called Brinon near Orleans with an 84-metre frontage (as long as the nave of Valmagne), two wings and 25 bedrooms. 'It was a shooting place and nowadays - poof] - you buy pheasants, you put them in a wood and . . .' She clapped her hands to simulate gunfire. 'All we could do there was put up a luxurious hostel for shooting. That didn't interest me. A choice had to be made between Valmagne and that place. For me, who am quite meridionale, the choice was done.' As if to emphasise the finality of the decision, she referred to Brinon only as 'the other place', never by name. The sale of Brinon enabled her to put a new roof on Valmagne, a job costing over FFr2m (Pounds 250,000), to extend the private wing and thus to convert a romantic relic into a going concern. Had she not been afraid of the responsibility? 'I think I didn't see that, no. I knew it was going to be very hard, but this place was worth it and the other was not. The dogs were restless and she went into the kitchen to get their food. The mongrel's bowl she placed outside the back door, the old red setter's just inside, the little white poodle's by the stove and the bassett-hound's by the coat-rack. 'My life is full' she said. 'It wasn't like that before. Very often I think I've got a lot of worry . . . But I think my life is full and I think too I've done something with my life, something which will survive. And that is a great satisfaction for me. Otherwise, if I had stayed over there in the other place - well, it is a very ordinary life, banal.' Did you think of yourself as a strong person? 'I never asked myself that question, but now - Allez] Dehors]' - she shooed the dogs out - 'I'm not so interested in me like that, you see. The thing is that I'm pushed by events. When I was younger, very often I thought life was difficult. I was asking myself questions. Now I do not. Life - it's hard very often but gives me satisfaction.' The state helps with grants and a recent measure has relieved owners of historic monuments from death duties. Routine maintenance is covered by a grant (currently FFr480,000 a year) and income from visitors, conferences, wedding receptions and the like. The vineyard is quite separate, and just about profitable. She continues to put in her own money for such capital works as re-opening the bricked up abbey windows, three of which have just been completed. But the great church is buckling. Whether by mistake or to preserve the romanesque cloister on its south side, the 13th century architects made the flying buttresses on that side too slender. Do you have dreams of it falling? 'No, no]' she exclaimed with horror. 'You do everything you can. After that . . . well, after a certain point you are not responsible.' And if it suddenly started to move . . . ? 'But don't say that. It's been like that ever since 1257. It won't move tomorrow morning. But we must do everything in such a way that it doesn't move in 20 years. I'm working not for me. I'm working for them . . . That's all.' It was not clear if she meant her heirs or the people of France. 'My feeling is not the feeling of an owner,' she continued. 'I think I'm only a responsable. I'm one in the chain and I must transmit it. And I hope it will stay in the family. But you see we do not know.' If your grandchildren decided to be airline pilots instead, would you be devastated? 'I think if they do not do what they ought to do, they do not deserve it. You see, you must in a way deserve what you have, don't you think? 'And of course I hope one of the three - maybe the three together if they get on - will be able to keep it. If not, well . . . ' She broke off with a shrug. 'When you are born in a family to whom this sort of place belongs, you must consider yourself as a responsable and not an owner. You have no rights. You have duties. I will try and explain all that when they are older. 'They must also be thankful for all the generations before who have kept the place and transmitted the place. And that they must never forget.'</p>

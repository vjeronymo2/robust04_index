			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Offshore banks of Bahrain lift asset levels TOTAL assets of Bahrain's offshore banking units rose 10.3 per cent to Dollars 56.80bn in the first quarter of this year, according to the Bahrain Monetary Agency's quarterly bulletin. The total is also an 18 per cent improvement on the record low of Dollars 48bn to which asset levels sank during the Gulf war, which temporarily rocked confidence in banking in the region. The BMA bulletin put the number of offshore banks operating on the island at 46, a considerable fall from the 75 operating from Bahrain during the mid-1970s, when it was the centre of the region's petro-dollar recycling boom. However, the growing sophistication of banks in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, and the general fall in local lending opportunities has slimmed the number of offshore banking units on the island. Two locally-incorporated offshore banking units, Kuwait Asia Bank and the Bahrain Arab International Bank (BAIB), have decided to begin liquidating their assets - the BAIB in readiness to close.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DIE HARD 2' BLAZES ON THE 4TH OF JULY  </P> <P> "Die Hard 2," 20th Century Fox's entry in the summer '90 Box Office Blockbuster  Sweepstakes, grossed $5.9 million on July 4, a day that is traditionally low in  attendance because of the outdoor celebrations associated with the holiday.  </P> <P> "It's Christmas," shouted a jubilant Tom Sherak, president of marketing and  distribution at Fox.  </P> <P> "If you'd told me we would do just under $6 million on July 4, I would have  told you to go to the hospital for a mental checkup."  </P> <P> Sherak said the studio would have been happy with a $4-million July 4; as it  turned out, "Die Hard 2" grossed almost that much from its preview opening  Tuesday. The $3.7-million Tuesday receipts will not be counted as opening-week  figures, however.  </P> <P> "Tuesday is Tuesday, a preview day," said Sherak, preparing some tangled logic.  "We opened on Wednesday and Tuesday's figure have nothing to do with the  opening."  </P> <P> The Fox executive declined to predict how well the film will do through Sunday,  but other analysts said it could do as much as $30 million, which would make it  the strongest-opening film of the year.  </P> <P> July 4 figures were not released by other studios.

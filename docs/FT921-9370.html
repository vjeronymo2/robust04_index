			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / GEC Alsthom dispute fuelled by job cut threat AN INDUSTRIAL dispute at a plant of GEC Alsthom, the switchgear company, has intensified after management told unions it wants to shed a further 157 jobs. About 430 of the 650-strong workforce at Openshaw, near Manchester, have been on strike for more than five weeks over the compulsory redundancy of 12 people. These were part of a shedding of 95 jobs announced in September. Negotiations on a settlement to the dispute will inevitably be complicated by the further job losses. GEC Alsthom had previously indicated that more job losses were necessary, but unions say that 157 is worse than they had feared. The company may seek volunteers for the cuts. Unions, however, believe it will seek further compulsory severances. Many groups of workers have threatened industrial action over redundancies in the recession but few have taken it. Strikes on any issue have been rare in the past year. The GEC Alsthom strikers will be told by unions today of the management plans, which also include a reduction in the size of the plant. The company said yesterday that the workforce reduction was because of depressed demand for medium-voltage switchgear equipment and the need to cut costs to compete. Orders had declined further since the 95 redundancies were announced. The company said it regretted the compulsory redundancies. Continued efforts were being made to resolve the dispute before the company suffered irreparable dam-age. Mr Larry Brooke, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the strikers were not fighting for money but the right to work. Workers from the plant yesterday demonstrated about redundancies outside GEC's London headquarters. GEC Alsthom is owned 50 per cent by GEC and 50 per cent by Alcatel of France.</p>

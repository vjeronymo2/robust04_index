			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS PULLS INTO TIE FOR WSC LEAD;  </P> <P> JC BASEBALL: GIBSON STYMIES GLENDALE WITH A 5-HITTER TO END MONTHLONG  CONFERENCE DROUGHT.  </P> <P> Lance Gibson is a starting pitcher for College of the Canyons, but his  complete-game victory at Glendale on Wednesday came as quite a relief -- for  his relievers and his coach.  </P> <P> Beginning a stretch of three Western State Conference games in four days,  including a date with conference co-leader Cuesta on Saturday, Canyons Coach  Len Mohney wasn't eager to overextend his pitching staff against Glendale.  </P> <P> Gibson responded with a complete-game five-hitter, allowing only one earned run  in Canyons' 14-2 victory. Gibson (4-3) had not won a WSC game since March 22,  but his effort Wednesday helped boost Canyons (21-10, 12-3 in conference play)  into a first-place tie with Cuesta, a game ahead of Moorpark.  </P> <P> "To get a complete game out of Gibson makes us real healthy for (today) and  Saturday," Mohney said.  </P> <P> Canyons led, 6-0, when Gibson allowed an unearned run in the eighth. Glendale  scored its other run in the ninth on John Bojanac's eighth home run of the  season.  </P> <P> "It felt good to go the distance," said Gibson, who struck out five and walked  only one. "It's probably one of my best games of the season, and it's good to  get it late in the season."  </P> <P> The game began as a pitchers' duel; Gibson combining an effective split-finger  fastball with off-speed pitches, and Glendale left-hander Matt Whisenant  countering with his mitt-popping fastball.  </P> <P> Canyons led, 1-0, after five innings before touching Whisenant (4-4) for two  runs in the sixth.  </P> <P> Gary Vlcek replaced Whisenant in the eighth, but the only relief he provided  was to the Canyons batters, who had struck out 10 times against Whisenant but  battered Vlcek with 11 runs in 1 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> The defense for Glendale (12-22, 6-10) contributed to the blowout by committing  four errors during Vlcek's stint.  </P> <P> Canyons scored three runs in the eighth and eight more in the ninth.  </P> <P> Second baseman Steve Kovacic, recently moved to the cleanup spot, hit a  three-run home run to left in the ninth, and first baseman Mike Kerber followed  three batters later with another three-run home run to left. Kerber had  Canyons' only other extra-base hit, a double.  </P> <P> Every starter had at least one hit and one strikeout in Canyons' 18-hit  onslaught. Gary Morgan, the only regular who didn't score, led the team with  four hits. Ron Robart, Kovacic, Charlie Fowlks and Billy Horvat all had two  hits apiece for Canyons.  </P> <P> Canyons also stole nine bases.  </P></p>

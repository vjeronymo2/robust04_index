			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jimmy Steepe] </F>   [Text] The first glimpse into the report compiled by former  South African Defence Force [SADF] General Pierre Steyn into the  activities of the Military Intelligence's Directorate of Covert  Collection [DCC] points to high level collusion between the  police and the defence force. And the common link between the  two is former Vlakplaas commander, Eugene De Kock, who is named  in reports of the Steyn investigation as well as the Goldstone  Commission.    The Attorney General of the Transvaal, Dr Jan D'Oliveira,  told NEW NATION that De Kock's name appears in Gen Steyn's  report as well as the Goldstone Commission reports dealing with  Third Force violence. Gen Steyn was appointed by former  President F.W. de Klerk to investigate the DCC following a  Goldstone Commission raid on the directorate's offices in  Pretoria in 1992.    D'Oliveira also said that activities to which De Kock had  allegedly been linked included train and hostel violence. De  Kock gained notoriety when he was charged with training of  Askaris [former ANC members working for the South African  Police] at the Vlakplaas base of the South African Police in the  1980's.    "We are investigating various incidents of violence in the  train and hostels that could be tied-up together with De Kock's  activities," D'Oliveira said.    "There are certain similarities appearing in the Steyn and  Goldstone Commission reports which we are investigating".    "We have a large number of things which we are looking at  which De Kock might have been involved in," he said. "Incidents  of train and hostel violence feature high up in the  investigation".    Meanwhile, mystery surrounds the whereabouts of the complete  report compiled by Steyn into the DCC. Lawyers say that in  terms of procedure the report should have been handed to the  then State President F.W. de Klerk.    But De Klerk's spokesperson, Richard Carter, told NEW NATION  that no such report existed in the Deputy President's office.  Carter said the former president was briefed "verbally" about  the findings of the commission but because it was an "internal  matter" it did not warrant a written report.    Questions about Steyn's report first came to light when  President Nelson Mandela asked De Klerk to hand him the report  during a television debate shortly before the elections. De  Klerk, who appeared embarrassed, told Mandela that he could not  hand him the report because he felt it did not contain any  sensitive information that warranted his attention.    However, almost 18 months after the report was handed to De  Klerk, there has been no subsequent finding from either the  police or the Attorney-General's office on the relevance of  Steyn's findings.    Asked about the report, Steyn said he did not think it  appropriate to comment.    What is known, however, is that a number of senior officers  were suspended from duty following the report. Lawyers for  Human Rights spokesperson, Jody Kollapen, told NEW NATION that  he found it difficult to believe that De Klerk, who had asked  for the investigation, did not get a copy of the report.  Kollapen said he thought it was "standard government procedure  that after every commission a report should be handed to the  state president for consideration.    "If General Steyn was commissioned by the state president to  conduct the investigation, De Klerk should have been the first  person to have received his report." "I find it strange that  someone who had commissioned a report would feel it was not  necessary to study the finding even when further investigation  was necessary," said Kollapen. "I do not believe that De Klerk  was not given a copy of the report."    The DCC members were sacked by De Klerk following the  Goldstone Commission raid on their offices and the subsequent  investigation by General Steyn.</p>

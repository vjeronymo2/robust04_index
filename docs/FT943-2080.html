			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: Timothy West's 'Macbeth' - Theatre If the last two Macbeths you saw were Alan Howard (National Theatre, spring 1993) and Derek Jacobi (Royal Shakespeare Company, winter 1993-4), then you may well find it refreshing to turn to Timothy West (Theatr Clwyd, right now). It is rare today to hear anyone speak Shakespeare so naturally (I wish I had seen his Falstaff), and to hear an actor speak verse with such communicative ease. His technique is virtually invisible: no bravura feats of legato breath-control, no lieder-like strokes of special word-painting, no here's-something-I-prepared-earlier calculation. He simply utters the words, in calm phrases, as if he was thinking them for the first time. So it sounds ungrateful to say that West almost never convinces as Macbeth. His kind of naturalness is itself wrong, for it involves scaling the nervous heights of the role down to a level too ordinary. Early on in the big dagger soliloquy, he began to remind me of a housemaster confronting some baffling disturbance in the corridor outside the dormitories; and, once I had seen the resemblance, I could not shake it off. He addresses the hallucinatory dagger with utmost reasonableness: how strange that he cannot grasp the thing. Then, it hits him: this is indeed a hallucination. Well, he is resigned to that; hallucinations do happen, after all, in difficult circumstances; but we must all just buckle down and help him through this trying time. When it comes to 'Nature seems dead', he can darken his voice and enlarge his vision to something beyond the everyday. But not for long. Even Banquo's ghost only disturbs him for as short a while as possible. His spirit does harden, and he does grow distant from his wife, and he wears his criminality with greater ease, yes; but the vast scale of Macbeth's overwrought thoughts eludes him wholly. Still, his way of speaking affords the simple and invaluable pleasure of keeping our attention on Macbeth as it unfolds moment by moment. This pleasure is provided nowhere else in Helena Kaut-Howson's staging. Everyone works very hard indeed to project. Earnestness and eagerness hang heavy in the air, but never dispel the production's basic dullness of spirit. Alexandra Mathie (heroine of Helena Kaut-Howson's recent Jane Eyre) brings a genteel vein of spinsterly anxiety to Lady Macbeth. As usual, the witches are ghastly; these ones wail a great deal, thrash artificially around the stage, and seem much more unhappy than Macbeth himself. (They reminded me of the actress Kathryn Hunter even before I noted that she is listed as Kaut-Howson's co-director.) But nobody here seems to be in the same play as anybody else. The production boasts some of the worst lighting - by Nick Beadle - I have ever seen. Sometimes it tries to be naturalistic, as for the nocturnal scene after Duncan's murder - and yet when the torches leave the stages, Malcolm and Donalbain are left in as much stage light as before. Or it tries to be eerily dramatic, as when Lady Macbeth is suddenly lit by sidelights and a footlight to give three huge shadows; the effect, however, is one of tawdry melodrama. Often the person speaking is none too visible. Pamela Howard's designs have all kinds of unusual touches. I enjoyed the backpack Macbeth wears, and the curious black-feather ruff his wife wears with her Victorian tartan frock for the banquet. But my favourite was the pair of Eskimo boots she wore for her first appearance. At Theatr Clwyd, Mold</p>

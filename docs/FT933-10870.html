			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Bachelor party no fun for Thai MPs THE THAI law forbidding prostitution is probably the least-enforced act in the world. But even in Bangkok it is unusual for 30 government members of parliament to be caught on the same night consorting with women of doubtful virtue - especially during an official campaign against the sex trade. In the last two days the Thai press has reported with relish on an end-of-term 'bachelor' party held for MPs from the New Aspiration party in Bangkok's Emerald Hotel last Wednesday; the host was Mr Boonchu Trithong, a deputy finance minister and deputy NAP leader. The revelations have been denied by some of the embarrassed MPs - who described the girls variously as 'artists', 'singers' and 'actresses' - but they have hardly stunned the nation. Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the NAP leader who was not at the party, described the women as singers rather than prostitutes, but did not dispel the notion that it was normal for MPs to cavort with prostitutes. 'Had they been prostitutes, the party would have been held secretly,' he said. The publicity is particularly embarrassing for the five-party coalition government because it has campaigned against prostitution, although the emphasis has been on protecting children used in the trade. Earlier this month, the government banned the latest edition of Longman's Dictionary of English Language and Culture because it described Bangkok as being known for both its Buddhist temples and its prostitutes. The only comfort for the government is that opposition MPs are unlikely to have spotless records. Thai women's organisations have pointed out that it is useless for the government to try to improve the country's tarnished image if government officials are themselves involved in prostitution.</p>

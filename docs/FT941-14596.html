			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Bentsen hints on Vietnam trade embargo Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, suggested yesterday in Bangkok that there could be an early end to the US trade embargo against Vietnam. The embargo has isolated Vietnam for 30 years and Mr Bentsen said people like him wanted to 'get it done; get it behind us'. Speaking to Thai bankers he said Hanoi had made progress in accounting for US servicemen missing in action or held as prisoners of war and that a 'strategy of engagement' might be the best way forward. US officials said that American bankers in the region had told Mr Bentsen the time had come to end a policy that only served to boost US trade competitors. Mr Bentsen also said he was 'encouraged' by statements by leading US legislators such as Democratic Senator John Kerry, who has indicated that he would support dropping the embargo. Mr Kerry ended a visit to Hanoi earlier this week and praised the Vietnamese authorities for their co-operation in resolving the 'missing-in-action' (MIA) issue. After watching 100 US and Vietnamese soldiers excavate for the remains of MIAs at the weekend, Mr Kelly said 'all of the signs are moving in the right direction' Admiral Charles Larson, currently in Vietnam, is the highest-ranking US military officer to visit the country since the war ended. Admiral Larson, commander-in-chief of Pacific Forces, is trying to determine the fate of 2,239 US servicemen still listed as missing. A US trade embargo has been in place against North Vietnam since 1964; this was extended to the whole country in 1975 when Communist forces defeated the US-backed forces in the south. Last year the US eased restrictions to allow Vietnam to borrow from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and to allow US companies to bid for projects financed by these institutions. Mr Bentsen leaves today for China on the last leg of his three-country tour to encourage Asian nations to open their booming economies to US companies and exports. He will be the most senior member of the Clinton administration to visit China. His tour started in Indonesia.</p>

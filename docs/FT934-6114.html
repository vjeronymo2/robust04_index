			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Outlook better for machine tool sector Britain's machine-tool industry faces another nine to 12 months of difficult trading conditions, but its long-term prospects are encouraging because the increased competitiveness of UK manufacturing. This is the conclusion of the annual industry forecast by Oxford Economic Forecasting for the Machine Tool Technologies Association. Machine tools have been one of the worst-hit industrial sectors in the recession - production dropped from Pounds 941m in 1990 to Pounds 624m last year and is predicted to rise only marginally this year to Pounds 632m. Mr John Walker, the forecasting organisation's managing director, said the recovery in sales which he had predicted would start this autumn was now likely to be delayed, mainly because of the weakness of continental European markets. Over the next nine to 12 months the Continental recession would limit export demand, he said. And the UK market would be weak because the growing industries - chemicals, electrical engineering and metals - did not buy many machine tools. In contrast, recovery was weak in the main machine-tool purchasing sectors - aerospace, automotive and general mechanical engineering - and investment increases were likely to be delayed 'for a little while at least'. Mr Walker predicted, however, that machine tool production would rise to Pounds 758m in 1995 and Pounds 852m in 1996. Industry's increased competitiveness, based on relatively low wage costs and high productivity growth, would also be reflected in better predicted growth rates for UK machine-tool output than for imports.</p>

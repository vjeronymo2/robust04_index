			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPK/RHR: "At Least 80 Dead in Incidents in </F> Bujumbura According to Ambassador"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 1 Feb (BELGA) -- The fresh outburst of  violence in Bujumbura has claimed something like 80 deaths over  the last 24 hours, claimed Burundian Ambassador Jean  Ngendanganya in Brussels on Tuesday afternoon [1 February],  before inviting Belgium and the European Union to increase and  improve its humanitarian aid to the Burundian population.    On Tuesday morning there were at least three casualties, and  houses were once again set on fire in the Burundian capital, but  the Army and Gendarmerie are not interceding, added the  ambassador, speaking at a news conference given in Brussels. It  should be remembered that the Army consists primarily of members  of the Tutsi ethnic minority.    "We are asking Belgium and the European Union to increase  their aid to Burundi, and to improve its distribution, so as to  ensure that it reaches those for whom it is intended. A large  proportion of this aid is actually being hijacked," reiterated  the ambassador.    The interethnic confrontations have been provoked by a new  power struggle between the government of Mrs. Sylvie Kinigi and  the extremist opposition, following the removal from office on  Saturday by the minister of justice of five of the seven members  of the Constitutional Court, which has to rule on whether or not  the choice of Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira to succeed Mr. Ndadaye is  constitutional. The dismissed magistrates are all Tutsis.    The members of the Constitutional Court were ready to  invalidate the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, explained the  ambassador. However, the current atmosphere of violence has  rendered it impossible to hold a new presidential election. It  is for this reason that the Parliament (the majority of whose  members are Hutus -- BELGA editor's note) elected Mr. Cyprien  Ntaryamira as the new president of Burundi on 20 January in an  emergency procedure. This choice represented a consensus  between all the political forces, for 78 out of the 79 deputies  present had come out in favor of the election of Mr. Ntaryamira,  and it is inadmissible that his appointment now be called into  question, added the ambassador.    The assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu,  during a coup d'etat by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October,  had provoked an outbreak of violence between the Hutus and  Tutsis, resulting in several tens of thousands of deaths and  creating hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p>

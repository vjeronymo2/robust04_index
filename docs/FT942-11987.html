			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): BAT rides out US war on smoking - Other Companies BAT Industries' first-quarter figures tomorrow are expected to show a healthy rise from Pounds 354m pre-tax to about Pounds 385m. Despite the much-publicised war on smoking in the US - which BAT defied last week by buying American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) - its tobacco profits may be around the same as last year. The real profits increase will come from insurance, through further recovery by Eagle Star from its upsets in mortgage indemnity and through real progress at Allied Dunbar in the UK and Farmers in the US. Electrolux: Europe's leading white goods manufacturer will show the benefits of a strong US sales performance and a bottoming out in Europe when it presents its first-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts believe profits could exceed SKr600m (Pounds 51m) for the period, compared with SKr202m last year. Tate &amp; Lyle: The sugar and sweeteners group is expected to report a Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m rise in interim profits tomorrow from Pounds 107.6m to Pounds 120m-plus. Most of the rise will come from US and Australian operations. Improving markets for Staley, its US corn starch business, will have helped profits, as will recovery in its US sugar businesses, hit last year by teething troubles at a new desugarisation plant at its cane sugar operation, and difficult trading conditions for its beet sugar business. Exchange rates will also aid profits. A rise in the interim dividend is expected in line with Tate's progressive policy. Tate will also be asked about the lapsing yesterday of its bid for two sugar mills in Australia. Body Shop: Overseas growth, especially in the US, is expected to boost Body Shop International's year-end results when they are revealed on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to rise from Pounds 21.5m to between Pounds 25m and Pounds 27m, with UK operating profits a little ahead of last time's Pounds 11.2m. The US should pitch in about Pounds 4.5m (up from Pounds 2m, though this was affected by the move of the headquarters to North Carolina). The dividend should rise from 1.7p to at least 1.85p. BP: The UK-based international oil company reports its first-quarter results on Thursday. Oil prices lower than a year ago will reduce the benefits from cost-savings, strong downstream margins in the US, lower interest charges and a swing back to profits in chemicals. Replacement cost pre-tax profits will be about Pounds 250m, against Pounds 231m last time and Pounds 315m in the fourth quarter.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELLOWSTONE LIVES ON  </P> <P> Western senators and congressmen still are beating the bushes for scapegoats in  the aftermath of last summer's fires in and around Yellowstone National Park.  As the new session of Congress was getting under way, Sen. Alan K. Simpson  (R-Wyo.) told a Wyoming newspaper that congressional hearings would have two  major goals: "to avoid this kind of thing in the future and to pin blame for  what happened in the past." There would be a new cast of characters in the  National Park Service under the Bush Administration, he said, and they would be  selected to some degree on the basis of fire-fighting policy.  </P> <P> Such retribution is senseless. A careful analysis of what really happened in  Yellowstone last summer demonstrates that very little could have been done to  affect the scope of the fires or the extent of destruction. The chairman of a  federal fire-management review team said that "there never was a way to  preclude what happened in Yellowstone this year."  </P> <P> The review team, while not passing judgment on the Yellowstone decisions,  defended the National Park Service's policy of permitting certain naturally  caused fires to burn themselves out in pursuit of acceptable ecological goals.  But the officials added that fire-fighting efforts might have to be undertaken  in some instances because of social and economic consequences. The Yellowstone  fires were fought with considerable success in preventing economic loss,  specifically in the saving of man-made structures like Old Faithful Inn and  related buildings. But the major damage may have been political, as officials  like Simpson and Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) joined the panicky attacks on  Park Service and Interior Department officials for not doing more to stop the  fires.  </P> <P> In fact, the fires burned far less acreage than was being reported last August  and September. The biggest fires were fought from the beginning because they  had been man-caused. The majority of the large fires did not even begin within  Yellowstone, but in lands outside the park under the jurisdiction of the U.S.  Forest Service, which has a more vigorous fire-suppression policy.  </P> <P> One of the best retrospectives of the park fires, written by nature writer Ted  Williams, appeared in the January issue of Audubon magazine. Williams was  vacationing in Yellowstone during the peak of the long fire season. From his  own observations, and from follow-up research, Williams found that while the  fire perimeter encircled 1.4 million acres, the vegetation in 30% to 70% of  that area was untouched. "I'd seen and guessed that there was 10% black,"  Williams wrote, but the Park Service estimated 20%.  </P> <P> Some plant life remained in all but one-tenth of 1% of the 1.4 million acres.  While the politicians had complained about the sterilization of the soil in  vast stretches of the fire area, implying that nothing would grow there again,  soil scientists and wildlife biologists said that there was no soil  sterilization, even in the most intensely burned regions.  </P> <P> Critics also complained that the Park Service was reluctant to use bulldozers  to cut fire lines. The lines that were actually plowed with the machines proved  ineffective. Foot crews armed with axes worked best. Much of the damage that  the Park Service must contend with was caused by bulldozers where they were  allowed to tear up meadows.  </P> <P> The fires were part of a natural process that probably would have, and should  have, occurred decades ago but for past policy of putting out every fire as  soon as possible. This permitted dry fuel to build up on the forest floor.  Turned to tinder by drought conditions, all it needed was one spark.  </P> <P> As Williams left Yellowstone last fall, he said that he reflected on all the  changes that Yellowstone had undergone since the last Ice Age. Except for the  wolves hunted to extinction in the area, all of Yellowstone was still there.  "Nothing basic had changed," he said. "The park had survived all those  millennia with scarcely any human help." And, presumably, Yellowstone will  survive even the angry politicians still seeking scapegoats.  </P></p>

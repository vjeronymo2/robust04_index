			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bridge Oil buys US assets for ADollars 76m Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, yesterday announced that it is buying a number of properties - including some undeveloped acreage - in the US from Santa Fe Energy Resources for around ADollars 76m (USDollars 50m). It also unveiled plans to float a minority interest in its American subsidiary in the US. The assets are being acquired by Bridge Oil (USA), the company's existing US vehicle, which is currently 100 per cent owned by the Australian parent. They include producing natural gas and oil properties in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, in the Texas Panhandle, and other smaller interests in Wyoming and central Texas. Bridge said that the properties currently contain about 56.8bn cu ft equivalent of net proved and probable reserves, worth ADollars 60m. The exploration acreage, costing ADollars 16m, totals about 9.2m acres in the western US, the bulk of which offers exploration rights for up to 13 years and conversion into long-term production leases if a discovery is made. The company plans to fund the deal via a mixture of cash and shares - including the delivery of a 10 per cent interest in Bridge Oil (USA) to Santa Fe Energy. The initial public offering of shares in Bridge Oil (USA), which is conditional on regulatory approvals, will involve 4m shares, and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a ADollars 67m dividend payment to Bridge Oil itself. After the flotation, it is estimated that around 28.57 per cent of Bridge Oil (USA) will be owned by the general public; 10 per cent by Santa Fe; and the remaining 61.43 per cent by the parent Bridge Oil company. Bridge Oil became involved in the US petroleum industry in 1981, expanding in the late-1980s. In January 1990, it spent ADollars 147m on a package of producing properties from USX Corporation.</p>

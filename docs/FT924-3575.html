			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Observer: Speech therapy South African society has always had a first-world and a third-world sector, and never the twain did meet. But now the first-worlders are to get access to the healing powers of the third world via Telkom, the state telephone monopoly. For R6 a minute (Pounds 1.20), anyone with a phone can consult a sangoma or traditional Zulu spiritual healer, to cure ailments of the mind or body. The sangoma will in turn consult the caller's ancestral spirits to find out the cause of the ailment and the cure. (That is done through mystical channels, without recourse to Telkom, it seems.) Given that 80 per cent of South Africans regularly consult traditional healers, the service could well prove popular. If callers do not like what the sangoma has to say, however, they can try Telkom's alternative services: SexTalk, LoveTalk or the Princess Diana tapes.</p>

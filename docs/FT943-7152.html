			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Securities houses get Taiwan's approval Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give final approval today on applications by eight foreign securities houses to set up branch offices on the island, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. The SEC yesterday said Japan's big four securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko), Britain's Baring Securities and S G Warburg, W I Carr, the broking arm of Banque Indo-Suez of France, and the Goldman Sachs of the US were all qualified to upgrade from representative offices to branch offices. For several years Merrill Lynch has been the only foreign brokerage permitted to maintain a branch in Taiwan. Foreign brokers will have nine branches and 16 representative offices in Taiwan, according to the SEC. Taiwan last year eased the capitalisation rules for foreign brokerages to set up a branch on the island, lowering the minimum capitalisation from TDollars 200m to TDollars 100m (Dollars 7.5m to Dollars 3.78m). But foreign brokers are still required to have operated a representative office for a year before applying to set up a branch. In another liberalisation move, the finance ministry said yesterday said it would allow new companies to underwrite short-term paper, with a minimum capitalisation of TDollars 2bn. The government also said banks would be allowed to underwrite and certify commercial paper a year after these rules took effect. Banks are currently banned from underwriting commercial paper, and there are only three companies underwriting short-term paper, all of them government owned. In a related development, the finance ministry plans to break the monopoly held by the Kuomintang-controlled Fuh-Hwa Securities Finance Corp, Taiwan's only margin finance lender. Four business groups have applied to set up securities finance firms. Taiwan's financial deregulation is being motivated in part by its desire to expedite entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

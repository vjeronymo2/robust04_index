			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charles Lambroschini: "Balladur in China: What </F> Went Amiss"]    [Text] "With regard to human rights, Balladur ought to  have spoken out. But he belongs to the Pompidou generation, and  he maintained the habits of 1960's diplomacy, when there was no  need to do so...." A member of the French delegation, on the  plane home on Sunday [10 April], tried to describe the mistake  which made the prime minister's visit to China go amiss. He was  not alone.    The regrets began in Shanghai on Saturday when the arrest of  large numbers of dissidents had looked like deliberate  provocation. Forgetting diplomatic jargon, Alain Juppe  exclaimed: "It is beginning to look like a lot of people. We  do not like it at all."    On the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Beijing, Wei  Jingsheng's arrest was interpreted merely as a deterrent  measure. Seen from Paris, the Chinese authorities simply wanted  to prevent the most famous of Chinese dissidents, released last  year after 14 years in prison, from seizing the opportunity of  this visit to give resounding interviews to the journalists who  were due to accompany the prime minister.    But, following the arrest of a second dissident in Beijing  on  Friday, just when Edouard Balladur was giving journalists a  satisfied assessment of the political phase of his visit, the  tough interrogations of three other dissidents in the big  southern city could no longer leave any doubt. One deputy  noted: "Contrary to what Balladur said in his press conference,  `discretion' does not necessarily guarantee `effectiveness' when  dealing with the Chinese."    Another member of the delegation went further: "We came too  soon. After signing the joint declaration in January which  closed the dispute created by the arms sales to Taiwan, Edouard  Balladur ought not to have agreed to this visit without a  serious guarantee that contracts would be signed and without  specific plans for political cooperation. He ought to have  demanded payment in advance."    One diplomat who is an expert on China explained that  Balladur had come at the "wrong time." According to this  expert, the approach of the fifth anniversary of the Tienanmen  Square massacre had mobilized dissidents who were determined not  to allow the event to pass without commemorating it. The  authorities, for their part, were very nervous and allowed the  police to act at the slightest move. "Li Peng," the diplomat  stressed, "learned from the 1989 events that by responding too  late, you are likely to face an uncontrollable situation.  However, because of the social tensions created by economic  modernization, he fears an even more serious crisis than five  years ago. This time, he is afraid that dissidence by  intellectuals will spark off a revolt by workers, threatened  with unemployment, and by poor peasants more than 100 million of  whom are roaming the roads."    One last restrospective regret: Edouard Balladur, according  to several experts talking to journalists on Saturday, was a  hostage in the battle for power which is currently stirring up  the candidates to succeed old Deng Xiaoping. By refusing to  invite Li Peng to Paris, the prime minister gave the impression  that he was choosing one camp against another. This apparent  involvement by a foreigner in an internal battle was immediately  punished by the arrest of dissidents. In the plane between  Shanghai and Paris, the matter turned into a case of settling  scores. The culprit was no longer Li Peng but the French press.  Sent by the prime minister, Alain Juppe lectured to the special  correspondents: "You focused on human rights and you did not see  our objective. We were looking to the long term. If France  wishes to establish a place on what will be the biggest market  in the year 2000, it must start now. If we want to have proper  political relations with a country which represents one-third of  the world's population, we must take the risk of taking the  first step. There were no longer contacts between the two  governments. Our ambassador was no longer received by the  Chinese authorities. This visit was not only useful. It was  necessary."    The demonstration would have been more convincing if Edouard  Balladur and his entourage had sought contact with the press  earlier. But, with regard to human rights, the rule was to say  nothing. The prime minister did not wish to explain his  analysis to the press for fear of seeming to provoke the  Chinese. This was in vain, because, seeing on Saturday that the  Chinese had laid a trap for him, Balladur eventually publicly  condemned the arrests of dissidents as "unacceptable."  <H5>  Goading </H5>   Another observation is the inconsistencies between some of  the French statements. Before his arrival in China, Alain Juppe  had said in an interview with LIBERATION that the Chinese  authorities' attention would be drawn to a number of dissidents  by handing over a list of names. Following the talks in Beijing  between the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers,  who met in private to discuss delicate matters, Balladur issued  a denial that any list had been handed over.    Members of the delegation had advised the prime minister to  respond to Li Peng's goading by a statement as firm as the one  in 1984 in which Francois Mitterrand mentioned the "symbolic  case" of Sakharov during an official banquet at the Kremlin.  Others had suggested that the prime minister should cut short  his visit as Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then National Assembly  speaker, did in Moscow in 1980.    Each time the prime minister said no: The state's interest  should come before its pride. But, in Paris, this attitude had  the opposite effect. One final comment in the plane by one of  those who accompanied Balladur: "By preferring to stick to  reason, the prime minister, paradoxically, lacked realism."</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH OFFICER KILLS ROBBERY SUSPECT  </P> <P> A man suspected of robbing the customer of a bank automated teller machine was  shot and killed by a Long Beach police officer who apparently believed he was  armed and aiming at him, officials said Saturday. No gun was found with the  body.  </P> <P> A second suspect, 24-year-old Keith Hughes of Compton, was arrested. The  robbery occurred Friday night at a Bank of America building near the corner of  Willow Street and Daisy Avenue.  </P> <P> The identity of the dead man had not been released by late Saturday. He was  pronounced dead at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center shortly after the 8 p.m.  incident.  </P> <P> The incident began when officers discovered two suspects beating a victim who  apparently had just made a withdrawal from the teller machine.  </P> <P> When ordered to surrender, the suspects fled in different directions, police  said. Officer Jim Hill, a 13-year veteran, said he observed one of the suspects  turn toward him with an object in his right hand. The officer said he fired at  him, but the suspect continued to run.  </P> <P> About two blocks away, Officer Ralph Robbins, an eight-year veteran, caught up  with the suspect, who he said was crouched behind a car.  </P> <P> "He was still holding the object in his right hand," Long Beach Police Lt.  Philip King said. "Thinking that the suspect had a weapon and was preparing to  fire at him, Officer Robbins fired at the suspect."  </P> <P> He was hit by about four shots, authorities said.  </P> <P> Investigators said no gun was found on or near his body.  </P> <P> As is the procedure in all officer-involved shootings, the district attorney's  special investigations division was called in to determine whether the officers  were justified in using lethal force.  </P> <P> The robbery victim, who was not identified, was treated at the scene for his  injuries and released.  </P> <P> Hughes was booked for investigation of murder as well as robbery. Police  alleged that by fleeing, Hughes provoked the use of deadly force against the  second suspect.  </P></p>

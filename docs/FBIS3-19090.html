			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed M.d.M.: "The EU Committe of Regions Is Born </F> -- Institution Presidency Slips Through Luc Van den Brande's  Hands"]    [Text] It was amid much disorder, but the makings of a  historic moment was there, when the EU [Europoean Union]  Committee of the Regions was inaugurated last Wednesday [9  March] and Thursday. The meeting of the 189 representatives of  regional and local government resulted in the appointment of a  president for the institution. Of the four candidates, the  Frenchman Jacques Blanc, president of Langedoc-Roussillon, was  eventually elected. His appointment is the result of lobbying  among his colleagues as well as the outcome of agreements with  other candidates. Luc Van den Brande from Flanders, the main  outsider was felt to be too supportive of the North, but above  all handicapped by the separatist and radical image of a certain  element of Flanders.    Mr. Blanc will remain president for two years. He will then  switch places with Catalan Deputy President Pasquall Maragall.  The secretary general will probably be a German. Pause from  Bavaria is the most likely candidate.    Despite the celebrations, the Committee members did not  forget that they are on probation until 1996, when the Committee  statute may be modified. Some members, like Bavarian President  Edmund Stoiber, intend to turn the Committee into a Third  Legislative Chamber, alongside the Council of Ministers and the  Parliament.    To deserve this promotion, the Committe will have to prove  that it means business. It will be consulted on numerous  matters, such as the European transport and telecommunication  networks, economic and social cohesion, structural funds, etc.  With its first recommendation being sought by 9 April, the  Committee will hold its next session in Brussels on 4-5 April.  Jacques Blanc indicated that it will have to focus on clear  objectives and avoid going in too many directions.</p>

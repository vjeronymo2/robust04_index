			<p>BFN     [Text] Korea has concluded an accord on the terms under  which it will borrow $2.34 billion from France for the  construction of a high-speed railroad linking Seoul and Pusan.  By obtaining concessions from Banque Indosuez, which will  represent syndications to be formed for the loans, the Korean  government will be able to lower finance costs by $170 million,  the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.    In addition to low interest rates, the Ministry said, other  terms such as debt-payment periods are favorable.    The accord on the terms of the proposed French loans to  Korea  was signed by Chong Tok-ku, director-general for economic  cooperation at the Ministry, and M. Tabouis, senior vice  president of Banque Indosuez, yesterday afternoon.    Korea and France are scheduled to sign an agreement on the  French export and commercial loans in August this year after  syndications are formed for the loans.    The annual interest rate on a $1,617 million loan to finance  the French export of TGV supertrains to Korea has been lowered  from the 7.28 percent level to 6.25 percent, the Ministry said.    The cut in the interest rate will save $150 million, the  Ministry said. Added to this is $4.6 million saved from the  reduction of the commitment fee from 0.325 percent of the loan  per annum, which had been demanded by the French bank, to 0.28  percent.    Korea has conceded to the French demand for a 0.4 percent  management fee and a 1.2 percent insurance premium, the Ministry  said.    The debt payment period will be 18 years, including an  eight-year grace period during which the payment of interest  will be deferred, the Ministry said.    The average interest rate on two commercial loans totaling  $720 million, which the Korean Government will use to finance  domestic purchases, will be 0.57 percent on top of the London  Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), down from the 0.75 percent  spread which had been demanded by the French bank.    This concession which Korea has obtained from the French  bank  will save $13 million, the Ministry said.    The Tranche A loan of $411 million, which will be paid back  in 12 years, has a 0.55 percent spread on the LIBOR, down from  the 0.625 spread demanded by the French bank.    The Tranche B loan of $309 million, whose debt-payment  period  is 15 years, has a 0.6 percent spread, down from the French  demand for 0.875 percent.    The commitment and management fees will be 0.3 percent and  0.7 percent per annum, respectively, as was demanded by the  French bank.    "A commercial loan with a 15-year repayment period is  unprecedented in the world financial market," said Chong of the  Ministry. "In addition, the interest rates (of the Tranche A  and B loans) are very low."    To secure concessions from the French Government, Chong  said,  Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong met with the French prime  minister as well as his French counterpart when he visited  France to attend the Asia Development Bank's annual meeting  earlier this month.    Following Hong's talks with the top French officials, he  said, negotiations on loan terms proceeded speedily.    "We expect the favorable terms we have obtained from France  for the export and commercial loans will serve as a benchmark  for Korean financial institutions planning to raise funds in the  international financial market," he said.</p>

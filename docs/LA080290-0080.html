			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMIC INDICATORS SHOW ONGOING SLOWNESS, NO RECESSION  </P> <P> The government's main economic forecasting gauge failed to budge in June, the  Commerce Department said Wednesday in a report that analysts said portended a  listless economy in the months ahead.  </P> <P> The department's index of leading economic indicators, designed to forecast  economic activity six to nine months in advance, was unchanged for the second  month this year. It had risen in March and May and fallen in February and  April.  </P> <P> Many economists had expected a small increase in June. If the index were to  fall for three straight months, it could signal a forthcoming recession.  </P> <P> "This meandering is consistent with what is happening in the economy," said  economist Darryl Delano of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "It all nets out  to basically nothing."  </P> <P> David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage Assn., agreed.  </P> <P> "Basically, what we've seen over this year is small increases, small decreases,  with everything averaging around zero," Berson said. "The economy is going to  continue in its slow-growth path."  </P> <P> But other analysts, such as David Jones, an economist with the New York  securities dealer Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., expressed deeper concern.  </P> <P> "What we have got is an economy that is slowly sinking into possibly a mild  recession by either late this year or early next," Jones said.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration predicted earlier this month that the nation's economy  would grow 2% this year.  </P> <P> But the growth rate as measured by the gross national product was just 1.7% in  the first quarter and 1.2% in the second, meaning the economy would have to  expand at an annual rate of 2.9% during the second half of the year to meet the  Administration's prediction.  </P> <P> Few economists expect that amount of growth.  </P> <P> Indeed, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management released a survey Wednesday  showing that the manufacturing economy slumped in July for the first time in  three months.  </P> <P> And the Commerce Department, in another report Wednesday, said construction  spending in June was flat after falling during the previous two months.  </P> <P> The purchasing managers index fell to 47.7% in July from 51.1% the previous  month, ending three months of increases. A reading below 50 indicates that the  manufacturing economy generally is declining.  </P> <P> The index, a composite of survey results on order levels, prices, inventory and  other areas, had been below 50 for 11 straight months. It averaged 48.8% in the  first seven months of 1990. July's reading was the lowest since 45.2% in  January.  </P> <P> The decline was the sharpest since the index fell about nine percentage points  in early 1984, economists said.  </P> <P> Orders from manufacturers tumbled to 46.2% from 54.9% in June. The rate was the  lowest since January "and will undoubtedly weaken, if not decrease, the recent  modest growth in production," the association said.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department's construction spending report showed that spending on  new construction was unchanged in June at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  $447.5 billion after falling in each of the two preceding months.  </P> <P> Spending had dropped 0.3% in May and 1.9% in April.  </P> <P> Both the building and manufacturing sectors have borne the brunt of high  interest rates as the Federal Reserve attempted to stem inflation by slowing  the economy.  </P> <P> "The June leading indicators report dashes almost all hope that the economy  will pick up steam later this year," said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist with  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "The weak industrial sector will get even weaker by year's end as  manufacturers' new orders fall and growth in unfilled orders wanes," Rahn  added. "It would take only a mild amount of order cancellations to stop growth  in industrial production and turn a weak economy into recession."  </P> <P> Both manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and unfilled orders were  among the negative statistics in the June report. Others were a decline in the  money supply, a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in  orders for new plants and equipment and an increase in weekly unemployment  claims.  </P> <P> The consumer confidence index also was negative in May, leading some analysts  to fear that consumers were retrenching. Consumers account for two-thirds of  the nation's economic activity.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, only four of June's leading indicators were positive: an increase  in the price of raw materials, higher stock prices, an increase in building  permits and slower business delivery times. The length of the average workweek  was unchanged.  </P> <P> The various changes left the index at 146.0% of its 1982 base of 100 and up  1.4% from its level a year ago.  </P></p>

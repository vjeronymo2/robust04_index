			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng] </F>   [Text] Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday  rejected China's request to give a written guarantee that $269  billion would be handed over to the Special Administrative  Region (SAR) government by 1997.    A vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News  Agency), Zhang Junsheng, challenged Sir Hamish's forecast in  Wednesday's Budget that reserves of more than $141 billion and a  Land Fund of $125 billion could be available to the SAR by March  1998.    "If they are able to write it down, then we welcome it and  hope they do what they say. The more reserves the better," Mr.  Zhang said yesterday. "But I do not know whether this is only a  blank cheque."    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang offered a  more mild response when asked about the possibility of such huge  reserves being left by the British. "China hopes that it (the  Budget) will not leave a huge financial burden to Hong Kong  people and the future SAR government," Mr. Shen said.    Xu Yongfu, senior economist at the Hong Kong branch of the  Bank of China, said the surplus could have been bigger had there  been no plans for overspending. "For example, the proportion of  expenditure on social welfare is too big," he said. "What we are  worried about is that Hong Kong, whose success lies very much on  a spirit of diligence, will be turned into a welfare society."    Britain guaranteed under the Memorandum of Understanding  with  China on the vast airport projects that $25 billion would be  passed on. Sir Hamish responded that his "forecast" of the  reserves growing to $269 billion, with the SAR's Land Fund  added, was already in "black and white". "It's there in black  and white at the back of the Budget speech," he said on radio.  However, he rejected the suggestion that any extra written  undertaking should be made.    "I'm quite confident about those forecasts -- but they are  forecasts -- they're based on assumptions," he said. "If things  change radically then of course we change our policies  accordingly, but they're secure, sensible and best-effect type  forecasts."    He said he was confident that his present forecasts could  cope with a normal down-side scenario of the economy. "I can  say I am confident that the reserves are sufficient to cater for  at least one or two years of what you might call normal downside  scenario. We are not looking at horrendous downside scenarios  because they are not likely," Sir Hamish said. "The reserves  partly exist to let you ride out any temporary difficulty for a  year or two, so you can avoid a stop-go policy on expenditure."    He also disagreed that his financial forecast was too  optimistic. "I think it's probably better to say that we've been  a little over-conservative in the past," he said. "We've  revised the forecast upwards, it's true, in the light not just  of last year but of the past three years. "I would say it's  still a fairly conservative forecast.    "It certainly does not assume that land sales, land prices  and stock market turn-over continue at the present very-high  rate."    Sir Hamish said he was cautious in his forecasts for  land-related income such as premiums and property stamp duty as  the Treasury did not anticipate the same level of return in the  1994/95 year as the revised estimates for the current year.    Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said that  the property stamp duties to be collected in the current year  would be $12 billion and the estimate for next year would be  slightly more than $9 billion. Sir Hamish said that in  forecasting land revenue, particularly on projections going  beyond next year, the Government took a fairly cautious view.  "We certainly don't project the existing level [of income] for  we take a more cautious view than that."</p>

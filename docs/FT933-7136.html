			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Securities firms in capital squeeze: The awkward effects of a European directive regulating investment activity EVEN FOR those well-versed in the complex phraseology of European directives, the Capital Adequacy Directive is vexatious. Translated into English it means that most of Britain's securities industry will have to use a new measure of financial strength. Until now the investment industry has had to meet capital requirements set out by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog. SIB officials are careful to point out that for a large number of firms the cumulative capital requirement will not change. Capital may simply be allocated differently among various business activities. For a significant minority, however, changes will be needed. A key difference will be that for the first time firms which do not handle client money or trade on their own account will need to meet an initial capital requirement of Ecu50,000 (Pounds 38,000). Those which do handle client money will need Ecu125,000 and those which deal on their own account and underwrite issues will need Ecu730,000. Under current UK rules there is no initial capital requirement. All capital requirements are related strictly to the degree of risk involved in specified activities. The rules require firms to hold enough capital to cover fixed overheads for various periods and to hold capital against trading positions, the amount dependent on the amount of risk. The directive requires all firms to have enough capital to cover fixed overheads for 13 weeks. While this is already required of larger UK stock-broking and money management firms, smaller fund managers and investment advisers of other types need capital to cover only four to six weeks of fixed costs. The so-called position risk requirements, which will mostly affect securities firms that are members of the Securities and Futures Authority, are in some respects less stringent than those already in place. An SFA official said: 'We are concerned that some firms might actually end up with lighter capital requirements than they now have.' Some firms will face tougher position limits than at present, however. Current rules apply very low requirements for securities firms that trade equities for their own book and meet strict portfolio diversification requirements. The directive makes no adjustments for the extent to which diversification reduces risk and some securities firms, in particular the larger ones, may have to hold more capital against their portfolios. Even among firms with no interest in operating abroad, hundreds may find that they need to raise additional capital or alter their business mix. An SIB official said: 'A lot of firms will think, 'Well, I'm not going to use the European passport so this won't affect me'.' But the regional stockbroker in Maidstone is as much subject to the new rules as SG Warburg, a fact which has not yet fully penetrated the industry, regulators say. Regulators point to a number of mitigating factors. First, the directive applies only to investment business as defined by another piece of Brussels legislation, the Investment Services Directive. That excludes firms which only give advice. Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers and intermediaries, estimates this is the case for more than 80 per cent of its members. There is another escape, under which firms that do not have enough initial capital will still be allowed to operate. However, all firms will have to meet the other expenditure and position risk require-ments. Firms which take advantage of this arrangement will be required to calculate their current capital and monitor it until the directive takes effect on December 31 1995. Subsequently they will have to ensure that their capital never falls below the highest point reached during this reference period.</p>

The visit was to begin on Sunday.    At the beginning of the week, when staying in Warsaw, the  chairman of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)  announced plans to make a two-day visit to the Czech Republic.  However, the party leader "probably made a mistake", an LDPR  spokesman told CTK. As it turns out, it is necessary for  Zhirinovsky to address intra- party affairs, which will require  his presence in Moscow on Sunday and Monday.    A decision to postpone the visit was taken after LDPR  representatives' consultations with the staff of the Czech  Embassy in Moscow.    Earlier Prague had made it clear that it considers  Zhirinovsky's planned visit as highly undesirable. In  particular, Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml stated an intention  to make every possible step to prevent the LDPR leader from  visiting the country.</p>

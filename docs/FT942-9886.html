			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Property: The reluctant house-hunter - ICI's search for new headquarters Few London buildings exude as much corporate self-confidence as the neo-classical monolith of Imperial Chemical House at Number Nine Millbank, headquarters, since 1926, of one of Britain's biggest industrial companies. The pomp of the stone and granite exterior is matched by the grandeur of its ultra-modern interior. A Pounds 30m refurbishment in 1988 replaced the original oak-panelled corridors and rabbit-warren of offices with a set of wall-to-floor glass offices arranged around a transparent atrium. A sense of corporate identity is stamped on the building by a huge atrium carpet made from ICI-produced fibres and the vibrant, modern oil paintings, commissioned for ICI, which line the walls. Given the strong sense of identity associated with the building, it is poignant that ICI has now decided to move to smaller and cheaper premises. ICI's headquarters staff numbered 2,000 two decades ago. Now, following decentralisation, retrenchment and the demerger of Zeneca, ICI's bioscience offshoot which has moved to new premises, there are only 240 people based at Millbank. By the end of 1995, the figure will have been reduced to 150. ICI's decision to rethink its occupancy of the Millbank site is being mirrored by similar cost-cutting decisions on property at its subsidiaries throughout the UK. Since ICI has set itself targets on return on capital of at least 20 per cent, it needs to make its assets work. In addition, restructuring, job cuts and disposals of non-core and under-performing businesses have added to the backlog of property problems to be solved. The job of overhauling ICI's portfolio of 400 properties and 30,000 acres of land has fallen to Mr Andrew Sturt, a former developer who became a consultant to ICI in October 1991, following Mr Ronnie Hampel's appointment as chief executive. Mr Hampel's decision to appoint a property consultant reflects the view at ICI that there was an insufficient awareness of the importance of property. Mr Hampel believes property should be viewed as an asset, rather than as a resource. For the past decade ICI has operated without a group property manager and decisions relating to property have inevitably been handled on an ad hoc basis. 'There was a lack of a property dimension in decision-making,' says Mr Sturt. Such an approach had it drawbacks, principally a lack of flexibility. ICI would build premises in locations which appeared to be cheap. However, the premises were often unsuitable for occupation by another tenant, which made them difficult to dispose of once ICI had ceased to require them. 'It is a burden that was totally unnecessary,' says Mr Sturt. Recession, the decline of manufacturing industry and, in some cases, the contamination of land has exacerbated the problems of disposing of property in difficult locations. In Harrogate, for example, ICI owns a large expanse of vacant offices, laboratories and 70 acres of land on a site that was formerly the headquarters of ICI Fibres. The difficulty in cases such as these is in obtaining planning permission for a change of use for the site. The scale of recent job losses in Harrogate has made the local authority reluctant to allow a change of use for land that was previously used for employment generating purposes. Sometimes, circumstances change with time and a problematic property can become valuable. Near Bristol, for instance, ICI owns 1,500 acres of surplus land on a site acquired in 1957 to accommodate a petrochemicals plant. The plant occupies 370 acres, while the remainder of the land, which was originally earmarked for the expansion of the plant, has so far been unused. But the construction nearby of the second Severn Crossing and the addition of an intersection to the M49 motorway could make the site valuable. ICI will seek planning permission later this month to build 2 1/4 m square feet of warehouses on a third of the site. It intends to seek institutional partners to build the warehouses, which will be up to 300,000 sq ft in size. In other cases, it is hard to imagine anything that could add value to a site. In Dumfries, Scotland, ICI owns a 100,000 sq ft office building, built in the 1960s. Only a handful of people occupy the building and ICI has little chance of finding new tenants given the poor local demand for offices. In the case of the Dumfries building, the decision to locate a business in an out-of-the-way spot dates back to a decision taken during the second world war to find a manufacturing location beyond the reach of German bombers. But many of ICI's surplus premises stem from more recent decisions. In Welwyn, for instance, ICI is trying to dispose of a four-year old, 120,000 sq ft building that was built to house the headquarters of its films division. Following restructuring and relocation, only a handful of people now occupy the building. 'As soon as the headquarters was completed, the rationale for it had gone,' says Mr Sturt. A similar situation, on a larger scale, has arisen with ICI's group headquarters at Millbank. The building has several unused floors as a result of ICI's restructuring and, in particular, the demerger of Zeneca. However, sub-letting space at Millbank is not a viable solution. The building's design offers insufficient privacy if shared by two companies. company. Instead of sub-letting the surplus space, ICI plans to find itself new premises, obtain a new tenant for the existing premises and then sell its Millbank building, together with two adjacent buildings it owns that are let to the government. Finding new premises is proving difficult, given ICI's intention to remain close to the City and Westminster, its need for car parking spaces and its insistence on easy access for visitors. Mr Sturt has been unimpressed with the 100 buildings he seen so far. 'What is in the market at the moment is disappointing,' he says. The problem of property disposal highlights the question of whether corporate buildings should be owned or leased. The case for owning production plant is strong, for example, because of the necessity to invest large amounts of capital in specialist equipment. For other types of property, such as offices, however, there is a strong case for renting, rather than owning property. 'With the pressure on the businesses to achieve a 20-30 per cent return on capital, it is crazy to be investing in a low-yielding property asset. It is putting a millstone around the neck of businesses,' says Mr Sturt. 'Planning for business is relatively short term compared with even a decade ago,' he argues. 'There is no point in investing in premises for ever.'</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PETE ROSE DECISION;  </P> <P> OTHER VIEWS;  </P> <P> NATION'S PRESS SHOWS LITTLE EMPATHY FOR ROSE;  </P> <P> (THE REACTION TO THE LIFETIME SUSPENSION OF PETE ROSE IS STRONG. HERE IS HOW  SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP SPORTS COLUMNISTS SAW THE DECISION.)  </P> <P> Pete Rose is banned for life from baseball for gambling, and everyone except  Pete Rose knows it.  </P> <P> In the psychiatric world, a piece of real estate in which Rose might do well to  invest what wealth he has remaining, they call this a form of behavior denial.  Rose is to denial what he used to be to hitting. It's what he does best, and  it's all he has left. For Rose, this is a different kind of hustle -- and the  bluest note yet played in this hauntingly sad story.  </P> <P> This man who came to represent baseball to a generation is an exile, apparently  forever, with only the slightest chance for reprieve.  </P> <P> He is exiled -- this makes it worse -- at his own hand, having pulled his world  down on top of him.  </P> <P> And yet, Rose won't admit it. For all we know, he may not even believe it.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Glasgow's health board chief resigns after row Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr Bill Fyfe, chairman of Greater Glasgow Health Board, Britain's largest health authority, James Buxton writes. Mr Fyfe's position became increasingly difficult following a board decision which he instigated to dismiss Mr Laurence Peterken, the board's general manager. Shortly after Mr Peterken was dismissed he was appointed to the newly created post of director of special projects by Mr Gerald Scaife, the chief executive of the National Health Service in Scotland. Mr Scaife then investigated circumstances of Mr Peterken's dismissal while MPs put down questions to ministers in parliament. Mr Fyfe appeared to be losing the support of Scottish Office ministers. Yesterday five members of the Greater Glasgow Health Board issued a statement saying: 'In the light of information now available we believe the correct procedure was not followed in the dismissal of Laurence Peterken. 'We have no confidence in the chairman and we call on him to resign forthwith.' Mr Fyfe took over the chairmanship of the health board earlier this year. He had previously won ministerial approval as chairman of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board, where he stood up to trade unions, made savings and encouraged the formation of one of the first trust hospitals in Scotland.</p>

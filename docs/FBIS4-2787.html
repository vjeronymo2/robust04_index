			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The DEHONG UNITY NEWS  is read by five minority peoples who speak five different  languages.    It is China's only journal that caters to such a diverse  readership.    Founded on January 1, 1955, the quarto-format newspaper is  run by the Dai and Jingpo nationalities autonomous prefecture in  Dehong, southwest China's Yunnan Province.    The area is inhabited by 930,000 residents, of which 51  percent are minorities of Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Deang and Achang  nationalities.    When the four-page union news was launched, it was published  in Chinese, Dai, Jingpo and Lisu, with each language taking up  one page.    The page in the Dai tongue, however, had to be handwritten  because there was no print matrix for the language. Not until  1956, when the first governor of the prefecture made the steel  matrix for the Dai language, did the newspaper begin to publish  the four language versions separately.    In 1989, this unique newspaper added one more version in  Zaiwa, a branch of the Jingpo language.    Being the only newspaper to cater to such a diverse  readership in China, the unity news has a circulation of around  10,000.    "This is a small number. It plays its role, though," said Li  Xiangqian, editor-in-chief.    He said that the paper symbolizes the unity of these  minorities.    The paper devotes most space to local news. It also carries  short articles and pictures as well as international news from  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY.    The newspaper has been used as a "textbook" by local primary  schools and night schools.    For nearly four decades, the paper has also served as a  cradle for the growth of minority writers and singers.    The publication caused quite a stir when its Dai and Jingpo  versions made their way to neighboring Myanmar [Burma]. Some  students of Zaiwa (the name of Jingpos living abroad) from  Rangoon University even made trips to buy the paper.    Now published three times a week in Chinese, twice a week in  Dai and Jingpo and weekly in Lisu and Zaiwa, the newspaper has  drawn attention from scholars in the United States, Japan and  other countries, who have written to the editors requesting  copies of the newspapers for their research.</p>

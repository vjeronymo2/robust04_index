			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Rise in German demand boosts new car sales NEW car sales in west Europe rose by an estimated 4.7 per cent in September, the strongest monthly year-on-year increase this year, thanks to a rise in demand in Germany and smaller European markets. According to industry estimates, new car sales in west Europe last month rose to 942,000, from 899,000 in the same month a year ago. The rise in demand in September, which followed a 3 per cent increase year-on-year in August, has begun to compensate for the weakness in sales earlier this year. However, new car sales of 10.5m in the first nine months of the year were still 1.5 per cent below the 10.7m achieved in the same period a year ago. Last month's improvement was widely spread, with higher sales in 11 of 17 markets across Europe. Significantly, new car sales in Germany rose last month by an estimated 18.5 per cent to 277,000 from the low level of last year, when demand dropped sharply. In the first nine months of the year, new car sales in Germany were an estimated 9.3 per cent lower than a year ago. European car makers expected demand in Germany to fall more sharply this year after the record sales of 1991, when unification boosted sales to a record 4.2m from only 3.3m a year earlier. In September, new car sales in France rose by 3.8 per cent to 147,400 but demand remained weak in the UK, with a 4 per cent fall from an already very depressed level. Sales in Italy, previously one of the strongest markets in Europe, also declined by 3.7 per cent year-on-year. Most of the smaller European markets performed more strongly in September and lower sales were recorded only in Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg in addition to Italy and the UK. Among the big six volume car makers, the Volkswagen group of Germany and Renault of France posted the strongest growth in west Europe this year. The state-owned French car maker increased its sales volume by an estimated 5 per cent in the first nine months. The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has built a record lead in west Europe this year, helped by the waning challenge from the Fiat group of Italy. Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, has slipped from second to fourth place in the first nine months behind General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall and Saab) and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen. Fiat has suffered a 7.4 per cent drop in its sales volume, which has depressed its west European market share to only 12 per cent in the first nine months from 12.8 per cent a year ago. Ford is the other big loser in west Europe this year. A 6 per cent drop in sales volume has forced it to impose short-time working at many European car assembly plants. The share of Japanese car makers in west Europe has also declined this year, with sales falling by 7.6 per cent in the first 9 months. This has depressed their market share to 11.9 per cent from 12.7 per cent a year ago. Among the executive and luxury car makers, Mercedes-Benz has continued to lose ground to BMW and Audi, its arch rivals. Mercedes-Benz, which is due to replace its smallest 190 series early next year, has suffered an estimated 11.2 per cent drop in sales volume this year and has slipped behind both BMW and Audi in market share. BMW has increased its sales by 9.4 per cent, helped by the success of its 3-series, while Audi has increased its sales by around 8.5 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                       January-September 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Volume   Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                              (Units) Change (%) Jan-Sept 92 Jan-Sept 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET             10,501,000    -1.5        100.0      100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.        1,825,000    +4.8         17.4       16.3 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors            1,294,000    -1.2         12.3       12.3 (Opel/Vauxhall, US**** &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall           1,238,000    -0.8         11.8       11.7  -Saab**                     40,000    +0.2          0.4        0.4 Peugeot (incl.            1,265,000    +2.3         12.0       11.6 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

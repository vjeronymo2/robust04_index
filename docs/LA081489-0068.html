			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gasoline Prices Drop: The average price of gasoline fell nearly 3 cents a  gallon at the pump in the past three weeks, a nationwide survey found. The  national average is $1.13 a gallon, 2.7 cents below the average on July 21, the  Lundberg Survey reported. "A drop of this magnitude during such a short period  is something that motorists have not seen since 1986," analyst Trilby Lundberg  said. She said the price fall was caused by an oversupply brought on by  overcompensation on the part of refiners and importers in response to "tight  refining capacity and even tighter capacity for gasoline because of new vapor  regulations." Federal vapor regulations have forced refiners to refrain from  using butane for such properties as octane, she said. Production of inventory  safety margins led to oversupply.  </P></p>

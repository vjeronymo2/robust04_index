Vogel in Tunis on 8 March: "I Will  Plant Roses in My Garden"]    [Text] It is one o'clock in the morning in Tunis. Yasir  'Arafat -- in uniform, handgun in a green holster -- sits behind  his desk under a picture of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem  and signs documents. "Yesterday I started this felt-tip pen,"  he says. "Today it is already used up."    [DER STANDARD] What about your gun? Have you had to use it?    ['Arafat] I have had to use it often. In 1973, the Israelis  attacked me in Beirut and, at the same time, my three brothers  in Jordan. Only my bodyguards were there -- six of them, then I  myself, and my secretary. We opened fire, all of us, until we  escaped. I tell you just one of the many incidents.    [DER STANDARD] Therefore, they call you the great survivor?    ['Arafat] I have a strong belief in God. In Islam we say:  The moment has not yet come. And when it comes, no one will be  able to stop it. This is predestination. But who understands  why God has made my problems even greater now?    [DER STANDARD] Would you sometimes prefer to be somebody  else than the president of Palestine?    ['Arafat] No, this is my destiny, and I have accepted it. I  was a successful engineer and entrepreneur, but then I joined  the revolution and left everything behind. I do not regret it.    [DER STANDARD] Where do you get your energy from?    ['Arafat] For me, work is the best way to relax. I am a  workaholic. I cannot remember having had one day of vacation  ever since I joined the revolution.    [DER STANDARD] You never take a break?    ['Arafat] Sometimes I would like to watch cartoons. But I  do not have time, I just watch the news on television.    [DER STANDARD] Since the massacre on 25 February in Hebron  things have been terrible, but we assume that everything works  according to plan between Israel and the PLO: What is your  vision of the future state of Palestine?    ['Arafat] I have called it the "peace of the brave." This  means: Completely new relations with one's enemies. We want  the same peace as that between Egypt and Israel.    [DER STANDARD] Would the Palestinian state be a democracy  like Austria?    ['Arafat] We Palestinians are proud of our democracy; we  call it a democracy in the jungle of the guns. But it is one of  the most important models of a democracy in this region.    [DER STANDARD] Democracy harbors a risk: The people could  elect somebody else. Would you be willing to retire?    ['Arafat] I would love to.    [DER STANDARD] What would you do then?    ['Arafat] I am an engineer and I like my job.    [DER STANDARD] Could you imagine leading a normal, civilian  life, having a house in Jericho, a garden....    ['Arafat] Why in Jericho?    [DER STANDARD] ...or Jerusalem, Nablus, Gaza?    ['Arafat] Why not?    [DER STANDARD] You would plant roses in your garden?    ['Arafat] Sooner or later I will have something like that.    [DER STANDARD] Are you looking forward to that?    ['Arafat] Yes. I have a right to that. This is a  democracy, and we will accept what is decided in the democracy.  However, I am not alone; I am also the chairman of the Fatah  Movement.    [DER STANDARD] And now you are also a married man.    ['Arafat] That has not changed anything about my situation.  Otherwise, I would not be here for this interview.    [DER STANDARD] Are we now (it is almost two o'clock in the  morning) keeping you away from your wife?    ['Arafat] No, I still have another two hours of work.    [DER STANDARD] The idyllic times in Gaza with roses in the  garden have not come yet. We can imagine that Fatah people from  Hebron call you and say: "Abu 'Ammar, our people are outraged;  they want to avenge themselves for what happened in the mosque."  What is your advice to them?    ['Arafat] After the massacre, the people are extremely  angry. This could not have happened with the participation of  the (Israeli) Army. And today (Tuesday) the Israeli  investigation committee noted that the Army shares  responsibility because the guards came too late. What does that  mean: The guards came too late? Where were those who were on  duty before? This means that some units, generals, or officers  of the Army conspired with the armed settlers. And since we are  talking of the massacre of Hebron: Since then we have had  another massacre; 37 people were killed, more than 400 injured,  and more than 2,000 arrested.    [DER STANDARD] Is it not surprising that the Palestinians  have not yet decided to resume their armed struggle?    ['Arafat] They have been patient so far, but that has  limits.    [DER STANDARD] Can you imagine a situation in which you say:  We must interrupt the peace process?    ['Arafat] I have never deceived my people. If we reach a  dead end, I will tell my people.    [DER STANDARD] But a dead end does not mean an interruption  of the peace process?    ['Arafat] Who knows, it takes two to tango.    [DER STANDARD] Sometimes tragic events can have positive  effects, such as the grenade attack on the market in Sarajevo.  Do you think something like that is possible in connection with  the massacre in Hebron?    ['Arafat] After Sarajevo, the Americans seized the  initiative. But here they are not doing anything. Quite the  opposite, they are even preventing the UN Security Council from  adopting a resolution. The other members of the Council would be  for it.    [DER STANDARD] At the end of September, the first pictures  of your potential future residence in Jericho turned up....    ['Arafat] Do you know how many houses I have been given?  Fifty-eight. I expressed thanks for them and said: I need only  one -- perhaps.    [DER STANDARD] Have you chosen one?    ['Arafat] No, no.    [DER STANDARD] When will you need a house in Jericho?    ['Arafat] After what has happened, it is very difficult to  give a date.    [DER STANDARD] Has the peace process not reached a point  where both Rabin and you would suffer political damage if it  collapsed?    ['Arafat] Yes, but the Israelis are the occupation power.  It is important that the Israelis realize that they cannot  survive or coexist with force. Where is the Soviet Union today,  formerly the biggest nuclear power in the world?    [DER STANDARD] Does not Rabin's fate depend on yours and  yours on that of Rabin?    ['Arafat] No, my fate depends on God.    [DER STANDARD] And Rabin's fate?    ['Arafat] On God and on my people.</p>

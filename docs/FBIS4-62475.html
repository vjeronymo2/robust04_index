			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Svetlana Shipunova report: "Kuban Without Power"] </F>   [Text] Krasnodar -- The Kuban is one of the few regions in  Russia where the new representative power has still not been  elected. The election date has been set three times and has  been postponed three times -- the last time until 20 November  1994. The majority of the kray's political forces have come out  sharply against this, including the "Otechestvo" patriotic  movement with the biggest mass appeal here, the All-Kuban  Cossack Host, and the kray organization of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia. Moreover, "Otechestvo's"  Coordinating Council has even brought a court action against  Kray Administration Head N. Yegorov for violating citizens'  constitutional electoral rights.    This situation has now been exacerbated by a new  development.  It was learned right after the May holidays that Nikolay Yegorov  had been appointed a Russian Federation minister (it has not yet  been divulged what his functions will be in the government).  According to unofficial data, V. Gladskoy, first deputy head of  the kray administration, has categorically refused to take up  this post and is still merely acting governor.    Thus, the Kuban is at present without both legislative power  and executive power in the person of a legitimate administration  head. Yu. Skokov, previously the leader of a major Krasnodar  Kray enterprise; V. Samoylenko, the present mayor of the city of  Krasnodar; and some others are being named here among the  possible candidates for this post.    It is not, however, a question of which of them the  president  will choose and whom he will appoint in his edict, already for  the third time, to rule the Kuban. Public opinion is  unequivocally inclined to hold an election of the administration  head. The Kuban deputies in the State Duma have sent a letter  to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin demanding the holding of  simultaneous elections of the kray administration head, the kray  legislative assembly, and the organs of local self-management no  later than September (in other words right after the end of the  cereal grain harvest). Today the same demand is being advanced  by the Cossacks and a number of the kray's political and public  organizations. As for the population, it advocated elections in  a referendum as long ago as 25 April last year.    If the country's leaders do not heed public opinion this  time  either, the political situation in the kray might be sharply  exacerbated by the beginning of summer.</p>

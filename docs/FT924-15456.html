			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Income replacement policy launch Standard Life is to join forces with US-based disability insurer UNUM to launch a permanent health insurance policy, planned for November 16. The new policy will pay out 75 per cent of salary, minus state benefits, after claimants have been off work for either 13 or 26 weeks, depending on the deferral period selected at outset. The definition of disability will relate to the claimant's 'own' occupation - many other plans on the market require the claimant to be rendered incapable of pursuing any occupation before they will pay out. Standard Life will also introduce non-smoker rates on its term assurance.</p>

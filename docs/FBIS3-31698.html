			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hajrudin Sermic report from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] Horrendous attacks of the chetnik-ustasha forces  along the entire separating line on the Maglaj front are  intensifying by the hour. The chetniks and ustashas are  receiving reinforcements from Zepce, Doboj, Prnjavor, and Mt.  Ozren. This are definitely the most powerful attacks so far  with only one goal -- to conquer Maglaj.    The fighters of the 201st [Hill] Brigade have halted their  further advances toward the town. An appeal by the Maglaj War  Presidency and the Command of the 201st Hill Brigade of the  Bosnia- Herzegovina Army to the residents that they immediately  and urgently place themselves on the rim of the town and prevent  the enemy from capturing Maglaj has borne fruit. Volunteers,  representatives of the civilian authorities, more than 50  mothers, and even wounded soldiers are reporting to participate  in the crucial battle for Maglaj. They could not be prevented  in this even by the hundreds of artillery shells fired at the  town and several dozens of civilian casualties. The Maglaj is  being defended heroically from the heart for who knows how long.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO HUNT FOR SOURCE OF ALGAE IN NEWPORT BAY  </P> <P> State and county officials will survey areas fronting a creek leading to  Newport Bay this summer to track down the sources of nutrients that are choking  the waters with algae.  </P> <P> Joanne Schneider, the environmental program manager for the California Regional  Water Quality Control Board, said at a press conference Friday that officials  will try to determine where nutrients, such as those found in fertilizers, are  flowing into San Diego Creek. In the past few years, they have identified some  nurseries and agricultural areas along the creek but have concluded that they  are only part of the problem.  </P> <P> "The next step is: What are those other sources?" Schneider said. "It's kind of  like a piece of detective work."  </P> <P> They speculate that such runoff also might come from parks, lawns and  construction projects. Another source might be nutrient-laden ground water,  which can rise to the surface near the creek.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Due in September  </P> <P> In 1987, the state Legislature, acting on legislation introduced by state Sen.  Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), called for the water board to survey water  quality in Newport Bay. A report is due Sept. 1.  </P> <P> Bergeson and other residents had been concerned that work on the report had not  been moving fast enough. After the press conference, Bergeson said: "I think  it's evident the survey is going forward. I feel very positive."  </P> <P> Later, Bergeson added: "I've been disappointed that (the survey) hasn't been  moving at a more rapid rate, but I understand it's very complex. I just don't  want to lose momentum."  </P> <P> San Diego Creek flows into Upper Newport Bay, where the algae buildup is  thought to be the worst. Bergeson and other residents who live near the upper  bay have been alarmed by recent algae growth.  </P> <P> "There has been more algae built up in the last few months than I have ever  seen," Bergeson said.  </P> <P> Bill Hamilton, owner of the Cannery Restaurant on the Rhine channel near Lower  Newport Bay, said that he continues to observe the ugly buildup.  </P> <P> "There are places in Newport Harbor where it looks like indoor/outdoor  carpeting," he said. "It looks terrible."  </P> <P> In addition to its slimy appearance, algae can kill fish and other marine life  by soaking up the oxygen in water. High amounts of nutrients -- especially  nitrates, phosphates and trace metals -- can produce algae in massive  proportions.  </P> <P> The state Department of Fish and Game has said that it appears existing levels  of nutrients have yet to excessively deplete the oxygen supply to marine life  in Upper Newport Bay. But it is not known how much the area can take before the  situation becomes excessive.  </P> <P> The Orange County Environmental Management Agency did a study of the area that  showed a decline over time in the amount of the organic nitrogen nutrients in  the bay. They have not determined whether this means the problem is getting  better or worse.  </P> <P> But Bob Collacott, manager of the environmental resources division at the  agency, said that the amount of nutrients flowing into Newport Bay is still  much greater than any other place in Southern California.  </P> <P> "You will not see this anywhere else," he said.  </P> <P> In its statement, the water board advised that no action be taken until the  state and county organizations have completed their study.  </P> <P> "At this point, I don't think any legislation is needed," Schneider said. "It's  just a question of having to know what to control and if we can control it."  </P> <P> But steps have been taken at some nurseries to stem the runoff of water and  fertilizers into San Diego Creek.  </P> <P> Hines Wholesale Nurseries in Irvine has installed 117 acres of drip irrigation,  which helps prevent the overflow of excess water from plants. By September, it  plans to start a recycling system in which runoff will be collected, the  nutrients removed and the water reused. The system is expected to cost more  than $1 million, said Bud Summers, the nursery's technical resource manager.  </P> <P> Since 1983, the water board also has had erosion-control measures for  agricultural areas along the creek. Deposits of silt caused by erosion have  been found to carry nutrients that flow into the bay.  </P></p>

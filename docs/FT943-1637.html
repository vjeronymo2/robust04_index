			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Group to campaign against antibiotic A group has been set up to campaign on behalf of people who claim to have suffered side-effects from taking Septrin, one of the world's top-selling antibiotics. The Septrin Action Group, formed after a weekend meeting in Birmingham, is planning claims for personal damages and to campaign for the drug's withdrawal. Septrin is used against bronchitis and urinary-tract infections and has an HIV-related application. The group claims the drug has been linked to 134 deaths and a range of side-effects since its introduction in 1968. It says Septrin causes reactions to sunlight, skin rashes, damage to blood cells and potentially fatal damage to the kidneys and other organs. The group points out that Septrin combines two active agents, one made by Wellcome and one by Hoffman La Roche, and that the side-effects are mainly linked to the latter. The Department of Health said yesterday: 'The committee of safety of medicines has received 134 reports of suspected adverse reactions with a fatal outcome associated with co-trimoxazole (Septrin's scientific name).' It said, however, that more than 80m prescriptions had been dispensed in the UK and 'a report of an adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible'.</p>

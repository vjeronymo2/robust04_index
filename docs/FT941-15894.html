			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Ciampi seeks to run caretaker cabinet Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday sought a strong mandate from parliament to run a caretaker administration in the run-up to early elections. The former governor of the Bank of Italy made the plea to avoid a destabilising power vacuum in a speech opening the debate on the no-confidence motion presented before Christmas by Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had been expected to announce a date for elections in his address at the end of last year, but he delayed doing so in order to allow parliament to give its verdict on the Ciampi government. A hard core of Christian Democrats, the main backers of the Ciampi government, has backed the no-confidence motion in an effort to prolong the life of the present parliament. The debate was suspended last night and will resume today. Although the outcome remained uncertain, it seemed unlikely that the Christian Democrats would succeed in prolonging parliament until European parliamentary elections in June. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, announced he would be withdrawing his party's deputies and senators from the legislature. The League's withdrawal underlined the fact that the current legislature, elected in April 1992, had reached the end of its natural life, according to Mr Bossi. This, coupled with the hostility of the former Communist party, the Democratic Left (PDS), to prolonging the present parliament, will put strong pressure on President Scalfaro to call elections for early April at the latest. Mr Ciampi avoided announcing his resignation, but he made it clear he had completed the limited objectives of his original mandate when he agreed to be prime minister in April last year. In a carefully worded speech, Mr Ciampi appeared anxious to ensure the no-confidence motion was defeated, while at the same time making sure that all his options were kept open. His supporters said it was important to defeat the no-confidence motion as this would give him more authority to run a caretaker government. Mr Ciampi himself made frequent reference in his speech to the need to maintain Italy's international credibility. While saying his government had no power to influence parliament on early elections, he nevertheless warned the politicians of the dangers of creating a political vacuum. The purpose of those wishing to prolong the present parliament is two-fold: to allow time for a hopelessly divided Christian Democrat party to reform and to exploit as long as possible parliamentary privileges that help protect deputies from prosecution for corruption. One in six members risks prosecution on corruption charges. However, the four-party coalition has never had a majority larger than 16 votes and it looked unlikely last night all would back the Panella no-confidence motion. As an alternative, some Christian Democrats talked of presenting a counter-vote in the form of a confidence motion. Mr Ciampi may today go to President Scalfaro and discuss whether or not to resign. There would then follow up to two days of talks between President Scalfaro and political leaders prior to an announcement on how long the present parliamentary session would last.</p>

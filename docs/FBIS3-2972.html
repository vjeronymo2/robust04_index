According to the draft  agreement, a prime site in Queensway, the twin-tower Queens  Lines, will be handed over to Chinese troops in 1997 with the  British side offering the PLA the right to redevelop the  three-hectare site. But to ensure that the military estate  close to the Conrad Hotel and Island Shangri-La Hotel, will not  be redeveloped for commercial or other uses, British negotiators  are understood to have attached a stringent condition that any  redevelopment be confined to military use. The draft accord  also makes it clear that instead of Hong Kong taxpayers bearing  the cost for any redevelopment project, the PLA would foot the  bill.    Based on the results of four days of tough negotiations late  last month, the draft accord detailing the plan and other  arrangements is now being considered by the PLA for final  confirmation. Sino-British defence experts are understood to  have planned to meet again towards the end of this month, hoping  to put the finishing touches to the draft deal. Should the PLA  raise no objection to the draft accord, it is expected that the  two sides will put the deal to the next Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) plenum for formal approval. Sources said  the two sides were discussing the date for the next plenary  session, expected to be held next month at the earliest.    Queens Lines is understood to have been one of the three key  sticking points during the long-running defence talks at the  JLG. The other stumbling blocks were the relocation of the HMS  Tamar naval base to Stonecutters Island, and Britain's demand  for China to make a declaration that it would return any unused  military facilities to the Special Administrative Region  government for development. Comprising two towers and housing  more than 40 families of the British barracks, Queens Lines is  currently the married quarters for senior British military  officers. Property experts have put the value of the site at  more than $6 billion at 1993 prices, given the lack of prime  sites in the Central business district. Noting the value of the  site, British negotiators are understood to have tried to  persuade the Chinese side to release Queens Lines for  redevelopment for either commercial or residential use but the  Chinese side insisted on retaining at least part of the areas.    One of the options considered by the two sides during the  negotiations was for the British side to redevelop the site at a  cost of about $400 million. Anticipating the difficulty in  seeking the Legislative Council Finance Committee's approval for  funds, the British side is understood to have cast doubts on the  option, which was eventually dropped.    During the negotiations, the Chinese side indicated it  wanted  to keep Queens Lines for use as married quarters for PLA  officers.</p>

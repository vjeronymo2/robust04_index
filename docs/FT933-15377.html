			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Major's slimline tonic loses sparkle MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, made limited headway in his attempt to cut the annual G7 summits down to size. British officials yesterday admitted that Mr Major's proposal to limit future summits to heads of government had not won sufficient support. The US, Canada and Italy backed the plan but it was strongly resisted by France and Germany. Both countries have coalition governments and the inclusion of finance and foreign ministers in the talks enables the different parties in government to be represented. The UK prime minister had more success with his plans to strip the summits of the pomp and bureaucracy that has grown over the years. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said he expected next year's summit in Italy would have 'fewer people, less formality. . . more free-flowing discussion and a little less structure.' According to a senior Canadian official, Mrs Kim Campbell, the Canadian prime minister and another summit novice, was 'in favour of anything' which could make summits more informal. 'People were very firm that we have got to cut down the ceremonial and the 36,000 cops out there,' the Canadian official said. UK officials said future summits would end with either a press briefing or chairman's statement rather than a long-winded communique. The role of the sherpas, the officials who prepare the summits, would be radically cut to reflect the reduced workload of a meeting without a final prepared statement. A UK plan to limit the summits to two days gained partial acceptance. In future, talks among the seven will be limited to two days, but additional talks such as today's 'G7 plus one' meeting with President Yeltsin will run into a third day.</p>

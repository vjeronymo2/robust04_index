			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Recovery ends as investors reduce their risk The fragile recovery in European government bond markets ended yesterday, with 10-year bonds shedding about a point in most markets. 'Although markets had consolidated over the last few days, investors are still very nervous and are using the strength to off-load (long) positions while speculative funds are re-establishing short positions,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International. 'There's a much greater awareness of risk in the market,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'Many long-term investors have had their belief in the bull market story shattered and prefer to reduce their risk on any uptick,' he added. Market participants are keenly awaiting the Bundesbank's allocation of variable-rate securities repurchase agreements today. Most traders expect a small drop in the minimum repo rate to around 5.90 - 5.92 per cent from last week's 5.97 per cent. In the event of a small reduction, 'we could see a brief rally, but people would probably look to sell at that level rather than buy,' said Mr Kokko. Weaker US Treasuries and rumours of near-term monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve also put pressure on European bonds. German bunds set the pace, with most activity centred in the futures pits, where trading was very technical. The June future broke several key support levels on its way down. 'Each time we approached a support level, the contract went through it like a hot knife through butter,' said a German dealer. The contract hit a low of 96.40 and stood at 96.60 in late London trade, down 0.83 points on the day. Bunds dramatically underperformed their Dutch counterparts, which have seen less foreign selling in recent weeks. 'Foreign holdings in the German market were massive, while at the long end of the Dutch curve, domestic holdings have outweighed,' said Mr Torsten Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS. 'Dutch domestics are holding on to their paper, while German domestics can't absorb all the paper sold by the internationals.' The Dutch 10-year benchmark yielded some 10 basis points below its German counterpart yesterday, after being only 2 basis points below two trading days earlier. The release of stronger than expected industrial output data got the UK gilt market off to a bad start and prices slid further in the afternoon on the back of weaker bunds. The June long gilt futures contract on Liffe fell by about 1 3/32 points from Monday's close to 112 9/16 . French bonds also slid, fuelled by domestic selling. All eyes are on the Bundesbank's repo, which is seen to set the pace for much-needed rate cuts in France. On the Matif, the March bond futures contract ended at 126.22, down 0.46 from Monday. Japanese government bonds rose on late short-covering in Tokyo and continued to post small gains in London trading. However, sentiment remains subdued by trade tensions between Japan and the US as well as supply concerns. After firming at the opening, US Treasury prices edged steadily lower across the maturity range yesterday, undermined by a stronger retail sales report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 92 11/32 , to yield 6.853 per cent. The two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 7/16 , yielding 4.910 per cent. Trading was quiet from the start, although prices did post modest gains in the first few hours of business. The market, however, could not maintain its early upward momentum, and as soon as the buying petered out, prices began to decline. The selling intensified in the afternoon following the release of a stronger-than-expected weekly retail sales report from the Johnson Redbook service.</p>

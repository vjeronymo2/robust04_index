			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Life body chief backs disclosure Life insurance companies charge too much for their products and costs will have to come down once sales agents are required to disclose commissions, the head of the life insurance industry's trade association said yesterday. 'Commission disclosure will draw attention to the substantial differences between the operating costs of life offices,' said Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Association of British Insurers, in an unusually frank speech to members. 'This should stimulate competition which will drive down costs. In general, the industry's costs are too high for the product which is being sold.' Mr Boleat also attacked those of his members who have been publicly criticising the efforts of regulators in recent years to force disclosure and to end bad selling practices. 'The unseemly wrangling which went on prior to the establishment of the Personal Investment Authority did the industry no good at all,' Mr Boleat said. 'It gave the impression of an industry fighting to avoid effective regulation and moreover one that was at odds with itself on how regulation should be achieved.' Until recently, Mr Boleat said, the life insurance industry has been inadequately regulated. The improved regulation provided by the PIA should help improve its tarnished image, he said. Mr Boleat, who was addressing a conference on life insurance, added: 'Regulation in the life industry is essential because in the absence of regulation there would be no reward in being virtuous.' The life insurance industry has for years resisted regulations requiring it to tell prospective customers about costs generally and about sales agents' commissions in particular. But that information will have to be disclosed from January.</p>

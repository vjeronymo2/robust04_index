			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold hits 9-month high as buying spree continues THE FIRE in the gold market ignited by high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros continued to rage yesterday as the price moved up to a nine-month peak of 356.60 a troy ounce and the excitement spilled over into silver and other precious metals markets. 'The propaganda about the Goldsmith and Soros deals has been overwhelming,' said one trader. 'I am getting calls from no-brain investors who have difficulty picking up the 'phone, let alone understanding the gold market. But nobody wants to sell gold. Professionals are having to buy to cover option positions. They (Sir James and Mr Soros) have provoked a weight of money that means rationality is suspended. Who knows where or when it will end?' Some traders said silver was centre stage yesterday as the price moved to a 21-month peak of Dollars 4.36 an ounce in London before easing back to close at Dollars 4.325, up 21 cents from Wednesday's close. Platinum, like gold, reached its highest price for nine months in London and closed at Dollars 384.50 an ounce, up Dollars 10.30. Gold eased back to close last night at Dollars 355.25 an ounce, up Dollars 3.60. Seven weeks ago the metal was at its lowest for seven years but at the weekend it was revealed that Mr Soros, who made Dollars 1bn in the currency markets last September, had bought shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest North American producer, and Sir James, the Anglo-French deal-maker, had taken out a huge number of options to buy gold. Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'In the next few weeks, until Sir James's options mature, gold buying by call option writers will mean that the more the price rises, the more it will rise.' Mr Jeff Christian, managing director of CPM, the New York-based precious metals consultancy group, suggested gold was ready for 'an extended move upwards', but it was still susceptible to sales by central banks - which have 35,000 tonnes in their vaults. He took to task those organisations and gold bulls who in recent weeks had 'attempted to mislead the public on the essence and nature of official sector gold activity'. He said a large number of central banks had sold gold in the past few years and these disposals had brought about 33.7m ounces net of additional bullion to the market since 1987.</p>

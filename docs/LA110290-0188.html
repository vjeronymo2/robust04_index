			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRANCE HAS LAST LAUGH AS BRITONS SHUN INSULT DAY  </P> <P> Urged on by Britain's top-selling Sun newspaper but outnumbered by cameramen  and pigeons, a handful of Britons gathered in Trafalgar Square today to bawl  insults at the French.  </P> <P> The tabloid Sun, with a circulation of 4 million, backs Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher against plans by Frenchman Jacques Delors, president of the European  Commission, for a European currency to replace sterling.  </P> <P> So it urged readers to turn toward France at midday and bellow: "Up yours,  Delors!" and appointed as gathering place the square that commemorates the  British victory over the French fleet at Cape Trafalgar in 1805.  </P> <P> Just four members of the ruling Conservative Party and two young office workers  turned up.  </P> <P> Bemused tourists looked on and taxi drivers hooted approval as the group  gesticulated, waved flags and sang "Rule Britannia."  </P> <P> The solitary Frenchman present, journalist Eric Dior, was disappointed. "I  expected something more grotesque," he said.  </P> <P> French newspapers today countered the Sun's outburst with mostly good-natured  mockery of their neighbors across the English Channel.  </P> <P> "Roastbeefs, the Frogs Greet You," was the headline in Le Parisien. The French  call the English "roastbeefs" because of their supposed fondness for overcooked  meat.  </P> <P> "We like you really . . . , " Le Parisien said of the English. " . . . It would  be too cheeky to reproach you for your appalling food, for pinching our wines,  our dishes, our chefs, our country cottages and our countryside.  </P> <P> "It would be even easier to mock you for your rainy weather, the way you look  as if you have just swallowed an umbrella, your women's buckteeth, your pubs  closed on Sundays and in the evening.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MISTRIAL DECLARED IN SANITY PHASE OF DENTIST'S TRIAL  </P> <P> A mistrial has been declared in the sanity phase of the murder trial of a  dentist after jurors said they were unable to decide whether he was sane at the  time of the slaying.  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court jury sent out a note Monday to Judge Donald  Meloche, saying they were deadlocked after 15 hours of deliberations on the  sanity of Dr. Douglas Dustin, 53.  </P> <P> Dustin, who lives in the Los Angeles area, was convicted March 17 by the same  jury of first-degree murder in the Sept. 13, 1987, shooting death of Dustin's  estranged wife, Adelheid (Heide) Dustin, 50, near her La Jolla home.  </P> <P> The jurors said six of them voted one way, five another, and one was undecided  on the sanity question.  </P> <P> Dustin's murder conviction will stand, but he will be retried on the sanity  phase. Meloche ordered Dustin back to court on April 21 for setting a retrial  date.  </P> <P> If he is found insane, he would likely be committed to a mental hospital,  possibly for life. But if jurors find he was sane, he would face a state prison  term of 26 years-to-life.  </P> <P> Most of the psychiatrists who examined him testified during the sanity phase  that they believe he was insane at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> John Mitchell, Dustin's attorney, said in court he may ask that he get a new  trial on the guilt phase of the trial because the jurors failed to reach a  verdict on sanity.  </P> <P> The sanity phase began March 20 and the jury began their deliberations on  Thursday afternoon.  </P></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Samsung engages in a higher quality revolution - The results of the strict regime introduced at the South Korean conglomerate It is being called Chairman Lee Kun-hee's cultural revolution at Samsung, South Korea's oldest and largest conglomerate. Instead of little red books, there are Chairman Lee's videotapes, which engage in masochistic corporate self-criticism. The message is that Samsung is in danger of becoming a second-rate international business unless the group rapidly shifts its focus from quantity to quality and overhauls its cumbersome bureaucracy. Samsung and other South Korean conglomerates, or chaebol, have become fixated on market share and sales volume at the expense of high-quality goods that can compete in advanced industrial markets, according to Mr Lee. Not only is Samsung in danger of losing global sales as rising labour costs rob it of price competitiveness, but it also faces the threat of better products in its home market as Korea dismantles its trade barriers, particularly against Japanese goods. The harsh message was prompted by the chairman's visit to the US last year. Retailers told him that Samsung consumer electronics, one of the group's main areas, suffered a poor image because of high defect rates. To underscore the sense of urgency, the 51-year-old son of the group's late founder has introduced radical western management practices this year at Samsung, which previously was considered the Korean chaebol most influenced by Japanese corporate culture. 'We are trying to create the psychological atmosphere for change, and break down the hierarchical mind-set to improve efficiency,' said Mr Hwang Young-key, the executive director for personnel. 'We are willing to sacrifice sales and profits for quality improvement.' Foreign analysts believe weaning Korean groups away from their empire-building will not be easy. But Ms Nicola Gwynne-Howell of Baring Securities in London is confident that Samsung is proceeding in the right direction. 'They're global leaders in a lot of the technologies they are in, such as semi-conductors,' she says. Although Samsung's corporate programme still has some way to go, 'the ingredients are right'. As part of its new and more focused approach, Samsung's 180,000 employees work a shorter and earlier schedule - from 7am to 4pm - to encourage them to be more productive. 'We are telling them with this measure that the group is changing, so you should change too in your work habits,' explains Mr Hwang. Senior executives must spend four days out of their six-day week at factories, meeting suppliers and customers instead of remaining behind their desks. Tape recorders have replaced written records at meetings to reduce paperwork. Workers are encouraged to stop the assembly line whenever they spot a production defect and fix the problem. It is too early to say whether these management practices are cosmetic or will have a significant effect on Samsung's performance, although most analysts believe that Mr Lee has identified a serious fault that underlies the corporate strategy of all chaebol. Perhaps more crucial for the future of Samsung, which estimates 1993 sales at Won50,000bn (Dollars 61bn), is a restructuring of its 48 companies, which range from electronics to construction to petrochemicals. There is a growing awareness at Samsung and the other chaebol that rampant diversification is hindering their global competitiveness. The groups need to concentrate on a few core industries to achieve success abroad. 'We have been covering so many industries, from light and heavy manufacturing to the service sector, that we didn't know where to place the emphasis,' said Mr Lim Dong-sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute. A first step to slimming down the group was taken in June when Samsung announced that it was selling or merging most of its peripheral light industry and service companies, reducing the number of subsidiaries to 34. They include two of Samsung's original businesses, food and textiles, with other members of the Lee family members acquiring some of them. The future focus of Samsung will be on high-tech and heavy industrial companies, supported by an expanding financial services business, including Korea's leading insurance company. The goal is to develop other world-class companies to match the success of Samsung Electronics, which accounts for 16 per cent of group sales and is the world's leading manufacturer of memory chips. This may prove difficult since some of Samsung's other main businesses have encountered recent problems. Samsung Engineering &amp; Construction was punished by the government earlier this year after it was blamed for building faults that caused one of the nation's worst railway accidents. Samsung General Chemicals, its petrochemical business, is losing money due to production overcapacity in this sector. One possible growth candidate is Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), which is expected to be listed shortly. The company is one of Korea's leading manufacturers of ships, construction equipment and machinery. But SHI's ambitions are controversial, since it wants to expand into car production, which would cost at least Dollars 2bn in initial investments. Some analysts warn the move is risky because Korea could face a production glut in the next few years as the country's five existing car manufacturers expand capacity. Those doubts are shared by some Samsung officials. 'When we can't even make a television properly, how can we make a good car?' asked one executive. The government also has its reservations. It recently blocked what was suspected to be a takeover bid by Samsung for Kia Motors, the country's second biggest motor company. Samsung has also shown interest in the aerospace sector. Samsung Aerospace Industries is the country's largest aircraft manufacturer with its licensed production of the F-16 fighter jet for the Korean Air Force. It is now planning to move into the civilian aviation business. It recently agreed with Aviation Industries of China to develop a mid-size commuter aircraft and may start a domestic carrier to create a market for the airliners. Samsung's move to higher value-added industries, such as cars and aerospace, is understandable. But the strategy carries with it the risk that it may only encourage further expansion when the group needs to focus its energies on a few selected businesses. Whether Samsung can achieve balanced growth may prove to be the true test of Chairman Lee's management reforms.</p>

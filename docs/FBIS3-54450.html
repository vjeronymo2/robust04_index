			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Speaking at a dinner with leaders of European  Jewish communities in Strasbourg last night, Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin said that Syria has informed Israel of its  willingness to sign a separate peace agreement, unlinked to  agreements with other parties. Today Rabin will address a  plenum of the Council of Europe. Gid'on Kouts reports from  Strasbourg:    [Begin Kouts recording] The Syrians gave an affirmative  reply to a question posed by an Israeli representative in the  Washington talks as to whether an agreement with Syria will  stand on its own two feet -- namely, be unlinked to arrangements  with other countries or parties. The Syrians said that for  them, such an agreement is part of a comprehensive arrangement.  This was announced by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at a dinner  with European Jewish leaders in Strasbourg.    Israeli sources said that the Syrian statement, made  yesterday, means the Syrians are prepared to sign a separate  agreement with Israel, a departure from the Syrian stand in  President al-Asad's Geneva talks with Bill Clinton. After that  meeting, the U.S. peace team reported that al-Asad made any  agreement and normal relations with Israel contingent on the  settlement of issues such as the right of return and Jerusalem.  In Rabin's opinion, this is an encouraging reply reflecting a  Syrian readiness to achieve a peace agreement with Israel.  [passage omitted] [end recording]    Our correspondent adds that Yitzhaq Rabin further noted  there  is no room for saying that an agreement with the PLO is  imminent. A source in his entourage was pessimistic about  prospects for attaining such an agreement by the end of this  week.    Rabin also said he did not think Jordan would be the first  or  second country to sign a peace agreement with Israel.</p>

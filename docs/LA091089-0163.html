			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENCORE! CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF THE MUSIC CENTER;  </P> <P> TODAY;  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE MUSIC CENTER: VISITS WITH 16 PEOPLE WHO HAVE ROLES IN  ITS ROUND-THE-CLOCK OPERATIONS -- FROM OUT FRONT TO BACKSTAGE, FROM MUSIC TO  MAINTENANCE, FROM SALES TO SECURITY  </P> <P> Most properly and most officially it's called the Music Center of Los Angeles  County. For while it may fill a block of downtown real estate, this complex of  buildings and people is as diverse as the county itself. A multifaceted city  within a multifaceted county.  </P> <P> Take, for example, one day (and part of a night) at the Music Center. Almost  any day. Say a day last spring:  </P> <P> From his Pavilion office, Music Center coordinator Roger Parrell, the liaison  between the County and the Music Center Operating Co., scans the day's  schedule: Pavilion -- Performance 'Orpheus," 8 p.m. Mark Taper Forum --  performance, "Stand Up Tragedy," 8 p.m. Ahmanson Theatre -- performance,  "Phantom of the Opera," 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Eldorado -- Breakfast Club marketing  breakfast (30 people), 7 a.m.-9:30 a.m. Blue Ribbon -- Pete Schabarum reception  (200 people), 5 p.m.-8 p.m. Founders -- Coopers &amp; Lybrand lunch (40  people), 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Pavilion Restaurant -- 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m., 5:30  p.m.-8 p.m. Otto Rothchilds -- 7:30 a.m.- 11 a.m. Backstage Cafe -- 11 a.m.-8  p.m.  </P> <P> An arts complex with only artists? Hardly. To maintain its many cultural and  social activities, the Music Center operates much like a self-contained city, a  city of more than 500 citizens. Here is a glimpse at how this city functions.  </P> <P> SCOTT POLLACK  </P> <P> For glamour and adventure, Scott Pollack has one of the most underrated jobs in  the complex. He commands the 17-man security force that ferrets transients out  of stairwells, returns lost diamond broaches and keeps groupies from assaulting  the Pavilion Artists Entrance.  </P> <P> Only 22 and a captain for Burns International Security Services (contracted by  the county), the native New Yorker looks snappy in his starched white shirt  with badge. "Most of the work is fairly slow," he says, "but there are  moments."  </P> <P> During their post-performance lockup of the three theaters, Pollack and his men  have found diamond watches, as well as cameras, binoculars, items of clothing  and wallets. "Once we found a $6,000 diamond ring," he says. And once he  discovered a homeless couple living in a Pavilion stairwell. The young man and  woman had been there two days; the pair had set up bed and lodging.  </P> <P> Last year a burglar broke into the gift shop on the courtyard. But most of the  time there is little problem because the grounds are patrolled on a 24-hour  basis. (L.A. County Safety Police also provide building security.) A wide-angle  video lens sweeps the courtyard with a ubiquitous eye.  </P> <P> Fans often try to con their way through the Grand Street Artists Entrance, says  Pollack. "They will say that such and such a performer had left their name at  the entrance, and it isn't their fault if it's lost."  </P> <P> PAGE MESSERLY  </P> <P> "Often we are a person's very first theater experience," says Page Messerly,  box office treasurer for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "Sometimes people are  intimidated to come to the box office. If we treat them well, they will enjoy  theater more."  </P> <P> This day, Messerly, 30, a UCLA theater-arts graduate who used to design  lighting for Equity Waiver productions, is busy on three fronts: taking ticket  orders for the July 1 and final performance of "Orpheus of the Underworld,"  handling advance sales for the summer Pavilion presentations of "Gypsy" and  "Fiddler on the Roof" and doing subscription work for the 1989-90 Music Center  Opera season (which just opened with "Tosca").  </P> <P> Messerly started in the telephone-orders room of the Pavilion four years ago,  moved to group sales and took over as box office treasurer last year. Her  department numbers 11 full-time staff members.  </P> <P> "Just now I had to explain to a customer at the window that we are not the  Ahmanson," Messerly says. "People often confuse our Pavilion box office with  the other theaters.  </P> <P> "Most sales, though, are not over the wicket but through ticket outlets and  telephone and mail orders.  </P> <P> "The important thing is communication, learning how to extract information from  people quickly. It's a lot easier when a customer says, 'I want to see this  show on this date and here's the money I have to spend.' It comes down to what  price people want to spend. Some have to have a seat on the aisle. And one  patron, when buying for the Joffrey Ballet, always sits in Row 22, insisting  the Joffrey can only be appreciated from Row 22.  </P> <P> "When it comes to opera, we find that word of mouth, not reviews, is  particularly important."  </P> <P> NEAL ALVAREZ  </P> <P> He writes plays on the side and oversees a 130-person usher pool for all three  theaters. "I started ushering here in '73," says Neal Alvarez. "It was a job to  get me through college."  </P> <P> Now, as supervisor of all ushers, which include ticket takers and footmen (the  uniformly dressed personnel who work the front of the box offices), Alvarez,  35, has a career.  </P> <P> Many current, full-time Music Center employes were once ushers and several,  Alvarez says, went on to become L.A. policemen, lawyers and judges. The most  famous is actor John Ritter, Music Center usher class of 1969-70.  </P> <P> Dressed in blue blazers or gray blouses and slacks, the ushers this evening  were moving through their post-show routines, clearing out the houses, checking  to see that restrooms were empty, and clearing with Alvarez the next day's  schedule for a children's drama festival.  </P> <P> But ushering is not as passive as it may look. Take heart attacks.  </P> <P> Says Alvarez: "People don't realize it, but some theatergoers are alive today  because we're trained in CPR."  </P> <P> The night before, at a soiree hosted by California Federal Savings for the  opening of the Music Center Opera Company's "Orpheus in the Underworld," a  patron suffered a seizure and toppled out onto the courtyard in front of the  Pavilion. Alvarez and the house manager rushed to his side and called the Music  Center registered nurse, Virginia Bidwell, who works full-time in a large  first-aid room at the Pavilion. Paramedics were on the scene in less than five  minutes. The man was saved, which Alvarez credits to a policy that ushers be  Red Cross-trained in CPR.  </P> <P> "Major illnesses are common here," says Alvarez. "When all three theaters are  running, plus the usual tourists and strollers, you can have more than 6,000  people here."  </P> <P> A graduate of Los Angeles City College and UCLA, Alvarez calls ushers "the  Music Center's unsung heroes because we are the people who represent the Music  Center to the public."  </P> <P> Beginning ushers earn $4.67 an hour, senior ushers, $5.39. Above them come head  ushers, house managers, then Alvarez himself.  </P> <P> They are highly motivated, says Alvarez. "The prerequisite is that they have to  be students, either high school seniors or in college. They may work 30 hours a  week -- and they get to see a lot of plays.  </P> <P> Says Alvarez: "There have been 6,000 ushers here since the Center opened.  Ushering here is an educational experience, like going to an arts college."  </P> <P> DON LA PANE  </P> <P> Don La Pane, director of sales for Pavilion Catering, was having a typically  crazy day. Not only was he yanked into emergency service as a maitre d' in the  pastry department but -- dressed in suit and tie -- he had to jump into a  catering truck to speed deliveries to an off-the-premises party.  </P> <P> Says La Pane: "This job is crazy but wonderful. Nothing is routine. What we  really do in the catering department is run a hotel without sleeping rooms."  </P> <P> Pavilion Catering, with 200 employees, not only operates all three restaurants  -- the 200-seat Pavilion dining room, the 175-seat Otto Rothchilds and the  205-seat Back Stage Cafe (including its 175-seat outdoor capacity) -- but also  handles the assorted banquets, parties and private lunches that daily fill the  Music Center culinary schedule.  </P> <P> Catering is a big-budget item here. A post "Orpheus" opening-night party the  evening before, for 400 invited guests, cost $25,000.  </P> <P> "A lot of downtown corporations don't even know there's food here," La Pane  says. "I sell the Music Center as a destination. We do a lot of off-premise  catering. No potential client will talk to you if you say you're from a  catering company, but if you say 'Music Center' the reaction is different."  </P> <P> "Our business is word-of-mouth. And our business is predicated on how  successful the theaters are. The '88 summer was slow. But 'Phantom of the  Opera' has changed that. The success of 'Phantom' has compelled us to bring  back brunch at the Pavilion."  </P> <P> La Pane was checking out decor, theming, flowers and entertaining for a private  banquet in the Pavilion's Grand Ballroom: "Eight hundred man-hours can go into  a sit-down dinner. People step into a party and don't think a thing about the  preparation, how much must be done in a short amount of time."  </P> <P> MIREYA JONES  </P> <P> Mireya Jones strongly attacks the idea that volunteers are socialites with  nothing better to do.  </P> <P> "We're the best-kept secret in Los Angeles," says Jones, outgoing president of  the Los Angeles Philharmonic Affiliates, an umbrella organization for  volunteers at the Music Center. The group began working for the Philharmonic  Orchestra in 1923 with a handful of volunteers and today has 2,400 members in  22 autonomous committees.  </P> <P> The group is "getting something done -- that's where volunteers want to be.  We're not the tea-and-crumpets broads that (Ernest Fleischmann, Philharmonic  executive vice president) expected when he came here from England," she says.  </P> <P> Typical of the work done by the Affiliates is planning for the Philharmonic  Ball, an event last year that raised $130,000. Recently, Jones, incoming  president Frances Muir, Philharmonic Ball chairman Joan Riach, Fleischmann and  Ann Giesler, coordinator of volunteer activities for the Philharmonic, met to  hear progress reports on the next ball -- which will be held on the Pavilion  stage Dec. 5, the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Music Center. Topics of  discussion ranged from Fire Department regulations to table arrangements, from  the labor costs of doing fund-raisers at the Music Center to the restrictions  on fund raising.  </P> <P> The Music Center regulates the fund-raising activities of the resident groups,  primarily to keep them from competing for the same funding sources.  </P> <P> "I'm amazed that it works as well as it does," Muir says of the fund-raising  rules. "There are a lot of egos involved, and a lot of money."  </P> <P> TONY DOMINGUES  </P> <P> When the Music Center finally goes dark, when the last lingering patron has  left Rothchilds, a maintenance crew slips into the shadows with its mops and  vacuums. It's 4 a.m. in the underbelly of the Music Center. In what, to the  casual observer, seems the toughest job, a crew of janitors hauls out its  cleaning equipment and departs to myriad way stations of grime, dust and trash.  </P> <P> Tony Domingues supervises the 26 janitors. His shift, he explains, is the best  time of day to dump the trash, scrub the restrooms, clean the offices and, once  a week, steam clean the Plaza courtyard itself.  </P> <P> "Besides our regular work, we have to get ready for special shows, too," says  Domingues. "The 4 a.m. to noon shift is the most common for most of us."  </P> <P> Like the ushers and guards, Domingues, spots his share of lost baubles,  including wallets and a gold fountain pen (found in an elevator).  </P> <P> But nothing in Music Center lost-and-found legend compares with a janitor's  recent discovery at the Pavilion. There, wedged between two seats following a  concert by the Philharmonic, was a cashier's check for $10,000. The check was  signed and the payee line had yet to be filled in. The janitor turned it in to  Domingues who, in turn, gave it to the security guards in lost and found. The  man who had signed the check was able to retrieve it within hours.  </P> <P> JAMES B. DOLAN  </P> <P> The tools of a music librarian's trade have changed since James B. Dolan joined  the Philharmonic the year before the Music Center was built. There are now  computer filing systems and on-line data bases, photocopiers and fax machines.  </P> <P> But the basic tasks of proofreading and collating the music that appears on the  orchestra's racks for rehearsal and performance are still done the  old-fashioned way -- carefully, by personal examination of every bar of every  part.  </P> <P> "You have to look at everything," Dolan says. "You could work 24 hours a day  and never get caught up."  </P> <P> In addition to catching and correcting the errors and putting measure numbers  in the parts where the publisher omitted them, Dolan must see to it that  bowings and other indications are transferred.  </P> <P> He is not alone in his job. Only the fifth librarian in the Philharmonic's  70-year history, Dolan is the first to have two assistants -- Kazue Asawa  McGregor, wife of Philharmonic trumpeter Rob Roy McGregor, and Katherine Dolan,  his daughter.  </P> <P> Together, they are responsible for getting the correct music on the stands and,  indeed, for obtaining the music in the first place.  </P> <P> A compact man of quiet pride, Dolan has an obvious love for the scores and  parts the orchestra does own -- many of them first editions. As Toscanini's  librarian during a career that began in Boston in 1934, Dolan himself is a  walking library of music lore, and his stories are filled with the likes of  Arthur Fiedler, Leonard Bernstein and Ferde Grofe (a violist for the  Philharmonic in its first season in 1919).  </P> <P> DAVID RUBINSTEIN  </P> <P> Is there a phantom in the house? Not if David Rubinstein has anything to do  with it.  </P> <P> Rubinstein, production stage manager for "Phantom of the Opera," was roaming  the cavernous backstage area at the Ahmanson before a matinee. He was checking  on myriad details -- from an actor's tardiness to ensuring that set pieces  lowered and raised from the stage didn't bump into each other.  </P> <P> "It's really about putting out fires," he says about his job. "Some days  they're aren't any, and my crew and I are able to sit down. Then we have those  days when there are more fires than we can handle."  </P> <P> Being a man of the stage (theater graduate of Temple University, veteran stage  manager and/or assistant director specializing in musicals ranging from "Les  Miserables" to "Peter Pan"), Rubinstein is frankly superstitious. Ask about a  particularly tricky technical maneuver and he'll knock his knuckles on whatever  surface is nearby. And doing a show involving a Svengali-like phantom artiste  who wreaks havoc to an opera house doesn't make things any easier, though it  does make for much half-nervous joking.  </P> <P> "We'll mess up," Rubinstein says, "and somebody will crack that the Phantom's  up to his old tricks again. Rubinstein coordinates four assistants,  communicates with crew hands posted from up in the fly to below the stage,  keeps a watch on monitors fixed on the conductor, the stage and the huge  chandelier set piece, and controls a switchboard for hundreds of automatic and  manual cues . . . and he also runs weekly rehearsals for cast understudies and  sends daily reports on the performances to "Phantom's" central New York  production office.  </P> <P> NANCY DAVIS  </P> <P> "So you'll send out the financial statement for the board meeting?" Nancy Davis  says into the telephone. ". . . OK, I'll fax the fund-raising report now."  </P> <P> Davis is telephoning New York. In fact, she will talk to four people in one  office in New York, scanning a "Weekly Minder" date book as she's transfered  from one extension to the next.  </P> <P> The Joffrey Ballet was at home for 27 years in Manhattan's City Center Theater,  until it established a joint residency at the Music Center five years ago.  While the now bicoastal troupe performs equally in each metropolis, many of its  administrators spend most of their time in New York. That sets up daily  obstacles of time and space for Davis, general manager of the Joffrey's West  Coast operations, and her eight-person staff.  </P> <P> "Yes, it is frustrating," says Davis, squooshed into an office the size of a  large closet. She nonetheless has a window with a view of Grand Avenue  featuring the Museum of Contemporary Art. "You might not get a call back. You  have good days and bad days."  </P> <P> Davis, a former I. Magnin store manager with a chipper disposition and shiny  blonde hair, coordinates Los Angeles activities -- fund raisers, patrons,  ticket, advertising and publicity agencies, and the company's board of  directors, about half of whose 73 members live in the L. A. area.  </P> <P> It's not always paper-pushing. When the troupe is in town, Davis says, she and  most of her staff watch performances every night. And, their suite of four  small offices shares space on the fourth floor of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion  with rehearsal rooms -- the click-clack of typewriters punctuates muffled  sounds of opera singers and orchestras.  </P> <P> Another of Davis' tasks: arranging a free performance of the "Nutcracker" for  3,000 inner-city kids, made possible by a Joffrey donor. The cost of the  gesture, she told the donor by phone, would total about $90,000 if every seat  of the Pavilion was bought.  </P> <P> "You always want to be able to meet the needs of the donor," says Davis. "This  particular donor feels strongly about trying to find meaningful activities for  inner-city kids. For many, this will be their first exposure to the performing  arts. It is gratifying for me to put the right project together with the right  donor. Also I have a sense of victory when it all works out and it's great  knowing that the children will benefit."  </P> <P> JAMES M. FLOYD  </P> <P> A matinee for "Phantom of the Opera" means extra work for James M. Floyd,  general manager of the Music Center garage. That's when he runs an extra 700 to  800 cars.  </P> <P> "When the theaters are going," says Floyd, "it's a constant flow. Every hour  something new is going on here."  </P> <P> It's 1:30 in the afternoon and cars are rumbling through the entrances for a  matinee of "Phantom of the Opera." Floyd is out on Grand Avenue directing  traffic for all levels (1,800 spaces). "The trick," he says, "is to keep all  the entrances open and flowing." Across the Plaza, on Hope Street, others on  Floyd's staff are manning valet parking.  </P> <P> But Floyd's staff of 45, employed by a contracted firm called 5 Star Parking,  has more to do than only work theater parking.  </P> <P> His crew opens the underground garage at 5 a.m. to accommodate city and county  employees. Two men work from 11 p.m.-8 a.m. doing nothing but mopping up oil  left by leaky engines on the slick garage surfaces.  </P> <P> Floyd views his job as "an adventure. It's unique because it's not routine.  It's a job of logistics. You have to be on the alert."  </P> <P> WALLY RUSSELL  </P> <P> Wally Russell leaned back in his chair, sipped coffee from a paper cup and  enjoyed the lull. "Orpheus in the Underworld" had opened two nights before and  for the technical director of the Music Center Opera it had been two weeks of  non-stop overtime getting everything ready to go -- the lights, scenery, props,  audio gear . . .  </P> <P> Says Russell: "The theater is like that. Very, very intense periods followed by  a down time."  </P> <P> Russell, 55, rumpled, easy-going, spoke from his disheveled, unadorned office,  just roomy enough for a couple of large desks, a drafting table, a small  refrigerator. Exhausted, he planned to go home at noon and dig into a mound of  paper work piled up from his job at the opera.  </P> <P> But by 10 a.m., a phone call threatened to disrupt the welcomed peace.  "Orpheus" star Dom DeLuise may have to fly to New York.  </P> <P> That would mean a rehearsal for understudy Roderick Cook, who couldn't arrive  at the theater until 7 p.m. In addition to overseeing all technical aspects of  production and supervising 45 people on eight productions a year, Russell is  responsible for scheduling all activity taking place on the stage. Therefore,  he would also have to set in motion routine preperformance technical  preparations, make sure cast and crew were notified of the run-through, then,  to his displeasure, stay for the evening performance to "make sure everything  runs smoothly."  </P> <P> Leaving his office located one floor beneath the Pavilion stage, he ascended  the single flight to meet property master Carmine Marinelli. "We may have to  throw in a rehearsal this afternoon," he told Marinelli without a trace of  panic in his voice.  </P> <P> He is used to responding to emergencies, however.  </P> <P> Preparation may start as much as three years ahead of time, Russell says:  "Someone might want to know how many shipping containers are needed for  costumes coming from Amsterdam." Or it may mean loading scenery into the  backstage area of the theater two days before a premiere.  </P> <P> But problems -- which cause delays -- are costly. Actors, musicians and  stagehands, all paid by the hour, go into overtime, which can total up to  $3,000 an hour for the routine contingent of stagehands employed on a single  production. Says Russell: "It behooves you to organize well."  </P> <P> JUDITH TOWNSEND: ANNE E. WAREHAM  </P> <P> In Gordon Davidson's offices, command central of the Music Center's Center  Theatre Group, the phone never seems to stop ringing. Secretary Judith Townsend  coolly handles the incoming barrage like an air-traffic controller. Executive  assistant Anne E. Wareham is keeping tabs on all of the day's, and week's,  meetings to follow.  </P> <P> The trips and the office load have only increased since last September, when  Davidson took over the artistic directorship of the Ahmanson Theatre while  remaining at the helm of the Mark Taper Forum. By their own accounts, Wareham  and Townsend have a handle on the additional load, which is best appreciated by  scanning their shoe-box office. Every desk surface is covered in paper. Seven  large file cabinets stand behind them, on top of which are stacks of produced  and unproduced scripts.  </P> <P> Townsend wears a headset "so I can keep my hands free" while answering calls.  Eight big address card files line Townsend's desk, while Wareham has four and  counting. (Townsend: "Each day, I add 10 new numbers and Gordon averages 25  messages.")  </P> <P> Wareham describes herself as Davidson's "lifeline between him and whomever he's  working with."  </P> <P> Townsend is traffic cop for the flurry of phone calls ("We're swamped when he's  in, since everybody seems to know when he's in"). Perhaps even more demanding  is maneuvering house seats for Davidson's guests. Townsend often finds herself  having to place a takeout lunch in front of the artistic director. "Otherwise,"  she says bemusedly, "he'll completely forget about it."  </P> <P> FRED STEGEMAN  </P> <P> When Frank Gehry's design for the $100 million Walt Disney Concert Hall complex  was chosen last year, it was described as "a lush garden oasis nestled among  towers."  </P> <P> When project-management consultant Fred Stegeman of Stegeman and Kastner Inc.  heard that repeated, he was bemused. He explains that he has to think in  somewhat more mundane terms -- "acoustics, lighting, escalation, nurses'  stations, parking stalls and toilets." In short, Stegeman is assessing the  "oasis" in terms of all those practicalities needed for the Philharmonic's  future home adjacent to the Music Center.  </P> <P> Stegeman, a fit 51, talks about his job as "the man in the middle," responsible  for finding out what Gehry wants, what the property owners want and what's  possible. He ensures that the contractor makes it happen and that all parties  are kept up to date with every development.  </P> <P> "Concert halls are very expensive items and very complex," he says, "and we  have to produce (this one) relatively fast." Although there is as yet no  specific target date, completion may be possible for the 1994 season.  </P> <P> "Five years, actually six, sounds like an awful long time," Stegeman says, "but  many of these things can take nine or 10 years."  </P> <P> JOHN HOWLETT  </P> <P> The June morning after the Music Center Opera opened "Orpheus in the  Underworld," the company's director of marketing and public relations was deep  in planning the campaign for the new season in September. In the selling  department, the future is always now.  </P> <P> The meeting in John Howlett's spare, functional Music Center office covered ad  designs for the upcoming operas and grappled with budget constraints. With  "Tosca" and "The Rise and Fall of the City Mahagonny" opening almost  simultaneously, are two ads necessary or can both be covered in one?  </P> <P> The ads featured the phrase "L. A. Opera." Though the company is not formally  parting with its Music Center Opera designation, Howlett finds the L. A. Opera  concept a useful tool.  </P> <P> "We have gone very quickly from non-existence to being perceived as a major  company," Howlett says. "Now we need to be seen as friendly and as part of the  larger community."  </P> <P> Howlett himself feels very much a part of the community here, both within and  without the opera offices. "I feel everything I've done has led to this job,"  he says. He had been vice-president for marketing at the Brooklyn Academy of  Music, where his work on the Next Wave festivals was much what it is here,  "basically a matter of positioning, and getting a new audience."  </P> <P> Howlett's planning meeting was constantly interrupted by a flow of phone calls  and people.  </P> <P> "My job description from the beginning has been to do whatever has to be done.  The organization is remarkably egoless in doing that," Howlett says. "The  organzation is basically Peter (Hemmings, general manager) and everybody else.  We all have to pull together."  </P> <P> RAE MACDONALD  </P> <P> In a minuscule office in a boxy trailer across the street from the Music  Center, the telephone is ringing -- again. The woman sitting at the cluttered  desk on this warm June afternoon apologizes for another interruption and  politely answers, "Master Chorale, Rae Macdonald."  </P> <P> Tall and cordial, with short and curly dark hair, this busy woman industriously  marking rehearsal schedules and fielding phone calls is production coordinator  for the Master Chorale. "Right now," she explains, "I'm re-adjusting the opera  schedules for our January through April rehearsals so we can get our  availability slips out and solicit singers (for the opera choruses)."  </P> <P> That is part of keeping the Master Chorale's organizational wheels turning, but  Macdonald has another formidable task: taking care of the group's 133 altos,  tenors, sopranos and other voices.  </P> <P> One day in the life of the Music Center, a day that in many ways impacted on  the hundreds who visited and the 500 who work there. It was just one day.  </P></p>

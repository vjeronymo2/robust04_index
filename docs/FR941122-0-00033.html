			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress expected the emission limitations in title IV to result in annual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions of 2.8 to 4.4 million tons in Phase I. Senate Rep. No. 101-228 at 327; Cong. Rec. S16980 (Oct. 27, 1990). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA estimates that the expected reductions by Phase I units alone during Phase I are about 2.4 million tons in 1995 and 1996 and about 3.5 million tons in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Memorandum from T. Larry Montgomery to Brian J. McLean (Oct. 15, 1993). As discussed above, the statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not intend these reductions to be eroded by substitution or reduced utilization plans. Yet, under the current regulations, Phase I units can avoid some of these reductions by offsetting their emissions in Phase I with excess, new allowances resulting from such plans. The use of 200,000 excess, new allowances per year in Phase I will negate a significant portion (i.e., 6 to 8 percent) of estimated, expected reductions for Phase I units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Because, as discussed above, Congress did not intend the substitution and compensating unit provisions to create excess, new allowances, commenters erred in claiming that such allowances account for the 2.8 to 4.4 million ton range for estimated Phase I reductions in SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . Rather, the range reflected,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> uncertainty over what emissions decreases or increases would occur at Phase II units that would not be subject to emissions limitations until Phase II. Because of the lack of emissions limitations on such units in Phase I, the Phase I emissions of these units and the impact on total Phase I reductions could only be projected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatively, banking these new allowances for use in Phase II will diminish the intended emissions reduction impact of the 8.95 million ton cap established by Congress for Phase II. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 60954&hyph;60955 (explaining the importance of the Phase II cap). The carryover and use of the excess, new allowances created by early entry of Phase II units into Phase I can result in emissions exceeding the cap for each of the first five years of Phase II by as much as 200,000 tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The magnitude of potential erosion of expected emissions reductions supports the Agency's conclusion, based on statutory language and legislative history, that Congress did not intend to allow substitution or compensating units to create allowances for pre-Phase II emissions reductions that would have been achieved in the absence of substitution and reduced utilization plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency's conclusion is also supported by Congress' approach in sections 404(e), 405, and 410 of the Act. As discussed in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954), the fact that in those sections Congress carefully limited the ability of Phase II units to obtain additional allowances for pre-Phase II reductions strongly suggests that sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1(B) should not be interpreted to allow allowance allocations for all such reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, contrary to the assertion of some commenters, the Agency's modification of the current regulations is not based on circular reasoning. The statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not intend for substitution or reduced utilization plans to result in fewer reductions than without the plans. The analysis that such plans under the January 11, 1993 regulations can result in about 200,000 excess, new allowances per year in Phase I shows the potential magnitude of the problem and supports today's modification of the regulations to ensure consistency with the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Substitution Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is modifying the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning substitution plans by limiting the allowances allocated to a substitution unit to the baseline times the lesser of: the 1985 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; the 1985 allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; the greater of 1989 or 1990 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; or the most stringent federal or State allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate for Phase I as of November 15, 1990, the date of enactment of title IV of the Act. In addition, the final regulations eliminate the language in the January 11, 1993 regulations providing that a Phase II unit that lacks any common owner or operator but has a common designated representative with a Phase I unit can, without anything more, be designated as a substitution unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Limiting the Allowances Allocated to Each Substitution Unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule limits the number of allowances allocated to each substitution unit by calculating the allocation using the lesser of the unit's 1985 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate or an SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate that is reasonably representative of what would have been achieved without the substitution plan. Specifically, a substitution unit will be allocated allowances equal to baseline times the lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate; or the most stringent federal or State allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate as of November 15, 1990 applicable to the unit in 1995&hyph;99. The January 11, 1993 regulations consider only the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, section 404(b)(5) requires that the substitution plan include a demonstration that the ``reassigned tonnage limits [under the plan] will, in total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than would have been achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit or units without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5). The Agency interprets this provision to require that the plan achieve total reductions equal to or greater than both (i) the Table A unit's reduction obligation in Phase I and (ii) the reductions that the substitution unit would have made if it had not entered Phase I, including reductions made, or mandated by federal or State law adopted, prior to the passage of title IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations sets forth a different interpretation of section 404(b)(5) that the Agency concludes is erroneous. As EPA explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954&hyph;60955): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

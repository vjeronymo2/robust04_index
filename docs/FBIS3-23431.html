A special sapper unit will also be stationed for a time in  Kuldiga to immediately liquidate explosive devices if found any  near Skrunda radar station.    The above mentioned actions were taken due to the blowing up  of pole for high-tension power line in Feb. 28 near Skrunda  radar and the explosive device found March 15 at a pole for  electricity wires, situated 1 kilometer away from Skrunda radar  station's pass post. [see item LD1603141994 in previous  Terrorism Report]    Charges are brought against wrongdoers, and Latvian  Prosecutors Office Board for Special Issues and Kuldiga district  Prosecutors Office investigate both cases. Presently it is not  clear if both the incidents are connected.    During the examination of clock mechanism that was connected  to the explosive device found March 15, experts stated that the  organizators of the explosion were non-professionals. The  experts claim the device was made of 12 kilograms of tolite,  electric detonator, wires, clock mechanism and power supplying  battery. If it had exploded, not only near located houses but  also Skrunda radar station would have suffered damages.    In return, it is stated that nearly half a kilogram of  tolite  caused the explosion in February 28.</p>

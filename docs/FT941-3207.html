			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Local councils to demand more parishes The government will today be urged to create more parishes as part of its review of local government. The National Association of Local Councils, which represents community, parish and town councils, says that about 13m people in rural England effectively have a 'three-tier' local government system of counties, districts and parishes. Parish and equivalent councils are served by 75,000 councillors. Merging counties and districts would mean that in unparished areas, local government would become more distant, and residents would only have one tier to complain to in the event of problems. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has urged that local government reform work on the 'subsidiarity' principle, where all powers are devolved to the lowest practical level. However, the legislation that started the review does not allow transfers of functions and responsibilities between the tiers. Mr Martin Harvey, the NALC's deputy secretary, said that if subsidiarity was to be implemented properly, counties or districts should make agency agreements with parishes to deliver specific services - such as local libraries - which are currently a county responsibility. He also said that subsidiarity would require separate entries for parish councils in government grants. At present, parishes gain all their funding from the grant paid to district councils, who are then expected to devolve funds to parishes. Local authorities have started intensive lobbying of Labour MPs over the local government review. The MPs are in a pivotal position after dissension among Tories. In the past week the Labour leaders of 38 English and Welsh counties have called on the party to drop its support for the review, claiming it will be a 'political disaster' and will 'only weaken local government further by replacing county-wide strategic services with joint boards and quangos'. But the leaders of more than 100 Labour-led district councils have also written to all Labour MPs urging them not to abandon the party's policy of strong support for unitary councils that combine the functions carried out at present by districts and counties. The letter says that MORI polls carried out for the Local Government Commission showed a general majority of two-to-one among voters in favour of the unitary principle. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, backs unitary authorities, and said in a recent interview with the Municipal Journal that the party had favoured unitary local government 'forever'. However, this approach is deeply unpopular with the Association of County Councils, which has been Labour-controlled. Some Labour spokesmen are now uncomfortable with this line.</p>

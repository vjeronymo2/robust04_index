			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bundespost Telekom lifts profits Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, preparing for privatisation in 1996, lifted profits before taxes, write-offs and government transfers to DM7.6bn (Dollars 4.5m) last year, up from DM7bn, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. After special write-offs of DM3.2bn and taxes and transfers to the state of DM6bn, the group reported a net loss of DM2.9bn, Telekom said yesterday. Group sales rose by 9.3 per cent, to DM59bn from DM54bn, reflecting a surge in business in eastern German states where turnover rose to DM4.5bn from DM3.5bn. The law for privatisation is expected to come into force in 1995, providing for the transformation of Telekom into three operating companies. It will be Germany's biggest privatisation to date. The first tranche in the telecommunications arm will be offered in mid-1996 with a market value of DM10bn-DM15bn. The market capitalisation of the group as a whole is set to be about DM60bn.</p>

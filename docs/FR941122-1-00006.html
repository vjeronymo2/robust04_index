			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 11, 1982, the Department published a rule at 47 FR 25496  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement section 129 of Public Law 96&hyph;249, which allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced FFP at the 75 percent level for costs associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the planning, design, development, acquisition, or installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ADP systems. On January 19, 1994, the Department published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another final rule at 59 FR 2725 which reduced the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement rate to the 63 percent level effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1991 for system proposals which were approved on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after November 28, 1990 unless the State had an approved Advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Document and had submitted an Implementation Advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Document with all the paperwork required for approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to November 28, 1990. The requirements and procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies for system development at both the enhanced and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard rates of funding were codified in 7 CFR 277.18 of Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Program Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13961 of the Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Act to reduce the rate of Federal funding for system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development to the regular 50 percent rate. The change in rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new rate applies to costs associated with the planning,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change in the funding rate applies to new proposals as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as proposals approved prior to April 1, 1994 at the enhanced rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of either 75 or 63 percent. Previously approved projects will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be reimbursed at the enhanced rate for costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred, as defined in the Background section of this preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only through March 31, 1994. The Federal reimbursement rate will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then drop to the regular 50 percent rate for the time remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the approval period. Modifications on or after April 1, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to existing systems will be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate. All new systems developed on or after April 1, 1994 will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

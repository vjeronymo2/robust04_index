UNITA has demanded more central and provincial  government posts. Pedro Manuel, our correspondent in the  Zambian capital, reports that the mediators and observers want  the two negotiating teams to meet today in a bid to overcome the  current stalemate.    [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. No  understanding has been reached yet concerning the issue of  government for this country. The mediators and observers may  try to get the two sides to meet today to overcome the deadlock.    According to a source, yesterday the mediators gave UNITA  yet  another document for it to analyze. That document was drawn up  on the basis of the offer made by the Angolan Government. UNITA  promised it would reply some time today.    Despite that, observers here in Lusaka have admitted the  possibility that negotiation may break down should UNITA remain  steadfast in its current position. The (?peace talks) continue  to focus on ministerial portfolios and provincial government  issues. UNITA has accepted what the government has offered but  it continues to say that it is not enough. It wants more  so-called key ministerial portfolios and more provinces to  govern. [end recording]</p>

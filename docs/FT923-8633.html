			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (6) Sir, Abbey is getting into bad habits by wishing to throw money at the housing problem. The housing market's overriding problem is oversupply. Homes are no different from any other abundant commodity in experiencing a price fall. Sideline the incidental problems; the basic cause of the malaise is too many vendors chasing too few buyers. A remedy is to regulate supply. Since this will not happen naturally, a capital gains tax on all homes sold within the first five years of occupation would produce this effect. Exceptions could be made to cover essential sales caused by job relocation, down-sizing on retirement or redundancy, and for moves to cover the expansion of a family by birth or by accommodating an elderly or dependant relative.

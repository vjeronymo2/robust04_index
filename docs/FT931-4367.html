			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Horns of a dilemma The London Stock Exchange faces the unhappy decision whether to stick with its ill-fated Taurus paperless trading and settlement system or abandon the project as a bad job. Turning back now would be a startling admission of failure. In addition to the Pounds 75m development cost incurred by the Exchange itself, City brokers and banks have spent much more. One can only hope these costs have been written off as incurred. The Exchange certainly has some explaining to do about why the project has been allowed to drag on at such expense for so long, but it was members and users who insisted on the project being so complicated. The London equity market cannot afford to wait indefinitely for an overhaul. A simplified version of Taurus built around a central database - rather than the complex distributed databases now proposed - would be less of a technological challenge. That would mean going back to something like the original 1987 proposals for Taurus. Doubtless there would be resistence to the idea. Registrars, for example, might view such a system as a threat. The attempt to replicate every last nuance of existing arrangements has proved unacceptably costly and slow. If the exchange cannot reconcile the conflicting interests, the Bank of England should knock heads together. There is a strong case for moving quickly to rolling settlement even without Taurus. Frankfurt is already well down this path, and the City is being left behind.</p>

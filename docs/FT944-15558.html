			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Guidance when late bills pile up - In a nutshell Legislation to allow businesses a statutory right to interest on bills that are paid late may still be a long way off in the UK. But the need to manage cash flow remains as acute as ever for businesses, particularly when they are growing rapidly. To help understand and calculate the cost of unpaid invoices and improve cash flow, Griffin Factors, the subsidiary of Midland Bank, has produced a guide, Financing the Credit Gap. The free guide contains an interactive disc and a booklet which help to assess the business's financial position and make recommendations. Available from Griffin Factors. Tel: 0800 525507</p>

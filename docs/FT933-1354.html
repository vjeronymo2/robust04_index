			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Back to Beijing for bohemian principles - Lynn MacRitchie admires Chinese avant-garde art, finding it full of contradictions put to artistic use Visiting young artists in China sometimes seems like going back in time, to Paris in the early years of this century, perhaps, when the creators of what was to become modern art were starving in hovels as they made their history changing experiments. In Beijing today there is an 'Artists Village' on the very western edge of the city, where a large group of painters, sculptors, writers and poets live the sort of bohemian life no longer much practised in the survival conscious west, where economic strategies are as much a part of artists' conversation as developments in their work. In 1993, however, even in China, such a community could not remain unknown for long. Some of the residents, although unrecognised by the artistic authorities who do not allow their work to be exhibited in the city, are already regular exhibitors in the west, the US and Australia, their untaxable income - since the authorities do not recognise them, neither can they profit from them - from sales at western prices making them part of Beijing's new rich. 'China Avant-Garde', the second part of the exhibition of Chinese contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, gives an opportunity to see the work of artists who for the most part are still living in their homeland. Some are employed as art teachers or designers, some are proud to be 'living as independent artists.' This position, like so many in the rapidly changing China of today is one filled with contradictions, something the artists themselves are well aware of and which in some cases provides a powerful theme in their work. All kinds of art work are practised and represented in the show. A form of realistic painting holds an important place, however. Fang Lijun and Liu Wei, both painters and two of the participants from China in the Venice Biennale this year, told me they had been disappointed by some of the work they saw there, complaining that it was too difficult to understand and seemed too far removed from everyday life. Both Fang Lijun and Liu Wei work from life, as captured in informal photographs of family and friends. Fang Lijun uses his own image worked large and repeated to create a world of anonymous figures against neutral backgrounds such as the sky, water or the sea, elements which he describes as being both very familiar and completely unknowable. The compositions suggest oppression and dread, the smiling figures both appealing and threatening, a potential brutality lurking beneath the placid and beautifully drawn surface. Liu Wei uses his immediate family as his subjects. By depicting them with brutal clarity in compositions which include the bits and pieces of everyday life - dad in his army uniform in front of a TV set showing Beijing opera, for example, or the elder brother grinning as he shows off his baby next to a grotesque toy deer, Liu Wei captures the absurdities of life in a society which has destroyed the meaning of the achievements of the past but faces the future with confusion: if you want to know what life in Beijing really feels like, look at these pictures. Another important school of painting is political pop, whose most famous representative is Wang Guangyi. He too is influenced by what he sees in the streets. We are used to our streets being full of images, he told me, but the billboards once painted with political slogans and exhortations are now covered with the famous names he uses in his pictures, combining the heroic workers, peasants and soldiers of 'Maoist realism' with Benetton, Kodak, Coca Cola and Marlboro. He points out that he does not celebrate the consumer objects as the American pop artists did, but wishes to make his audience think about the culture clash which has thrown his world into turmoil, producing a strain of nostalgic idealism which has made Chairman Mao into a genuine people's hero for the first time, patron saint of the hustling taxi drivers who clog the capital's streets. Other artists, such as Ni Haifeng, who lives on an island 12 hours sailing time from Shanghai covering rocks and stones in the landscape with writing and numbers, combine their knowledge of Western conceptual or performance work with study of ancient Chinese traditions. At a time when all is flux, the need to grasp on to something which retains integrity is strong. It is sobering to reflect that the get rich quick jungle which is China today emerged directly from the devastation of the Cultural Revolution, economic liberalisation the party's next tactic to retain power at any price. While most of China's citizens, with survival their uppermost concern, obey the new commands just as they obeyed the old, some of her artists are exploring what it really feels like to be Chinese today, telling the truth about their experience in a way that has simply never happened before. Throughout the history of Chinese culture, the individual has had little significance and less power. As China faces the future, this will have to change. Her avant-garde artists, wary, cynical, talented and tough, are at the forefront of this transition. New Art from China Part II: China Avant-Garde.

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: UK group sells stake in Chateau Latour ALLIED-LYONS, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has sold its 93.2 per cent stake in Chateau Latour, one of the four leading Bordeaux vineyards, for Pounds 80m (Dollars 120m) to Artemis, a private company controlled by Mr Francois Pinault, the French industrialist. Mr Pinault, head of the debt-burdened Pinault-Printemps retailing group, regarded the purchase as 'a good, long-term investment,' an aide said yesterday. she added. The Medoc estate was put on the market late last year. The decision reflected a change in management strategy after the group's Pounds 147m foreign currency loss in 1991. The focus switched to international growth brands and improving return on assets. The deal values Latour at Pounds 86m - little more than half its estimated value two years ago. Allied, which has been associated with the vineyard for over 30 years, emerges from the deal with a small profit. It became the majority shareholder in 1988 when it paid Pounds 58m for the 53 per cent stake held by Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times. The sale completes the rationalisation of Allied's wine business. It sold its Kendermann and Langenbach business in Germany last year and yesterday sold its US importing company, Frederick Wildman, to management. Its wine operations now comprise Callaway, Clos du Bois, and Williams Hill, in California, Calvet in France, the UK shippers and whole-salers, Harveys and Grants, and the Victoria Wine retail chain. Mr Pinault, 56, one of the new breed of French entrepreneurs, expanded his business activities rapidly during the 1980s from a Breton-based timber company into one of the leading French retailers with a turnover of FFr70bn last year.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / EBRD threatens to stop help for Russia: Jacques Attali ties bank's assistance to continuance of economic reforms THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will halt all financial help to Russia if economic reforms are postponed, Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD president, said yesterday in Budapest. Speaking at the bank's first annual meeting, he said western assistance should go only to those governments 'able to demonstrate that they have embarked upon the right road to reform. It is to be hoped that the political conditions in Russia will be such as to allow resources to be released.' The opening session of the meeting was also marked by further disagreement between the US and the EBRD over the scope of the bank's activities. In referring to western help for Russia, Mr Attali had in mind the Dollars 18bn - in addition to the Dollars 6bn earmarked for a stabilisation fund - recently announced by the Group of Seven industrial countries. 'But we would halt all our operations too,' he said. The EBRD has so far backed two loans to the former Soviet Union, which total Ecu28.8m (Pounds 20.62m). Even if Russia kept to the reform path, Mr Attali warned that all the countries of the former Soviet Union, and of eastern Europe, required extra financial help totalling Ecu4,000bn from the west. He said this would help ensure the region's balance of payments requirements, finance the privatisation of viable enterprises, boost export industries, convert the defence industry, and improve safety at nuclear power stations. EBRD economists have estimated that, during 1992, the balance of payments requirements for eastern Europe alone total Ecu15bn. The conversion of the old military sector is a key illustration of the disagreement between the US and EBRD over the bank's role. Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, told the meeting that the EBRD should 'not diffuse its mission' by moving away from its original mandate which stipulates that the bank commit 60 per cent of its financing to the private sector. It should not diversify away from privatisation by, for example, recapitalising state-owned enterprises. Mr Attali yesterday proposed setting up a special restructuring facility aimed at converting the military-industrial sector in the former Soviet Union (which directly, and indirectly, employs 12m) and at restructuring the Russian nuclear power industry. Many EBRD member countries see the need for some form of soft loans for these industries, but the US remains opposed. The bank's board agreed to look into the proposal, in a move to avoid further dispute. Mr Brady, who later flew to Moscow, said: 'We are not convinced of the need (for the bank) to branch into new restructuring operations involving major policy changes that detract from the bank's main mission. 'The EBRD cannot cover the entire range of needs; it cannot be all things to all people; it cannot hope to cover all sectors, both private and public, in all countries.' Germany and the former Soviet republic of Georgia set up diplomatic ties yesterday during a visit by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, local journalists said, Reuter reports. The agreement was a diplomatic coup for the new chairman of Georgia's ruling state council, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, who is trying to build diplomatic bridges with foreign states and attract western business. Germany will be the first western nation to open an embassy in Georgia and will provide humanitarian aid. EBRD projects to finance eastern Europe's most promising industries are becoming entangled in west European anxiety about trade competition, writes Nicholas Denton. Mr Ronald Freeman, vice-president of the EBRD's merchant banking arm, yesterday named food, textiles, steel and cars as the areas with the most immediate potential for restructuring and privatisation. But the EBRD had to tread warily in precisely these sensitive industrial areas because they were 'hot buttons in Brussels', he said. The EBRD's caution comes in the wake of political controversy surrounding the bank's Ecu61.4m (Pounds 44m) loan to General Motors' new Hungarian car and engine plant, which Mr Freeman confirmed yesterday. The loan fell subject to an investigation by the European Community following objections by France that tax concessions granted to the plant encouraged unfair competition. EBRD merchant bankers said they were surprised by the politicisation of the credit decision and that the dispute, although resolved, served as a warning. The pressure exercised by western member countries raised doubts about the independence of the EBRD and its ability to make credit and investment decisions on primarily commercial criteria which its charter stipulates. Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD's president, yesterday launched a broader attack on EC hypocrisy in protesting about support to eastern Europe and at the same time blocking imports. He was scathing about the EC's recent association agreements Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which he said denied access for nearly half the three countries' products.</p>

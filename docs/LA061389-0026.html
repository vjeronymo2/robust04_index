			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE DOES LITTLE HARM, BUT IT JOGS THE MEMORY  </P> <P> As soon as the jolt struck his Mobil station in Montebello, the epicenter of  Monday's earthquake, Al Louie went into his emergency routine: He turned off  the gasoline pumps, checked the station for damage, then took off in his car.  </P> <P> First stop was his house five miles away, where his wife was in the yard  watering the grass, "so I knew everything was OK." Then he drove by Schurr High  School, where one of his four children is a student. "Everybody was out in the  field, so I figured it was OK, too," he said.  </P> <P> There were, indeed, no reports of serious damage or injuries in the epicenter  area. But Montebello and the surrounding communities are just west of Whittier,  where the region's last major earthquake caused extensive damage in 1987, and  the latest temblor brought back frightening memories for residents.  </P> <P> Two hours after Monday's quake and its sharp aftershock, Cora Valeriano kept  the door to the courtyard open at the De Paul Center, a 14-acre Montebello  compound for religious retreats.  </P> <P> The 1987 shaker severely damaged the center's brick chapel and gym and toppled  a marble statue of St. Vincent, whose head was severed when it hit the ground,  smashing through the glass door before rolling to a stop in front of  Valeriano's office.  </P> <P> "This one scared the heck out of us," she said Monday. "When it hit, I just  held onto the door frame. And as soon as it settled down, we ran outside."  </P> <P> Valeriano, a secretary at the center, spent the next hour outside with several  other employees, taking no chances. The facility was being used Monday for the  annual retreat of eighth graders from St. Bruno's, a Roman Catholic school in  Whittier. "These kids were through the worst of it the last time," Valeriano  said.  </P> <P> When Monday's 4.5-magnitude quake struck, the youngsters were starting a "trust  walk," an interpersonal exercise in which they close their eyes while being  escorted through the grounds by partners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under a Walkway  </P> <P> "We were under this walkway thing when it started shaking," said Rudy  Ceniseroz, 14, pointing to a structure between two buildings, supported by  columns.  </P> <P> "I tried to run because I thought it was going to fall," said classmate Chris  Gorny. "We immediately think, 'Get to a grassy area.' "  </P> <P> Teachers quickly gathered them on a lawn for a "count-off." After all 27  students were accounted for, the students fell into giggling banter -- boys  insisting that the girls were the only ones scared and the girls responding,  "Yeah, right."  </P> <P> "The kids are fine," concluded Judee Mattson, religious education director at  the school. "The adults are not so fine."  </P> <P> Reports were similar in surrounding communities. At the Uptown Preschool in  central Whittier, director Alice De Leon reported that excited students dived  under the tables, shouting: "Oh good, it's an earthquake!"  </P> <P> "People in our area have been more vigilant -- if not hypervigilant," said  Albert H. Arenowitz of the Intercommunity Child Guidance Center in Whittier,  which counseled several hundred people after the October, 1987, quake.  </P> <P> "They do their drills, they keep their flashlights at their bedside," he said.  "From a psychological point of view, if you are prepared, I think your anxiety  level won't be quite as high."  </P> <P> But several miles to the west, in Bell, Vickie Moon became one of the day's  minor casualties when she cut two fingers trying to hide under a counter in a  Purity liquor store and market.  </P> <P> "The last time, many friends were hurt in Whittier when things fell on them,"  she said. "This time we were the center. I was scared."  </P> <P> A block down Gage Avenue, 300-pound Jesse Gonzales stunned a dozen other people  washing their clothes at a laundry when he bolted out the door to safety. "I  was the first one out of there," he said. "They didn't think I could move that  fast."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mary Lou Fulton contributed to this story  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fermenta share trade halted TRADING in shares of Fermenta, the Swedish industrial group, and its finance company subsidiary, Independent, was halted yesterday on the Stockholm bourse. Fermenta said the suspension was due to the heavier-than-expected losses suffered by Independent in the last four months of 1991. The losses halved its share capital. Independent said it was in talks with a Swedish bank consortium and its chief shareholders. These include Bilspedition, the Swedish transport group, and the holding company, Industrivarden. The talks are aimed at how best to restore Independent to financial balance. A further statement will be made next Tuesday. Last September, share trading was suspended in Fermenta and Independent because of the financial deterioration of the companies. The chairman and chief executive of Fermenta subsequently resigned. A consortium of five banks agreed to extend a SKr4bn (Dollars 688.5m) credit line to Independent. For the first eight months of last year, Fermenta made a pre-tax loss SKr357m. It was just over two years ago that Fermenta announced plans to create a large finance company by merging Independent with Infina, another Swedish finance company, in a SKr1.8bn deal. The share price suspension represents another chapter in the crisis-strewn history of Fermenta. In 1986, the company, founded by Mr Refaat El-Sayed, found itself at he centre of Sweden's largest financial scandal. Mr Hans Dahlberg, the chief executive of Folksam, one of Sweden's largest insurance groups, resigned yesterday in the face of credit losses totalling SKr1bn last year. Forenings, the commercial bank, yesterday announced a financial loss of SKr935m due to credit losses of SKr2.8bn.</p>

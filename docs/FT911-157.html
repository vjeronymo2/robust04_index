			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Memotec takes up attack against BCE MEMOTEC Data of Montreal says a proxy fight to remove three of its directors is a thinly-disguised effort by telecommunications conglomerate BCE to gain control over Canada's overseas telephone monopoly. Mr William McKenzie, Memotec's chief executive, took full-page advertisements in Canadian newspapers yesterday, accusing BCE of seeking to undermine the 'independent direction' of its wholly-owned telephone subsidiary, Teleglobe Canada. 'This is not an issue about Memotec management,' Mr McKenzie said. 'The issue is control of Teleglobe.' Memotec announced yesterday that it earned CDollars 1.1m (USDollars 950,000m) in the first quarter, compared with a CDollars 4.1m loss a year earlier. Revenues rose by 9 per cent to CDollars 99.9m. The company ascribed the improvement mainly to better operating results from its telecommunications businesses and the restructuring of computer subsidiaries. BCE controls Bell Canada, the country's biggest domestic telephone company, and is also the controlling shareholder of telephone equipment maker Northern Telecom. BCE has a 31 per cent stake in Memotec, and has expressed its displeasure in the past over the company's management. However, the proxy fight was launched last week by Gordon Capital, a Toronto securities firm. BCE will have to abstain in the proxy vote, which is due to be taken at the annual meeting in Montreal this Thursday. BCE has an agreement with Memotec to vote only for its own nominees to the Memotec board. Gordon said last week that it owns no shares in Memotec. If its proxy fight is successful, however, its three nominees plus four directors representing BCE could outvote the rest of the board. Memotec's other large shareholders have not yet said how they will vote. They include the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public-sector pension plan, and the Ontario municipal employees' pension fund. In its proxy solicitation, Gordon criticised Memotec for expanding into high-technology businesses by using cash mainly from Teleglobe. Mr McKenzie called Gordon's move an 'ambush' which gives inadequate time for shareholders or management to consider their positions. Memotec has hinted it might seek to postpone Thursday's meeting as part of its defensive tactics.</p>

The ROSSIISKIE VESTI Newspaper features a commentary on  these  speeches headlined "to find reasonable correlation between speed  of reforms and real social price for it." "Let us put it  bluntly: the government does not suggest any backtrack from the  previous policy," the newspaper stresses.    "The strategic course for creating an effective market  economy must be preserved, but the task of cutting social price  for reforms moves to the foreground at this stage." At the same  time, the newspaper criticises the federal budget of the Finance  Ministry, which was approved, in principle, by a meeting of the  government, expressing doubts at "feasibility" of some of its  indicators for 1994.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes in the same vein,  noting that the budget was adopted with "a black hole." The  newspaper's commentary claims that "the pumping of worthless  money into the economy will not check the slump (of production).  It will only destroy the consumer market which has just  emerged. Then, there will be the only way out -- a state of  emergency. This way of developments is not the worst one."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries a summary of the above  speeches under the headline "President's State of the Nation  Message to Russian Parliament is Platform for Accord."    It singles out Yeltsin's words that, following the message,  "long-awaited outlines of a general approach to tackling  economic problems" start emerging and that consequences of the  political amnesty adopted by the lower chamber of parliament on  ringleaders of abortive coups in August 1991 and October 1993  are fraught with the danger of new confrontation.    A commentary on the amnesty written by A. Golts and  published  by the same newspaper claims that the release of the Lefortovo  prison inmates "is no threat to political stability."    Giving a summary of the president's and premier's speeches,  the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper stresses that "Viktor  Chernomyrdin's report absorbed the best economic goals."    But it is not quite clear, the newspaper adds, whether the  present government can realise them. A series of extracts from  Yeltsin's speech published by the newspaper starts with the  following words: "I fully understand how contraversial the  decision (on political amnesty) taken by the lower house is and  how hastily it was carried out."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA (opposition newspaper) gives a digest of  +the report on social and economic situation in Russia compiled  by the Russian Statistics Committee, which was circulated in the  Kremlin among participants in the enlarged meeting of the  government. Its data on the continued slump of the Gross  Domestic Product in Russia are described with one word  "evalanche."    The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Radovan  Karadzic, leader of Bosnian Serbs and vice-president of the  Union of Serb Writers.    Russia's initiative to settle the conflict in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, he says, "helped to overcome confrontation with  NATO, and Russia, I believe, entered, thanks to this, the world  political arena as an independent force which should be reckoned  with." "We experience an unusual inthusiasm and gratitude for  what Russia has done for Serbia," he added.    The trud newspaper features the last part of the memoirs by  former commander of the Soviet Navy Nikolai Kuznetsov who  personally knew Stalin, under the headline "Stalin's Death."    The PRAVDA newspaper prints a photograph from the front  cover  of the West German Magazine SPIEGEL with the inscription  "Stalin's Second Death," depicting him together with Vladimir  Lenin inside the mausoleum (magazine's correspondent used a  hidden photo camera to take a snapshot).    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Deputy  Prosecutor- General Vladimir Kravtsov, saying that he "has no  doubts about guilt of Khasbulatov, Rutskoy and their aides."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA devotes an article to the world's first  cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who would have turned 60 on March 9.</p>

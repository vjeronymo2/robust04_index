Speaking to  approximately 300 participants at the European congress of his  organization in Bonn on Saturday [19 February], Brunner said  that the 12 June German election to the European Parliament  makes up for the referendum that was not permitted to be held on  Maastricht. Brunner, former chairman of the Bavarian Free  Democratic Party of Germany, told the Federal Government that  its policy is not accepted by the people. The government must  again learn to represent national interests, he said.    Brunner supports a Europe that is the fatherland of the  fatherlands in the spirit of Charles de Gaulle. His party is  against bureaucratic centralism in Brussels and is for a Europe  of the free peoples and equal rights, he stressed.    The Bonn meeting discussed the ticket for the European  elections, which is to be headed by Brunner. According to its  own information, the "Association of Free Citizens" currently  has approximately 120 members. Erwin Wickert, former German  ambassador to the PRC, participated in the conference, which was  chaired by Deputy Party Chairman Professor Karl Schachtschneider  (Nuremberg).</p>

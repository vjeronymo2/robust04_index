			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Reynolds sparks discord: Former PM attacked for revelations on peace process The Irish Republic's new coalition was yesterday embroiled in an immediate controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, revealed details of confidential negotiations between London and Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. His comments drew immediate criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds also said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. According to Mr Reynolds the all-Ireland body is among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, meets Mr John Bruton, the republic's new prime minister, in London next week. Mr Reynolds's comments are widely seen as a bid to sour Mr Bruton's relations with the unionists and demonstrate to nationalists that it was the outgoing Fianna Fail led coalition that had secured concessions on cross-border bodies. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP, accused Mr Reynolds of 'destructive dialogue' and seeking to weave a web of suspicion by giving the IRA the impression that an 'embryo united Ireland' was within reach. Mr Peter Robinson, East Belfast MP for the hardline Democratic Unionists, called on Mr Major to provide 'the clearest clarification' of the state of negotiations, warning the government that it was 'heading for confrontation' with the unionist community in Northern Ireland. British officials and Sinn Fein will meet for more exploratory dialogue at Stormont today when the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again.</p>

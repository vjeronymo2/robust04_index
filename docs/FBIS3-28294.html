			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Takashi Sakamoto, member of YOMIURI SHIMBUN </F> Economic Department]    [Text] With the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit close at  hand, Japan and the United States continue to have  confrontations over the issue of setting "quantitative objective  criteria" at Japan-U.S. economic framework talks for insurance  services. That is because Japan is exercising strong  precautions against the possibility that the United States may  use the criteria as a numeric target in one sidedly forcing  Japan to accept foreign-affiliated companies, which want to make  inroads into the Japanese market.    With the summit just around the corner, the United States is  strengthening its offense. Jeffrey Garten, under secretary of  commerce, showed his hard-line stance, saying: "We have no  intention to accept a bad agreement." Richard Gephardt,  Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, said:  "Numeric targets are needed (to liberate the Japanese market).  The targets will become pressure as we seek changes in Japan."  He is preparing to submit to Congress a bill designed to impose  sanctions against Japan by onesidedly setting a target and  thereby forcing Japan to liberate its markets, in case the  comprehensive talks fail.    Together with automobiles and auto parts and government  procurement, the insurance issue is one of the "three priority  areas" which the United States is trying to settle in the  summit, slated for 11 February. However, establishment of the  "quantitative objective criteria" is the largest cause of the  deadlock in negotiations for insurance services. Giving  considerations to Japan's strong resistance, the United States  is showing its flexible stance, saying that the "criteria is not  accompanied by retaliation against Japan or a deadline for  achieving goals."    However, when it comes to details of negotiations, the  United States is trying to force Japan to increase the share of  foreign- affiliated companies in the Japanese market to the  level of their market share in other industrialized countries.  In addition, it is rather obvious that the U.S. aim is to use  the "quantitative objective criteria" as a lever to open up the  Japanese markets.    Saying that an introduction of the numeric targets,  including  market share, runs counter to market liberalization and is  linked to controlled trade, Japan is maintaining its stance that  "establishment of the objective criteria, which is linked to an  introduction of numeric targets, is absolutely unacceptable."    Some Finance Ministry officials are criticizing the United  States, saying: "It will harm consumers' interests if the  government issues an administrative guidance and recommends the  consumer buy insurance from foreign-affiliated companies."  "Establishment of the numeric targets is a lazy man's idea which  takes no account of corporate efforts."    Japan is taking precautions against and showing its almost  allergic reaction to the idea of setting numeric targets because  it has gone through bitter experiences, such as the Japan-U.S.  semiconductor accord.    Japan agreed that it would exert efforts to increase the  share of foreign-made semiconductors to 20 percent in Japanese  market. However, the U.S. Government and Congress, thinking that  it was an "international pledge," were obsessed with this figure  and forced Japan to buy more U.S.-made semiconductors while  hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan  if it fails to reach the target.    Moreover, Japan is opposing the U.S. negotiations stance,  which onesidedly concludes that "Japan is a closed market."    Certain improvement has been made for individual items of  the  insurance services. Among other things, Japan explained its  plan to study various issues -- including the possibilities of  securing transparency in issuing government approvals or  licenses for new products and in setting insurance rates, and  introducing the broker system, in which brokers can represent  consumers to sign contracts with insurance companies -- from  the viewpoint of reforming the overall system.    The Finance Ministry will stop its administrative practice  of  convoying Japanese industries and try to liberate the insurance  market through easing government regulations.    However, the United States is asking Japan to delay  liberalization of the so-called "third field" -- market for  treatment of injuries and diseases, such as "cancer" and  "Alzheimer's disease" insurance -- because American companies  have an advantage over Japanese companies in this field in the  Japanese market. Japan is strongly opposing this U.S. demand,  saying: "It is obviously contradictory to call for a delay in  liberalization of the only area where it has vested interests."    Opinions of both countries over Japan's "business  practices only among affiliated companies" are still divided  with no sign of finding a meeting point.    As a U.S. problem, Japan points out the licensing system  issue, which varies from state to state. In addition, Japan  also pointed out the following problems: discriminatory measures  against other countries in the fields of government procurement  and reinsurance practices, a clause which requires corporate  executives to be U.S. citizens, and other discriminatory  measures against foreign- affiliated companies. It seems that  much more time is needed before both countries can find  substantial solutions to these problems.    As was the case in setting objective criteria, mutual  distrust underlies the rough going in the negotiations.  However, the keywords of reaching an agreement are "transparent  market that is open to domestic and foreign companies,"  "conditions of fair competition," and "expansion of consumers'  choice." The Governments of Japan and the United States are  required to iron out the differences.</p>

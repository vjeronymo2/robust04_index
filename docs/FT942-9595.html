			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Japanese withhold vital Eurotunnel cash Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, is on the brink of another financial crisis this weekend because its Japanese bank creditors have contributed little of vital new financing with only one working day before Monday evening's deadline for Pounds 700m of loans to be raised. Because of the gravity of the situation, Mr Pen Kent, a Bank of England director, is intervening to try to persuade the banks to contribute their share of the funds. The Bank is talking both to the banks directly and to Japan's central bank. 'We are not going to let this vital transport project go down for the want of a couple of yen,' a UK government official said. European bankers said they were considering whether to ask Mr John Major, the prime minister, to write to his Japanese counterpart, Mr Tsutomu Hata. A senior Whitehall official said: 'The government is ready for a bit of arm twisting with the Japanese banks.' The tunnel operator needs to raise Pounds 700m in new senior bank debt from its syndicate of 200 banks prior to launching a rights issue to raise a similar amount. However, it has received commitments for just Pounds 500m, largely because of the absence of contributions from Japanese banks. The new funds are needed largely because of the delayed start to services through the tunnel which means that the company will receive less revenue in the next couple of years than was originally hoped. In order for the financing to go ahead, a 90 per cent majority of banks also has to agree to change bank covenants, since the company is currently in breach of its borrowing agreements. It currently has 80 per cent of votes in favour and needs positive responses from 'just a dozen more banks', a banker said. However, the fund-raising exercise cannot succeed without theparticipation of the Japanese banks because to date they have contributed 23 per cent of the existing Pounds 6.8bn commercial bank facilities, far more than banks from any other country. Their ability to make new loans is constrained by the erosion of their capital caused by the prolonged Japanese recession. Eurotunnel's directors will be made aware of the loan shortfall at a board meeting tomorrow. A banker said: 'There is no chance of all the money being received by Monday evening.' He added that Eurotunnel would face some very difficult choices if the bank finance has not been raised by the end of the week. 'Directors could try and make do with less than the full Pounds 700m. But that would not be easy.'</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Eggar seeks power price cut THE electricity industry must cut domestic bills to reflect cheaper coal prices, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday. Mr Eggar, speaking during a visit to Rufford and Ollerton collieries in Nottinghamshire, said it was vital that consumers were given the benefit of any deal between the electricity producers and British Coal. He was confident British Coal would be able to produce coal at prices that would benefit electricity consumers. 'The challenge that faces this and other pits is to reduce their costs to produce coal competitively,' he added. 'It is a challenge I am convinced British Coal can meet.' Mr Eggar said it was important for British Coal to be privatised without delay. This meant that it must agree contracts to sell coal to the electricity industry as soon as possible. These contracts would determine how many British Coal pits would survive, Mr Eggar added. He would not confirm rumours that the government was about to negotiate an agreement between British Coal and the electricity industry. He saw a role for the government as a 'facilitator'. The government, British Gas, the regulatory body Ofgas and 11 of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales are to set up an independent Energy Savings Trust to promote the efficient use of energy, Andrew Slade writes. The initiative promised in the Conservatives' general election manifesto was announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. His department said the government expected funding to come from the electricity industry and consumers. a</p>

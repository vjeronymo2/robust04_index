			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Travel: A wild west where dolphins play and life itself was born - Julia Berney marvels at Shark Bay, an Australian outpost so remote that special tax rebates compensate for the isolation bloody dunes, turquoise lagoons, bottle-glass sea, indigo submarine meadows. Down there, you could fraternise with a dolphin, follow the stromatolite road to an evolutionary time warp, and maybe spot a mermaid - in one day if you hurried. But everyone said: 'Nobody rushes round here.' I saw my mermaid only from the aircraft, so she looked no bigger than a slug. She is the dugong, or sea cow, aquatic cousin of elephants. Sailors seeing voluptuous, lactating females dreamed up mermaids. The dugong's face must have been a let-down; but then, sailors were at sea a long time. Below stretched prongs of tree-less land and seawater evaporation tanks. Pilot Jeff dumped Saturday's newspapers under a bush, for the solar salt township of Useless Loop. Then we buzzed over Dirk Hartog Island, looking down onto circling sharks and loggerhead turtles. Hartog, in 1616, was the first of several mariners who were not overly impressed with Australia's westernmost point. Place names reflect their frustration: Hopeless Reach, Useless Inlet, Disappointment Loop, Mystery Beach. The dearth of fresh water confounded them. The log of a French captain named Hamelin recorded 'gloomy shores' and 'miserable sterility.' The mainland approach also looks unpromising. The coastal highway's only focal points for hundreds of kilometres are roadhouses surrounded by bottle trees - dead shrubs adorned with empties, the art of the litter lout glittering like apocalyptic Christmas trees. But turning to Peron Peninsula, which bisects Shark Bay, you suddenly wake up to its weird beauty. Side tracks lead to mangrove lagoons where Siberian snipe come to holiday; or to mysterious blue holes on empty beaches where you can float Dead Sea-fashion; or to stark, treacherous viewpoints like Eagle Bluff where I watched a manta ray fly like a carpet through clear green water. Far out in the bay, something huge was thrashing, silently. Nobody knew what it was. The thrill of mystery remained. Birridas - gypsum claypans - pockmark the land, rising and falling with the tides. They look solid but a vehicle easily breaks the crust, sinking into ooze. Only samphire grows on the claypans; mispronunciation of the plant's name has given birridas the evocative name 'sandfire flats.' Emus crossed the road, and snakes; Shark Bay's 98 reptiles include the deadly king brown. Before the little town of Denham, we crossed the 26th Parallel. This is north-west Australia's frontier, above which special tax rebates compensate for the isolation. Remote, yet cosy, Denham feels like a Cornish fishing village gone tropical beside a tepid sea. It possesses a supermarket called Tradewinds, a Silverchain Bush Nursing Post visited by the flying doctor, and a shell museum run by a Filipino lady. A notice advertises: 'Many things to be gazed' for 'Dollars 1 each person, great or small.' After dark, barefoot and careless on the jetty, I trod in squid ink. In the night water were beautiful sea snakes, bites from which can kill in 30 seconds. Samoan girls were catching squid by the bucketful, screaming in the wind as every one spurted its last indelible defence across the decking. I wore my black feet all next day. A note in my room begged: 'Please use desalinated water sparingly to conserve the subsidised supply and avoid severe penalty charges to us.' Even in a cosmopolitan country, Denham's mix is rich. It includes Maoris and other Polynesians, Chinese, Mauritians, European allsorts, Aborigines - in fact, almost every ethnic group, plus hybrids - and the racial harmony positively glows. This was not just my outsider's rosy impression. It was confirmed by Denham-born Rod Drummond, who labels himself happily as 'bitsa'  -bits of this, bits of that, chiefly Aboriginal, Malay, Melanesian and Norwegian - and thanks his mixed blood for 'letting me evaluate both sides of an argument - see the black and white views.' The melting pot began in the mid-19th century. European pastoralists arrived  -sheep tolerate artesian water too salty for human consumption - and then pearling attracted the Asians. Once, Denham had a pearl-shell road. Now, an industry that died has been resuscitated. From Monkey Mia, I reached the pearl farm by glass-bottomed boat. Green turtles lumbered below; long-tom fish tailwalked the ripples like big silver pencils. A thunderhead was dropping rain that evaporated halfway down the sky. Pearls are sold in a floating hut. The attraction of paying wholesale export prices (roughly half those in jewellers' shops) seemed to be equalled by the romance of buying pearls directly above the oyster lines. The farm cultivates white and black pearls, but you can also buy golden and cream pearls that develop from the yellow nacre typical of Shark Bay oysters. Monkey Mia, named after a boat, is famed for the bottlenose dolphins which for three decades have swum inshore - in water so shallow they almost beach themselves - to mingle with people. This is no stage-managed show. The dolphins are wild. Hand-feeding, which is very restricted, cannot be the sole attraction: dolphins sometimes give the fish back. Nobody, from animal behaviour researchers to tourists, doubts that the dolphins visit just for human contact. I sensed the dolphins observing me like hosts scrutinising a guest - an unexpected role reversal. I stroked their flanks but soon stopped clicking my fingers and making kissy noises: it seemed insulting. The dolphin smile is fixed and meaningless, but the intelligence in the eye shocks you into humility. Ranger Cilla Hurley captured the intimacy of the experience: 'When a pregnant dolphin lets me stroke her and feel the calf moving inside - that's most special.' A day after giving birth, the mother, showing remarkable trust, brings her baby to meet a crowd of strangers. South lies one of only two beaches in the world composed entirely of shells. In Lharidon Bight, a tiny bivalve multiplies unchecked because it enjoys hyper-salinity - caused by high evaporation from shallow water - which precludes its predators. Beach deposits accrete to form coquina limestone, which is chain-sawed into sparkling white building blocks. The Hamelin shell-block quarry borders the old telegraph station which, incongruously, sells Devonshire teas. On a dune stands the bleak grave of a baby cholera victim from 1898. The even lonelier beach grave of a drowned man overlooks the stromatolites. These are stony, mushroom-shaped columns built in shallow water by microscopic cyanobacteria. More primitive than plants, yet photosynthetic, they trap and bind sediment as they grow, painfully slowly. With its unique combination of favourable factors - such as highly mineralised water and restricted circulation - Hamelin Pool houses the world's only major colony of living stromatolites. Walking this reef is like journeying back into geological time for, metaphorically, these stromatolites are stepping stones from the beginning of evolution. For billions of years, cyanobacteria were pumping out oxygen when no higher life form existed to use it up. We are still recycling that oxygen stockpile. Stromatolites paved the way for all other life. Shark Bay's ecosystem is balanced finely. Stromatolites; rich desert wildlife; the world's most secure dugong population, 10,000 strong; island refuges of marsupials extinct elsewhere, and a sea boiling with fish - all merit protection. Shark Bay has now received a World Heritage listing. This antagonises many pastoralists, salt miners and commercial fishermen who, naturally, defend their livelihood. Tourism, too, might seem to conflict with conservation needs but Jim Matan, a regional tourism manager, told me of the 'new sensibilities' influencing potential development. Basically, Shark Bay is recognised as unique and precious, and anything that threatened the environment would be self-defeating for the tourism industry. Western Australia's department of conservation and land management is turning Peron pastoral station into a national park. Sheep were removed first; then, with more difficulty, foxes and feral cats - immigrants responsible largely for Australia's marsupial losses. At the end of the day, the juggling of interests in Shark Bay is mind-boggling. At the end of my last day there, however, my problem was staying awake. If I slept, I knew I would not rouse by 3am to reach the Overlander Roadhouse for the Greyhound, which hurtles through the night like a mobile dor mitory. Rod Drummond knew the local cure for flagging spirits. He took me to Peron, which has terrible beauty at sunset: the sand goes end-of-the-world red. Here, like a missionary in the cooking pot, I had to stand shoulder-deep in an old corrugated tank brimming with artesian water that comes up as hot as the hottest bath, then dry off in the tingly wind. The desert hydrotherapy worked. I never slept until the Greyhound reached the bottle trees, a minute past the Overlander, an hour before dawn. Denham is around 10 hours by road from Perth, or three hours by Western Airlines. From its tourist centre, Topday Safari Tours runs adventurous 4WD tours with guide Rod Drummond. Fishing tours and 4WD hire are available. The Old Pearler Restaurant serves excellent seafood. Julia Berney stayed at Denham Villas: self-contained units a stone's throw from the sea.</p>

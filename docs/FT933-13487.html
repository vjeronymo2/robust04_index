			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: Dublin Theatre BILLY Roache made his name as a playwright at London's Bush Theatre with a trilogy about his native Wexford. The Cavalcaders, commissioned by the Abbey Theatre for their small stage, The Peacock, is his first play to open in Ireland. The Cavalcaders are a quartet of barber-shop singers who work together by day in a Wexford cobblers and perform in local bars by night, dressed in matching red dinner jackets. Roache's interest in memory - is indicated before the play starts by his familiar device of filling the auditorium with vintage pop music, most significantly, the chorus 'Can't Get Used to Losing You'. As the play opens, a glum figure in a raincoat, Terry, is handing over his shoe repair business to a younger man, Rory, who plans to modernise it. The set, by Frank Conway, is highly evocative: a battered Victorian cobbler's bench, massive old machinery, dirty coffee mugs and dusty, string-tied bundles of shoes dating back years. In these unlikely surroundings Terry relives the heyday of the quartet before the departure of the other two members, Josie and Ted. Sudden changes of lighting (designed by Trevor Dawson) indicate leaps back in time. We see Terry at the age of 44 brutally ending his affair with Nuala, a warm and vulnerable 22-year-old, recently released from the 'funny farm'. He would be better suited to the more mature Breda, who drops in to listen to rehearsals, but he has never recovered from his wife running off with another man. It takes some time to realise that Terry, easily the dullest of the four men, is actually the central character. Rory and Ted stick in the mind only as 'the good looking blond one' and 'the one who plays the piano'. Rather unexpectedly, Ted runs off with Rory's wife in a sketchy sub-plot. However, all three are overshadowed by the fourth member of the quartet, Josie, a jaunty provincial corner-boy who dies young, presumably from cancer. Josie is played by Billy Roache, his thin angular frame, foxy face and receding hair giving credence to this quick-witted, tabloid-reading, pint-drinking chancer. But that Josie is so likeable and also 'doomed' distracts from the central drama, which, unfortunately, is Terry's. His rejection of Nuala led, he believes, to her suicide. But he is also mourning the disappearance of the community he knew as a child, when The Cavalcaders were the pride of the neighbourhood. Nuala is played with heart-aching naivety by Marie Mullen, and Breda (who eventually ends up living with Terry) is given a sad dignity by Aisling O'Sullivan. But ultimately the women contribute little, as they are seen only as Terry's girlfriends. For all the technical achievement of the writing, the play is disappointing, and oddly unsatisfying. Terry, a selfish emotional cripple, never grows or changes. There is little or no sense of the claustrophobia of the dead-end small town which electrified the Wexford trilogy, nor, apart from Josie, any truly memorable characters. It is not often an author upstages his own play, but Billy Roache has done it here. See it for his dazzling performance, but don't expect too much else. City of Angels, the musical which was to close early on August 7, has won a reprieve and will continue at London's Prince of Wales Theatre. Written by Cy Coleman and Larry Gelbart, it was enthusiastically reviewed when it opened in March. But it suffered from a lack of advance bookings and the early closure was announced last week. A surge of interest followed and Angels has been playing to packed houses. Prince of Wales. (071) 839 5987</p>

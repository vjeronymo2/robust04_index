			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Inchcape buys 15% of Gestetner INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, is to buy a 15 per cent share of Gestetner Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor, plus an option to raise its stake to 25 per cent. Inchcape is buying the initial stake for Pounds 37.9m from Chiltern Capital, an Australian company which took control of Gestetner in 1986. Chiltern has already sold 29.9 per cent of Gestetner to Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer. Gestetner is the world's largest independent distributor of office equipment, using the brand names of Gestetner, Nashuatec and Rex Rotary. Much of it is produced by major Japanese manufacturers, principally Ricoh and Mita. It also derives substantial revenue from service and supplies. Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner's chairman and chief executive and a major shareholder in Chiltern, will give up executive responsibilities immediately, although he will continue as chairman until an independent successor is appointed. Inchcape will have two directors on the board and Ricoh will have three. Chiltern will sell its remaining 15 per cent stake in the group to Inchcape for 129p a share. Inchcape is also paying Pounds 2.9m for an option on convertible unsecured loan stock, enabling it to raise its stake in Gestetner to 25 per cent on or before July next year. If Inchape exercises the option, it will have paid about Pounds 80m for its 25 per cent stake. Last year Gestetner made pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.2m on sales of Pounds 900m. However, the company warned yesterday that conditions in Europe, where it earned 55 per cent of its revenues, continued to deteriorate. It would therefore charge Pounds 45m against first-half results to cover redundancies and asset writedowns. It said trading conditions in the rest of the world were pleasing. Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said: 'For a relatively modest investment at a very acceptable price, we have obtained an important strategic stake in a core business which has considerable growth potential.' Inchcape funded the purchase by a Pounds 40.4m vendor placing of shares at 570p each. Inchcape's shares yesterday closed 8p lower at 583p, while Gestetner's rose 7p to 130p.

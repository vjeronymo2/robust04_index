			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Cost of 'peace dividend' is lost jobs, says ILO Hopes of a 'peace dividend' for jobs by converting defence industries to civilian manufacturing have proved depressingly wide of the mark, according to the International Labour Organisation. In a report to its metal trades committee, now meeting in Geneva, the United Nations agency says the most striking part of the long-awaited peace dividend after the fall of communism has been massive job losses in the armaments industries on both sides of the old Iron Curtain. The US, the world's biggest arms producer, has made redundant 400,000 mostly well-paid and skilled workers over the past three years. Roughly the same number have lost their jobs in the former Soviet Union. In both cases the number is expected to treble over the next three years, the ILO warns. In France and Germany, employment in defence industries is set to shrink by up to a quarter. Smaller arms producers such as Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Slovakia have also registered big job losses. 'Each direct job that is lost may lead to the loss of two or three indirect jobs in other sectors,' the ILO report notes. Far from finding equivalent jobs in the civilian industry, most of those made redundant share the fate of former steel and car workers in facing long-term unemployment, unstable jobs and reduced incomes. 'In the US, the major difficulty is that many of those affected are too skilled, too specialised, overpaid and too old (many between 40 and 60) to find new jobs,' the report says. This marks a painful contrast with estimates made before the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989 of net job gains from defence conversion. One UN study forecast a ratio of at least two jobs created for every one lost. Converting arms manufacture to civilian production will mean 'hardships and problems of adjustment' whatever the strategy adopted, the ILO says. However, most of the successes so far have had 'a helping hand from governments'. US experience suggests the ingredients for success include far-sighted planning by management in co-operation with the workforce and public authorities, economic incentives to develop new products and retool factories, and retraining of management and workers. Conversion assistance is expensive. The US will have to earmark some Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) for this purpose over the next five years, the ILO says. In the former socialist countries, it argues, the key to successful conversion lies in privatisation, accompanied by greater incentives for workers and managers to produce for the civilian economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Austrian Companies Concentrate on East </F> Europe"]    [Text] Vienna -- Austrian companies have increased  massively their investments in East Europe. According to a  study by the Economic Research Institute (Wifo), Austrian  expenditures on projects in the East were even higher than  investments in the European Union.    Thus, the Austrians invested 3 billion schillings in the  reform states in the first half of 1993 but only 2.7 billion in  the European Union.    Of Austria's total foreign investment of 59 billion  schillings, about 25 percent went to East Europe. In 1990 the  share was 10 percent.    A total of 50 percent of direct Austrian investments abroad  were made in the European Union, with Germany topping the list  at 20 percent. The share of investments is 9 percent in the  European Free Trade Association [EFTA] and 12 percent in the  United States. Since 1989, investments in the EFTA countries  have dropped by 50 percent.    The significance of Austrian investments is generally  increasing. They rose from 1.3 to 3 billion schillings in the  first half of the 1980's to 11 billion schillings in 1989. In  1992 they reached a level of 21.5 billion schillings. According  to the Wifo analysis, a decline occurred in 1993 because of the  bad economic situation.    Whereas the activities of Austrian companies abroad have  increased strongly, the nation's attractiveness for foreign  investors has declined. In the 1970's, a total of 0.8 percent  of all foreign investments by OECD states were made in Austria;  in the 1980's the share dropped to 0.4 percent.    The Wifo cited the pending decision on Austrian membership  in  the European Union as the major reason. Thus, Austria was not  able to participate in the investment boom in West Europe before  the introduction of the single market.    Overall investments by foreign companies in Austria are  currently standing at 69 billion schillings. About 60 percent  of the money comes from European Union states, with Germany  accounting for two-thirds.    EFTA states accounted for 20 percent of the investments, and  the United States 7 to 8 percent. Direct investments by Eastern  states (2 percent) are insignificant. The remaining 10 percent  were invested by Japanese companies.</p>

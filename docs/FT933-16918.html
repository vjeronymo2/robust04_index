			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Observer: Hot tip However much the sun may shine on Britain during the rest of the summer, certain of the Church of England's more traditionally minded members must be banking on a far sunnier one next year. The reason lies in their belief about the Almighty's attitude to the controversial Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, who in his past days as a professor of theology has waxed a touch sceptical about the virgin birth and the resurrection. Three days after he was consecrated as bishop in York Minister in 1984, the building was stuck by lightning and badly damaged by fire. The traditionalists decided it was a sign of God's disapproval of the appointment. If so, with the 68-year-old Jenkins under notice to retire in 12 months time, heaven should surely turn on the heat benignly in celebration.</p>

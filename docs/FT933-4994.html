			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / EC to probe antitrust allegations against Microsoft EC competition authorities are investigating allegations of antitrust violations against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company. According to Microsoft, the EC investigation stems from a complaint filed on June 30 by Novell, the leading computer networking software company and Microsoft's arch-rival. The allegations follow abortive secret merger talks between the two companies last year. The Directorate General for Competition (DG4) is currently 'assessing the merits of Novell's allegations', Microsoft said. 'We believe Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner and we look forward to presenting our evidence to the Directorate-General,' the company added. The EC antitrust investigation mirrors a similar probe by the US Justice Department, which recently began a review of information gathered over three years by the US Federal Trade Commission. The Justice Department intervened after the FTC was deadlocked twice on whether to take action against Microsoft. While under FTC investigation, Microsoft made an offer to acquire Novell. In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading has also looked into charges of anticompetitive activities by Microsoft. However, the OFT is now believed to have suspended its investigation in view of DG4's involvement. Each company now accuses the other of having failed to negotiate in good faith. Novell is bitter about what it sees as Microsoft's use of the protracted merger talks to slow its attempts to compete in the PC operating market. Microsoft says it was Novell that dragged the talks out and finally called them off. Novell acknowledged that it and 'other significant software companies' have been involved in discussions with DG4 about Microsoft. The complaint is understood to charge that Microsoft has deliberately attempted to limit competition in the market for personal computer operating systems. Microsoft, whose DOS operating system is used on about 90 per cent of all PCs, offers PC manufacturers discounts if they agree to pay an operating system licence fee for all of the computers of a particular model sold. Novell claims that this 'per-processor licensing' arrangement effectively excludes competition from its alternative DR-DOS program. Novell is also understood to charge Microsoft with illegal 'tying' of sales of one product to another. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has previously denied both of these charges.</p>

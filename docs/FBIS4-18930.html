			<p>BFN     [Text] In Bosnia, the situation appears to be quieter in  the region of Gorazde following yesterday's second NATO air  strike on Serb tanks shelling the Muslim enclave. Bosnians  welcome this show of force.    Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate of European  affairs said this morning [on Radio Monte Carlo] that the  bombing of Serb positions should be extended if the latter were  to continue their attacks on the Gorazde safe haven. The carrot  and the stick must be used, Lamassoure added.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Life Sciences disappoints with 12% rise Life Sciences International, the laboratory equipment company headed by LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland, disappointed the City yesterday with a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 23m for 1993. Analysts had been expecting nearer Pounds 26m and the shares fell 15p to 140p. Excluding acquisitions, profits were down 11 per cent, the first fall since the current management team was brought in by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, almost seven years ago. Sir Christopher, who described the setback as 'more of a belch than a hiccup' said the company now had 'a lot to prove'. '1993 was the year in which the continuing worldwide recession had a significant impact on the laboratory equipment markets, which up to that point had appeared relatively recession-resistant.' He said the US market grew broadly in line with inflation but that France, Germany, Italy and Canada were all 'very disappointing'. The UK was the only 'robust' market. Earnings per share rose by just 3 per cent to 9.4p (9.1p) but the dividend is up 10 per cent to 3.9p (3.55p) via a proposed final of 2.5p (2.35p). Sales from continuing operations rose 16 per cent to Pounds 129m but excluding the translation effect of the stronger dollar growth slowed to just 3 per cent. Trading profits from continuing operations fell from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 17.5m, after a 25 per cent drop in the second half. Profits were hit by Pounds 1.6m of provisions covering settlement of a longstanding lawsuit and write-downs on the value of demonstration equipment in the US. Sir Christopher said that management had taken steps to improve financial controls, particularly in the US. Acquisitions during the year contributed trading profits of Pounds 6.16m on sales of Pounds 25.5m. Most of this related to Labsystems, the Finnish pipette maker acquired for Pounds 33.5m in June. Sir Christopher said that despite the setback the acquisition of Labsystems had made management 'more confident about our position in the market than at any time in the past'. Labsystems brought the group a strong presence in continental Europe, the former eastern bloc and Japan. COMMENT Shareholders in Life Sciences, Sir Christopher Bland's other company, have done rather less well than investors in LWT. While LWT shares have provided a compound annual rate of return of more than 60 per cent over the past four years Life Sciences' have offered little more than 10 per cent. Over the past two years the shares have lagged the market by about 40 per cent and yesterday's figures justified investors' caution. The top management was clearly surprised by the impact of recession on the Continent and must also take some of the blame for lax financial controls in the US, though Labsystems looks an increasingly good acquisition. The current year has started well and assuming profits of about Pounds 28m the rating drops to just 13. But, as Sir Christopher admits, the company now has a lot to prove.</p>

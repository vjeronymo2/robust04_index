			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Beverley falls to Pounds 56,000 BEVERLEY Group, the engineering concern formerly known as Petrocon, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 518,000 to Pounds 56,000 in an eventful six months to the end of June. Losses for the whole of 1991 amounted to Pounds 2.57m. In March, Petrocon acquired Beverley and in April it failed to acquire James Wilkes in a hostile bid. And this week the High Court approved a capital reconstruction involving the reduction of share capital and the writing off of the share premium account to eliminate a deficit on profit and loss reserves of Pounds 6.68m. In addition the 12 1/2 p shares have been divided into ordinary shares of 7 1/2 p, dealings in which are expected to start today and deferred share of 5p, which have been cancelled. Turnover increased to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 9.2m) as a result of the Beverley acquisition. Earnings per share came out at 0.16p against 1.18p and the interim dividend is being passed. There was a payment of 0.625p last time.</p>

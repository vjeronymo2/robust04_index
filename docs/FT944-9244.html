			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Asset sales hold Volvo on course The rapid drive back to big profits this year by Volvo's car and truck divisions may have caught most of the attention, but a significant contribution to the Swedish manufacturer's nine-month surplus of SKr12.7bn (Dollars 1.75bn) came from a non-core asset disposal programme that has only just begun. The net gain on asset sales in the first nine months contributed SKr4.2bn - or nearly one-quarter of the pre-tax profit - as Volvo began a strategy of focusing on core motor vehicle operations, adopted following the collapse late last year of a plan to merge with France's Renault. These sales helped produce a marked strengthening of Volvo's financial position over the period. Net debt has been driven down from SKr14.5bn at the end of last year to SKr700m at the end of September, while the group's equity-to-assets ratio has risen from 21 per cent to 30 per cent. This has put Volvo well on the road to achieving the financial strength it needs to underpin the long-term development of its car and truck businesses, now that it is not sharing costs with Renault. The target set for the assets disposal programme by Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, earlier this year was an equity-to-assets ratio of 50 per cent. That target looks as though it will be comfortably exceeded as the biggest plums in the Volvo assets pie have yet to be sold. This year, Volvo sold its interests in Cardo, an industrial holding group, to the Wallenberg empire for a capital gain of SKr2.6bn; Custos, an investment company; Norway's Saga Petroleum; Cultor, a Finnish sugar producer; and Hertz, the car hire group. Still to come, however, are Volvo's residual holding in Renault; its wholly-owned subsidiary BCP, a food and beverages producer; its 27.5 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies by sales; and its Swedish investment bank Alfred Berg. At the recently-announced privatisation price for Renault, Volvo's 20 per cent holding is worth around FFr8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). At present market prices, Volvo's share in Pharmacia is worth around SKr9bn. Volvo is wary of putting a price on its remaining assets, but some estimates have reckoned the BCP, Pharmacia and Alfred Berg sales could raise between SKr40bn and SKr45bn gross. Mr Gyll wants to complete the disposal programme by the end of 1996. Under an agreement with the Swedish government, which is the other main shareholder in Pharmacia, Volvo cannot sell its holding in the company until January 1996 at the earliest. Most attention is therefore focused on how and when Volvo will sell off BCP, a company with turnover in the first nine months of SKr15bn and operating profits of SKr1.6bn. Volvo is understood to favour a direct sale to a corporate buyer, rather than a flotation. It says it has been in discussions with up to 30 potential buyers, although the only company so far to declare publicly its interest is Nestle, the Swiss food group. If there is no flotation, the most important issue will be whether BCP is split up or sold as a whole. Its main components are Swedish Match, a beverages division which makes Pripps beer and Ramlosa mineral water, and a food division with a big market share in Sweden. Volvo says price will dictate whether BCP is broken up or sold intact. When the asset disposals are complete, Volvo will certainly be a cash-rich motor company. Then it will have to show that it can achieve the same strong returns on the money in its car and truck operations as it did in its diversified investments.</p>

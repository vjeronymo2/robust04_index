			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Canada's poll focuses on social security CANADA'S two main political parties are struggling to reassure an increasingly confused electorate that they can maintain one of the world's most generous social security systems while making a significant dent in the budget deficit. Fiscal restraint and social security reform have emerged as the two key issues in the campaign for the October 25 general election. Both the ruling Progressive Conservative and the opposition Liberals have promised sizeable cuts in the deficit over the next four to five years. But they also acknowledge the need for sweeping reforms of the social security system, which makes up about two thirds of government spending. Both parties face the dilemma that any admission that spending cuts might include social security entitlements would amount to political suicide in the election campaign. The Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the deficit, which totalled CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.7bn) last year, within five years. The Liberals say they will cut the shortfall from 5.2 per cent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Mrs Kim Campbell, the prime minister, has been trying to repair the damage in recent days caused by her earlier remarks which raised questions about the Conservatives' commitment to the social security net. She said in a speech in Toronto that 'my approach does not cut social programmes. It fixes them.' Economists have dismissed the barrage of budget deficit targets as meaningless without significant cuts in spending on programmes such as unemployment insurance, social welfare and healthcare. Both parties' scenarios also assume what economists consider as unrealistically strong economic growth to bolster tax revenues. The Globe and Mail newspaper said in an editorial yesterday that since both the Conservatives and the Liberals 'still deny any intent to cut spending, the choice before the voter is this: which party is it safe to hope is lying?' With less than a month to go in the campaign, the Tories have recently lost ground in public opinion polls to the Liberals as well as to the regional parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the right-wing Reform Party in western Canada.</p>

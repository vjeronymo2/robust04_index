			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Engineering sector pay freezes spread THE NUMBER of pay freezes in British engineering industry almost doubled at the end of last year to cover nearly a third of all settlements in the sector, according to the latest figures from the Engineering Employers Federation. The sharp rise recorded by the federation appears to confirm a new wave of pay freezes across British industry which was first noted by the Confederation of British Industry pay databank. It found that third of all employers introduced pay freezes during the final quarter of last year. The rise in the number of freezes suggests that the recent spate of industrial action, for example at the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde, is unrepresentative of the mood in industry as a whole. Pay analysts also say that the clampdown on pay rises in the public sector, announced in November, could be having a significant impact in the private sector. The federation found that 100 of the 346 settlements reported between November and January were pay freezes. A further 107 settlements, not included in the figures, were deferred, meaning no pay rise was awarded but that the position will be reviewed again during the course of the year. The period covered by the federation's figures came soon after Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism but also coincided with a string of large redundancy announcements from big employers. The increase in the percentage of freezes, which had been running at only about 12 per cent of settlements during last summer, indicates that anxiety about job security was a stronger influence on wage-bargainers than the possibility of higher inflation arising from Britain's withdrawal from the ERM. The average pay rise in the engineering sector for the three months from November to January, including the freezes but excluding the deferrals, was down to 2.47 per cent. The trend continues downward with the average settlement in the sector for January at only 2.39 per cent. Although that is still comfortably above the 1.7 per cent inflation figure for January it shows that strong downward pressure will remain on the government's annualised average earnings increase figure, which in December fell to 4.75 per cent the lowest figure for 25 years. The federation's figures also underline how diverse pay bargaining has become in the recession. For the three-month period, and excluding freezes and deferrals, nearly one fifth of all settlements were more than 4 per cent. Pay analysts such as Incomes Data Services and Industrial Relations Services emphasise that the majority of settlements are still above inflation. The IRS figure for settlements for the whole economy found an average increase of 3.6 per cent in the last quarter of last year.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia Denmark's Hafnia offers a salutary lesson for those small to medium-sized European insurers seeking to develop a 1990s strategy through co-operation with their rivals. A measure of its enfeeblement lies in the fact that even the diminished value of minority stakes in domestic competitor Baltica and Sweden's Skandia is more than twice its own market capitalisation. In attempting to convert the 33 per cent Baltica stake into a full merger, Hafnia has already been shown the door. The question is whether yesterday's suspension of its shares is the prelude to a successful conclusion of negotiations to establish a Scandinavian alliance with Norway's UNI Storebrand and Skandia. It remains hard to see why Skandia would want to pool resources with weaker brethren, or indeed, given its defensive voting structure, why it even has to contemplate the idea. Given the secrecy of the talks, though - and the politics and personalities involved - it would be silly to rule it out. Hafnia shareholders can only hope that tomorrow's results contain no unexpected nasties and that a cash buyer for the Baltica stake really is waiting in the wings. They would be doubtless further cheered by any news of a management shake-up.</p>

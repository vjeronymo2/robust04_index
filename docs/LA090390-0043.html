			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIA'S PRESIDENT FAILS TO EMBRACE PEACE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The president of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government, appearing to  reject key features of a new U.N. peace plan, said his government wants to  maintain the political and military status quo.  </P> <P> Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and  Pacific affairs, said Sunday that Vietnam had similar reservations in talks  with the United States last week.  </P> <P> Cambodian President Heng Samrin's comments came in a speech broadcast by the  state radio Saturday. The text was seen Sunday in Bangkok.  </P> <P> He said his government regarded the U.N. plan "as a basic document" for future  discussions and was ready to discuss it with the guerrillas in talks Indonesia  is arranging.  </P> <P> But he said with no elaboration that his government's stance "is to maintain  its status quo -- both politically and (militarily)."  </P> <P> The U.N. role, he said, should include verifying that agreements are  implemented and organizing new elections.  </P> <P> The three rebel groups fighting the government have expressed support for the  plan. Washington backs two of the guerrilla groups.  </P> <P> Vietnam voiced its reservations with the U.N. plan at a meeting at the United  Nations on Friday in which the United States tried to persuade it to back the  plan, Solomon said.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese, he said, had reservations about "issues related to military  arrangements and some of the administrative arrangements."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Amnesty International today accused communist guerrillas of  massacring more than 50 people in two train attacks in central Cambodia.  </P> <P> The international human rights group issued a statement urging the Cambodian  guerrilla coalition, which includes the communist Khmer Rouge, to ensure that  those involved in the killings "are removed from their positions and brought to  justice."  </P></p>

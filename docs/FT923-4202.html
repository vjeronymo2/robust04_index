			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There were 17,634 packages for the day, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. There was good general demand. Landed new season's Assams sold at about last levels although plainer sorts tended easier. Bright liquoring and good medium east African teas met good competition but prices were often lower with quality. Lesser mediums remained a strong feature and fully firm to 2p dearer. Brighter central African descriptions were dearer. Offshore; strong demand at fully firm rates. The highest price realised was 152p for a Rwanda pf. 1. Quotations: quality 160p, good medium 132p, medium 125p, low medium 80p.</p>

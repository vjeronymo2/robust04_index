			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIFFED TEEN SUES HER DATE IN 'STOOD UP!'  </P> <P> A 16-year-old girl sues her date when he stands her up for the prom. Is she a  heroine or a troublemaker? The answer is never in doubt in "Stood Up!," today's  simplistic "ABC Afterschool Special" (3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).  </P> <P> Lucy Deakins ("The Boy Who Could Fly") is high school junior and budding  photographer Becky, thrilled when senior gymnastics star Garrett (Spike  Alexander) asks her to his prom.  </P> <P> Becky earns money for a dress and on the big night eagerly waits for her  escort. And waits. She learns later that he took his old girlfriend.  </P> <P> What to do? What any red-blooded American would do these days, apparently --  sue.  </P> <P> In the teleplay, written by Peg Haller and Bo Schneider and directed by Aviva  Slesin, there's no question that Garrett is an arrogant jerk, but why have  Becky's photographer mentor (Jan Miner) comment, upon hearing who the girl is  going to the prom with, "Oh, an athlete" -- as if she's just stepped in  something? Cheap shot. She doesn't know him.  </P> <P> There is some mitigating humor -- Becky imagines she has to wear a scarlet "S"  for "Stood Up," and fantasizes getting revenge as a punk giantess in black  leather.  </P> <P> The pending lawsuit brings Becky notoriety, scorn and criticism. An alternative  -- a "trial" at school -- is suggested by a high school teacher (Geoffrey Owens  of "The Cosby Show").  </P> <P> That Becky wants reimbursement for the money she spent on an unreturnable dress  is reasonable. That Garrett scores with his peers by suggesting that guys have  to watch out for angry dates who file lawsuits is realistic. But it's a stretch  to think this is an issue of burning concern to teens.  </P></p>

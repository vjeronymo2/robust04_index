			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Italian police in pay protests TWO unions representing members of the Italian police protested yesterday outside the Ministry of Interior in Rome and organised a nationwide series of demonstrations to draw attention to pay and work conditions, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The protest coincided with public discontent among the para-military Carabinieri over their pay and conditions. This comes at a time when Italy's security forces are under increasing pressure to combat a rising wave of organised crime countrywide. In response, President Francesco Cossiga called a meeting of the defence, finance and interior ministers in an bid to prevent the grievances becoming an election issue. The police are concerned by a January decree which brought the pay of junior ranks of the Carabinieri up to levels of their inspectors. They have demanded a re-organisation of career structures and more pay, retaining the previous differential with the Carabinieri. The Carabinieri, meanwhile, has been angered by MPs' inability to approve the decree raising their pay and last week chose the occasion of a funeral of two colleagues, gunned down by Naples gangsters, to shout abuse at authorities.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez improves 27% in first half Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French construction and utilities group, raised net profit by 27 per cent in the first half of 1994 and predicted a 'significant' increase for the full year, agencies report from Paris. Net group profit in the first half was FFr434m (Dollars 82.04m) up from FFr342m in the first half of 1993. Operating profit rose to FFr1.53bn from FFr1.20bn, on consolidated revenues up 7 per cent at FFr48.33bn, from FFr45.11bn. Profit before exceptional items rose to FFr1.09bn, from FFr743m while cash flow advanced to FFr3.11bn, from FFr2.64bn. Construction activities swung to a profit of FFr1m from a loss of FFr139m. Lyonnaise-Dumez said the turnround came in spite of continued difficulty in the sector. Cash flow rose 20 per cent from the previous year. Profits from services and the parent company's activities fell to FFr616m from FFr768m, which the company said mainly reflected lower capital gains during the period. However, it said operating earnings rose 32 per cent. Results from other activities, including property, showed a loss of FFr183m, compared with a loss of FFr287m. Property losses alone narrowed to FFr186m from FFr330m. Lyonnaise des Eaux said it expected its full-year 1994 net attributable profit to improve on the FFr804m posted in 1993. 'The group's recovery is continuing and the net attributable profit for the full year 1994 should again improve significantly,' Lyonnaise des Eaux said. Paribas, the French bank, is to pay Italcementi FFr325m to settle a dispute about its sale of control of Ciments Francais to the Italian group. In return, Italcementi said it was renouncing all pre-emption rights on Paribas's stake in Ciments Francais.</p>

Black market traders in Beijing were Wednesday buying  dollars  for up to 8.87 yuan, compared with Tuesday's close of 8.696 yuan  on the so-called "united market," comprising five swap markets  linked earlier this month by computer ahead of a planned  nationwide exchange beginning April 1.    Banks were meanwhile offering just 8.48 yuan to the dollar.    Until the end of February, the rate on the street had  closely  tailed the swap market -- which has hovered around 8.7 yuan to  the dollar since the unification of the country's dual currency  system on January 1.

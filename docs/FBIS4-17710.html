			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 27, BNS -- "Too much concessions were  made to Poland" in the Lithuanian-Polish friendship and  cooperation agreement, says Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the  rightist opposition in the Lithuanian parliament.    The accord was signed in Vilnius Tuesday [26 April] by  Polish  President Lech Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas.    In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper,  Landsbergis noted, however, that the signing was an important  step in relations between the two countries. The opposition  leader said the shortcomings in the treaty were partly  compensated by Brazauskas' speech in the parliament after the  signing ceremony. "The president spoke about important things,  which should be understood as unwritten contents of the treaty,"  Landsbergis said.    The Lithuanian opposition earlier sharply criticized the  agreement and the Lithuanian Government for dropping a demand  that the annexation of Vilnius and its region by Poland in 1920  be mentioned in the treaty.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MCC accountants on final chapter ACCOUNTANTS are nearing a final chapter in their disposal programmes of the assets in the Maxwell business network, more than ten months after they were first appointed. Price Waterhouse has been handling the 400 companies - most of them non-trading - within Maxwell Communication Corporation. Realisations so far have totalled Pounds 59m, including companies such as Panini, Nimbus, Macdonald, MBCG and MCPC. Professional fees have totalled Pounds 15m to date. There have been no MCC realisations so far in the US, where the majority of the assets are. Mr Mark Homan, one of the joint administrators, has said he wanted to avoid a fire sale; the businesses are also self-sufficient in cashflow and ahead of projections. Accountants at Arthur Andersen are administrators to the private Maxwell business empire. This also includes about 400 companies, the vast majority being non-trading. There were 55 trading businesses identified, of which 52 have been sold, generating Pounds 110m. These include the European newspaper, AGB and some other market research companies. Income has been offset by Pounds 2m in trading losses and costs, and estimated professional bills of Pounds 11m. Two businesses have been closed, leaving one - British International Helicopters - to be sold, along with property assets and overseas investments, which should in total realise at least another Pounds 50m. The Office of Fair Trading has cleared the way for bids from four of the six serious contenders. In addition, the firm still has to determine the point at which to sell the majority shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers, but appears to be in no hurry to do so. Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Andersen, said he is getting to the point of liquidating a number of the companies now held in administration.</p>

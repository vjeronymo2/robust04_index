			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Transferable Subscription Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC received many comments on the issue whether conversion rules should be modified to require converting institutions to provide depositors with transferable subscription rights to purchase the stock issued in the mutual-to-stock conversion. This issue was not addressed in either the Proposed Policy Statement or the Interim Rule. In recent Congressional testimony the FDIC Chairman has indicated that the FDIC may consider whether depositors and other stakeholders of converting institutions should receive transferable subscription rights so they can participate more equitably in the conversion process and receive benefits from the conversion without having to purchase conversion stock to do so. With one exception, all the comments received on this issue opposed the idea. One mutual savings bank stated that ``we are outraged that any governmental body would consider provisions such as depositor subscription rights that could enable speculators to force a mutual bank to convert to a stock bank. Such a provision would not just endanger this bank, but destroy it, along with many other community institutions.'' A national banking industry trade group echoed these sentiments, noting that ``permitting or requiring transferable subscription rights would undermine the integrity of conversions by generating intense pressures to convert mutuals to stock form. All mutuals would be put into play.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many mutual savings and cooperative banks in Massachusetts expressed their objection to ``mandatory depository transferable/saleable subscription rights'' noting that ``they could subject our depositors to professional flippers [out-of-area depositors who are just interested in short-term investment gains], attorneys and investment firms who may bring pressure to force a mutual-to-stock conversion.'' A shadow regulatory group expressed the opposite view, arguing that subscription rights should be transferable to provide an incentive for depositors to exercise their subscription rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Contributions to the Community/FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of those who commented on the issue expressed opposition to requiring converting institutions to contribute part of the conversion proceeds directly to their communities. Many noted such a requirement would impose a ``social tax'' on converting institutions. A state savings bank stated that ``a capital giveaway wouldn't further the FDIC's legitimate goal of preserving safety and soundness.'' Another state savings bank noted that such a ``social tax would jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank and would negatively affect credit availability to local consumers and small businesses. These are not public funds.'' One of the numerous savings banks in Massachusetts who commented negatively on this issue asserted that ``a social tax would replace insider greed with a form of outsider greed.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters, however, suggested that the FDIC should share in conversion proceeds. A regulatory ``shadow'' group stated that the FDIC should receive at least 50 percent of [the transferable subscription] rights [issued in a mutual-to-stock conversion], which it would sell in the market. The group argued that: ``the taxpayer, through the FDIC, has the strongest claim on the existing surplus of converting mutual institutions. The taxpayer has taken the risk of loss that is usually borne by the stockholder. The public, that had to pay for the loss of failed thrifts, should reap some of the benefits that all usually go to the stockholder.'' A state bank commented that ``windfall appreciation from stock conversions should accrue to the FDIC. The FDIC has provided protection for thrifts over the years and deserves the benefit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Merger/Conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual who commented on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule stated that merger/conversions should not be allowed because they ``only serve management's interests and not the depositors.'' He suggested that any merger take place only after an initial ``free-standing'' standard conversion. A bank holding company commented that merger/conversions are desirable because they increase competition in the industry and support safety and soundness. It noted that state law is the ``proper authority'' to regulate management compensation issues in merger/conversions. A law firm commented that the problems with merger/conversions could be ``reduced substantially if the OTS revised its policy to encourage a discount in the acquirors' stock as offered to depositors of the acquired institution.'' A state banking and thrift regulator suggested that the FDIC and OTS collaborate in a joint determination on whether merger/conversions will be approved in the future and, if so, adopt specific requirements to provide parity among savings associations and savings banks. A state banking and thrift industry trade group recommended that merger/conversions be permitted only in the case of undercapitalized institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case-by-case basis. A national banking and thrift industry trade group said it would not oppose a ``regulatory pause by the FDIC to evaluate its rules governing merger/conversions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

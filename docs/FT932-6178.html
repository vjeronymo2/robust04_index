			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Castings shows slight downturn to Pounds 4.37m CASTINGS, the West Midlands based iron castings supplier, yesterday announced pre-tax profits down slightly at Pounds 4.37m for the year ended March compared with Pounds 4.46m in the previous period. Turnover fell to Pounds 33.8m against Pounds 35.1m. The directors said that 'the year has been most unpredictable with a reasonable start, poor middle and an improvement towards the end. We hope it will continue to improve to the levels we enjoyed three years ago.' They added that the brunt of the downturn was borne by the company's Brownhills site. The directors stated that it was 'most disappointing' to lose more than Pounds 200,000 as a supplier to Leyland DAF, the commercial vehicle maker, which collapsed in February. The board proposes a final dividend of 3.05p (2.77p) giving a total for the year of 4.35p (4.07p). Earnings per share were 14.3p (14.66p).</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (1): International gaze falls on mini-state - In 1996, when the EU reviews its constitutional rules, there will be pressure to downgrade the influence of smaller member states Luxembourg is a tiny, placid country, ostensibly content to drip with prosperity, exploiting its economic niche at the conjunction of France, Germany and Belgium, and punching above its weight as a founder-member of what is now the European Union. But suddenly it is under international gaze, after its prime minister, Mr Jacques Santer, was vaulted unexpectedly this summer into the presidency of the European Commission, to succeed the powerful Mr Jacques Delors in the new year. The Grand Duchy will need influence at the Euro-court. In 1996, when the EU reviews its power-sharing and constitutional rules ahead of planned integration of eastern Europe around the end of the century, there will be pressure to downgrade the influence of smaller member states - not to mention mini-states such as Luxembourg. And ahead of that, EU pressure is already rising to persuade Luxembourg as a fast-growing financial centre to harmonise its low tax regime with its partners. Its powerful neighbours, led by Germany, resent the outflow of capital into the Grand Duchy, lured by its virtually zero withholding tax on foreigners and banking secrecy laws. 'I fear that the two issues will be linked, and that will be very difficult for us,' acknowledges Mr Francois Biltgen, a parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, who have governed in coalition with the Socialists since 1984. But more important than having Mr Santer in Brussels is the virtual certainty that he will be succeeded as Luxembourg's prime minister by Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, a tough and intelligent politician who is widely respected on the Euro-circuit. Mr Juncker, who at 39 will be the EU's youngest premier, is presently Luxembourg's finance and employment minister. He has won a high reputation among his peers by dint of intellectual ability, straightforward argument, and a gift for building consensus within the quarrelsome Euro-club. Mr Delors himself tried hard to persuade Mr Juncker to join the Commission and, according to some insiders, once thought of him as his possible successor. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a fellow Christian Democrat, affectionately calls Mr Juncker 'Junior'. As finance minister, a portfolio he may well retain as prime minister, Mr Juncker has not shirked hard decisions. In recent years he has started reform of health insurance and last year completed an overhaul of taxation, reducing the burden on middle-income households and small to medium-sized companies, while keeping a tight grip on spending. The ruling coalition has given Luxembourg an almost unbroken cycle of growth in the past 10 years, as well as political stability. Its planners now foresee national output rising by 3 per cent and more to the end of the century. Luxembourg is alone among its partners in meeting all the Maastricht treaty convergence criteria for economic and monetary union (Emu), notably through government debt at a mere 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product, and the budget in virtual equilibrium. At the same time, it manages to devote a high average of 10 per cent of public spending to capital investment in telecommunications, transport and energy. Yet prudent stewardship of the public purse is but a small part of the explanation why Luxembourg has the highest per capita income in the EU. Dependent on the economic performance of its neighbours, it nonetheless consistently outperforms them; growth rates never turned negative during the recent recession, and unemployment, high by local standards at 3 per cent, remains at about a quarter of the EU average. Luxembourgers have prospered by being abnormally fast to identify opportunities for their economy. This is all the more remarkable given that the Grand Duchy has surrendered many conventional tools of macroeconomic management. Control of exchange rate and monetary policy is vested in its 72-year-old economic and monetary union with Belgium and, by virtue of its geographic position at west Europe's heart, its frontiers were open long before the advent of the Single Market. In the mid-19th century, Luxembourg was among the first to set up an advanced steel industry, the initial origin of its wealth. 'It is a skill they have historically: to see a niche and go for it,' says Mr Rodney Williams of Flemings, one of the largest managers of the flood of investment funds located in Luxembourg. Through agility and inventiveness, the Grand Duchy has in more recent decades become: a pioneer of the Eurobond market; a launch-pad for the cable and satellite TV business; a leading personal finance centre through customised banking services and tax-efficient saving through investment funds. In the latter and other similar cases, Luxembourg enacted the new Euro-legislation on mutual funds (the USITS directive) well ahead of its competitors. The number of funds tripled between 1987 and the end of last year from 405 to 1,175, with the volume of investment rocketing from LFr1,135bn to LFr9,967bn. 'As a government, we introduce quickly and in advance,' says Mr Juncker. But, he cautions, 'as a small country we don't have the freedom to make mistakes. Every 10 years we have to invent something new, something which the others have not seen yet. And if you back the wrong horse you're dead.' The finance centre, generating 15 per cent of GDP directly and probably double that once ancillary services from lawyers to restaurants are added in, was definitely a good horse to back. Bankers and politicians are divided on whether the German-led drive to enforce a withholding tax, and possibly even to erode the finance centre's other precious asset of banking secrecy, could seriously damage Luxembourg. 'The withholding tax is the first wall of the fortress, but the inner wall is (banking) secrecy', says one leading banker. But the signs are that the government is bracing for eventual tax harmonisation. 'We have to behave in a manner so that we are prepared to live without the withholding tax,' argues one senior minister. More cautiously, Mr Juncker argues that the finance centre is close to critical mass and must learn to trade on its skills and experience. 'We are becoming richer and richer, but we are not more intelligent, we don't work harder, and we are no better than the others. We have to explain this to our people.' Because of its partners' perception that Luxembourg gets rich by exploiting loopholes, the government is wary of betting too heavily on any one horse, and thinks ahead about diversification. For example, with an already dense network of small to medium-sized industry, Luxembourg is now targeting high-tech, high valued-added foreign companies, offering a generous tax regime along with its skilled, multilingual labour force. 'We're very vulnerable, and we've always needed more courage and imagination to defend our vital interests,' Mr Juncker says. He will also need courage and inventiveness to defend Luxembourg's position in 1996. As the Grand Duchy's political establishment sees it, the priorities are: to preserve the EU balance between big and small states; ensure that Luxembourg retains its right to a commissioner when the EU expands further; avoid too overt a correlation between country size and population and voting power in the EU's Council of Ministers; and, above all, to avoid all this getting enmeshed with the wrangle over withholding tax. None of this will be easy, but the very fact that the EU had to resort to Luxembourg and Mr Santer to resolve the Delors succession crisis - after the UK vetoed Belgian premier Jean-Luc Dehaene at the Corfu summit in June - greatly strengthens the Grand Duchy's position. 'It is a sign that small countries make up an important part of the cement of the Union,' says Mr Biltgen. 'Just his being there wins part of the argument for (Luxembourg) having a commissioner.' But altogether typically for a Luxembourger, he quickly adds that 'we have to look for compromise solutions.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Thursday the local press published a new decree  on elections to Uzbekistan's Oliy-Mazhlis (parliament), which  consequently has been brought into force. The decree stipulates  that the republic's new parliament will consist of 250 deputies  elected in one-mandate districts on a multi-party basis for 5  years.    Elections to the Oliy-Mazhlis are held on a nationwide  basis.  Citizens aged 18 have the right to vote and citizens not younger  than 25 years old can be elected to the Uzbek parliament.    Political parties, Karakalpakia's parliament (an autonomous  republic within Uzbekistan), regional and the Tashkent city  councils of people's deputies can nominate candidates to the  deputies of the new parliament.    Parties have the right to nominate their candidates under  provision that they are registered by Uzbekistan's Justice  Ministry not later than 6 months before the elections and have  collected not less than 50,000 signatures of electors.    Citizens who have a previous conviction or have not lived in  the republic before the elections, servicemen, employees of the  national security service or Interior Ministry, and ministers of  religion are not permitted to be registered.    The date of the elections to the new parliament has not been  determined yet. Elections are likely to take place in summer  1994, when the authorities of the deputies of the present  Supreme Soviet expire.    Two parties officially registered in the republic can  participate in the elections. These are the legal successor of  the Communist Party, the Popular Democratic Party chaired by  President Islam Karimov, and the Party Vatan Tarakkieti  (Homeland's Progress) formed by the presidential state adviser  Usman Azimov.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif from Cairo] </F>   [Excerpt] A major difference of opinion between Egypt and  Saudi Arabia over the Yemeni crisis has hurt relations between  Riyadh and Cairo, which an informed Egyptian source has  described as becoming serious.    According to the source, Saudi Arabia has always claimed  that  its unique relations with Yemen make it necessary that all  attempts to find a solution to the problem go through Riyadh.  The source added that Egypt had remained patient since Saudi  Arabia rejected any Egyptian intervention when the crisis broke  out. Saudi Arabia claimed to be confident that the parties in  Sanaa and Aden were capable of resolving their differences  without outside intervention.    The source added that Egypt responded favorably at first but  its patience ran out when the crisis became exacerbated in a way  that, according to Egypt, threatened the region. It said that  some Egyptian Foreign Ministry experts prepared a study on the  possible deterioration of the situation in Yemen and came to the  conclusion that leaving things as they were could make the  situation worse and make some parties push to take the case to  the United Nations, which would mean allowing a Western presence  in Yemen in the name of international legitimacy, a development  that Egypt regards as detrimental to Arab interests.    The source added that Egypt decided to intervene either  unilaterally or in coordination with the United Arab Emirates  [UAE], particularly as the evidence convinced it that some Arab  parties are intent on exacerbating the situation in Yemen and  impeding any efforts to resolve it. The source said: Egypt  noticed that the Gulf Cooperation Council did not discuss the  Yemeni crisis at its recent meeting in Riyadh. Egypt is  strongly opposed to undermining Yemen and bringing down its  regime because of its stance during the second Gulf war.    The source revealed that another issue, Iraq, has  intensified  the crisis between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is  accusing Egypt of working covertly to improve the atmosphere  between Baghdad and some Arab and Western capitals and says that  the Arab League's reconciliation initiative is only a back door  for returning Iraq to the Arab fold. It added that Saudi Arabia  brought up this issue with Egypt several times and stressed that  it adopt the Gulf stance, which is opposition to reconciliation  with Iraq.    The source did not rule out a possible Egyptian move to  raise  the level of its diplomatic representation with Iraq as a means  of pressure. The source expressed the hope that the cloud  marring Egyptian-Saudi relations would disappear and stressed  that Saudi Arabia and Egypt need each other.    On the other hand, Arab diplomatic circles are pessimistic  about the prospects of Egyptian-UAE mediation between Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid. These circles expect this mediation to fail for several  reasons, the most important of which is that the fundamental  problem lies in the struggle for power and not in implementing  the "Pledge and Agreement" document. They note that  implementation of the document will neither strengthen the unity  nor remove the specter of secession. They add that non-Yemeni  parties have succeeded in planting fear within the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] and that this fear has been bolstered by  financial aid that has exceeded $1 billion in cash and military  aid. These parties, the Arab circles said, gave al-Bid forged  reports saying that Salih rigged the elections in favor of his  party so he could appear later as magnanimous when he offered  the prime ministership, Defense Ministry, and some other  noninfluential posts to the YSP so that any future legislative  elections would appear to the people to be honest and objective  if the lists of the winners or ministers appeared without any  southern name.    The circles say that these non-Yemeni parties have stressed  to the southern Yemenis that if Egypt's efforts to achieve an  Arab reconciliation continue, it will only strengthen 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's position, who in his capacity as president has  the authority to sign any Yemeni reconciliation with Saudi  Arabia and the Gulf. The non-Yemeni parties added that this  would mean the immediate severance of communications between the  Gulf and Aden and that the Gulf prefers to cooperate with the  YSP, either through al-Bid's assumption of the presidency of the  Republic or through the restoration of the south's independence.    An informed Arab source said that the Gulf parties that have  direct ties with intelligence organs there handed al-Bid  documents and lists of names that reveal that 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's relatives assassinated some YSP members to pull the rug  from under the feet of the leadership in the south. It added  that these parties stressed to al-Bid that some of those who  carried out these operations were half brothers of President  Salih on his mother's side. [passage omitted]</p>

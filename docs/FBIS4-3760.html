			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] in a letter formally informed the Strait Exchange  Foundation [SEF] on 22 April about the details of the Chientao  [Qiandao] Lake tragedy. The SEF and the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC] held an urgent meeting to discuss the letter.  They decided that the investigation results provided by  Communist China were not acceptable because they failed to  provide reasonable answers to some doubts raised by the victims'  families and our relevant departments.    The MAC authorized the SEF to reply in a letter today to  express the hope that the mainland authorities will send us all  information, including records of the investigation, and to once  again express a strong demand that a special meeting between the  SEF and the ARATS be held in Hong Kong on 27 April as scheduled.    The MAC also said: If Communist China does not provide a  reasonable explanation, the MAC will when necessary release the  report compiled by our investigating group and compare it with  the one compiled by Communist China. Here is Liu Yu-mei's  report:    [Begin recording] After newspapers in Hong Kong carried  detailed stories about the Chientao Lake incident, the ARATS  informed the SEF in a written message on 22 April and provided a  relatively concrete report. In the letter, the SEF said: Wu  Li-hong [Wu Lihong], Hu Chih-han [Hu Zhihan], and Yu Ai-chun [Yu  Aijun] plotted as early as last year to rob tourists on Chientao  Lake by using a motorboat. On 31 March, they climbed aboard the  Haijui [Hairui] tourist boat and committed the crimes of  robbery, murder, and arson which caused 32 deaths.    The letter pointed out: After a 17-day investigation, the  case was brought to light. The police retrieved $5,250, 154,000  new Taiwan dollars, a video camera, six cameras, eight rings,  one jade bracelet, and two Rolex watches.    The SEF was not satisfied with the report. SEF Deputy  Secretary General Shih Chi-ping said that the information  revealed by the ARATS was only partial in nature. He expressed  his hope that the mainland will provide more detailed facts and  that it will promptly answer in clear terms whether the two  parties will hold special cross-strait consultations on this  case.    [Shih] It is our hope that the ARATS will provide us with  more detailed information so that we can have a better  understanding of this case. We also hope that they will give us  a clear answer as soon as possible concerning the request stated  in our previous letter.    [Liu] Shih Chi-ping said that the MAC and the SEF will  respond to the ARATS' letter in the near future. This is Liu  Yu-mei reporting from the SEF. [end recording]</p>

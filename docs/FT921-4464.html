			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: The time comes to speak up and put up - An array of visual aids Most people in business can expect to have to make a presentation. It is not just salesmen and women who have to make a pitch for a customer. Solicitors and accountants wooing new clients and businessmen seeking finance have all had to hone their presentation skills. Increasingly they are turning to visual aids - flip charts, overhead projectors, slides and videos - to put over their message. For the nervous and inexperienced, visual aids provide a useful prop while, for the more seasoned presenter, they can increase the force of the message. Large companies will often have in-house public relations and marketing departments to help speakers, but the smaller business will usually have to go outside for professional help. This need not be prohibitively expensive, particularly if the business is prepared to do much of the preparatory work itself. But visual aids must be handled with care. Unskilled or over-enthusiastic use can weaken the impact of your presentation and may be positively counter-productive. Even quite basic aids, such as the marker pens used on flip-pads or white boards can be tricky, warns David Turner, a training consultant. 'Speakers have been known to forget they were holding a pen and write in their ear or draw lines on their trousers.' At the other end of the scale, multi-screen slide and video presentations may sound and look impressive but are more likely to distract the audience from the presenter's message than enhance its understanding. 'People have come to expect some kind of visual aid, but beware of being too slick or too technical,' says Francis Bergin, a communications training consultant. 'Plan your presentation and then decide whether visual aids are necessary. The experts suggest the following ground rules: Do not make excessive use of visual aids. Use them to support your presentation but not to replace it. You may not be the most charismatic of speakers, but the most interesting visual aid in the room is you. Don't compete with your visual aids. Introduce the subject, put up your slide or transparency, let your audience absorb the information, then take it down or switch off the projector Don't take your audience through the text of a visual, word by word. 'Since most audiences can read, this is a complete waste of time,' writes Lee Bowman in High Impact Business Presentations.* Don't attempt to cram in too much information. Your audience will not be able to absorb it all and may not even be able to read it from the back of the room. Don't use visual aids to fill in time. Few people have ever complained that a presentation was too short. Once you stop talking, the audience can start asking questions. Make sure you rehearse your presentation. Check that you have not positioned projectors, lecterns and chairs so that you trip over wires or block the view of your audience. Have back-up equipment available if possible. There is a growing range of visual aids. The simplest ones can be the most effective and also the least likely to produce technical problems: Flip-pads and white boards are perhaps more useful in training sessions than in formal presentations, though they have a role here too. Their main disadvantage is that the presenter must turn his back on the audience to write and so may lose their attention. Some presenters attempt to overcome this problem by standing behind the flip-pad to write but this looks unnatural and requires an unusual degree of manual dexterity. Ready-prepared flip boards are better if the presenter is making a set presentation. They allow the use of graphs, and diagrams in black and white or colour are simple to use and easy to transport. Overhead projectors. These ungainly objects are the workhorse of many presentations. You can make your own transparencies in black and white or colour but must use special coloured pens obtainable from stationers. Unfortunately transparencies are so easy to produce that many presenters simply make copies of complex tables and detailed text. The result is excessive detail and a complete loss of graphic effect. You are advised to have your transparencies prepared by a professional slide production company. Check the audio visual services section of Yellow Pages. The Slide House, one London-based producer of audio visuals, quotes Pounds 8 for a black on white transparency (plus VAT) with additional colours from Pounds 1.25. Slides can make powerful use of colour, depth and texture and are easily controlled by the speaker to suit the speed of his delivery. But slide presentations need careful preparation. Slides, like family holiday snaps, can seduce the over-enthusiastic presenter. Keep the number of slides to a manageable level and keep them informative. Slides of company logos and 'chapter' headings are a distraction. If you have a computer capable of producing graphics, you may be able to make your own slides, but there are plenty of professional slide production companies which can do it for you. The slide producers are used to reacting to last-minute requests and most can respond within 24 hours. But the longer you can give them to work on your presentation, the more polished it will be. 'Most people leave it up to us to put their material in an attractive format,' says Malcolm Hearn, a director of The Slide House. The cost of the slides depends on the colours used and the complexity of the images, but slides involving simple text, the use of bullet points and graphs or charts would cost Pounds 15 to Pounds 25 each, plus VAT, he calculates. Electronic presentations. For all their versatility, slides are static. You can bring slide images to life by using electronic presentation equipment which can either feed images to a television set or be projected onto a larger screen. Electronic image creation allows you to animate bar charts - making a bar 'grow' on screen, says Martin Conradi, managing director of London-based Showcase Presentations. Conradi puts the cost of preparing and mounting a fairly straightforward presentation at Pounds 2,500-Pounds 3,000, rising to Pounds 4,500-Pounds 5,000 for one involving more elaborate stage props. Videos provide the impact of a moving image but are not easily integrated into a presentation. 'A video breaks up your act,' says William Parkhurst in The Eloquent Executive.** Despite the popularity of home video shows on TV, audiences are accustomed to high professional standards so a low-budget corporate presentation may look rather basic by comparison. And do not let the video run for too long. Unless you are very entertaining, the audience will soon become bored. There is a wide choice of video companies if you decide to farm production out to a professional. Costs vary widely depending on the number of locations involved, on the props required and whether you want to include graphics. VCL Video, a London company, says clients can expect to pay around Pounds 1,000 a minute for a video. Unless there are complications, shooting would take two to three days and editing a similar length of time. *Business Books. Tel 071 973 9670. 246 pages. Pounds 16.99; **Harper Collins.

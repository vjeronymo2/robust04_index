			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 WORKERS OVERCOME BY FUMES AT UNOCAL  REFINERY  </P> <P> Five workers were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes Monday while working on an  80-foot-high converter at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington, authorities said.  None of the workers suffered serious effects.  </P> <P> The workers, all employees of an outside contractor, apparently inhaled the  fumes from a nearby heater exhaust that was blown in their direction by a gust  of wind, said Unocal spokesman Jeff Callender.  </P> <P> City Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek said three of the men reported feeling  faint, but Callender said all were able to climb down under their own power  from the 80-foot-high ironwork structure, which breaks down oil into high-grade  gasoline.  </P> <P> Paramedics took the men to Bay Harbor Hospital, where all were undergoing chest  X-rays and other tests, but none of them was expected to be admitted.  </P></p>

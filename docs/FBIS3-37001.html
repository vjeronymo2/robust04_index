			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Anin report under the "Opinion" rubric: "Bosnian </F> Crisis: What Should Russia Do? Why Could the U.S. President  Not Contact the Russian One?"]    [Text] Bill Clinton said that he could not reach Boris  Yeltsin due to technical reasons to discuss the latest turn in  the Bosnian crisis. This may mean two things: either the  Russian president is on his deathbed, or he has nothing to say  to his American counterpart.    I do not believe that Boris Yeltsin's announced slight  indisposition has even the slightest bearing on his loss of  speech. Hence, the "technical reasons" must be related to the  proposed NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia. What  matters is not so much that the Russian president cannot say  "Yes" in principle, but a bombing strike in response to his "No"  would have greatly damaged the Russian leader's prestige. The  consequences of a punitive solution to the Bosnian crisis could  be incomparably more serious that moral damage, even if it was  done to a head of state.    One may guess as long as one wishes about the peacemaking  potential of the NATO action. In what may turn out to be its  immediate effect, however, the Serbs may start hunting the UN  "blue helmets" and start out-and-out guerrilla warfare. Then  the "Atlantists'" next step would be to bring ground troops into  the region, troops that are capable, unlike a peacekeeping  contingent, of carrying out full-blown combat operations. In  practice this will amount to the West's war to eliminate the  Serb people. Neither more nor less -- simply because the Serbs  do not surrender (there has not been such a thing in their  history) and, having earned a reputation of a guerrilla people,  they would fight to the last man.    And then Russia will have to make a choice. Either, staying  neutral, to take part in the Serb-NATO war at the diplomatic  level, or to stand up for the underdog and send its troops  there. This will be a new big war in which Russia will be  effectively left alone against all, because in Bosnia the  interests of the "Atlantists" and the Muslim world coincide  surprisingly. This third world war would bring about what did  not happen in World War I and what was about to happen in World  War II: Russia would be crushed and, maybe, would cease to  exist as a state. Its territory would be divided into  protectorates, the borders of the North and the South would  close, and the ruined Orthodox civilization would no longer be  there to prevent the two sides from warring, trading, and simply  having direct contacts.    There will be no World War III if Russia does not stand up  for the Serbs should something happen. To do so, in order to  counter the pressure of radicals from among pro-Serb nationalist  patriots, the Kremlin will need only to organize a national  referendum. "Pan- Slavism" was a new word for those who lived a  century and a half ago. For the current generation of the  Empire's heirs it is completely unfamiliar. So the results of a  referendum featuring a question like "Do the Russians want war?"  can be foretold right now.    By doing so Russia will retain its statehood, but its  authority in the world would be measured in negative values from  that very instance with all the ensuing consequences. After  all, nuclear weapons themselves do not guarantee great power  status to a state. Without an ideological underpinning an A-bomb  is nothing more than a box of matches in the hands of a foolish  kid. The ideological underpinning, however, is the so-called  postponed threat factor, which is the foundation of modern  military-political rivalry. How strong this factor is as an  indicator of the strength of one world leader or another can be  revealed in a specific crisis situation -- those leaders, once  broken, would be dismissed as outsiders.    So the position of President Yeltsin, who has a slight  indisposition in Zavidovo, is unenviable: Every alley is a dead  end. He will probably still talk to Clinton, but there is just  one hope left -- that NATO will back away from its decision and,  contenting itself with effectively meaningless concessions from  the Serbs, will not bomb them after all.</p>

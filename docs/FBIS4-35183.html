			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin, the head of the Israeli  government, has acknowledged the wide gap between the Israeli  and Syrian positions on the peace process. Shim'on Peres, the  Israeli foreign minister, said earlier in Washington that  Syria's terms for negotiations are unacceptable and that it  wants to wrest great concessions from Israel, especially with  regard to full withdrawal from the Golan.    It seems Israeli officials continue to block and hinder  prospects for achieving a real breakthrough in the peace process  based on the Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace  principle.    What Peres terms great concessions is an outright fallacy.  The Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. It  is an indivisible part of Syria. Therefore, Israel's withdrawal  amounts to nothing more than a correction of an abnormal  situation and the end of an aggression that has continued since  1967.    Security Council resolutions have asked Israel to pull its  troops out and not to change the identity of the Golan and the  other occupied territories. The U.S. peace initiative was  launched, in the first place, on the basis of Resolutions 242  and 338 and the land-for-peace principle, as well as the need to  achieve a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the  conflict.    The ABC's of justice suggest that occupation should be  removed; usurped territory should be returned to its owners; and  that Israel should submit to UN law and stop pursuing the law of  the jungle. Humanity is preparing to enter the 21st Century.  Occupation has been removed from all over the Earth. All  nations have attained their freedom and independence. It is  illogical that Israel should stay above international law,  practicing a policy of occupation and terrorism and deeming the  invasion of others' territories a legitimate right and the  displacement of the residents of those territories a fact of  life.    Israel's claim will remain worthless until this claim is  translated into actual, concrete stands toward peace. Since  1948, the rulers of Israel have been crying out for peace and at  the same time igniting wars and carrying out attacks in the name  of working to achieve peace. But, when the Arabs responded to  the first serious U.S. initiative, the Israeli rulers' peaceful  claims turned into obstacles and hindrances in the way of the  progress of the peace process.    Syria, along with Lebanon and Jordan, have proposed full  peace in return for full withdrawal. However, the Israeli  rulers rejected outright the principle of full withdrawal and  hinted at the possibility of partial withdrawals in return for a  series of impossible conditions and restrictions. In Lebanon's  case, for example, the Israeli rulers have escalated their  brutal land, air, and sea attacks against Lebanon, because  Lebanon adheres to the implementation of Security Council  Resolution 425. They deemed their message to Lebanon a message  to all Arabs who ask for the withdrawal of the occupying Israeli  forces to the 4 June 1967 lines.    The rulers of Israel have also rejected a comprehensive  withdrawal from the Golan under fabricated pretexts. They  deliberately foiled any prospect for real progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track. In fact, Rabin has gone as far as making  a commitment to hold a public referendum on the Golan, as if  Israel is above international and UN law and can simply occupy  and annex the land of others while the owners of the land are  not allowed to claim it or to defend its identity, culture, and  history.    These Israeli practices, in the Golan, southern Lebanon, and  the Palestinian arena, clearly confirm that Israel does not want  peace and that it has never abandoned its expansionist and  aggressive schemes. It is no coincidence at all that the  Government of Israel has threatened to occupy the Gaza Strip and  Jericho once again if the Palestinian self-rule authorities do  not abide by Israel's instructions.    Peace in the eyes of the entire world means establishing  justice and right and ending occupation, injustice, oppression,  and terrorism. In Israel's book, however, peace is a cheap deal  that guarantees that Israel will swallow as much as it can of  others' territories that it has occupied by force, deception,  and trickery.    It is natural for Syria and the other Arab parties to reject  such aggressive proposals and adhere to the restoration of all  their occupied territories and to assert international law in  the region.    The Israelis are greatly mistaken if they think their  maneuvers and tactics, which have exceeded all limits, will make  the Arabs abandon their territories and rights. Syria said  yesterday -- and it reiterates today and will reiterate tomorrow  -- that there can be no relinquishment of any single iota of the  soil of the Golan and that peace depends on the departure of the  last Israeli soldier from the Golan and the establishment of a  just and comprehensive solution in the region.</p>

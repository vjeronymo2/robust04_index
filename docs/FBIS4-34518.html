			<p>BFN     [Text] The Santa Cruz Chamber of Private Communications  Media sent a letter to Telecommunications Director General Raul  Campero Paz in which it regrets the proliferation of clandestine  radios in this department despite the expressed commitment of  the director general, who on 18 May conveyed his decision to use  "all legal and technical means to prevent the emergence of new  stations disregarding the requirements that rule the national  broadcasting system."    Enrique Roda Bush, chairman of the private communications  media, referred to the creation and opening of radio "Amazonas  107.9 MHZ," which is already on the air in Santa Cruz. This  proves that officials in the area have been overpowered in their  effort to put an end to the operation of clandestine stations.    He demanded an order that should work to fulfill the law's  provisions. Campero Paz two weeks ago said he would personally  order the DITER [expansion unknown] regional agent to prevent  broadcasting by Radio Creativa, which did not have anything, not  even a copy of the license application request form.    He then reaffirmed his commitment to act in all cases that  could emerge concerning radios that have not complied with the  technical and legal reorganization of the radio broadcasting  system.</p>

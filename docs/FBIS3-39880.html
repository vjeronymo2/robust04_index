			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "bag": "Aid From Bonn Didn't Arrive in Eastern </F> Communities--East's Cities Allotted Three Times the Capital  Funding of Western Ones"]    [Text] In 1993, east German municipalities were able to  reduce their personnel expenditures by about 2.5 percent,  despite salary increases and alignment with salaries in western  Germany. This year, they hope to maintain personnel costs at the  level of 19.5 billion German marks (DM).    Early in 1993, personnel costs in the east German  municipalities were still expected to increase, but this did not  happen because many incorporated towns reduced the number of  employees at a rate faster than had been anticipated. According  to a report on municipal finances by the Deutsche Staedtetag  (DST) [Congress of Municipal Authorities], positions were cut  primarily at social facilities, particularly day care centers  for children. The DST does not anticipate any further salary  alignments beyond the present 80 percent of salaries in western  Germany. The east German municipalities anticipate per capita  personnel costs of DM1,355 or 136 percent of similar costs in  western Germany, as heretofore.    In all, east German municipalities have budgeted DM62  billion  in expenditures for 1994, an increase of 4.5 percent. They  anticipate revenues of DM56.5 billion, an increase of 5 percent  which represents a DM5.5. billion deficit equal to that in 1993.    In 1993, the "German Unity" fund, one of the primary sources  of income of the east German laender and municipalities, was  increased by DM3.7 billion. The DST criticizes the fact that 40  percent of these funds were not turned over to the east German  municipalities as required by law, but instead were given to the  new laender for already planned allocations. This also applies  to the DM1.5 billion government investment fund.    Expected tax revenue of DM5.8 billion for 1994 is likely to  equal just 30 percent of the west German level. This is due  primarily to the fact that per capita small-business tax revenue  is equal to only 15 percent of that collected by west German  municipalities. In the case of income tax revenue and real  estate taxes, the corresponding ratios are 35 and 53 percent  respectively.    The report notes a slight increase in current allocations  (DM24 billion) and no change in investment allocations at DM9  billion. Current allocations per capita in 1994 are almost twice  as high, and investment allocations are three times higher than  in western Germany. Estimated income from fees and other charges  is expected to decline to 6 percent from the sharp increase of  16.1 percent in 1993.    The cities and towns in the new laender are planning for a  5-percent increase in current material costs. Expenditures for  social services are expected to rise sharply (71 percent) but  will still be appreciably lower than in western Germany. The DST  fears that social welfare, the lion's share of social  expenditures, will become the "explosive issue in the government  budgets" of the new laender during the next few years as it has  elsewhere.    In contrast to 1993, east German fiscal experts believe that  expenditures will grow at a higher rate than revenue this year.  As a consequence, eastern Germany's own potential for investment  will be reduced and, since more substantial federal and laender  subsidies are not expected, they fear it will be impossible to  match the high rate of investment of years past. This year  investments will total DM18 billion, as against DM18.5 billion  in 1993. But in view of the "accelerated decline in investments"  by municipalities in western Germany, per capita expenditures  for construction in eastern Germany will be twice as high as in  the west.    After 1994, the east German laender will receive  substantially higher transfer payments from the augmented  "German Unity" fund of the old laender, since they will be  included in the laender financial redistribution program and  will also be receiving supplementary federal aid as of 1995. In  addition, as provided under investment aid legislation for  eastern reconstruction, they will be getting more than DM6.6  billion.    In contrast to the legislation governing the "German Unity"  fund (which calls for allocating 40 percent to the  municipalities), it is up to the land governments to decide how  to share the substantially increased income with the  municipalities. The DST calls for retaining the 40-percent  quota. After all, the west German municipalities are also  required to contribute 40 percent of the transfer payments.</p>

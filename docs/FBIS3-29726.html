They expressed indignation at the fact that the puppet  clique  are kicking up a row over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the  North, in conspiracy with the United States, and concern over  the situation of the Korean peninsula which has been more  strained by such anti-DPRK campaign.    After the rally they staged a demonstration, shouting  anti-U.S., anti-"government" slogans.</p>

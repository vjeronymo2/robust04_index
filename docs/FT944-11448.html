			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Romeo without a ray of romance - Sarah Hemming catches a bleak, brutal portrayal of Shakespeare's tragedy at the Barbican To say that the first production in the Barbican's Everybody's Shakespeare Festival might not be to everybody's taste is putting it mildly. Karin Beier's Romeo und Julia from the Dusseldorfer Schauspielhaus is a bleak, brutal reading of Shakespeare's tragedy in which no ray of romance ever pierces the despair. Set not in medieval Verona, but in a sort of giant grey underpass - not unlike the Barbican car park - it presents us with a chic, harsh world where Romeo and Juliet's affair is simply a rebellion that misfires. It is a coherent reading, the interpretation of a young director (Beier is 29) who uses the play to explore the empty world of contemporary, alienated youth. In a recent interview she described how she wanted to capture the mood of wealthy young Germans driven to fill their empty lives by seeking sensation in dangerous rituals and her production emphasises the violence in the play. Romeo and Juliet's story is played out against the background of gang warfare, as groups of youths rove around the town, spoiling for a fight and engaging in bizarre martial manoeuvres. For them the urge to destroy is paramount and death is the ultimate thrill. Tybalt becomes an arrogant, taunting neo-fascist; Mercutio a cynical desperado, so bent on self-destruction that he deliberately falls on Tybalt's knife and even reappears as a ghost in Mantua to goad the exiled Romeo towards suicide. No one is likeable. While the adolescent world is violent and rebellious, that of the adults is fatuous and hypocritical. Even the nurse is played as an unsympathetic raunchy blonde, while Friar Laurence becomes a dubious, scarfaced individual and the prince is a babyish fop. In places this staging makes for impressive set pieces: the ball is a skillfully choreographed parade of garish grotesques, the fight a disturbing fray that conveys well the thrill of adrenalin. But it is horribly relentless. In this decadent, comfortless world there is no where for the teenagers to turn, and no room for subtlety, warmth or emotion. However bleak, all this might be just bearable if Romeo and Juliet themselves ran counter to the mood. But in this profoundly nihilistic staging, the tenderness and poetry is stripped out of even their encounters and they emerge a rather gormless pair. The balcony scene is played on two trapezes: giant swings, suspended over the concrete, emphasise how close to childhood they still are, suggest the yearning for excitement and operate as a metaphor for the unattainability of love. Even here, however, death is seen as the ultimate kick, as they discuss who would make the bigger 'splat' if they fell from their perches. Love scarcely makes an entrance. At this point the subversion of the classic interpretation is quite funny, but as it goes on, it becomes tedious, depressing and empty. Arriving at Friar Laurence's cell, Juliet teases Romeo with glimpses of her black bra; when they wake from their marriage night they squabble petulantly over whether they heard the nightingale or the lark. And in the final instance of this insistently anti-romantic production, Romeo changes his mind at the last moment and tries to vomit up the poison he has swallowed. Shakespeare's lovers may be too romantic for this age, but his story of two innocents pitted against a violent and corrupt society has a trajectory that is lost here. Take away that, and you take away the tragedy. Here, as Romeo dies retching, there is not a wet eye in the house. Final performance at the Barbican Theatre tonight (071-638 8891).</p>

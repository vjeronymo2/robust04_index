			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S VENDETTA OUSTED HIM, SAYS IRWINDALE OFFICIAL  </P> <P> A former redevelopment consultant to the city of Irwindale has said a move to  fire him was part of a vendetta by Irwindale Mayor Pat Miranda, who was  frustrated in an attempt to use the city's redevelopment agency for personal  gain.  </P> <P> Fred Lyte told Miranda in a statement that the mayor had "disrupted and  harassed our staff because we would not take unethical or illegal actions for  your personal benefit." The statement was given to the mayor and City Council  before it voted to fire him Dec. 22.  </P> <P> Lyte accused Miranda of trying to destroy the city's redevelopment agency and  called his actions "a disgrace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determined to Stay  </P> <P> "You have said that . . . even if you can't get the votes to fire me, you will  continue to harass me until I quit," the statement said. "Don't hold your  breath. I do not intend to leave Irwindale voluntarily because I am needed here  to protect the people . . . against your deceit and greed."  </P> <P> Miranda responded to Lyte's charges with a brief statement of his own,  addressed to the city residents. The mayor said he had become convinced that  Lyte, a key figure in negotiations to bring the Los Angeles Raiders to  Irwindale, had been paid too much in commissions in his post as redevelopment  consultant.  </P> <P> "I asked Charles Martin, our city manager, how much the city had paid Fred Lyte  in about 10 years and he said about $6 million," Miranda said. "That may be  about $4.5 million more than other cities may have paid (their consultants)."  </P> <P> For this reason, he indicated, he wanted to rewrite Lyte's contract before the  council decided to fire him.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Miranda said Tuesday that any further response would only give  credibility to Lyte's remarks, which Miranda considers "nothing but sour  grapes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Point of Accusation  </P> <P> Miranda did not answer a pointed accusation in Lyte's statement that "probably  no one" had benefitted more from the activities of the redevelopment agency  than the mayor.  </P> <P> Referring to property where Miranda operated a taco stand, Lyte declared that  the site, "which was worth about $25,000 12 years ago, has been leased to  Hopkins Development under an arrangement where you will receive a minimum of  $1,680,000 over the period of your lease. I understand that the execution of  this lease by you was a probable conflict of interest violation."  </P> <P> Lyte accused Miranda of wanting to fire him in part because the agency made  another deal with Hopkins Development which would have paid other parties more  than Miranda would get from his deal with the company.  </P> <P> "You came to Charlie (Martin) and me and said that your manhood would be  questioned if the (other party) got more than you did," he charged. "You asked  us to coerce Hopkins . . . into paying you . . . another $800 per month through  denials of permits and other governmental actions.  </P> <P> "We were told that we would regret it if we didn't. However, we refused to  blackmail Hopkins for your benefit and this was when your attacks on me first  started."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Motive Suggested  </P> <P> Another motive, Lyte charged, was that Miranda may be "trying to kill the  Raider deal and a good way to do it would be to get rid of Charlie (Martin) and  me."  </P> <P> Miranda has questioned rising legal and environmental costs associated with the  Raider project, but he has not said he wants to kill it. An environmental  impact report is scheduled for council discussion this week.  </P> <P> Lyte's statement is the latest in a series of allegations that Irwindale  officials have profited immensely from dealings as officials.  </P> <P> On Sept. 24, 1987, a Times story detailed instances in which Irwindale  officials had steered millions of dollars in city contracts to private  businesses that they either owned or had a substantial interest in. The story  also said that Lyte, in negotiating the Raider deal, appeared to have violated  a provision in his contract forbidding him from recommending to the City  Council a project in which he had a financial interest.  </P> <P> Under his contract with Irwindale, Lyte, who virtually directed the  redevelopment agency although he had only the title of consultant, was to  receive a fee of $2 million once the Raider stadium in Irwindale was completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Total of All Fees  </P> <P> In his statement, he acknowledged that for industrial and other projects he had  arranged over a 12-year period for Irwindale, he stands to receive a total fee  of about $6 million.  </P> <P> "To date, my projects will result in Irwindale receiving about $600 million . .  . and I will receive about 1% of that amount," he said. "That's not bad for a  city that had $25,000 in the bank 12 years ago."  </P> <P> Lyte said that for 12 years the mayor had insisted on such a fee arrangement  and "rejected a straight salary arrangement" suggested by Lyte. He noted that  part of his contract called for him to pay all his own expenses.  </P> <P> Miranda said in his statement that he understands "our city was about the only  city of the cities near us that paid anyone in the community redevelopment  agency on a commission basis to bring business into the city."  </P></p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / All at sea in the America's Cup: The wonderland world of international yachting politics WESTERN diplomats are not the only people agonising over what parts of the former Soviet Union to recognise and legitimise. In San Diego, officials of the forthcoming America's Cup are having to choose between rival entries from Leningrad - now St Petersburg - and Moscow. With only two weeks remaining until the first races of the three-month challenger elimination series, the St Petersburg group have a registered, paid-up Cup entry, but no boat, while Moscow has airfreighted its hi-tech 75 ft sloop to California but has no locus standi with the regatta's authorities. Tom Ehman, chief executive of the America's Cup organising committee, has written to the two sides urging the obvious compromise. However, a nation unable to agree on who controls its Black Sea fleet is in no hurry to harmonise over the America's Cup. Which brings one to the Croatian challenge. (The perfect correspondent to cover this year's America's Cup would be Lewis Carroll). Named Zara after an ancient Dalmatian city, the wooden boat - all other competitors have used carbon fibre construction - has reached a boatyard in Venice, courtesy of an Italian sailing enthusiast and fairy godfather named Marcon Cantoni. There Zara is likely to remain. The Yugoslav war and Cantoni's finances make that a near certainty. The America's Cup has always been an event for dreamers and romantics, but they need deep pockets. The actual racing begins next Tuesday when the two defender syndicates meet for the first of dozens of races between Stars &amp; Stripes and America3. Stars &amp; Stripes is skippered by Dennis Conner, the Cup's answer to Jack Nicklaus. No man has won the trophy more times, or expended more time and energy on its pursuit. Against him is Bill Koch, a patrician East Coast oil billionaire who took up yacht racing only in the mid-1980s. So far Koch has built three of the new America's Cup class yachts (one in complete secrecy at a US aerospace facility), acquired a 200-strong payroll and spent more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 27.4m) of his own money. Koch's obsession has become worthy of a gothic novel, in particular since he declines to let a professional helmsman take the wheel and intends to steer himself. It is owner participation without precedent at this level of sport. Does the Aga Khan ride in the Prix d'Arc de Triomphe, Gianni Agnelli drive a Ferrari at Monza? 'It's like letting Lee Iacocca race against Mario Andretti,' sighed one of Koch's crew during a recent practice regatta. Not that the 52-year-old skipper lacks practice, application or talent. His spare frame, clad in habitual white shorts, polo shirt and deck shoes, has spent hundreds of hours steering the yacht in practice races trying to lift himself from the level of the scratch golfer to someone who can stalk the greens with Faldo or Ballesteros. Koch is no softie. Five years ago he fought his brothers through two Dollars 17bn-a-year Koch Industries. Unforgiveable allegations were made in court. Bill Koch left with in excess of Dollars 600m compensation. 'The whole story would make the TV series Dallas or Dynasty look like a playpen. It was horrible to sit in court opposite your brothers and watch your family life disintegrate,' says Koch. He seems to use the saga as armour against those who predict that the brutalities of the Cup could destroy a rich amateur with his ego on the line. 'If I got through the court case, then the America's Cup should be fairly easy.' Of the challengers, who start racing on January 25, the Italian group Il Moro di Venezia and the New Zealanders are regarded as joint favourites. The series of three round robins followed by semi-finals and finals is once more sponsored to the tune of around Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.4m) by the French luggage company Louis Vuitton, now part owned by Guinness. Il Moro, skippered and led by French-American sailor Paul Cayard, have built a sequence of five yachts over the past two years. No design stone has been left unturned and the group has remained stable and purposeful: Anglo-Saxon characteristics that have never before featured highly in an Italian challenge for the Cup. Confident that he has a fast boat under his feet, Cayard is focussing on another opponent - Catalina Eddy. This is a meteorological system that begins over the eponymous island off Los Angeles and makes San Diego one of the hardest places in the world in which to predict the weather. Cayard reckons that a good many races this spring will be won or lost by a sudden wind shift. 'What are the syndicates doing to minimise the luck factor?,' asks Cayard. 'With as much as Dollars 50m on the line, is there going to be an accurate way to predict the wind?' Despite all the on-board computers and satellite met data faxed to the shore base, the answer seems to be No. According to Cayard, boats only 200 metres apart can often experience a 7-degree difference in wind direction and a one-knot difference in speed. He calls it scary but, for the minnows in the Cup fleet, this may be their chance to step over the highly-prepared Italians and Kiwis. Spirit of Australia, led by Iain Murray and Peter Gilmour, who created the Kookaburra campaign in the '86-'87 Cup, is 'poor' in Cup terms and running on a financial shoestring. Yet Murray's design finesse and Gilmour's fine intuitive helming must make them a good outside bet for the challenger finals. Of the other European teams, France is the best-funded and prepared but appears to have a slow boat and little time to fix it. Sweden is short of everything and Spain appears to be participating largely to celebrate the quintocentenary. Unfortunately, British participation consists largely of supplying gear to virtually every syndicate, plus the input of Welsh international helmsman Edward Warden Owen as coach to the New Zealand team. If the Kiwis win the Cup, perhaps Anglesey will mount a challenge for 1995? More Sport - Page XIII</p>

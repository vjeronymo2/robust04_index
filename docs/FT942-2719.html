			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Caracas Share prices rallied from a weak start to close up on the day after foreign buyers returned to the market. The Merinvest composite index added 2.1 per cent at 146.51, with Electricidad de Caracas climbing 9 bolivars to 388. Brokers attributed the recovery to buying by a couple of foreign institutions, and added that the banking crisis remained the main focus of concern. The rise in interest rates at the central bank's weekly auction of zero-coupon bonds on Wednesday was said to have had less effect than might have been expected.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a BELAPAN report, received at the  National Bank of Belarus, there remain today two fundamental  differences between the Republic of Belarus and the Russian  Federation on the question of the merger of the monetary,  credit, and financial systems of the two states. Belarus is  insisting that the payment notes of the National Bank of the  republic during the merger of the money systems should be  exchanged for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one. Russia  supports a rate of three Belarusian rubles to one Russian.    The second issue is that Belarus is making efforts to ensure  that Russia's domestic prices for energy sources and raw  materials after the merger of the money systems will also apply  to the territory of Belarus, while representatives of the  Russian Government do not agree with this.    It is thought that an attempt to overcome these differences  will be made today at the working meeting in Moscow of S.  Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of  Belarus, with B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation.  Taking part in the talks on the Belarusian side are Vice  Premier U. Zalamay and National Bank Board Chairman S.  Bagdankevich.</p>

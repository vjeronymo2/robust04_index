'Abd-al-Majid stressed the Arab League's  invitation to host all the concerned fraternal and friendly  parties that the sides signing the document believe should  attend. He also stressed the Arab League's support for all  efforts to end the crisis facing our country in order to draw up  sound bases and to build a modern Yemeni state.    On behalf of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, Foreign Minister Muhammad  Salim Basindwah today received a telephone call from Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, who expressed his  desire to see the document of accord signed at the Arab League  Headquarters in Cairo.    The foreign minister conveyed the greetings of the chairman  of the Presidential Council and informed him that, after failure  to sign the document in Yemen, the chairman of the Presidential  Council would have been pleased to see the Yemeni document of  pledge and accord document signed at the Arab League, if some  parties in the committee stemming from the expanded National  Dialogue Committee had not demanded that the signing ceremony  take place in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He said that the  General People's Congress leadership agreed to this demand, and,  therefore, it would be difficult to change the venue of the  planned signing ceremony, especially since the brother officials  in fraternal Jordan have begun preparations for the ceremony, in  addition to their commendable efforts.</p>

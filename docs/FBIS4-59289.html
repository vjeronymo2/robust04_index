			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the deputy foreign minister for  European and American affairs, a few minutes ago, our  correspondent asked him to give further details about the  espionage action by British agents against Iran.    During the interview, Mr. Va'ezi gave a detailed description  of the spying equipment installed at the Iranian Embassy in  London and how it was discovered, He also described the Foreign  Ministry's actions on the matter.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi,  if  possible please give our dear listeners more details on the  discovery of the British Government eavesdropping device at the  Iranian Embassy in London.    [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.  About two weeks ago, when tearing down a wall in the new Iranian  Embassy building in London, we discovered a bug installed and  realized that a bug had been placed there. With the discovery  of the bug, because of intelligence and operational  considerations, and in order to conduct further investigation,  we did not disclose the matter and continued our investigations  until it was made public yesterday.    The bug weighs about half a kilogram. A battery has been  fitted inside it. It has a number of parts and in effect acts  as a transmitter. In any case, this is the latest thing we can  announce in connection with the bug.    [Correspondent] Please tell us what measures the Iranian  Foreign Ministry has so far taken in response to this action of  the British Government?    [Va'ezi] After our investigation at the embassy was  concluded  the British Embassy's charge d'affaires in Tehran was summoned  today by the director general for Western Europe. A strong  protest was made against this action of the British Government.  We asked them to give us more explanations as quickly as  possible. In any case, future explanations by the British  Government will determine the next steps.    Basically, we consider this and the British Government's  behavior toward us as a weak point in our relations and in line  with Britain's overall policy on Iran.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.    [Va'ezi] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

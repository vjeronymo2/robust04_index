			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Direst warning yet on state of Russian oil industry The direst warning yet on the state of the Russian oil industry came yesterday from Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Shafranik, interviewed in Rossiskaya Gazeta, said that only an injection of Rbs3 trillion (Dollars 4.6bn) could stop a further production drop of 60m tonnes this year, from the present level of about 390m tonnes. Even with this investment, he said, production would fall by some 40m tonnes, previously said to be the worst estimate. Foreshadowing a strengthening role of the state in this sector, Mr Shafranik said that 'instead of disbanding ministries (in the energy sector) we must strengthen them and give them extra powers'. The Russian government is at present reorganising the oil sector under the control of five large, vertically-integrated state companies. Mr Shafranik, a former head of the main oil-producing region of Tyumen, revealed that 75 per cent of enterprises were technically bankrupt - but blamed a structure of pricing that made agriculture profitable and oil production unprofitable.</p>

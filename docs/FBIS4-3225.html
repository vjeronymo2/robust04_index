			<p>BFN     [Text] Changsha, April 19 (XINHUA) -- In south China's  Hunan Province 207 towns each achieved an output value of more  than 100 million yuan last year, 148 more than in 1992.    Encouraged by the central government's policy of speeding up  the construction of township enterprises in poorer areas, these  township enterprises are now introducing the shareholding system  and an export-oriented economy to the province.    In Santang town, Shuangfeng county, 242 joint-stock  enterprises were set up last year, yielding a total output value  of 160 million yuan.    A village near Xiumei town exported 60 million tons of  frozen  meat last year, earning more than six million U.S. dollars.    These enterprises have also made great efforts for  technological transformation.</p>

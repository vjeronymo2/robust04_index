			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S  </P> <P> California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the  world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change.  </P> <P> Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic  policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor,  but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people  built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others  brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness.  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s  makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A. W. CLAUSEN  </P> <P> A.W. (Tom) Clausen -- as BankAmerica Corp.'s once and future chief executive in  the 1980s -- was the architect both for one of the decade's biggest corporate  declines and one of its biggest comebacks.  </P> <P> He was blamed for many of BankAmerica's troubles earlier in the decade, such as  leaving its Bank of America unit with a huge portfolio of Latin American loans  that soured, as well as building an inefficient, bloated bank with an outmoded  computer system.  </P> <P> BankAmerica's problems went beyond those loans: Key executives left amid  turmoil, morale was low, the bank suffered an embarrassing mortgage scandal,  and its stock was battered on Wall Street. So vulnerable was BankAmerica that  First Interstate Bancorp launched an unsolicited $3.4-billion takeover bid in  late 1986 that BankAmerica ultimately fought off.  </P> <P> Yet it also was Clausen who returned to lead BankAmerica through a  Chrysler-like turnaround. Clausen, 66, had left BankAmerica, the San  Francisco-based parent of Bank of America, in 1981 to head the World Bank.  BankAmerica was a shambles when Clausen was asked by its board to return in  1986 to replace his successor, Samuel H. Armacost, who resigned under fire.  </P> <P> Under Clausen, BankAmerica became profitable again by slashing costs, improving  loan quality, selling assets and pushing consumer banking. More important,  Clausen brought in a team of key executives to work the turnaround, notably  former Seafirst Corp. President Richard M. Rosenberg, 59, who is now  BankAmerica vice chairman and the executive considered most likely to succeed  Clausen.  </P> <P> But the clout that BankAmerica once enjoyed worldwide has diminished from the  days when it was the nation's largest bank.  </P> <P> Clausen has not indicated when he may retire. Observers speculate that he may  leave in a year or two. JAMES BATES  </P></p>

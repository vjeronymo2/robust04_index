			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GURU' EDUCATION  </P> <P> I read with interest "The Gurus" by Russ Wiles (May 6) concerning the role  consultants play in assisting residential developers in their most critical  decisions on where, when and what to build.  </P> <P> Wiles correctly noted "there are no qualifying exams or required educational  prerequisites to enter the consulting field."  </P> <P> This is true, but your readers might like to know that the American Society of  Real Estate Counselors, founded 37 years ago and a professional affiliate of  the National Assn. of Realtors, is dedicated to enhancing the quality of advice  available to the public on property matters.  </P> <P> Membership in the society and the CRE (Counselor of Real Estate) designation is  awarded only after an extensive evaluation of a real estate counselor by his  peers. It recognizes than an individual has demonstrated judgment, integrity  and experience in real estate counseling matters and client service. Obtaining  the services of a CRE assures the user of securing unbiased,  non-contingent-based advice.  </P> <P> Your readers may contact the society at 430 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill.  60611, or calling (312) 329-8427.  </P> <P> EUGENE P. CARVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNING FLAGS ON AIDS  </P> <P> The World Health Organization is calling for a broader commitment to the  efforts to contain the AIDS pandemic, warning that flagging interest is raising  the risk of a more rapid spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that  causes the disease. It is a timely notice, coming as it does when many  Americans seem to be paying less attention to the problem.  </P> <P> "The gap between the pace of the epidemic and the prevention and control  efforts is threatening to widen," according to Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of  the WHO Global Program on AIDS. "Even though we can say today for the first  time that activities against AIDS are now under way in every country in the  world, we are locked in a race for control of an epidemic as fatal as any the  world has ever known."  </P> <P> WHO calculates that 5 million have been infected by HIV, that 600,000 have  developed AIDS, that more than 300,000 have died. By the year 2000, the  HIV-infected population will rise to 15 million, with the AIDS case total at 6  million and the cumulative death toll at more than 3 million. Those numbers  could prove too low, however, if the epidemic takes hold in Asia. And,  according to Dr. Mann, they might be reduced by 1 million if there is a  toughening of national programs.  </P> <P> Estimates of the global AIDS case load are continuously being revised, and,  without exception, they are being revised upwards, measuring the gravity of the  situation. A study by world experts of that case load in May estimated a total  of 375,000 AIDS cases. By June, however, Mann had revised that figure to  480,000. And in recent testimony to the National AIDS Commission, he further  revised the estimate to 600,000.  </P> <P> In the absence of a cure, the only control is through prevention. But education  and prevention programs, including sex education and distribution of condoms,  have been lagging. There are particular threats of a spread of the disease now  among the 5 million intravenous drug users scattered around the world, and  among the 100 million persons who each year contract sexually transmitted  diseases.  </P> <P> "Societies are still reluctant to confront the underlying problems which create  and enhance vulnerability to AIDS," according to Dr. Mann. "This entails  tackling problems such as drug use, access to health services, discrimination,  prostitute-client relationships and education of young people about sex."  </P> <P> Mann warned in particular about the dangers of discrimination against people  with behaviors that increase the risk of HIV infection or who have contracted  the virus. "Ignoring discrimination may be politically expedient but it is  dangerous to society and to public health," he affirmed.  </P> <P> Global efforts are now characterized by a widening gap between what rich  countries can do, extending the lives of infected persons with costly  treatments, and what the poor nations are able to do, he noted. "The combined  AIDS expenditures for California and New York exceed the resources currently  available for AIDS in the entire developing world."  </P> <P> But even in California, his counsel leaves no room for complacency. There is  continued resistance to the kinds of education programs likely to be most  effective in containing the spread of the virus at the critical points: Among  young people, minorities, and intravenous drug users.  </P></p>

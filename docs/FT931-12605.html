			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (9): Hotel guests spoilt for choice - Why Leeds needs to develop itself as a tourist destination NEVER before has Leeds had an oversupply of hotel rooms. But, by the end of next year, that is what it is about to get. The stock of good quality bedrooms for international business travellers will then have increased by nearly 80 per cent in 10 years. The city centre's present stock is just under 1,000 rooms. The Marriott chain will open a 245-bedroom hotel in September and the Copthorne will join the market with 150 new bedrooms 12 months later. The prospect of oversupply seems to have awakened the Leeds Hotels Association to the need for better, co-ordinated joint marketing. The advent of new tourist attractions such as the Royal Armouries and Tetley's brewing industry visitor centre will help fill some rooms at weekends, but the city has now embarked on a critical self-examination about what else it has to offer. One of Leeds' problems is that it winds down rapidly in the early evening. This in part a consequence of many affluent people living outside the city in attractive, easily accessible countryside or towns such as Harrogate, Otley and Wetherby, but it is also a function of size. At about 750,000 people in the conurbation, the market is less than a third the size of Greater Manchester's, which consequently has a livelier night-life, a wider range of entertainment and leisure, and the 'feel' of a 24-hour city. Leeds is not short of good theatre and culture but lacks a critical mass. Good restaurants, such as La Grillade, Sous le Nez, 42 The Calls and the new Leodis, could compete anywhere in the world, but walking through the city at night is often a lonely experience. 'Leeds has always been seen as a business destination but it can - and must  -also develop itself as a tourist destination,' says Mr Robert Kirby, general manager of the Bass group's Holiday Inn and a driving force of the hotels association. Mr Kirby says the hotels, city council, industry, commerce, the two universities and the Royal Armouries must work together on marketing. The association wants to see a conference and exhibition centre developed. It would cost about Pounds 15m and would probably have to be built near the Hilton Hotel - not far from the Tetley project and the Royal Armouries. The Hilton, with 210 bedrooms, will remain Leeds' biggest hotel until the Marriott opens this year. It has long scored over rivals - such as the Queens at Central Station and the Metropole in the commercial quarter - by being 'modern', but while competition has forced refurbishment of older hotels, the general shortage of rooms has been a cushion for all. The Holiday Inn - which opened three years ago - has provided a foretaste of intensifying rivalry, as has the development of 41 The Calls - with a good restaurant next door - in formerly derelict warehouses along the River Aire. Mr Kirby says that despite recession, Holiday Inn achieved 65 per cent occupancy in 1992 at an average of Pounds 65 per room, net of VAT. Occupancy rates were 52 per cent and 45 per cent in the two previous years. On the way, Mr Kirby picked up six quality or training awards. He is now urging the association to spearhead a total quality management drive throughout the city, involving hotels, restaurants, shops and even taxis. By tying in with Leeds training and enterprise council, he thinks the hotels should also be able to help upgrade skills throughout the service sector. He trained initially as a chef at North Lindsay College, Humberside, a centre of excellence in food industry education, but learned about quality through working in Switzerland and Italy. 'We hope the oversupply will be absorbed as Leeds comes out of recession,' he says, 'but we have to help things along by improving what we offer to both the business and tourist markets. 'There is a huge potential for tourism, which the new developments will highlight, but we cannot sit back and wait for things to happen. The road to excellence is always under construction.'</p>

In the second project period which began in 1991, emphasis was placed on providing training of health care professionals in the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection. Currently, HRSA funds 17 AETCs. As of June 1994, over 400,000 health professionals had received training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1995, the National AETC Program will focus the majority of resources on those Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs) with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS; however, consideration will be given to AETCs in rural areas. The AETCs will be required to spend the majority of their funds on information dissemination and the training (especially clinical training) of primary care health professionals, including physicians, registered nurses, dentists, physician assistants, nurses with advanced training (e.g., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and nurse midwives) and dental hygienists. Additionally, the AETCs will focus on mental health providers and allied health personnel. Emphasis will be placed on training in Ryan White CARE ACT programs and health professional schools and academic health centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $16,287,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that approximately 10 to 15 new awards will be made ranging from $500,000 to $2,500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

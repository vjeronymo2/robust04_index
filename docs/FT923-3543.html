			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / How dreams turned to dust: Two of Scandinavia's insurers have fallen victim to the effects of deregulation Life is full of surprises' has proved a grimly prophetic advertising slogan for Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, which last month sought protection from its creditors. Scandinavian financiers and regulators have been shocked by the deterioration in the fortunes of two of their biggest insurance companies, the latest victims of turmoil in the financial markets. The upheaval is in part a result of the forces unleashed when the markets were deregulated in the 1980s. Insurers, like the banks which experienced difficulties last year, have struggled to come to terms with deregulation, lost money on credit insurance and suffered from the general fall in confidence this year in Scandinavian property and equities. Their problems are vividly illustrated by the story of two men: Mr Jan Erik Langangen, the ousted head of Uni Storebrand, and Mr Per Villum Hansen, his counterpart at Denmark's Hafnia, who dreamed of creating financial conglomerates big enough to withstand competition from bigger rivals as Europe's internal trade barriers came down. Uni Storebrand and Hafnia have been pushed to the brink of collapse by the ill-fated efforts of their leaders to merge or take over two companies, Skandia of Sweden and Baltica of Denmark. During 1990 Mr Hansen built up a DKr4.5bn (Pounds 418m) stake in Baltica, controlling more than 34 per cent of Denmark's biggest insurance company. In the same year Mr Langangen merged Uni and Storebrand, creating Norway's biggest insurance company. Last autumn he persuaded Mr Hansen to join a scheme to take over control of Skandia, and by November 1991 they had spent more than SKr7bn (Pounds 688m) for a combined stake of nearly 43 per cent of the Stockholm-based insurer. But neither Baltica nor Skandia was keen on linking with smaller rivals. The resulting market uncertainty led to sharp falls in Skandia and Baltica's share prices, leaving Uni Storebrand and Hafnia nursing significant investment losses. Last month Hafnia joined Uni Storebrand in seeking protection from its creditors. 'In the eyes of the world there must be something seriously wrong,' says a senior banker in Copenhagen. 'But the insurance business is not a catastrophe. Speculation is the problem. Uni and Hafnia have been destroyed by tycoons.' Mr Per Villum Hansen, the 46-year-old chief executive of Hafnia who resigned in April, fits the tycoon bill most neatly. He is described by industry colleagues as a 'natural gambler'. A racehorse owner and a regular at the Sunday meetings at the Klampenborg racetrack near Copenhagen, Mr Hansen wanted to use the financial muscle of Hafnia to transform Danish corporate life. The son of a provincial blacksmith, he joined Hafnia's finance department in 1976 after a spell in the finance department of AP Moeller, the blue chip Danish shipping and energy company. After he took over as chief executive in 1980, Hafnia stepped up its investments in equities. In Scandinavia's bull markets of the 1980s the company's assets grew strongly, from DKr35.8bn to DKr58.2bn between 1987 and 1990. Mr Hansen also spearheaded a diversification at the traditionally conservative company, establishing a real estate operation and a merchant bank in the late 1980s, which worked on two successful ventures - M D Foods, a dairy company, and Tulip, a meat producer - to develop part of the country's agribusiness industry. When Mr Hansen turned his attention to Baltica, he had become a powerful figure in Denmark's financial scene. For the company's biggest shareholders, Mr Hansen could do no wrong. 'The board had complete confidence in this guy. He was admired like a small god,' says one insurance industry observer. By contrast Mr Langangen, the 42-year-old boss of Uni Storebrand until July, is regarded as a visionary whose aims reflect his links with the public sector and government. Mr Langangen honed his management style at Statoil, the country's publicly owned oil company, which has enjoyed almost limitless resources to finance its expansion. There, he forged close links with government, especially with Labour party prime minister Gro Harlem Bruntland, to promote the merger of Storebrand - a company which he joined in 1983 - with Uni. An expert on Norwegian classical literature who frequently quotes its most famous playwright, Henrik Ibsen, Mr Langangen persuaded the government that Uni Storebrand's expansion plans were in the interests of the Norwegian economy and could help the country redress Sweden's traditional domination of Scandinavia. Despite their differences, the two men decided to co-operate in their joint bid to take over Skandia. All the expansion plans - including Uni's merger with Storebrand and Hafnia's assault on Baltica - were based on the idea that big was not only beautiful but necessary for survival in post-1992 Europe. 'If Hafnia hadn't done anything we would simply have been run over by the European competition,' explains a colleague of Mr Hansen at Hafnia. The aims of the two were summed up in a simple slogan: 'If you are strong you can choose. If you are weak you will be chosen.' The Skandia deal, however, was an unprecedented gamble. First, by acquiring such a big combined stake in Skandia, both Uni Storebrand and Hafnia became increasingly dependent on the region's insurance market, both as insurance companies and investors. At the end of 1991 Hafnia's combined investments in Skandia and Baltica of more than DKr7bn were almost double its shareholders' equity of DKr3.9bn. In addition, Skandia's unusual shareholding structure - in which voting rights are restricted - made it a high-risk target. The provision limiting the maximum votes of any shareholder to 30 meant, according to one analyst, that even after acquiring more than 40 per cent of the shares, Uni and Hafnia had 'no more votes than the Skandia typing pool'. Moreover, neither Mr Hansen nor Mr Langangen discussed his ideas with Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive. Mr Wolrath says there was no contact with Uni Storebrand before September 1991 when Mr Langangen told him by telephone that he had acquired 11.4 per cent of the company's share capital. In October Mr Wolrath went to a meeting of Skandia's 'major shareholders' in Oslo. But in what was evidently a bad-tempered meeting, little progress was made. 'Nothing was presented on the plans and ideas of Uni Storebrand. It made the meeting completely useless,' says Mr Wolrath. 'Mr Langangen was extremely pushy. He had all the answers. He had a study drawn up by management consultants and said we could just get on and implement it.' Three weeks later, in November last year, Uni Storebrand and Hafnia completed their purchase of 43 per cent of Skandia's shares and held a press conference to announce the formation of what they termed 'Nordic Co-operation'. Mr Langangen and Mr Hansen calculated that Mr Wolrath would, at least, cede a minimum of three seats on Skandia's 14-man board to the new investors. But that proved a disastrous mistake. Even though relations thawed when talks between the three companies continued in December, the disagreement and confusion served to frighten off investors. By the time the three companies came close to agreeing a joint strategy in April, based on the complete integration of all three companies' Nordic operations, the markets had already baulked at the notion of Scandinavian insurance co-operation. Uni Storebrand and Hafnia had acquired their Skandia shares at an average price of more than SKr200. By April this year the price had sunk to SKr123, leaving both Uni Storebrand and Hafnia with investment losses totalling almost SKr3bn. Disgruntled international investors were in no mood to provide the fresh capital necessary to push through a merger, however. Mr Jonathan Walker of Baring Securities says: 'Our clients are not interested in Scandinavian financials at any price.' Mr Johan Hiller, the investor relations manager of Skandia, says the affair has paralysed the markets. 'Everything has been forgotten apart from who controls Skandia. It's a soap opera in a way.' Worse was to come. In April Skandia agreed a complex financial deal which would have given it majority control of Hafnia. The deal fell through when Hafnia's shareholders objected at the imposition of Swedish control. Instead, they agreed a restructuring, sacked Mr Hansen and sought to recapitalise through a DKr2bn rights issue. The financial markets were unimpressed. The share prices of all four companies continued to slide. Skandia sank to a new low of SKr91.50 in July. Baltica's share price fell from DKr790 at the beginning of last November to DKr458 by the end of June, compounding Hafnia's problems. Fresh investment losses at Hafnia stemming from the overall fall in Scandinavian equity markets wiped out the whole of the new capital within six weeks. By last month the liabilities of both Hafnia and Uni Storebrand exceeded their assets, and both companies were forced to suspend payments to creditors. Creditors, shareholders and state-appointed administrators now have a few months in which to sell the companies' assets. If they are unsuccessful, a long and complex liquidation of life insurance and non-life insurance operations is in prospect. Critics accuse Mr Langangen and Mr Hansen of overambition. Skandia's Mr Wolrath says they had a false impression of their own power. 'They were so big in their home markets that they thought they were Batman.' But defenders of the two men point to deeper causes. A former colleague of Mr Langangen says domestic media reaction reflected Norwegian suspicion of individual achievement and entrepreneurship. 'It shows that what Norwegians call Jante Loven is alive and well,' he says, referring to a fictional moral code devised by the Scandinavian novelist, Aksel Sandemose. The code, which governs social relations in a Norwegian rural community of Jante, has among its commandments: 'Don't think you are something because you are not; don't think you are wiser than us; don't imply that you are better than us.'</p>

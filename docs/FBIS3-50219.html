Before flying to Moscow, Urban had talked about buying  supplies of military technology worth "over $50 million." The  precise sum and the sort of technology to be bought would be  decided by experts from both countries over the coming weeks,  Urban said, adding that the Slovak Army had been already using  the same technology this year. Urban said that during his  Moscow talks there was no sign of the crisis which has arisen  around the reorganization of the Russian Government. He met  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, and together they  signed a plan for military cooperation between the two countries  for this year, which covers about 20 joint actions.    The plan was not part of the Partnership for Peace, Urban  said, because the Russian-Slovak military agreement had been  concluded before this year's NATO Summit in Brussels.    On November 30 last year Slovakia and the Russian Federation  signed a protocol on "The achievement of an agreement concerning  the partial reduction of the debts of the former Soviet Union  and the Russian Federation towards the Slovak Republic in the  form of supplies of special technology." On the basis of this  agreement, in December Slovakia bought weapons and military  technology worth $180 million. The main items were five Russian  MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for various types of  weapon.    During his November visit to Moscow, Slovak Defense Minister  Imrich Andrejcak stressed that Moscow was not capable of paying  debts, and the Paris agreements allowed its debts to be shelved  until 1996. "It is really a concession on the part of the  Russians that they are willing to write off the supply from the  debt, and it suits us," Andrejcak said.    After the division of the former Czechoslovakia, the former  Soviet Union's debts to Slovakia amounted to approximately $1.5  billion.</p>

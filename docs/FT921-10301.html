			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Baker calls on Senate to ratify arms treaty MR James Baker, US secretary of state, yesterday urged the US Senate to support swift ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction treaty with the former Soviet Union. In testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Baker said the treaty was vital to build stability between the US and the Commonwealth of Independent States by 'locking in' agreements to slash each sides' arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons. Mr Baker also appealed to senators to support the administration's plans for acting collectively with other countries to help the former Soviet republics make the break from seven decades of communism and central planning. 'It is a once in a century opportunity,' said Mr Baker. These words appeared aimed at staving off criticism at home and abroad that the administration has been too timid in offering help to the republics. In his testimony, Mr Baker rejected suggestions that the administration should incorporate the latest nuclear arms reductions proposed by President George Bush and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in an amended and updated version of the Start treaty. The Start treaty - negotiated over nine years - was signed last summer. It would cut US offensive nuclear weapons by almost 30 per cent to about 9,000 warheads; Soviet strategic weapons would drop by almost 40 per cent, to about 8,000 warheads. Mr Baker also told the committee that China might be about to commit itself to observing the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international pact to block the spread of ballistic missiles. He said such a move would be a 'major step forward' on US proliferation concerns.</p>

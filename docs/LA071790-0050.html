			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISABLED DEMONSTRATE AT DEUKMEJIAN'S HOME  </P> <P> More than 150 people, many of them disabled, picketed Gov. George Deukmejian's  Long Beach home Monday morning to protest proposed state budget cuts in funding  for the disabled.  </P> <P> The protesters, some in wheelchairs, complained that Deukmejian wants to slash  state support for 26 Independent Living Centers operating throughout  California.  </P> <P> The centers offer support services for the disabled, helping them seek jobs and  housing and teaching them to live on their own.  </P> <P> "Don't balance your budget on our lives," proclaimed one poster carried by a  woman in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> The centers get $5 million a year, or about a third of their annual budget,  from the state, according to Norma Jean Vescovo, executive director of the  Independent Living Centers of Southern California.  </P> <P> The proposed cut is one of many being considered in Sacramento as the governor  and legislators wrestle to close a yawning budget deficit.  </P></p>

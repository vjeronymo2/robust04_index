			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 7 ITAR-TASS -- The press secretary of  the president of the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Kostikov  issued a statement today, which says:    "Emotions prevailed over politics in the course of  discussion  of the question about the procurator-general in the Federation  Council. This is characteristic of Russia's fresh state  institutions. "But real facts exist apart from emotions.    "It is a reality that Aleksey I. Kazannik tendered his  resignation of his own free will.    "It is a reality that the president accepted his resignation  and named a new candidate for the post.    "These realities cannot be ignored.    "Hence, it is necessary to look for a way out of the  situation.    "A situation of vacuum or double power cannot be allowed to  emerge in the sphere of prosecutorship. This blocks the entire  system of prosecuting activity at a time when the country is  engulfed by a wave of crime. It will be difficult to make clear  to the people why an impasse appeared in which the Federation  Council has found itself. The prestige of this body can suffer  as a result.    "The Federation Council cannot be permitted to become the  initiator of political braking at a moment when Russia has begun  its movement toward concord.    "One would like to believe that the Federation Council will  act proceeding primarily from the supreme interests of the  state. The possibilities for this are far from exhaustion."</p>

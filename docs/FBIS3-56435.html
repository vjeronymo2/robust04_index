			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 January -- Yegor Gaydar confirmed today  that the main reason for his resignation was "the lack of levers  of influence." In an interview for the "Itogi" television  program he stressed: "One should either do one's job or admit  that you are unable to do it." Nonetheless, neither Yegor  Gaydar nor the Russia's Choice bloc, which he heads, intend to  join the opposition, believing it "possible to support  constructive dialogue with the government." Explaining his  decision to leave the cabinet, Yegor Gaydar said: "This will  stimulate the government to focus more on adopting responsible  decisions and will force it to tackle the need to curb  inflation, because now this is the responsibility of the  government and Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, and not of  Gaydar."    The view of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was heard on the same  television program. He said that Gaydar's departure from the  government was political rather than economic. "In September  Yegor Timurovich was invited in as a decorative figure to adorn  the government for a period of very difficult change. Now that  the main political gestures have been made, the decor can be  changed."</p>

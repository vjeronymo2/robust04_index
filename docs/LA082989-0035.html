			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The campaign to replace the late Claude Pepper in Congress wound down with a  poll by WSCV-TV in Miami showing a virtual dead heat between Republican Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen and Democrat Gerald F. Richman. If she wins today's special  election to fill the 18th Congressional District seat held for 27 years by  Pepper, Ros-Lehtinen, a state senator, would become the first Cuban-American  voted into Congress. In the survey of 301 likely voters, Richman, a Miami Beach  lawyer, received 47% of the vote, while Ros-Lehtinen had 45% and 8% were  undecided. The poll carried a margin of error of 5 percentage points. Among  black and Jewish voters, Richman's support neared 80%. Among white non-Latino  voters, he enjoyed a 2-1 edge. Ros-Lehtinen drew support from 86% of Latino  voters.  </P></p>

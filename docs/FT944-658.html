			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei down 1.6% as institutions sell Tokyo was closed to mark the Emperor's birthday, and other Asia Pacific markets were also in holiday mood. TAIPEI was sharply lower, following Thursday's consolidation, on last-minute selling by institutions of previously overbought stocks. The weighted index fell 107.73 or 1.6 per cent to 6,857.95, for a 0.6 per cent fall on the week. Turnover shrank to TDollars 85.3bn from Thursday's TDollars 114bn. Steels encountered heavy profit-taking, with China Steel down TDollars 1.3 to TDollars 31.2. Late selling also focused on textile issues that had supported the market in earlier sessions. Hualon was down 80 cents to TDollars 38.3. SEOUL saw sharp early gains wiped out as institutional investors unloaded large quantities of shares on rumours of a Won2,000bn central bank issue of monetary bonds to absorb liquidity. The composite index ended 0.35 ahead at 1,040.55, after a high of 1,053.95, and for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. Investors showed little response to a cabinet reshuffle announced about half an hour ahead of the close because, according to one dealer, most of the current economic ministers were retained. HONG KONG fell on profit-taking, after four days of rises, in thin trading in the absence of Japanese buyers. The Hang Seng index lost 100.78 to 8,311.88, for a 1.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was a meagre HKDollars 1.72bn, the third-lowest this year, against HKDollars 3.26bn on Thursday. KUALA LUMPUR fell prey to profit-taking and a lack of buying which sent the composite index down for the first time this week. The index lost 5.47 to 988.87, but was still 4.4 per cent higher on the week. Brokers said some investors were still optimistic about the market's prospects, although the index had met strong resistance at the 1,000 level. The utilities stocks, Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional, which performed strongly in recent days, pulled back as institutional buying quietened down. Telekom fell 40 cents to MDollars 18.0 and Tenaga lost 10 cents to MDollars 10.60. Yeo Hiap Seng rose 25 cents to MDollars 8.55 after its 'designated security' status was lifted. SYDNEY edged ahead in light volume of just 95m shares after Wall Street's continued rally. The All Ordinaries index ended 1.1 higher at 1,909.3 for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week. BHP added 10 cents to ADollars 19.72 in active trade after its ADRs closed firmer in New York. CRA was 2 cents higher at ADollars 17.82. On Thursday, the company said it had moved nearer to closing the Southern Copper smelter and refinery by buying out the other shareholders and booking an abnormal loss of ADollars 115m. MANILA was pulled lower by a mild selldown in blue chips as investors lightened their portfolios ahead of the Christmas holiday. The composite index fell 21.57 to 2,785.50, for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week, as foreign funds took quick profits, while local investors who were left behind by the weakening of the market in the past weeks have started to lighten up their portfolios. BOMBAY picked up as sentiment improved after the resignation of three ministers named in two national scandals. The BSE 30-share index rose 26.69 to 3926.90 for a 0.4 per cent fall on the week. Brokers said that the ministers' resignation was seen to have restored the prime minister's credibility in the ruling Congress party, which lost heavily in recent regional polls. SINGAPORE edged down, with light buying of some key stocks helping to shore up the market. The 30-share Straits Times Industrials index edged down 0.30 to 2,219.29 for a 2.3 per cent rise on the week. BANGKOK was slightly lower, the SET index losing 2.95 to 1,361.35 for a 1.9 per cent rise on the week. Thai Airways was Bt2 higher at Bt55 on news of the appointment of a new chairman.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Egypt fund from Framlington Framlington, the UK fund management group, yesterday announced the launch of a closed-end fund which will invest in Egypt, one of the fastest-growing emerging stock markets during the last year. The New Egypt Fund, which is to raise between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m, is one of a number of recent initiatives aiming to capitalise on opportunities in North Africa and the Middle East, opened by liberalisation and privatisation programmes. New Egypt follows the launch last month of Framlington's Maghreb Fund, which raised Dollars 30.5m for investment in Tunisia and Morocco.</p>

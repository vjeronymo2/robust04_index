This military-political alliance, established at  the end of the 1940's to provide for the collective defense of  Western Europe under U.S. leadership from a possible "invasion  of communism from the East," has presently fulfilled its main  historical mission. It would seem logical, with the dissolution  of the Warsaw Pact, disintegration of the USSR, and  disappearance of the threat of invasion, that we might expect  the disbandment of NATO as well. Adherents of this point of view  are to be found in the West, including in the United States.    However, the voices of those who are fighting for  preservation of the bloc, its transformation, and even expansion  and adaptation to the new realities of postcommunist Europe, are  ringing out with far greater volume. What arguments and  proposals are being advanced in this regard? To what extent do  they conform to reality and to Russia's interests? What kind of  policy can the Russian Federation have with respect to NATO?    This article makes an attempt to find answers to these  questions. Serving as a starting point for the search is the  work of American analysts R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee  from the well-known RAND research corporation--"Building a New  NATO," recently published in the journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  (Footnote 1) (FOREIGN AFFAIRS, September-October 1993, p. 28-40)  The arguments of proponents of preservation of the bloc are  propounded most clearly and concisely here.  <H5>  Arguments `For' </H5>   American analysts justify the need for maintaining the  alliance proceeding from a unique understanding of the problems  of European security in the postcommunist era. In their view,  threats to security on the European continent are at present  issuing chiefly from two "arcs of crisis," "zones of  instability"--eastern and southern. The eastern arc encompasses  the area between Germany and Russia, from Northern Europe to  Turkey, the Caucasus, and Asia Minor. The southern arc--Northern  Africa, the Mediterranean Sea region, Near East, and Southwest  Asia.    The greatest danger is presented by the eastern arc, whose  states have been oversaturated with arms following the collapse  of the USSR. They are unstable, infected with "aggressive  nationalism," and at the same time incapable of defending  themselves. "Central and Eastern Europe are saturated with  potential mini-Weimar Republics, each of which is capable of  unleashing an avalanche of violence upon the others," the  authors write.    In addition, there exist strong fears with respect to a  rebirth of imperial Russia, which itself is manifesting signs of  instability and a possible shift to the right. All this, in the  opinion of the American analysts, demands that the structure of  security in the region be preserved.    In what manner, according to the authors' concept, should  the  West react to the most dangerous challenges? They believe a  "general strategy" must be developed for "the propagation of  collective defense, democracy, and security along the arcs of  crisis."    The obvious instrument for implementation of such a strategy  is NATO. In the opinion of the authors, the Persian Gulf War and  the crisis in Yugoslavia have shown that the European Community  (EC) is incapable of handling such a task, insofar as consensus  among the 12 EC member states is virtually unattainable. Even  less suitable for such a role is the Conference for Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which consists of 53 members.  "Only NATO, with its tested command structure, developed  logistics network, and effective arsenal, is capable of dealing  with challenges to the security of Europe following the  conclusion of the Cold War," the authors believe. But if NATO is  unable to accomplish its mission, its existence will then be all  the more inappropriate.    In order to implement such a strategy, in the view of the  American analysts, certain significant steps must be carried out.    First and foremost, NATO, as an organization based on a need  for collective security against a specific threat, must be  transformed into an alliance directed towards the propagation of  democracy, stability, and regulation of crises in the broad  strategic sense.    A second measure, directed towards realization of the  "general strategy," must be the conclusion of a new  "trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western  Europe, i.e., intensification of the role of the European states  within the framework of the alliance, in other words, the  "Europe-ization" of NATO. To this end, the United States will  have to abandon its ambiguous attitude towards European  integration within the EC framework. It will have to support  this more energetically and thus encourage a more active role  for France, which does not recognize American hegemony in Europe  and without whose consent it will be impossible to transform  NATO.    In addition, to successfully transform the bloc the authors  believe it is necessary to have a strong Germany, more  interested than any other party in maintaining the stability of  its eastern borders. The political leaders in Bonn should  abandon their present passive role. Germany should be actively  included in ground operations outside the borders of NATO's  "zone of responsibility."    The American political experts believe that another  important  means of transforming NATO is expansion to the east, primarily  by virtue of including within it states of the "Visegrad  group"--Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and possibly  Slovakia. These countries must be simultaneously included within  the EC. Entry into NATO can be accomplished gradually, in  stages, and non-simultaneously.    The authors understand that until now the West has related  negatively to the possibility of NATO moving eastward out of  fears of encroaching upon Russia's security interests. In their  concept, however, the attitude of the Russian Federation towards  possible expansion of the alliance by virtue of the former  socialist countries would depend only on Russia itself. They  write: "Expansion of the alliance to the east should be  perceived more as a step taken by the West towards Russia than  as a step taken against it. As a partner to the West, Russia  could play a decisive role as a pillar of security and stability  in Europe and Asia. Whether expansion of NATO to the east  becomes a new offer of partnership or a step towards formation  of an anti-Russia alliance depends almost exclusively on the  outcome of internal transformations in Russia itself... But  turning the future NATO into a hostage to the outcome of Russian  transformations--is a way to eliminate the alliance."    The authors believe that development of a "constructive  policy" with respect to Ukraine is an important step in  "movement eastward." In their view, in light of the  indeterminate nature of prospects for democracy in Russia and  the geopolitical position of Ukraine as "an important strategic  buffer between Europe and Russia," Ukraine is "the best  guarantee against a Russian imperial rebirth, bearing in mind  Eastern Europe and especially Poland." The West therefore "must  strongly resist any attempt by Russia to again incorporate  Ukraine" within any kind of confederation. The Europe-ization of  Ukraine must also be encouraged--the development of close ties  between Ukraine and Central Europe, Ukraine's entry into common  European and regional structures.    These, in abbreviated form, are the main arguments and  proposals of the American analysts regarding the need for  possible transformation of the NATO bloc at this time.  <H5>  Interests of the United States </H5>   If we are to critically analyze the main provisions of the  article written by RAND researchers, the first thing that  strikes us is the farfetched nature of their assertions--as  though the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern  Europe represent just about the main threat to European security  in the postcommunist era, constituting a kind of regional powder  keg ready to explode at any moment.    It is entirely inappropriate to compare these countries with  minor versions of Germany at the time of the Weimar Republic.  There, as we know, a fragile democracy was unable to confront  the rise of militant German chauvinism, and this led in the  final analysis to the emergence of a fascist dictatorship  inimical to the West. We also know that in addition to  everything else, this German fascism was the reaction of Germans  to the colossal national degradation they experienced as a  result of their defeat in the First World War.    The fall of the communist dictatorships in the countries of  Eastern Europe was accompanied by directly opposing  processes--emancipation, the rectification of nations, the  acquisition of their proper dignity, clearly pro-Western  tendencies. If here and there there have been flare-ups of  "aggressive nationalism," these have been mainly anti-Russian in  orientation, which aspect is explained by decades of Soviet  domination. Therefore, a view of these countries as potentially  fascist mini-dictatorships simply fails to conform to reality.    Naturally there exists among the former socialist countries  certain friction and contradictions, and there is the threat of  their "Balkanization." But if we compare the degree of intensity  of these contradictions with the levels of conflict and national  irreconcilability in the former Yugoslavia, or in the Caucasus,  where we see underway the bloodshed of interethnic wars, it is  then clear even to the casual observer that this is on the whole  a fairly prosperous and tranquil region. The peaceful division  of Czechoslovakia without conflict into two sovereign states  provides further confirmation of this.    Why do the American analysts need to artificially demonize  the former European socialist countries to such an extent? It is  not difficult to find the answer if we proceed primarily from  the "national interests" of the United States in Europe.    NATO always was not only an organization for ensuring  collective defense, but also a major instrument for  domination--hegemony, if you will, of the United States in  Europe. The preservation of NATO following conclusion of the  Cold War is necessary primarily, according to the proponents of  such a point of view, to avoid losing the role of leadership in  European affairs. This explains to a significant degree the  energetic search by the Americans for various new pretexts and  justifications for prolonging the existence of the bloc. This  search includes establishment of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, a distinctive forum for discussion of security issues  which the former socialist countries and states of the CIS have  joined; adoption of resolutions on the possible conduct by NATO  of peacemaking missions by mandate of the United Nations or  CSCE; the striving of the leadership of the alliance to effect  release from control by the United Nations, in particular with  respect to the possible conduct of operations in Bosnia and  Herzegovina. (Footnote 2) (See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September  1993; SEGODNYA, 23 September 1993)    It is in this vein that we find the proposal of R. Asmus, R.  Kugler, and S. Larrabee on the movement of NATO eastward to join  the "Visegrad Group." It appears that the deliberate  demonization of these countries is just a means of concealing  their true intentions--of maintaining the dominant role of the  United States in Europe. It should be noted that these proposals  are supported most energetically by Germany which, as has been  noted, is interested more than others in the stability of this  region, and by the leadership of the alliance, in particular its  Secretary General M. Woerner, who has expressed support for the  swift joining of Poland and the Czech Republic but called for a  more cautious approach with respect to Hungary and Slovakia,  which are categorized as "regions of potential disturbances on  ethnic grounds."    Membership of these countries in NATO is advantageous to  Washington at present, insofar as the geopolitical situation  makes them interested to a significant degree in preserving the  bloc and in maintaining the dominant role of the United States  in it. Historically these states found themselves in the sphere  of geopolitical confrontation between Germany and Russia. Today  they fear not only a threat on the part of Russia, but on the  part of the West as well--though to a lesser degree--in the form  of a possible revival of Bonn's hegemonist aspirations. They  view the United States and NATO as a counterweight and  protection from the one as well as the other. It is from this  consideration that the striving of these countries to join the  alliance quickly proceeds.    American analysts do not hide the interest of the United  States in the former socialist countries. They write: "Their  inclusion in NATO would strengthen the Atlantic orientation of  the alliance and would ensure more significant internal support  for U.S. positions on key security issues." At the same time  they strive to present this as an unessential, secondary factor.    With the end of the Cold War, the American Congress has  appreciably reduced the military budget. The pull-out of  American troops from Europe is proceeding fairly intensively and  certain military bases and facilities are being closed. An  appreciable reduction is being seen in the number of American  officers in NATO command structures. Although they continue to  reserve key positions for themselves, the armed forces of  Germany are playing an increasingly significant role in the  joint forces of the alliance.    The process of integration of Western Europe within the EC  framework is proceeding in parallel fashion. Following  conclusion of the Maastricht accords and their approval by EC  member states, a definitive course has been charted towards  gradual transformation of the community into an economic and  political alliance, and in the longer-term perspective--into a  federation, i.e., a unified state. The military function has  been entrusted to the West European Union, which should become a  unique kind of ministry of defense of the European Community.  (Footnote 3) (See USA--EPI, 1993, No. 2)    France and Germany constitute the motive power for West  European integration. In addition to everything else, they have  set about creating a joint French-German army corps with  strength of up to 35,000, which should become the nucleus of a  future European army. The Euro-corps is subordinate to the West  European Union but, as observers note, it could be transferred  under certain circumstances to NATO command as well. On the  whole, the West European Union is also considered to be the  "European support" of NATO, but the relationship between the two  organizations is far from finally resolved.    While supporting West European integration in words, the  United States is in actuality rather uncomfortable at the  prospect, viewing this, and not without justification, as the  emergence of a new competitor in the world arena. But the EC  leadership is unambiguous in placing in doubt the advisability  of NATO's continued existence and the current role of the United  States in Europe. (Footnote 4) (Speaking in Brussels in  September 1993, J. Delors, chairman of the Commission of  European Communities, stated that NATO entails tremendous,  unproductive expenses, that Europeans do not understand the  meaning or necessity of the presence in peacetime of hundreds of  thousands of American soldiers and dozens of military bases in  Europe. He believes that even if NATO is preserved, Europeans  must still create their own reliable defense, that it is  intolerable for the United States to endlessly continue carrying  out its mission in Europe--See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September  1993.)    By virtue of this, the proposal of the authors of the  article  in FOREIGN AFFAIRS to actively support West European integration  can hardly be expected to find a response in the Clinton  administration. After all, the stronger the European Community  and West European Union are, the less the need on the part of  West Europeans for security guarantees from the United States  and NATO will be and the more inappropriate their presence in  Europe.    It is interesting that in calling for the Europe-ization of  NATO, the authors in fact pay no attention to the main issue: To  what extent is the United States prepared to allow a stronger  role to be played by Europeans within the alliance, the Germans  and French primarily?    The answer, though veiled, can be found in the following  passage: "Europe-ization of the alliance is just as much in the  interests of the United States as it is in the interests of the  Europeans. The United States may lose the ability to play  a leading or significant role (emphasis mine--S.S.)  in guaranteeing European security, unless it becomes part of a  more equal partnership." In other words, the proposals on  developing a new "general strategy" of the West, a new  "trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western  Europe serve in actuality only to conceal the following  objective: in leaving Europe, to remain in it--and not just  remain, but play "a leading or significant role."    It is proposed that Europeans, Germany and France primarily,  actively involve their armed forces in peacemaking and other  missions of NATO outside the bounds of its "zone of  responsibility" (in this regard, the strength of American forces  in Europe is diminishing significantly; in the long term they  may be withdrawn entirely). But the Americans intend, as before,  to command the armed forces of the alliance--otherwise "a  leading or significant role" will not be maintained.    Incidentally, the U.S. leadership and NATO are proposing  that  Russia employ its armed forces in the execution of peacemaking  missions of the alliance under similar conditions ("your  soldiers--our command"). (Footnote 5) (See IZVESTIYA, 31 March  1993) It is not difficult to discern behind such approaches one  of the traditional principles of American foreign policy--to  attempt to secure its national interests using the hands of  others.    It is understandable that France, the most European-oriented  country, might have every justification under such a version of  NATO Europe-ization to continue to suspect the United States of  hegemonistic aspirations. It is no accident that French Minister  of Foreign Affairs A. Juppe stated in September 1993 that the  country's foreign policy would continue to reject the  possibility of dictatorship on the part of other states and  would be aimed against aspirations to world leadership on the  part of any country whatsoever. France sets European solidarity  as the main priority, insofar as it cannot in isolation  "maintain an equal footing" with the United States or with the  rapidly developing countries of the Asian Pacific. Paris places  Atlantic solidarity, i.e., cooperation with the United States  and NATO, in second place as a means of guaranteeing security.    As far as Germany is concerned, that country can hardly be  expected to sharply broaden its participation in NATO operations  as the American researchers are proposing, unless its role in  the command structures of the bloc is appropriately enhanced.    At the same time, if in the future a "Franco-Germanization"  of NATO takes place in some manner, i.e., if the United States  loses its command role in the alliance, the bloc will then be  not NATO, not a trans-Atlantic organization, but rather a West  European security structure. At that time, the need for  existence of the West European Union may disappear as well.  American taxpayers and the Congress, however, can hardly be  expected to agree to finance U.S. presence in a  military-political alliance in which their country is not  playing the major role.    Thus, the future of the North Atlantic alliance is not  determined, and the proposals of R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S.  Larrabee regarding its "transformation" turn out upon close  examination to be just new methods of attaining an old  geostrategic objective--the preservation of United States  leadership in Europe into the postcommunist era.    How do the aspirations of the United States to preserve NATO  and its position in Europe correlate with Russia's  European-oriented interests? Is it really true, as the American  analysts believe, that Russia's posture towards NATO and its  possible expansion eastward will depend only on Russia  itself--on whether democracy will be victorious or the country  will revert to authoritarianism? How realistic are the West's  opportunities to geopolitically "sever" Ukraine from Russia, as  the American researchers propose?  <H5>  The Interests of Russia </H5>   The main national state interests of Russia, including those  oriented on Europe, proceed from the main historical mission  Russia must resolve today. This mission may be concisely summed  up as follows: Russia must transform itself in a historically  brief period of time from a military superpower with an  ineffective, half-destroyed economy and fractured  self-consciousness into a great multinational, democratic power  which is confident of itself, which possesses economic might and  a high level of spiritual and moral authority.    Clearly, Russia's natural partners in the outside world may  come from among those centers of economic might that strive more  than others to objectively cooperate with it and are prepared to  render it assistance on nondiscriminatory terms. Russia's most  natural partners are primarily its geographical neighbors who,  proceeding from their own security considerations, are  interested in preserving a stable--and consequently, a  territorially integral--Russia. In Europe this is the  integrational nucleus of the European Community--France and  Germany.    It should not be forgotten, of course, that the Roman-German  civilization has historically related to Russia in a haughty and  guarded manner. At the same time, however, history has taught  Western Europe that the preservation of stability throughout the  European continent depends to a great degree on the situation in  Russia. The fact that the European Community, at the initiative  of France, reacted instantaneously to the dramatic events in  Moscow on 3-4 October 1993, through proposals to expand  cooperation--is further confirmation of this.    Naturally, if the United States is uncomfortable at the  prospect of unification of, let us say, its Western civilization  fellow comrades within the EC framework, a West European-Russian  rapprochement can be expected to arouse in them far greater  fears. And there can be no doubt but that the main instrument of  opposition to this rapprochement may be NATO, as the simplest  and most effective lever for exerting pressure on the West  Europeans. In other words, in retaining command positions for  the United States, NATO constitutes one of the main obstacles  and impediments over the long term, standing in the way of  resolving the Europe-oriented aspects of Russia's main  historical mission.    Thus, the strategic and long-term interests of Russia are  served either by the dissolution of NATO, or by its unambiguous  Europe-ization. Also running counter to the strategic interests  of Russia is the possible eastward expansion of the alliance as  a means of strengthening and "Atlant-izing" it. Does the  foregoing mean that Russia should immediately demand that the  alliance be dissolved? No, it does not.    First of all, the future of NATO is basically a problem of  American-West European relations, and Russia cannot seriously  influence the fate of the alliance. But an interest is present  on the part of Western Europe to preserve the alliance primarily  on an anti-Russian basis. As researcher A. Arbatov writes,  justifiably: "...the chief reason for preserving NATO in the  foreseeable future remains all the same the unpredictability of  the further development of events within Russia and the  evolution of its foreign and military policy. (Footnote 6)  (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 1 October 1993) This is inevitable until  such time as Russia either establishes a durable and stable  democracy, or the West European defensive structure becomes so  strong that it is able to replace the United States and the  present NATO in the role of guarantor of security.    Both of these processes will most likely require more than a  decade to achieve. Over the course of this lengthy period of  time, it is perhaps foolish for Russia to propose initiatives on  the dissolution of NATO. Especially since preservation of the  alliance during the transition period also meets certain of its  interests, those related primarily to the German problem.    Presently it is unclear as to what limits and in what forms  the most powerful economic country in Europe--united  Germany--intends to augment its political role in the world. Its  striving to become a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council is just one orientation of this augmentation.  Without a doubt, the FRG is today an integral part of the West,  through its system of bilateral and multilateral agreements, and  its return to the military imperialism of the past is  impossible. But it is also a fact that fears exist among the  West European countries under Nazi occupation during the years  of World War II regarding a revival of German hegemonism,  perhaps in an economic form.    Historical memory is also alive in Russia with respect to  the  misfortunes and horrors brought by the war against Nazism.  Russia is therefore interested first and foremost in preserving  NATO during the transition period as a tried and tested  instrument of exerting control over Germany on the part of the  West. Here the interests of the United States and Russia  coincide. How long interest in this question remains depends  chiefly on the course of Germany's foreign policy.    But NATO is unsuited to the role of effective peacemaker in  Europe, a role R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee are  promoting, despite the presence in it of the required military  command and control and logistics infrastructure, and the low  efficiency of the EC and CSCE in settling interethnic conflicts.    As Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev noted, the  expansion of NATO itself will not accomplish the tasks of  providing effective counteraction to interethnic conflicts, and  will even "lead inevitably to a unique kind of hidden  confrontation, and thus in the final analysis--to instability."  (Footnote 7) (MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 26 September 1993)    Moreover, NATO has retained its anti-Russia orientation even  after the end of the Cold War. Following President B. Yeltsin's  statement in Poland on Russia's understanding of the problem of  Poland's possible entry into NATO, steps followed in factual  disavowal of this statement. Specifically, a letter was sent to  Western leaders bearing the president's signature which  expressed a warning against NATO expansion by virtue of  inclusion of the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe,  and which proposed that the security of this region be provided  through joint guarantees on the part of the alliance and Russia.  (Footnote 8) (IZVESTIYA, 2 October 1993)    In addition, the very existence of NATO, in the mass  consciousness of Russians, at a time when the Warsaw Pact and  the USSR have collapsed, is perceived as a symbol of national  humiliation and as the victory of the United States in the Cold  War. Whether or not these ideas--emerging from decades of Soviet  propaganda--are false is a separate issue. But the ideas are  entirely real. In other words, the very existence of NATO, not  to mention the possibility of its eastward expansion, creates a  foreign policy background favorable for the strengthening within  Russia of the positions of anti-American political forces.    In this sense we cannot help but share the view of O.  Harris,  editor in chief of the American journal NATIONAL INTEREST, who  writes: "To attempt to incorporate Eastern Europe within NATO's  sphere of influence, at a time when Russia is in a state of  dangerous disarray and its national prestige and self-confidence  are deeply undermined, would definitively constitute an act of  extreme stupidity." (Footnote 9) (Quote from FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  October 1993, p. 43.) In his opinion, extremist and chauvinist  elements both within Russia itself and outside it would use this  against the West. He believes that with the disappearance of the  Soviet threat, the need for a political organization of the NATO  variety has also disappeared.    Possible NATO actions would not remain outside the field of  view of Russian public opinion and would exert an influence on  the political leadership of Russia regardless of who is in  power. Russian public opinion would most likely react negatively  to NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia if Serbian positions  were subject to bombing or if peacemaking operations were  carried out near the Western Russian borders, i.e., in the  eastern "arc of instability," especially in territory of the  CIS. A mandate from the United Nations or CSCE would hardly  change anything. The reaction of Russians to possible NATO  expansion by virtue of including the former socialist countries  would most likely be negative.    In this manner, active peacemaking by NATO beyond the  confines of its own territory on the European continent or  possible NATO expansion eastward with the objectively retained  anti-Russia orientation of the alliance--is not a path towards  enhancing stability but, on the contrary, will intensify  mistrust and alienation between the West and Russia.  Consequently, in the final analysis this is a path of  intensifying instability in Europe.    What are the possible outlines of Russian policy with regard  to NATO? It is felt that in the long-term perspective, the  existence of NATO contradicts the strategic interests of Russia  in Europe, insofar as the anti-Russian orientation of this  alliance is objectively maintained in the postcommunist era.  NATO has fulfilled its basic historical mission, and the  continued existence of this alliance can be viewed only as a  temporary measure necessary for a transition period, until such  time as a new security system in Europe is built naturally. The  structural foundation of such a system must be West European and  Russian forces, the "blue helmets" of Europe.    It is felt that Russia must abandon any provision of support  to initiatives aimed at artificially prolonging the existence of  NATO. In particular, it must not move towards active interaction  with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, should not support  the striving of the alliance leadership to remove itself from  United Nations control, and must be especially rigid in opposing  the possible expansion of NATO eastward. Insofar as continued  existence of the alliance meets most of all the national  interests of the United States, it is best to allow the American  politicians themselves to justify before the world community,  Europeans, and their own people the need for extending the life  of their offspring even following the end of the Cold War.    At the same time, it is not in the interests of Russia to  fight in favor of immediate dissolution of the alliance, first  and foremost because of the German problem. A gradual, natural  process is underway of withdrawal of the Americans from Europe,  the Europe-ization of NATO, and simultaneous strengthening of  the European Community and West European Union, which suits the  interests of the Russian Federation. It would be foolish to  attempt to incite these processes onward--as they are mainly  outside the realm of Russia's influence. Time will tell as to  what form and which of the two (or even both military-political  alliances) will survive in the final analysis. It is important  for Russia that there be no organized structure in Europe  capable of effectively opposing the expansion of its cooperation  with the West Europeans.    But if during the course of the transition period, an armed  conflict flares up near the western borders of Russia that  demands NATO involvement, a settlement of the conflict must be  pursued only jointly with Russia, in which regard not only the  peacemaking forces themselves must be united, but their command  elements as well.    With regard to security guarantees for the former socialist  countries of Eastern Europe, in my view Russia should encourage  their convergence with the EC and West European Union and  strongly oppose their striving to join NATO. It seems that such  an approach will find the support of the Europe-ists and  Germany. And this will secure for the former socialist countries  the Western guarantees of security they so desire.    The main road leading to creation of a system of common  European security must be transformation of CSCE from an  amorphous mass into a strong international organization with its  own Security Council and its own peacemaking forces capable of  swiftly and effectively providing warning and extinguishing  armed conflicts. The directive organs of such an organization  could be located in the former socialist countries of Central  and Eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong  (6774 1987 2639)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Council  General Office sponsored a get-together in Zhongnanhai this  morning to exchange Spring Festival greetings. Premier Li Peng,  other leading comrades of the State Council, cadres and staff  workers of State Council organs, and some veteran comrades  happily got together to exchange greetings and usher in the new  spring.    On behalf of leading State Council comrades, Premier Li Peng  extended his festive greetings to all cadres and staff workers  of the State Council General Office, organs directly under the  State Council, and relevant departments, as well as their  dependents. Li Peng expressed his wholehearted thanks for the  outstanding jobs they have done in the past year.    In his speech, Li Peng said: The year 1993 which has just  gone by was a year of unusual achievements, and 1994 will be a  year with even more magnificent success. The principles set by  the party Central Committee -- "seize the opportunity to deepen  reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite  development, and maintain stability" -- are extremely  significant for China's development and progress. He said:  Ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, China has achieved world-renowned successes in its  reform and opening up endeavors, our economy has been developing  rapidly, our reform policies have had the support of the people,  and the international situation has always been favorable to us.  Confronted with such a gratifying situation, we will continue  to deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world. The  series of major measures for reform to be launched this year are  meant for further pushing our country toward building a  socialist market economic system so that even greater successes  will be achieved in our national economic development.    Li Peng said: Development has always been our central task  and the basic objective of all our reform projects. We must  work hard to improve the people's living standards and help the  whole nation to become affluent as quickly as possible.  However, social stability is an indispensable prerequisite and  condition for reform and development. If we fail to maintain  social stability, we will be unable to launch the measures for  reform, and our causes will not be able to proceed successfully.  Under the current situation, therefore, we must correctly  handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability  so that China's economic development can proceed in a sustained,  rapid, and healthy manner.    Li Peng noted: We, the Chinese nation, are now at a period  of rapid development. Cadres of state organs should feel  honored and proud of being able to directly take part in making  and enforcing decisions about reform, opening up, and  modernization. Li Peng urged all cadres and staff members of  the State Council to continue to work hard to accomplish all  assignments of the party and the people, achieve new successes,  and make even greater contributions during the year.    Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi  Haotian,  Song Jian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun, Chen Muhua,  Gu Mu, and other comrades were present at the gathering, which  was chaired by Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general  of the State Council.    During the gathering, Chinese Coalminers Song and Dance  Ensemble artists staged colorful entertainment programs.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Credito Italiano bucks Milan downtrend Nafta, Latin America and Asia - bourses were left to their own devices, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN, where trading was delayed until midsession by technical problems with the screen based system, was lower on the last day of the November account, the Comit index shedding 11.29 or 2.1 per cent to 534.13. Credito Italiano bucked the trend, adding L104 to L2,357 after a high of L2,389 in a continued response to Monday's profit and dividend announcement, and plans for its privatisation. Heavily traded telecommunications stocks were marked down on profit-taking and position squaring. Stet shed L107 to L3,571 and Sip L164 to L3,010. Fiat shares dipped L31 to L3,578 as many shorts were carried over to the December trading period, for technical reasons associated with the end of the rights issue. FRANKFURT reflected a repo rate cut, strength in derivatives and high hopes in banking as it celebrated today's holiday with the DAX index 22.61 higher at 2,071.72. Turnover rose again, from DM9.7bn to DM11.1bn. A nine basis points cut in the repo rate suggested that another cut in key interest rates would come sooner rather than later, and brought buying orders for the DAX future. This lifted the big blue chips, particularly Allianz which rose DM71 to DM2,901, with Daimler up DM7.50 to DM715.50 and Siemens DM5.50 better at DM727.60. In banks, the focus turned to Dresdner, DM9.50 higher at DM435.50, and to Commerzbank, up DM7.50 to DM357.50 on talk that its impending nine-month profits would show a rise appreciably greater than the 50 per cent plus it forecast at the end of last month. PARIS had an opportunity to react to the government's fixing of the Rhone-Poulenc share offer which came in at the lower end of expectations. The shares in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group put on FFr3.00 to FFr156.60, compared with the price of FFr135 set for sale to retail investors. The CAC-40 index gained 6.76 to 2,124.66. Generale des Eaux advanced FFr65 to FFr2,646 on positive company comments while Euro Disney picked up 80 centimes to FFr34.00 as some buyers returned following a sharp decline last week. AMSTERDAM softened slightly as some of the major international stocks weakened. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.3 to 137.6. Royal Dutch shed Fl 3.00 to Fl 193.70 as one London-based broker came out with a downgrade on the stock from hold to sell. Kleinwort Benson commented that while the group offered a 'safe earnings and dividend stream', the recent outperformance in the share price was a good opportunity to take profits. Fokker picked up 60 cents to Fl 22.30 after announcing that it had won an order to supply new aircraft to the UK. MADRID saw contrasts in the banking sector as the general index rose 2.04 to 302.93. Argentaria climbed Pta290, or 4.7 per cent to a new high of Pta6,410 as Banesto dropped Pta45, or 1.8 per cent to Pta2,425. The former was setting the price for a second share offer late yesterday, and dealers were looking for something at the top of the range; the latter reported a nine-month loss, after provisions. ZURICH was easier in low volume, awaiting tonight's Nafta vote and its impact on US markets, and the SMI index shed 5.1 to 2,712.3. BRUSSELS was little moved in spite of a strong rally in GIB, which rose BFr34 or 2.6 per cent to BFr1,318, as the Bel-20 index shed just 0.38 to 1,375.92. Elsewhere Petrofina lost BFr40 to BFr9,750 and SGB BFr55 or 2.2 per cent to BFr2,435. Solvay advanced BFr75 to BFr14,375 on reports that a tax on some of its products may be delayed. STOCKHOLM lost ground after falls in both Astra and Ericsson depressed sentiment. The Affarsvarlden general index declined 14.3 to 1,388.5. Turnover was SKr1.4bn. Ericsson B shares eased SKr14 to SKr408 while Astra B lost SKr1 to SKr170. HELSINKI rose by 1.7 per cent, the Hex index closing 26.1 higher at 1,542.9. A preliminary one-year pay deal in the paper industry took the forestry shares index up by 2.9 per cent. ATHENS advanced on reports that the government may impose a tax on repurchase agreements, which analysts believe will entice cash back into equities. The general index added 5.09 to 832.57 in good turnover of some Dr2.6bn.

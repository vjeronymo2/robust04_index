Interior Minister Carlos Delgado Chapellin told reporters  the  street riots are part of a premeditated plan to disrupt public  order and to tarnish the ceremony to change the government,  scheduled for 2 February, and the work of the recently-installed  Parliament.    The minister said the situation in the country is normal and  attributed the outbursts of violence to minorities that incite  the students to those actions.    Violent protests have broken out recently in Caracas and  other cities, which resulted in the death of one young student  on Tuesday. These protests, led mainly by students and masked  protesters, have turned into violent street battles with the  police.    Disturbances broke out again today at the Central University  of Venezuela [UCV] and other Caracas educational centers as well  as in the north-central state of Aragua.    The riots and the recent Banco Latino intervention, the  second most important bank in the country; public protests; and  uncertainty with respect to the financial system's soundness  were described by National Convergence Leader Julio Cesar Moreno  as part of a orchestrated plan to have President-elect Rafael  Caldera receive a country in disastrous conditions.    According to the leader of the National Convergence party,  which was founded by the new Venezuelan president, these  incidents are not spontaneous, but are intended to prevent the  successful start of the next administration.    Moreno attributed those interests to "an undercurrent that  has its source entrenched in priviliges that were handed out at  one time, especially during the past two administrations."    Asdrubal Baptista, one of the new president's main advisers,  pointed out that the new administration expects to place special  priority on raising the people's standard of living, and that  requires the support of all sectors of the population.    Without going into details, Baptista indicated that next  Wednesday Caldera will announce a far-reaching economic program,  prepared by the president himself, which is expected to "split  the country's history in two."    The presidential adviser pointed out that the country's  future will not rest primarily on its crude oil revenues, which  has fallen from $20 billion at the beginning of the 1980's when  the population totalled 13 million, to somewhere between $8 and  $10 billion in 1994 with the population at 22 million.    Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said current President  Ramon J. Velasquez, as head of the transition government, held  one of his last meetings today to examine the country's social,  labor, political, and financial issues.</p>

Dubinin and Shcherbakov  Tipped To Head Finance Ministry"]    [Text] Yesterday, the president and the prime minister held  the final meeting on forming a new government. Small wonder  that the last, decisive seat in the Cabinet of Ministers -- the  post of finance minister, which Boris Fedorov has reserved for  himself for the period in which a financial report for 1993 will  be written -- remains effectively vacant.    One may hold any opinion about Fedorov. Drawing on recent  reports you may keep dispelling as long as you wish the myth  about trends that prompted the former minister to do what he has  been doing. What may appear to be the finance minister's overly  spectacular line of conduct, however, has transformed the post  of finance minister from a work place into a crown of thorns of  a great reformist martyr. If this trend is to be followed,  finding a replacement for Boris Fedorov will be fairly easy.  The more so because the Fedorov-style activity (refusals to pay  money according to the government's own estimates, delays in  paying wages, depositing money in commercial banks) will hardly  be possible if the would-be finance minister lacks a deputy  prime minister's title.    Hence, both owing to the demotion and the postponed budget  deficit (government debts to the agro-industrial and the  military-industrial sectors), the minister's seat will no longer  be a pedestal for a charismatic figure. The important,  influential (and credit-disbursing) post of finance minister can  only be occupied by a person from Viktor Chernomyrdin's team.  Moreover, the candidacy will have to be approved by Viktor  Gerashchenko. The West's opinion, which was not heeded when  forming the bulk of the cabinet, is no longer decisive for a  whole number of reasons.    At present, two candidates are being publicly broken in:  from among Boris Fedorov's deputies, the Central Bank-backed  Sergey Dubinin (albeit "smeared" by the GAZ scandal, which Boris  Nemtsov would not let die out), has been nominated for  promotion, and at the same time a rumor has been spread about  former Deputy Council of Ministers Chairman Vladimir  Shcherbakov's possible appointment to the post. As for the  latter, it can be said that he, like many other former  government officials, has not squandered a certain clout he  wielded at the Council of Ministers; meanwhile, following his  dismissal he set up the "Interprivatizatsiya" fund, through  which billion-dollar foreign investments are being attracted to  the former USSR. On New Year's eve, television viewers could  watch his address as chief of a large investment fund. This  candidacy is preferable in terms of publicity than is Dubinin's,  to say nothing of the fact that it may be the most  "market-oriented" one compared to all other options --  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA readers could see that point: in an article  entitled "Management, Technology, Money: Only in This Sequence  Will We Be Able To Integrate Ourselves in the World Economy"  (No. 105 of 8 June 1993) we wrote about his views on the  domestic investment climate and the transformation of Russian  enterprises' management. What is unclear is another thing --  whether Shcherbakov, a successful businessman, will want to  return to government service.    The new finance minister will have to untangle a web of  "Fedorov's contradictions' and to bear responsibility for rising  inflation, for which those who had created a semblance of  "monetarism" by postponing the budget deficit are also to blame,  at least in part. The pro-radicalist press campaign of active  opposition to Fedorov's successor was just as inevitable and  ineluctable as strikes and credit commission meetings.  Furthermore, although for a person of purely state interests a  ministerial post means a realistic opportunity to influence  decisionmaking on specific matters, the assumption of this  responsibility can scarcely open up bright prospects for the  office holder; filling the last vacancy in the cabinet  (discounting Panfilova's seat) is turning into one of the most  serious personnel problems.</p>

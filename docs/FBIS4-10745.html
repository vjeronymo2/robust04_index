In the name  of pluralism (a concept that in Cuba does not really apply),  some criticism has been heard over the small amount of attention  the executive branch reportedly intends to give him, as well as  some favorable comments on restoring diplomatic relations  between the two governments.    It can be assumed Mr. Robaina is coming to our country with  a  clear goal. Therefore, it is right -- as scheduled -- for the  Paraguayan Foreign Ministry to receive him and listen to him.  As there are no diplomatic relations with the current Cuban  regime, there are no protocol reasons for any other official  attention.    There are no special reasons why Paraguay should restore  relations with the Cuban regime. Relations presuppose a certain  level of affinity or, at the least, some very specific and  dynamic interests that make them necessary. It is abundantly  clear that neither of these two factors stimulate Paraguay's  restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba.    The only possible interest worth mentioning would be limited  to some direct trade. Diplomatic relations are not essential  for such trade. It is enough to establish trade bureaus like  those used by Taiwan to maintain their very dynamic and  significant trade operations with a number of nations with which  it does not have any formal diplomatic ties.    The meaning of a Cuban diplomatic mission in Paraguay  remains  unknown, but it may well be assumed that establishing a  Paraguayan mission in Havana might be viewed by the Cuban people  as a gesture of approval and -- eventually -- support for its  regime, one of the last and strongest dictatorships still  remaining in the continent.    Paraguay should be interested in friendship with the Cuban  people, but not with a government and political system that has  made hundreds of thousands of Cubans choose, whenever possible,  to go into exile and to force many others to continue to  challenge the regime's ironclad surveillance and the sea's  perils to seek in a foreign land the liberty denied to them in  their own.    As a nation with a long experience in the restriction and  denial of liberties and political harassment and repression --  involving widespread fear, imprisonments, and exile -- we should  not be interested in dealing with any tyrant, regardless of his  leanings.    Out of respect for the liberty restored in our country -- as  well as the respect that any nation deserves even though  deprived of such liberty -- it would be inappropriate to take  any step that might even be viewed as tolerance of an  unmistakably dictatorial regime like the Cuban regime. So, let  us use our inevitably limited efforts to strengthen friendly  ties with free nations.</p>

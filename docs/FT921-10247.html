			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: American Airlines' argument for free market on transatlantic route Sir, Readers should be astonished at the article 'A Call to Protect British Airways from US Competitors' (January 17) in which Charles Leadbeater reports that the Commons Transport Committee has concluded that 'British Airways should be protected from increasing competition from US airlines in Europe until the US aviation market is opened up to foreign carriers.' US airlines only have a 46 per cent share of transatlantic passengers, and 47.5 per cent of the US-UK passengers. UK carriers have far better access to the US that US carriers have to the UK. The air service agreement between the US and the UK allows UK carriers to serve 88 city-pair markets compared with 47 for US airlines. And frequency controls prevent added service on existing routes like Chicago-Manchester. British Airways effectively serves the US from 67 non-stop destinations behind London Heathrow Airport with a total population of 97.4m - all potential passengers to the US. By contrast, Delta's Atlanta 'mega-hub' serves only 50.7m, America's Chicago hub 37.1m and United's Washington hub 23.0m. And the hubs all compete for traffic from many of the same cities. On average, US carriers provide connections to London from 77 destinations, including many small cities served by commuter airline partners with little transatlantic traffic potential. In 'A Manifesto for Civil Aviation in the 1990s', British Airways observed that liberal aviation agreements 'increase the number of airlines, frequency of flights and the seat capacity available on routes within Europe. To say nothing of the value of money enjoyed by passengers'. If liberal aviation agreements are so beneficial in Europe, why are they a liability in the transatlantic marketplace? It is demonstrable that traffic growth between the US and liberal European countries - France, Germany and Switzerland - significantly exceeded passenger growth to the UK. Had transatlantic traffic to the UK increased like that to France, Germany and Switzerland, 700,000 additional US visitors would have spent approximately Pounds 965m in the UK If there is a competitive advantage in the US-UK market, it rests with UK airlines. When the UK embraces free market practices in its aviation relationship with the US, the resulting competition will discipline the air travel market and produce economic prosperity and real value for consumers.

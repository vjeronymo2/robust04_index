			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Much inspection work still to be done HAVING completed 42 inspections in 16 months in the effort to eliminate Iraq's main weapons capability, the UN now is expected to continue operations at a slower pace, but officials emphasise that a lot of work remains to be done, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. Still, they appear confident that, apart from some gaps, most of the Iraqi programmes have been identified by inspection teams sent by the disarmament commission set up by the Security Council. The destruction of arsenals is well advanced except in the area of chemical weapons. Eliminating stocks of nerve agents and mustard gas, a programme due to start next month, is expected to take at least a year. Destruction teams are already in Iraq on a full-time basis. As for UN monitoring to ensure that Iraq never again develops the potential to become a serious military threat to the region, that will continue indefinitely, officials say. Mr Tim Trevan, the commission spokesman, hailed the latest mission as a total success. Its report will be prepared in Bahrain and transmitted to New York by mid-week for evaluation.</p>

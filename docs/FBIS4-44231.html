			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has left for Adana at the  invitation of the Association of Young Businessmen. In a  statement prior to his departure from Ercan Airport, he assessed  the latest situation on the Cyprus problem.    [Begin Denktas recording] The Turkish Cypriot side has done  its utmost to reach a reconciliation with the Greek Cypriot  side. We are waiting for UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report. The Greek Cypriot side's persistent  initiatives to join the European Union will keep that matter on  our agenda. We shall closely follow the situation and,  undoubtedly, we shall not hesitate to take the necessary  measures together with Fatherland Turkey.    The Greek Cypriot newspapers maintain their propaganda  activities by distorting the views we have expressed in  self-defense and as a reaction to Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos  Kliridhis. In particular, they have distorted the views we have  expressed on the Turkish Resistance Organization. Undoubtedly,  this is not the first time that the Greek Cypriots, who claim  that they will establish friendly relations with us, have tried  to distort our views. Nor is it the first time that they have  made an effort to create a negative impression in the world  about the Turkish Cypriots and their leaders. I have followed  the Greek Cypriot newspapers every day for 40 years. By doing  so, I am able to determine what they wish to achieve. As far as  the Greek Cypriot intentions are concerned, what we have read in  the Greek Cypriot newspapers have not inspired hope in us. We  hope that the foreign diplomats will closely follow the Greek  Cypriot newspapers and see how much an opportunity the Turkish  Cypriots have had to reach a reconciliation. Naturally, we  cannot find the right way if we are not informed about the Greek  Cypriot side's views.    I wish to recall Rolandhis' views. I wish to reemphasize his  approach because he made a realistic assessment. I hope that  the Greek Cypriot leaders will carefully read his assessment.  They have launched an appalling campaign to rearm themselves.  Greece will disappoint them once again. However, the entire  island will suffer if they open the door to catastrophe. I  called for a face-to-face meeting with Glavkos Kliridhis. I  still call for such a meeting because it would be very wrong to  believe that foreign officials will be able to have us reach an  agreement through their mediation, that is, if the two leaders  do not meet, or are not in a position to hold talks, or fail to  meet face-to-face as equals. Kliridhis has continued to avoid  holding talks with us. I believe that we have many things to  discuss. In particular, I wish to meet him face-to-face to tell  him the cost the country may be forced to pay because of their  rearmament campaign.    President Denktas will proceed from Adana to Kahramanmaras.  He will address the conferences that will be held in the two  cities on the Cyprus problem. He will return to north Cyprus on  Wednesday.</p>

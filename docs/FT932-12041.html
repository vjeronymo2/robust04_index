			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Clinton celebrates 100th day with his new star PRESIDENT Bill Clinton chose to spend a good public part of his 100th day in office with the new star of his administration, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general. Washington was still buzzing yesterday over her defence to Congress of her handling of the Waco siege, especially her breath-taking confrontation with Congressman John Conyers of Michigan. Mr Clinton's trip to the justice department, to attend the announcement of new nominations to senior positions and for some remarks, was only arranged late on Wednesday. The 100 days was predictably marked by many polls and much media and political commentary seeking to assess Mr Clinton's record in office and prospects for the future. Unsurprisingly the results were mixed. The Washington Post/ABC poll found approval for the way the president was handling his job by a 59-39 per cent margin, higher than most other surveys but down from the 63-30 peak of late February. But only 37 per cent thought he had accomplished much in his first 100 days. Of those who were disappointed, 40 per cent blamed Mr Clinton, 40 per cent the Republican party and 17 per cent both equally. Another national survey, conducted jointly by a prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, gave him a 55 per cent approval rating, which it said was the lowest at this point of any presidency in the last 40 years. Some 57 per cent thought he had lost his focus as president and less than half (49 per cent) backed his economic plans, down from 58 per cent in February . But this poll also found much greater public confidence in Mr Clinton's ability to effect the right sort of change in the country than in the Republican alternative. On healthcare alone, 72 per cent believed he could come up with necessary reforms, versus a mere 19 per cent support for what the Republicans might propose. On the comment side, a Los Angeles Times editorial, while dismissing 100 days as 'an artificial benchmark,' said the president was 'terrific in two areas but weak in a third. He is great with an audience and at policy analysis. Less impressive is his ability to get things done.' The Wall Street Journal, not a fan of Mr Clinton, said his first 100 days showed him to be 'a president of the congressional agenda and special interests.' The New York Times leader column, frequently critical, spoke of 'large accomplishments' (the budget bill) and 'many missteps' (the stimulus package). It urged Mr Clinton 'not to confuse motion with progress.'</p>

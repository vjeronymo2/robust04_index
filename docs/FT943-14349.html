			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan warned on impasse - Deadlock in trade talks could raise tensions in Washington Trade negotiations between the US and Japan are in a worrying deadlock which could lead to renewed tensions in Washington, a senior US trade official warned yesterday. Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce for international trade, indicated that bilateral negotiations aimed at increasing access to Japanese markets have not made much headway and that unless there was visible progress progress in the talks, frustration could mount in Washington. 'Progress is very slow. Most of the major problems are still in front of us,' he said. Mr Garten yesterday took part in sub-cabinet level talks on increasing foreign access to Japan's car and car parts markets, one of the priority areas in the framework negotiations. Since the trade talks resumed in May, the rhetoric has been toned down, Mr Garten noted. But there was still 'significant difference in the perception of whether or not there is an access problem.' The framework trade negotiations, agreed between Japan and the US last summer, broke off in February this year when the two sides could not agree on ways to measure progress in opening Japan's markets. Mr Garten cautioned that there was increasing frustration among the business community in the US and that once legislation approving the Uruguay Round agreement was passed, Congress would turn its attention to Japan. 'The concern is that just because we have been able to contain the tension. . . this should not be seen as an indication that that is going to last for a very long time.' Meanwhile, the US is developing an export strategy for Japan 'above and beyond the framework trade talks' which involves looking into ways the government can help US companies win Japanese Overseas Development Administration contracts and other projects such as the Nagano Olympics. The Clinton administration is aiming to nearly double exports to Dollars 1,000bn by the year 2000 and one particular focus of this export strategy will be the information technology sector, Mr Garten pointed out. 'This is the kind of area that the US and Japan can co-operate on, not just in the US, not just in Japan but elsewhere. These kinds of issues will have a major impact on US-Japan relations in the future.'</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dutch insurer to withdraw from Belgium Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, has decided to withdraw from the Belgian market and sell its insurance activities there to Almanij-Kredietbank, the Belgian savings bank group, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Neither company would disclose the price commanded by Aegon's Belgian insurance business, which generates annual premium income of around BFr3.5bn (Dollars 95m). The transaction will more than double Almanij's premium income from insurance activities to BFr8bn. Aegon said it was withdrawing from Belgium because of the absence of expansion opportunities and the fact that its insurance activities lacked the necessary critical mass.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / OECD hits at short-term job tenures THE OECD's annual report on labour market trends, published yesterday, has once again managed to combine objectivity and strong judgment without causing too much offence to any of its 22 member states. But in the case of the UK government it may have been a near-run thing. The report's editorial has often in the past tilted towards US and UK style labour market deregulation but this year it stresses the importance of long-term commitments in the workplace and active labour market management. The 1993 editorial is explicitly critical of the short job tenures associated with 'hire and fire' labour markets and warns of the dangers of creating too many sub-standard and insecure jobs. It is ironic that the OECD, usually associated with a more pro-market approach than the European Commission, should be emphasising long-term human resource development at a time when the EC is taking a hard look at deregulation. One economist suggested yesterday that the dismal state of the US and UK labour markets towards the end of last year, when the report was being drawn up, may have affected the judgments. But the differences should not be exaggerated. The OECD report repeats many of its long-standing criticisms of over-rigid labour markets and high payroll taxes, especially in the EC (and southern Europe in particular) where half of the unemployed have now been out of a job for more than a year. The report expects total OECD unemployment to peak in 1994 at the record level of 36m, up from 7.9 per cent of the workforce in 1992 to 9 per cent, and 10m above the cyclical low of 1990. OECD Europe will be even worse with the level rising to 12 per cent or 23m people. Nevertheless, employment is growing again in several countries including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and the report foresees OECD unemployment in other member countries starting to fall in the second half of 1994. The authors stress that the figures on measured unemployment should be supplemented by the 13m OECD workers who were either 'discouraged' from looking for work by poor job prospects or were part-time workers who wanted to work more hours. However, since the early 1980s there appears to have been a slow fall in the number of discouraged workers. That may have something to do with the gradual shift in spending on the unemployed from passive measures, such as unemployment benefits, to active measures such as training and placement services. Although in most countries passive measures continue to comfortably outstrip active measures, the proportion did shift towards active measures in 13 out of the 24 countries between 1985 and 1990. The report claims that there is tentative evidence to show that active programmes have increased the relationship between job creation and output growth and have increased wage moderation, especially in France, Sweden and Germany. Consistently positive results have been found for programmes in which counselling and job search assistance have been made compulsory for people claiming benefit. Recruitment subsidies to employers generally have positive results, although the gains are usually less than they seem because subsidies are often paid for workers who would have been hired anyway. Less favourable results are reported for broadly-targeted programmes such as training for all the unemployed. The report also suggests that countries with a higher degree of labour market activism have been better at combating long-term unemployment. People out of work for more than one year account for more than 30 per cent of the OECD unemployed. In most countries long-term unemployment is concentrated among prime age workers but in Southern Europe the largest share is found among youths - 15 to 24 - and in Japan and Sweden among older workers. Long-term unemployment is associated with technological change which has reduced the demand for unskilled labour, as witnessed by the low educational standards of the long-term unemployed. But the authors also conclude that 'high long-term unemployment is associated with high dismissal costs and generous provisions regarding the duration of unemployment benefit' and propose that both should be reviewed, especially in the southern EC countries. They point to the use of temporary contract work as a means of reducing long-term joblessness and cite France and Spain where there was a large increase in temporary work during the 1980s. In France two-fifths of the long-term unemployed found work at the end of the 1980's through temporary contracts and in Spain, where nearly 40 per cent of all employees are now on temporary contracts, the figures was twice as high.

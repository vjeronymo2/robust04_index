			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on 24 </F> March; place not given; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen: There is a general demand for  justice in the face of the criminal act that ended the life of  Luis Donaldo Colosio. I am committed to not allowing impunity.  Yesterday I sent the Federal District attorney general to the  scene of the incidents. He has conducted preliminary  investigations and is ready to report the results to the  competent authorities. I do not want any doubts, questions, or  concerns to remain, so I have given instructions to the Attorney  General of the Republic to create a special Deputy Attorney  General's Office that will be in charge of thoroughly  investigating the causes of this treacherous crime, fully and  totally dedicating its time to this task.    In response to a request from Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de  Colosio and based on my own convictions, I have decided to  appoint Miguel Montes Garcia for this important task of national  interest. He will hold this post if the Permanent Commission of  the Congress of the Union authorizes the request for leave he  has made to the Supreme Court of Justice.    Miguel Montes is a outstanding jurist who is well known for  his straightforward personality, his profound knowledge of the  law, and his honesty. In carrying out his duties, Jurist Montes  will have the support of the lawyers and expert investigators he  may deem necessary to help him in this important mission.    The leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party  [PRI]  and the coordinators of Luis Donaldo Colosio's political  campaign have endorsed this proposal. I will place at the  disposal of the Deputy Attorney General's Office and Montes all  the resources and necessary tools he may need to fulfill his  responsibility of promoting justice and facing this inadmissible  action for Luis Donaldo Colosio's family, the PRI, and all  Mexicans.    The law will be enforced. Justice will be served.</p>

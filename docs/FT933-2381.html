			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: If you're ready, Oysters dear . . . AN R in the month marks the official return of native oysters, wild scallops and mussels to our menus. Oysters are classically served raw and are so delicious that way that it seems a mite foolish for the cook to devote any time to them. I would rather conserve my energy for cooking other things. Mussels invite far greater variety of kitchen treatments. Just think of soups like moules mariniere, mouclade and our own mussel brose for a start. The only trouble about mussels is the time it takes to clean them. Reluctant to dally in the kitchen I shall save mussels for darker days when the appeal of lingering in the warmth of the kitchen soars. And so to scallops, which more often than not come ready cleaned by the fishmonger and which need little cooking. Scallops, like oysters, are of course exquisite to eat raw when beautifully fresh, with a squeeze of lemon or lime and perhaps a light scattering of chervil, or plain and simple just as they are. That is the way I gobbled my way through dozens of little queen scallops at John Noble's Loch Fyne Oyster Bar at Cairndow (there are branches in Nottingham and at Elton, near Peterborough). Marvellously tender and sweet they were with a briny whiff of the sea. Unless, however, the weather is truly brilliant, hot scallops may seem more appealing, in the evenings at least. Here is a timely way to serve them. GRILLED SCALLOPS WITH RED PEPPERS, TOMATOES &amp; BASIL A main course for 2-3 or a generous appetiser for 4, in which case I would serve the colourful mixture in (real or china) scallop shells. The peppers and tomatoes can be prepared ahead for the sake of convenience, but allow time to reheat them in the oven before grilling the scallops. Six fine fresh scallops (enough to yield  1/2 lb or so of flesh); two red peppers;  1/2 lb cherry tomatoes; a small bunch of basil; a sliver of garlic;  1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds; three tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; wedges of lemon and good bread for serving. Core the peppers, quarter them or cut them into strips as necessary to lay them flat, and wipe away the seeds. Cook them, skin side up, under a hot grill until the flesh feels soft and the skin is blistered and black. While the peppers are grilling, pour boiling water over the tomatoes. Leave for one minute then drain and slip off the skins. Cover the cooked peppers with a cloth (to keep the steam in) until cool enough to handle. Then strip off the skins and cut the flesh into chunks. Put the peppers into a warmed dish, add the tomatoes and mix gently. Crush the garlic and pound the coriander seeds to a coarse powder. Put the flavourings into a small pan with 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Warm gently until sizzling then pour the aromatic mixture over the vegetables. Swirl to mix and season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover the dish and slip it into an oven heated to 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 while dealing with the scallops. Gently separate the corals from the whites and slice each white across into two rounds. Lay them on a sturdy baking tray. Season them with sea salt and a grinding of pepper and dribble the remaining  1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over them. Turn them to coat them all over and slip the tray under the grill at a little distance from the flame. Grill, turning once, until the corals firm up and the whites turn from glassy looking to pearly. One minute on each side is probably plenty. Tip the contents of the scallop pan on to the vegetables and mix gently, adding a generous scattering of torn basil leaves. Serve with wedges of lemon and plenty of bread to mop up the fragrant juices.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ericsson disappoints with 88% nine-month advance Pre-tax profits at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, jumped 88 per cent in the first nine months to SKr3.49bn (Dollars 475m) from SKr1.85bn on the back of surging sales of mobile telephone equipment and tight cost control. Although the result was in line with expectations, it disappointed a market hoping for better figures and the group's B shares fell 5 per cent to SKr439 on profit-taking. This was in spite of a strong third-quarter order intake and confident remarks about prospects from Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive. The group's radio communications division, including mobile telephony, underpinned the performance with a 56 per cent advance in nine-month sales to SKr26.3bn. Its strong showing, based on rapid growth in the US, Japanese and Australian markets, enabled the group to lift overall sales 29 per cent to SKr54.6bn. In the third quarter, radio communications sales rose 47 per cent to SKr9.20bn from SKr6.24bn, more than half total sales of SKr18.06bn. Mobile telephony sales were 72 per cent higher. The group's other big division, public communications, saw nine-month sales expand to SKr17.2bn from SKr15.1bn. Mr Ramqvist said full-year results would be 'significantly higher' than last year's SKr3.1bn. 'We retain our clear leading position in the world in mobile telephone systems, with sharply rising installations of all established systems. We also see a very positive trend in the area of mobile telephones, with a growing share of the world market.' Order bookings were 30 per cent higher in the third quarter, taking them to SKr60.1bn, ahead 22 per cent, for the first nine months. The group's success in lifting orders for 12 consecutive quarters was described by Mr Ramqvist as 'evidence that we truly have very competitive offerings for our customers'. The group's fastest-growing markets are in Asia, where nine-month sales climbed 80 per cent to SKr11.4bn from SKr6.3bn. China and Japan are now the company's fifth and sixth largest markets after the US, Sweden, Italy and the UK. Analysts forecast full-year profits of about SKr5.5bn.</p>

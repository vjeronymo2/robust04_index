			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary" article: "They Want </F> To Sneak Around the Back..."]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Duma dealt with fairly  mundane questions in its first week, but anybody who follows  parliamentary life will be aware of their importance. When  beginning the work of a newly elected organ, it is, of course,  necessary to agree on a quorum. Views, naturally, differed.  "Russia's Choice" insisted on a two-thirds quorum, and moreover  demonstrated on the very first day that it intends to use the  "right of the minority" to disrupt sittings. The other side  proposed that the quorum be set at 50 percent of the deputies,  as this will render the work of the Duma more stable regardless  of the changing moods of deputies and factions. The majority of  votes was cast in favor of the second option.    The next question derives from the very same series: Which  should be the base number to calculate the majority of votes  required to adopt a decision? There would seem to be nothing to  debate here -- the majority should be calculated on the basis of  the number of deputies actually elected to the Duma (444  people). But there are those who, referring to the Constitution,  demanded that six non-elected "dead souls" also be added to  this. The discussion was so tricky that even "Russia's Choice"  was split over it and failed to arrive at a unified opinion.  But again, common sense prevailed -- the Duma finally voted to  calculate the majority on the basis of the number of deputies  actually elected.    During the very first sittings, as if on a photographic  plate, a polarization of the deputies' corps became evident.  When one part of the hall applauds and rises to its feet, the  other remains sullenly silent. And vice versa. It is somewhat  disconcerting to see the entire right-wing sector of the hall  react gleefully to inaccuracies and blunders, and rejoice when a  decision is thwarted for whatever reasons. There is no  "constructive collaboration" in that.... A parliament in which  they do not have a guaranteed majority is no good to them. So  from the outset the task has been to disrupt and to wreck.  Future developments are easy to predict: After waiting a short  while, the faithful hounds from the mass media will be let  loose, and then the issue of dissolution "in view of the  opposition to the president" will be raised everywhere.    Basic decency has already been abandoned in the "democratic  press" even today. The president is being urged to "demonstrate  firmness" and to put pressure on parliament (it has to be  assumed that hitherto he has demonstrated extreme lenience.) He  is urged not to give the deputies apartments (let them live in a  hotel for two years), and to restrict their travel  opportunities. There is open rejoicing at the impotence of a  parliament from which all premises have been confiscated and all  backup services withdrawn.    Matters are taken even further by Mr. Shumeyko, who, as the  elected speaker of the Federation Council, at his first press  conference declared a readiness to divide and isolate the State  Duma in the event of "dire need": "It is possible to cooperate  with those deputies of the Duma who are indeed concerned about  the state, and adopt laws directly here." (That is, in the  Federation Council, bypassing the State Duma.) It is no secret  to Mr. Shumeyko that "this will be a certain violation of the  Constitution." But if something is really wanted...it is even  possible to violate the Constitution. So you see the type of  authority which has been nurtured -- it will not be hampered by  a mere Constitution [ni v odnu konstitutsiyu ne vlazit]!    There is never a right time for disease and death. So it is  that Ye. Gaydar chose not Saturday, and not Monday, but Sunday  for his resignation announcement. Moreover, it is easy to  understand why. Saturday was too early -- the "big chief" from  Washington had not yet departed. And the composition of the new  Cabinet of Ministers was expected to be announced Monday. After  this, who needs your "resignation announcements"!    Of course, the surprise announcement by the "father" of the  Gaydar reforms, Mr. Ye. Gaydar, will generate, has indeed  already generated, a mass of conjecture and commentary. But two  assumptions are self-evident, and they can be expressed without  fear of serious error.    The first is that Ye. Gaydar "and Co." leave the government  at a time when dense dark storm clouds are already gathering on  the economic horizon. Now is the time to abandon the bridge of  the unreliable government ship. At the same time, with the very  same childish directness with which under Chernomyrdin they once  swore "terrifying oaths" of loyalty to reforms, they bequeath  the reforms to the government, having finally thrown the  contents of the slops bucket over them.    Second: Gaydar and his team are freeing their hands for the  next presidential elections, at which they intend to emerge,  like Aphrodite from the foaming sea, in all the radiance of  untainted cleanliness: "Here we are, elect us!"    But every cloud has a silver lining. It will be useful for  Gaydar to sit on the opposition bench in order to experience the  full measure of insolence and extreme contempt with which the  government meets any proposals and initiatives emanating from  parliament. He will rewarded according to his deeds. We will  see what happens after that.    Let us return to the parliamentary hall for a while. In the  opening days, the issue of the type of ballot -- open or secret  -- was the subject of fierce debate. Parliament's "democratic"  part was all but foaming at the mouth in its attempts to prove  that a secret ballot on any subject and as frequently as  possible is a commitment to democracy, and the most important  guarantee of the defense of the rights of the minority.    It is funny. I have as yet been unable to forget the time,  three years ago, when it was proven with equal fervor that the  most important guarantee of minority rights is the roll-call  ballot, whereas the secret ballot was exposed as anathema, as  cowardice, as a desire to conceal one's position from voters.  Which is why it was enshrined in Supreme Soviet standing orders  that the roll-call ballot may be used at the behest of one-fifth  of the deputies, but on no occasion can the secret ballot be  resurrected.    Why this U-turn? Least of all do I suspect my opponents of a  lapse of memory or defective logic. If concepts are turned  upside down, then it is probably for a reason. Maybe people are  sick of publicity. And maybe there is some basis to the rumor  that a "second key" has been fitted to the electronic ballot  system, and that during a secret ballot (which by its very  nature is impossible to verify) it brings about the required  result....    It is exasperating to talk about this, but falsehood,  deceit,  and the desire to "sneak round the back" were brought into play  from the very first days of parliamentary practice. It is  normal and natural for people to adhere to different views. But  can it be considered normal when an "extra" paragraph suddenly  appears in an agreed document, and it just happens to be about a  secret ballot at the behest of one-fifth of the deputies? When  a respected professor and jurist known to the whole country,  upon glimpsing into the hall, sees no raised hands, and hears no  words of appeal addressed to him? And when there is a shortfall  of just one vote to adopt the decision.... I cannot agree that  politics is a dirty game. The dirt is brought into it by people  -- through their conciliation, their lack of principle, their  readiness to achieve aims by any means.    In mainstream politics, the stakes are always high. It gives  rise to a conflict of interests, frank and human passions, and  it creates a very strong field of force, which masterfully  arranges people along their invisible lines. In mainstream  politics, there is always temptation -- the ceiling of legal and  moral requirements is lowered a little, deceit is answered with  deceit, meanness with meanness, lawlessness with even greater  lawlessness. And it is easy to jump back and forth across the  barrier, to achieve victory. Behind an easy victory follows the  next phase -- "the final dash," when a subdued opponent is  hunted down without any rules whatever. Then comes the  celebration, the apotheosis of a victory which "will wipe the  slate clean," burying the unsightly "details" beneath the waves  of the general fever of the victors. Open baseness wears a mask  of dignity, violence sets itself up as nobility, and falsehood  preaches honesty. The phony carnival of an unjust victory....    Today, truth and honesty are on the side of the "left-wing"  opposition. The sympathies and hopes of the honest, thinking,  and feeling part of society turn to it. This is a great  strength but also a great responsibility. These hopes must not  be betrayed.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Observer: Holmes plays hard to get Rather odd that Sir Peter Holmes, recently retired as chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, should have accepted as his first non-executive directorship in the UK a position on the board of headhunters Norman Broadbent. It would seem that Miles Broadbent had been sounding Holmes out for one juicy job or another, only to discover that his lunch companion was more amenable to joining his own stable. Shortly off for a spot of fishing in Montana before indulging his passion for the outdoors in other obscure corners of the world, Holmes says he is 'demobbed and loving the freedom'. So far he has also agreed to go on the board of a Los Angeles global investment fund, but that is it. The man who has been tipped as anything from the next chairman of British Gas to president of the CBI concedes he 'might think again' at some point. Only institutions that are 'leaders in their field' need apply. A Shell recruiter himself in the early 1960s, he is convinced headhunters perform a useful function - though Shell, of course, was far too proud of its in-house man management abilities to look for outside help in filling anything but the most specialised of jobs. Miles Broadbent, who headhunted Colin Marshall (now Sir Colin) to British Airways, already has Lord King aboard, as well as BICC ex-chairman Sir William Barlow. The latter has become so fired up with the business that he turns up regularly at internal management meetings. But those who hold headhunters in the affection normally reserved for traffic wardens and estate agents are still inclined to question why Holmes chose to christen his UK portfolio with a job that looks to be rather a whimsical hobby horse.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Lithuanian </F> reporters in Warsaw; date not given: "If We Think About the  Past, the Future Will Run Away"]    [Excerpts] We have reported that on the eve of his  visit to Vilnius, Lech Walesa, president of the Republic of  Poland, received a group of Lithuanian journalists and answered  their questions. The conversation took place around the marble  table in the Belveder. The Polish president replied to questions  from journalists Aleksandra Akinczo (ZNAD WILII), Rytis Sabas  (LIETUVOS RYTAS), Mecislovas Sadovskis (EKHO LITVY), Algirdas  Strumskis (TIESA), Josef Szostakowski (KURIER WILENSKI),  Kazimieras Sliuzas (ELTA), Rimantas Varnauskas (LIETUVOS AIDAS),  and Algimantas Zukas (RESPUBLIKA). [passage omitted]    [Reporter] There are enemies of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty  on both sides. One representative of the Lithuanian Union of  Poles compared this treaty to the Molotov-Ribbetrop pact. Mr.  President, what can you say about this? What gains will this  treaty bring to the Polish minority in Lithuania?    [Walesa] There has been much discussion, which means that  the  treaty is good. If the number of its supporter equals that of  its enemies, the treaty is ideal. Let us take advantage of the  possibilities that this treaty will present.    When we speak about ethnic minorities in Europe, we cannot  invent new standards. The past is weighing heavily on the  treaty's enemies, as well as on those who represent the ethnic  minority. They are still avoiding a different assessment. This  is a peculiar quadrangle of a circle. Until the treaty is  signed, we will not be able to settle other matters. Thus, let  us get moving at last. Let us follow the standards established  in Europe: Primarily, the openness of our countries that will  help to open borders and remove obstacles feared by the  minorities. If there is no openness, our relations concerning  ethnic minorities may deteriorate. I do not know who wants the  two nations -- the Lithuanians and the Poles -- to not reach a  mutual agreement. We are even becoming ridiculous because of  that. We are such close nations, and we are settling these most  important matters with such delay. I do not think that any side  would resort to discrimination. The latter leads to Yugoslavia.  Neither party wants a Yugoslavia. Thus, let us be open and get  down to work. Certainly, Lithuania can choose the Asian  direction, or that through Poland.    [Reporter] Mr. President, we would like to hear from you  what  definite effect this treaty will have on economic, cultural, and  political relations between Lithuania and Poland, which you and  President A. Brazauskas will sign in Vilnius?    [Walesa] In former times, everything was imposed from above.  You know that epoch. The one that is beginning now will be  different: Political agreements only open possibilities and  remove barriers to security. Life and people must make these  political agreements effective, so that one could remove  obstacles and overcome difficulties. We are trying to open our  doors. Maybe, we are doing this incorrectly. Maybe, this  should be done differently. However, we must accomplish the same  what we did with other countries. The implementation of  treaties by workers of culture, economists, and historians is a  totally different issue. In short, a treaty means the opening  of doors. Maybe, there will be some doors, but no one will walk  through them. However, we, politicians, must open them. If it  becomes obvious that we did too little, and that the minorities  gain little from this treaty, we will change it. Demand will  decide everything.    [Reporter] Mr. President, excuse us for asking this  question,  which may be unpleasant to you. You say that you care about  ethnic minorities. The Lithuanians in Poland stress their  loyalty to this state. However, they are displeased to hear  that, for example, this state lacks money to publish several  thousand Lithuanian textbooks. Another example is that the  Polish state imposes additional duties on building materials  imported from Lithuania which are necessary for the construction  of the Lithuanian cultural center.    [Walesa] One could assess the aforementioned duties and  other  things as malevolent issues. Some people claim this. However,  this is untrue. Certainly, some things are not planned, in this  case, this Lithuanian cultural house which is being built by  Lithuanians. This was not included in our plans. However, this  is done with no evil purpose. I did not learn to be a president  as well. The freedom team that came to work may have not  noticed those problems, while some newspapers assessed these as  malevolent activities. Both you and us have some matters that  are simply arranged improperly. Should we adopt a new  constitution and customs clauses with regard to Lithuania?  Maybe, our dear neighbor would not feel any damage in that  case, and you would not question me about it. Maybe, these  things should be changed, but there are principles. However, I  am pleading for one thing -- do not pass over to the enemy's  ranks. Let us assess this as a misunderstanding. I believe,  however, that the problem is quite different.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you said at the first  "Solidarity" congress, I suppose, 13 years ago that you must  drive the horses you were given. We know that your current  position is not very easy. Could you tell us how your relations  with the Sejm and the government are developing?    [Walesa] The problem does exist, but it lies elsewhere.  Speaking about the complexity of the situation, I predicted that  in advance. If we assess the situation in terms of my extreme  desire for power, then my position is really difficult.  However, I have never wanted to be president, and I have no  desire to be one. I only wanted to fulfill a certain task. I  wanted to overcome the former system that was bad to everyone.  I wanted democracy, openness, and pluralism for everyone. When  I was heard, the nation would go with me, and I would claim  victory. My goal was to bring the country to the system we had  planned.    Certainly, now we have different concepts and various  troubles. At one moment, there was such an opinion that the  Polish president must not have any political backing, and that  he must be equal with other people. I also thought so and did  everything to renounce any political impediments. Therefore, I  am having trouble today. Different interests are being  manipulated. These are not only the people from the old system.  They are not necessarily bad communists. Every one of them --  leftists, rightists, and centrists -- would like me to be with  them. I console everyone and urge him or her to preserve the  balance. That is why I do not please everyone. However, I am  implementing this concept with consistency.    People do not voice claims that I have no good initiatives.  However, they are displeased with the fact that I do not  implement those initiatives. They say that I have promised a  few things but failed to fulfill them. Of course, I  accomplished a lot. However, execution exceeds the limits of my  possibilities. It is the government and the parliament which  primarily engage in implementation. I am an executor in this  political system. However, people care little about this. They  say: We have elected you -- now you must deliver. My troubles  have emerged due to the pressure from the system in which I  happened to live.    The vital question is as follows: There must be one powerful  leader, a political party, and a presidential or a parliamentary  system. As long as this question remains unanswered, I am the  sole person loyal to my principles, and this does not cause any  trouble.    Certainly, I do not explain this, because primarily I am  faithful to the principles which I promised to implement: To  create a system and bring it into the country. Of course, one  can make everyone listen to and follow the leader. One can also  blind people through other measures: To incite and provoke  them, or set them against each other. However, one must begin  to create....    [Reporter] Mr. President, recently, the presidents of the  three Baltic states put forward the initiative called  5 + 3 + 4 (Central European, the Baltic, and Visegrad group  states). However, the Visegrad countries rejected this  initiative. Why?    [Walesa] We still seem to misunderstand each other. One used  to say in former times -- let us unite into pacts of three,  five, and ten. One could really expect success then. The new  epoch is quite different -- if we open our borders, we must have  regional cooperation, and not because Vilnius is closer than  Washington. Life's demands rather than decrees are responsible  for such regional cooperation.    A similar problem arose during my conversation with Russian  President B. Yeltsin. The Russians wanted to leave their  factories at the former bases. I said: Mr. President, let us  change this in the agreement so as to make our current economic  cooperation tenfold larger. However, this depends on economic  demand and cannot be imposed. I cannot impose cooperation on  anyone if it is unprofitable. Do you, the Russians, want to  mine gravel near Szczecin and ship it across Poland? Does not  Russia have gravel? Therefore, I say, let us not do such things.    I believe that we must agree on the principles and values  that we would defend. We must say that the entire world will  defend Lithuania's freedom, as well as that of Poland. The most  important thing is that no one will attack, if we sign such an  agreement, if we remove all dangers, and if we say that the  nuclear power station is the matter of the entire world, or at  least of Europe, and not only the internal problem of Lithuania  or Poland. However, all of Europe has the right to check  whether the nuclear reactor is good or bad. If it is bad,  Europe has the right to demand its closure.    Let us defend great principles and values. If such rights  were observed in advance, there would be no problem of  Yugoslavia, because it is said that everyone has the right to  freedom. However, one's freedom must not pose any danger to the  freedom of another person. This means that there are no  possibilities for resolving problems by force. If someone does  not observe these principles, he or she can be forced to do so.    In this respect, there is no need to create what you are  talking about. There is no need to conclude agreements, if  there is no demand. If the economy requires them, let us allay  these matters, so as to be able to resolve them in a natural  manner.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you have said that you want to  continue your duties. We understand that you will take part in  the upcoming elections.    [Walesa] I still have two years. I see that the system for  which I fought has not yet been created. If I really want to  participate in the upcoming elections, I will really win them,  because I always achieve what I want.    [Reporter] The veto of the popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] law and the refusal to confirm the finance minister  are assessed as your new election program. What would be the  key principles of your election campaign? Who would be your  most powerful rival?    [Walesa] I have enough time for the program. I have said  that I want to create a system. By designing it, I show its  faults and accomplishments. However, I set a challenge at the  same time. We have the provisional Small Constitution. What  can be the decision, if I say "no," and the government is unable  to do anything. However, the government coalition says something  different: We present you a name, and you (president) must  approve it. Why? Under what law?    That is why it is bad for both sides (president and the  coalition). I do not want these principles to be transferred to  the new constitution, which we are now drafting. Can I ignore  the problem of constitutional amendments resolved in such an  improper manner? I ask who has the right to change the  Constitution and the system? There can emerge a casual majority  coalition in a couple of hours, even of drunk people, that can  change the system. Seeing all this, I am setting a  challenge.... [passage omitted]</p>

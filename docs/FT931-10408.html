			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Daf set to shed 1,000 workers in Britain MORE THAN half of the 6,500 jobs at the Dutch and Belgian operations of Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, are to be eliminated, and it is understood that a first round of more than 1,000 job losses in the UK will be announced shortly. Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, the Dutch-appointed administrators, said yesterday the jobs in Holland and Belgium would be cut as part of the main Daf rescue plan currently under discussion with the Dutch government and Daf's international bank consortium. The plan calls for the creation of a new limited company, called New Daf, to salvage the 'core operations' of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck activities. New Daf could also absorb some of the UK operations of Leyland Daf, most probably the light truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, said Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receivers for Leyland Daf. The UK receivers warned last night in a letter to the 5,500-strong Leyland Daf workforce that job losses in the UK were 'inevitable'. It is understood that Daf had already planned to cut around 1,100 jobs in the UK as part of its earlier restructuring package, before it was forced to file for protection against its creditors last week after running up losses of more than Fl 800m (Pounds 296m) in the last three years. The UK receivers are also in urgent discussion with Renault, the French vehicle maker, about the future of its joint venture with Daf to develop a new range of vans, code-named Excel. There are around 270 Leyland Daf workers on the Excel project in the UK, mainly in Birmingham. Leyland DAF shop stewards are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, today, while union officials are due to have discussions tomorrow with the receivers on the future of Leyland DAF. Union leaders are due to travel to Eindhoven on Thursday for talks with the main DAF board in Holland. The UK receivers, who will meet more than 200 representatives of the Leyland Daf UK dealer network today, said last night they believed there was 'a future for Leyland Daf albeit at a reduced size'. The Dutch administrators said in a letter to the company's workforce in continental Europe that discussions about the formation of a new limited company, with the working name of New Daf, had been under way since last Wednesday. The move to transfer the core Dutch and Belgian activities to the new company had to be completed 'in the next three weeks'. The scale of the jobs cuts in the Netherlands and in Belgium was much greater than foreseen in the company's original restructuring plan, said the administrators. 'The expectation is that in Westerlo in Belgium and Eindhoven in the Netherlands the total number of jobs will be at least halved.' Daf has more than 5,000 employees at Eindhoven and around 1,500 at Westerlo. The administrators said Daf Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Daf group, would be 'run down and closed'. Leyland Daf Finance, its UK subsidiary, last week closed its five UK regional offices. They said they would rationalise and sell off 'as soon as possible' the troubled Daf Special Products subsidiary in the Netherlands, which manufactures some military vehicles and aerospace components.

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / People: 'A very good fit', to coin a phrase Roger Holmes is not prepared to venture a comment on what he thinks of the new 10p coin. 'I have to learn more about the options, about what goes into making coins.' No numismatist himself, the new deputy master and chief executive of the Royal Mint who left the board of Chloride in the summer, reckons the job is 'a very good fit' given his own mixture of private and public sector experience. The Royal Mint, which boasts a 1,100 year history of producing coinage, and which is now an executive agency in the context of the Next Steps initiative, is a significant international business, last financial year turning over Pounds 83m (Pounds 60.4m of which was in export sales) and recording profits of Pounds 11m. Master of the Royal Mint is the chancellor of the exchequer, but this is an ex officio position, so that deputy master is both the chief executive and effectively the chairman of the board of directors. Holmes, who takes over at the beginning of next year, succeeds Tony Garrett, 64, who was the first deputy master to be appointed from the private sector. Holmes' career began at the Board of Trade/DTI, where he rose to the position of assistant secretary. In 1980, he was seconded to British Leyland, from where he followed Sir Michael Edwardes to Mercury International. He then 'took the plunge', as he puts it, into the private sector, in 1984, joining ICL, again following in Sir Michael's footsteps. He spent six months at Dunlop before it was swallowed by BTR and has been on the board of Chloride for the past six years. Corporate operations director for the second half of his stint, he was responsible for the overseas battery business in Asia and Africa, and had all central functions, apart from finance, reporting to him. On completion of the large-scale divestment programme aimed at repairing the battered Chloride balance sheet, he left in the summer - having worked himself out of a job, he says - a few months after Keith Hodgkinson, who was recruited from GEC, was made chief executive.</p>

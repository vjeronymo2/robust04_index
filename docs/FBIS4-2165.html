			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--China warned the United  States on Thursday not to interfere in the case of celebrated  dissident Wei Jingsheng, who is facing fresh investigations.    The U.S. State Department expressed deep regret Tuesday over  the latest arrest of Wei and said it had conveyed its concern to  the authorities in Beijing.    Reacting to the US statement, a foreign ministry spokeswoman  said the 43-year-old pro-democracy activist had "violated  regulations when he was on parole and deprived of his political  rights." Describing the case as China's internal affair, the  spokeswoman said it was "inappropriate for any foreign countries  to make irresponsible remarks on this matter."    "China's public security organ is interrogating (Wei)  according to the law," she added.    The Beijing Public Security Bureau announced Tuesday that  Wei, who had been picked up by police last week, was being  investigated for "suspected new criminal offences."    The announcement carried the threat of criminal charges and  a  second jail term for Wei, who was only released on parole in  September, six months short of a 15-year prison term for his  "counterrevolutionary" role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall  movement.</p>

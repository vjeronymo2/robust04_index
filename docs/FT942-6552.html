			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: Back to the future - 3M was practising 'empowerment' long before it became fashionable. Martin Dickson on the company's formidable reputation for innovation At 3M, the US manufacturing giant, they never tire of telling one another - and anyone else who will listen - the remarkable story of Richard Drew and William McKnight. Drew was an enterprising young 3M laboratory assistant in the early 1920s who had a great new product idea: a glue-covered paper which would make it easier for car manufacturers to paint their vehicles without the colours running. McKnight, his boss at what was then a humdrum sandpaper manufacturing business, was unimpressed and suggested he drop the research. Drew persisted and invented masking tape - the first of the family of Scotch brand sticky tapes which transformed the fortunes of the business. A chastened McKnight - who as company president played the crucial role in forming the company's shape and culture - proclaimed that from now on all 3M laboratory staff would be free to devote 15 per cent of their time to research of their own - a guideline that persists to this day. And in 1941, in a paper spelling out 3M's management philosophy, he declared that employees must be allowed to perform their work in their own way - a principle which anticipated by 50 years the current management fashion for worker 'empowerment'. People would make mistakes, McKnight declared, but in the long run these would not be as serious as 'the mistakes management will make if it is dictatorial and undertakes to tell those under its authority exactly how they must do their job'. The tale is of more than historic interest. 3M managers use it frequently both to explain and reinforce the extraordinarily strong corporate culture which has made the group one of America's most inventive businesses, manufacturing more than 60,000 products, ranging from aerosol inhalers to film, video tape and home cleaning sponges. 'The culture is innovative,' says William Coyne, vice president for research and development, 'but management has to continue clearly defining that, for example by revisiting the successes of the past.' It is no accident that a corporate video sent out this year to subsidiaries around the world opened by quoting McKnight's 1941 remarks. 3M's inventiveness means that it consistently ranks in surveys of businessmen as one of the most admired corporations in the US. It was also prominently featured as one of the country's best-run companies in the early 1980s best seller In Search of Excellence by management guru Tom Peters. Such accolades, and the pride that accompanies them, can often be the prelude to a fall - as graphically demonstrated by the management upheaval over the past two years at struggling IBM, another In Search of Excellence star. But over the past decade 3M has quietly kept up its solid growth, without the fuss, managerial upheaval or vast write-offs common at some big US corporations, from its headquarters near Minneapolis/St Paul - a land of freezing winters and hot summers on the edge of the Great Plains which fosters down-to-earth Mid-western values rather than corporate pretension. True, its financial results over the past five years have been unexciting, falling short of its own goal of earnings per share growth averaging at least 10 per cent a year. But this is mainly because 3M is a quintessentially cyclical company, whose earnings rise and fall with the economy of the US - and increasingly that of the world, since some 50 per cent of its sales are now overseas, up from 37 per cent in the mid-1980s. As the US economy strengthens, and Europe emerges from recession, analysts are predicting earnings per share growth of around 8 per cent this year and 16 per cent in 1995. However, there can be no room for complacency at 3M, which faces two central management challenges in the 1990s if it is to retain its enviable reputation. Intense international competition in most of its markets means that customers have come to expect excellent service at very low cost, making it harder for manufacturers to claw back through price increases the impact of inflation on their manufacturing costs. This pressure on margins means 3M has to improve constantly its productivity in manufacturing and distribution, while trying to steal a march on rivals with the invention of new products which, in the words of R&amp;D chief Coyne, 'change the basis of competition'. As an example, he cites a new kind of reflective material which 3M says is three times brighter than that previously used on road signs. 'We have to continue creating,' says Livio DeSimone, the chemical engineer who has been 3M's chairman and chief executive since November 1991, 'but we must bring this more efficiently to the hands of the user. This is the hot topic for us today - and for all those who've got their eyes open and want to survive.' Some Wall Street critics argue that 3M has been too slow to cut manufacturing costs in Europe, where it has been gradually lowering employment through attrition and early retirement. But Doug Hanson, who heads the region, points out that forced redundancies involve particularly heavy severance costs in Europe and drastic cuts in the workforce are simply not 3M's style. 'We always want to do right by the people that leave, because if you don't, the rest of your people are going to be concerned.' Whatever the restructuring record, there can be no doubting 3M's resolve to keep new ideas coming. For many years it had a target - emulated by several other large US companies - that at least 25 per cent of its annual sales must come from products which had been on the market for less than five years. But two years ago, in the light of increasing competition, it decided to raise the bar. Now 30 per cent of sales should come from products less than four years old. Over 25 per cent did in 1993, and this year 3M hopes to achieve the new target fully for the first time. This impressive record is due to several factors. Arguably the most important is McKnight's cultural legacy. His 15 per cent rule remains an important company creed (though far from all the group's 8,500 technical staff spend so much time on their own projects). One of the group's most celebrated inventions in the 1980s - the Post-it Notes which people stick to computer screens - was dreamed up by researcher Art Fry in 15-per-cent time, though he was initially trying to create a hymn book marker. Coyne recalls that when he first joined 3M as a junior researcher, 'I became convinced in less than a day that this was a company which expected me to make a difference as an individual.' But the culture also encourages the cross-fertilisation of ideas between 3M's more than 40 business units. Much of this is done through informal networking, for example through an employee-run technical forum, which runs a series of lectures by inside and outside speakers. Technicians are also encouraged to get out and meet customers, on the grounds that the best ideas - such as Drew's masking tape - come not from sitting in a laboratory but from identifying unarticulated customer needs. Cross fertilisation is also reinforced by official bodies, such as 3M's little-publicised audit teams. Their primary function is to assess the commercial potential of laboratories' new product programmes. But as they go round the group they often come across developments in one lab which can be helpful to another. There is also a complex system of awards for new ideas, though the company generally eschews financial bonuses for inventions, on the grounds that getting them to market involves extremely complex corporate team-work. The culture is also underpinned by 3M's low turnover among research staff and the company's insistence on growing top management from within the company. 3M's R&amp;D effort is hardly flawless. Coyne is concerned about productivity, noting that R&amp;D spending is 7.3 per cent of group sales, compared with a target of 6.5 per cent. Other senior officials express concern that inventiveness could be stifled as the group gets bigger. But this willingness to engage in self-criticism, and benchmark against other companies, may be an important reason why 3M is still expanding healthily, unlike some other corporate superstars of the 1980s. DeSimone also attributes its lack of complacency to the immense diversity of its product portfolio, which means it has to compete across an unusually broad front against top-notch rivals, such as the Japanese in memory media, Johnson &amp; Johnson in healthcare and Eastman Kodak in film. 'If we have any arrogance we work hard at not retaining that trait,' he says. 'It's always been a killer in the long run - but it's a very quick killer these days.'</p>

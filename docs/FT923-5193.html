			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Increases in core businesses limit ADT's fall to 13% ADT, the Bermuda-based electronic security and vehicle auctions company, yesterday reported a 13 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Dollars 80.1m to Dollars 69.7m (Pounds 35m) for the first half of 1992. The result, struck on sales 10 per cent ahead at Dollars 677.3m, was largely in line with analysts expectations. The shares rose 11p to 400p. Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, said the core businesses had retained their 'recession resistant qualities'. Operating profits of the security and auctions businesses had improved to Dollars 53.1m in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 50.6m in the first. During the six months security services increased operating profits from Dollars 61.7m to Dollars 64.2m. The auctions business reported operating profits 12 per cent down at Dollars 39.5m. The company also signalled changes in the US market, which could mean fewer products for auction. For example, car rental agencies were holding on to vehicles longer than anticipated. Six month profits were depressed by a sharp rise in 'other expenses less income' from non-core activities, from Dollars 4m to Dollars 16.2m. These included losses from a travel business and lawn care operation, which Mr Ashcroft said were highly-seasonal. Interest charges fell by Dollars 5.9m to Dollars 23.6m. The dividend is withheld. Earnings per share for the first half fell by 7 cents to 52 cents. COMMENT These figures lend credence to Mr Ashcroft's view of ADT as a 'recession resistant' business. But the longer the recession lasts, the harder it may be to live up to the claim - as other companies are finding. The figures also go some way to polishing up ADT's image. Remaining doubts centre on such questions as whether capitalisation of some costs unfairly flatters the security profits. The biggest reservation is the onerous Dollars 1.2bn debt, including some Dollars 500m of convertible preference shares which fall due in 1994. Until investors are given some sign of how this preference share problem will be resolved, the shares are unlikely to attract confident followers. Full-year forecasts are for between Dollars 130m and Dollars 140m. The prospective p/e of about 9 is not as cheap as it looks.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lazard launches brewery trust Beer drinkers will have the chance to recoup some of their costs when Lazard Investors launch a new investment trust later this month. Lazard Brewers Investment Trust will deal principally in quoted UK regional brewers, such as Greene King and Young, and pub companies and other companies in the drinks trade. Mr Martin Hawks, analyst with Greig Middleton, broker to the issue, said yesterday that the outlook for regional brewers was better than it had been for some time. The sector was characterised by sound balance sheets, strong cashflows and good dividend cover. The trust will be managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, for the past five years investment manager of Whitbread Investment. The trust, to be launched on September 29 with subscriptions closing in the third week of October, will have an initial yield of 3 per cent and an initial 10-year life.</p>

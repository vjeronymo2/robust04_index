			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: CU victorious A decade ago Commercial Union was down and almost out following its ruinous attempt to expand in the US. Yet yesterday's agreement to acquire Groupe Victoire of France for Pounds 1.5bn propels CU beyond any other UK composite insurer in terms of market value and geographic spread. By buying 5 per cent of the French life insurance market, and a smaller position in non-life insurance, CU has staked a claim to sit at the top table in Europe with the likes of Allianz and Union des Assurances de Paris. The question is whether such a large acquisition is a stroke of genius or an act of hubris. The deal has the merit of fitting CU's well established strategy of expanding its life operations in continental Europe. With around 40 per cent of premium income coming from the life side after the deal, CU will be a more balanced insurer than any of its UK peers. If a higher proportion of income from relatively stable life business improves CU's quality of earnings, shareholders are unlikely to complain. The group's cost of capital might also be reduced as a result. CU is not buying Victoire's reinsurance interests, which provide a volatile return and would have reduced earnings quality. In the longer term, building a European network should bring economies of scale, such as cheaper reinsurance and shared development costs. But a genuine single European insurance market is years away. Much therefore depends on CU's ability to manage its new business in the short term. While the French life insurance market is growing fast, Victoire's network of sales agents will have to be nurtured - and probably expanded - to keep up with the bancassurance companies. Its salaried sales force will also have to be kept happy through the change of ownership. Meanwhile, Victoire's non-life side is fighting from eleventh place in a highly competitive market. The record of cross-border European insurance mergers is not altogether happy. Victoire itself suffered for its efforts to expand into Germany in the late 1980s. Given its management record in recent years, though, CU has probably earned the benefit of the doubt. The enlarged group will hardly be awash with equity, which should keep management focused on the job in hand. But by partially funding the deal with shares, CU will prevent its balance sheet from looking over-stretched. It is also comforting that CU has had every opportunity to examine Victoire's books. There seems little chance of a nasty shock. That leaves the question of price. The 30 per cent premium to net assets CU is paying for Victoire is modest by the standards set a few years ago. After the recent property shake-out in France, Victoire's stated net assets should be fairly solid. The early stage of the French underwriting recovery means the deal will almost certainly dilute earnings for at least the first year. But any initial drag on earnings is insignificant when judged against the potential rewards if the combination can be made to work. Should anything go wrong, modest dilution will be the least of shareholders' worries.</p>

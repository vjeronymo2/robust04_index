			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sharp recovery at J Saville Gordon J Saville Gordon, the property investment group with merchanting interests, is doubling its interim dividend on the back of a sharp recovery in first half profits, writes Paul Cheeseright. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 were Pounds 2.62m, more than twice last time's Pounds 1.26m. Earnings per share climbed from 0.85p to 1.74p; the interim dividend is raised to 1p but the company told shareholders 'this should not infer a similar increase in the final dividend.' The total for 1992-93 was 2.2p. Total turnover was Pounds 17.6m against Pounds 13.8m, after sales of Pounds 12m (Pounds 10.4m) from the pipeline equipment and stockholding subsidiary. Underlying the improved performance were three factors. First, there was a rise in property rental income, largely because of rent reviews; this should continue in the second half. Second, rising prices in the property investment market encouraged the group to make sales of properties unwanted in its portfolio; there had been no property trading income in the comparable half. The third factor was the effect of lower interest rates. Interest payable fell from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.53m. Helped by property sales, gearing fell from 78 per cent to 65 per cent over the period, but is expected to rise again in the second half if two planned acquisitions are completed. 'Our property portfolio continues to perform well,' said Mr John Saville, chairman. The group calculates that the value of its holdings, all of which are outside central London, has probably increased by about 20 per cent since the last financial year as investment yields have narrowed.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (7): Freedom to focus on core business - Case study: Whitbread information systems and the FI Group AN INCREASING number of UK companies see the need to focus on their core business while 'outsourcing' the supply of solutions and services in information technology to a third party. For example, Whitbread, the food, drinks and leisure group, and the FI Group, a leading computer systems and training company, has this year formed a Pounds 12.65m strategic partnership to provide system development and maintenance for Whitbread IT systems over the next five years. The FI Group, based at Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, with offices in nine other centres in the UK, took on a hundred employees from Whitbread's central development and support facility in February. Whitbread's systems services director, Mr Fraser Winterbottom, says the contract allows the company to focus on its long-term, strategic IT requirements, 'rather than utilising its people to deliver technical solutions.' The operation of Whitbread's data centres at Luton and Sheffield and communication networks are not affected and the company will keep a small team for business analysis, project management and PC developments. Mr Winterbottom believes that 'the key benefits of Whitebread's partnership with FI are that it enables us to focus our management attention on how we use systems to support the business - and that, over the next five years, we'll gradually move from a fixed-cost base for IT services to more variable costs, depending on business needs.' The partnership is the largest single contract won by FI so far. FI is one of a small number of European specialist vendors that have been successful in capturing stand-alone applications maintenance contracts, according to the industry research group, Input* FOR the financial year ending April, 1992, FI Group achieved revenues of Pounds 24.9m. Its support maintenance revenues of Pounds 10m put the company in second place to Hoskyns in the UK applications maintenance management market. The Whitbread agreement applies purely to people and applications systems software and not to the hardware operations at which remain under Whitbread's management. At the time of the transfer, Hilary Cropper, FI's chief executive, said: 'We are protecting the employees' rights and offering them long-term career opportunities with a developing systems company. 'Whitbread was looking for a partner who could achieve that - and they were aware that on a long-term basis they couldn't attract the expertise and know-how needed to develop their future IT needs.' More than half of the newly-transferred Whitbread staff purchased shares in FI in April. FI has set up a new division called FI Partners to exploit similar business opportunities. The group also operates a range of services, such as 'Mainstay' for applications support and maintenance; 'Software Factory' for developing both proprietary and open systems solutions; plus IT training and recruitment of IT professionals. Lyn Barrat, director of FI Partners, says: 'The critical success factors in partnership deals are not only a sound contract, but establishing a close relationship, dealing openly and meeting expectations. This can mean open-book accounting and profit-sharing. 'It certainly needs a clear definition of the service required and the key performance indicators. It means building into the service level agreement the flexibility and responsiveness to meet changing needs. At the end of the day, it's about getting it right - both for your customers and your people.' While offering a branded application support and maintenance service, FI emphasises the importance of the management process. The group is successful in the financial services sector - it has maintenance contracts with with Midland Montagu's foreign exchange dealing systems; Britannia Life, the Scottish insurance group; and with Barclays Bank for support of its MasterCard, Gateway and Interchange system. Overall, the FI Group believes that applications' maintenance management 'should provide a cost-reduction for the same level of service or a higher level of service for the same cost.' *Input Research Bulletin, London; tel. 071.493.9335  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A selection of leading facilities management suppliers*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                    UK %   Europe %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hoskyns/CGS                  22         10 EDS-Scicon                   12         12 Sema Group                   11          4 AT&amp;T Istel                    9          3 Data Sciences                 8          3 CFM                           5          2 Andersen Consulting           4          - DEC                           3          2 ITnet                         2          - P&amp;P                           2          -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for 1991; source: Input  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Unions settle for pay rises under 4% JAPANESE trade unions are accepting the lowest wage increases since the recession of 1987. Settlements in four leading industries - electronics, motors, shipbuilding and steel - suggest this year's spring wage offensive will yield rises of less than 4 per cent for most workers. After cuts in overtime payments and bonuses are taken into account, overall real earnings are likely to increase by less than 2 per cent this year. Meanwhile, two government surveys predicted the economy would start to recover from the third quarter. Many Japanese industries are expected to reach pay settlements this week. The low increases reflect the drive at most manufacturing companies to cut costs after a third year of falling profits. In the middle of the wage round several leading companies such as Nissan and telecom group NTT announced sweeping job cuts. This has set the context for wage bargaining. Unions in the electrical appliance industry have agreed a 3.6 per cent rise in basic wages, down by 1.1 percentage points on last year's increase, while steel unions have accepted 2.6 per cent, the lowest rise for four years, about 1 point down on last year's rise. Toyota, the biggest car maker, yesterday agreed an increase of about 3.8 per cent or Y11,000 (Pounds 64) a month, the lowest increase since 1987. Only the shipbuilding and heavy machinery industry so far have reached settlements over 4 per cent. The news on pay deals comes as the Economic Planning Agency's index of leading indicators, which predicts the state of the economy three to six months ahead, rose sharply to 50 per cent in January. A reading above 50 per cent is a sign that the economy is expected to grow. The index of leading indicators has been below 50 per cent for more than 10 months. Officials at the EPA were cautious about reading too much into one month's figures. They pointed out that industrial production had yet to recover, and inventories were still growing. The index rose from 30.8 per cent in December, partly because of a surge in machinery orders and lower commodity prices. However the EPA's index of coincident indicators, which shows current conditions, suggests the economy is still deeply depressed. The index was 11 per cent in January. A Finance Ministry survey of large companies found most expected improvement after July.</p>

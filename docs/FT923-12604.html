			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / New hospitals unit raises closure fears EVIDENCE that the gov-ernment is preparing to rationalise health services in London strengthened yesterday when Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced the creation of a special unit. The new unit will be responsible for implementing ministerial decisions 'decisively and rapidly' after Sir Bernard Tomlinson, the former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, produces his report on healthcare in London. The report is due in the autumn, and is certain to recommend a reduction in the number of hospital beds in the capital. London is relatively overprovided with beds compared with the rest of the country. Financial difficulties in the capital's big teaching hospitals have been brought to a head by the new financing system of last year's health reforms. That is prompting health authorities in outer London and the home counties to send fewer patients to the teaching hospitals. Many are being forced into bed closures, staff cuts and other economies as a result. The government is likely to face the politically sensitive decision of closing one or more of the famous teaching hospitals. A report last month by the King's Fund health policy centre suggested that up to 15 big London hospitals might disappear by 2010. The idea of a task force to implement change in London was recommended by the King's Fund, which welcomed the move. Mrs Bottomley said she would announce the membership of the unit when Sir Bernard produces his report.</p>

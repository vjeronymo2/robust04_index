			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> XENAKIS: "Pleiades;" ISHII: Concertante. Les Percussions de Strasbourg; Keiko  Abe, marimba.  </P> <P> Denon 81757 3678 2 (compact disc). Written for the Strasbourg ensemble,  Xenakis' four-movement suite explores the gamut of percussion sounds with his  characteristic mixture of rigorous process and galvanic energy, all pertinently  and powerfully rapped out here. Maki Ishii's 1988 Concertante for marimba solo  and six percussionists is a more lyrical effort, with a diffuse, suspended  sense of time, neatly captured in a performance at once earthy and abstracted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Is Still the Mother of All </F> Evils of the Century"]    [Text] Today, 25 April, is the 14th anniversary of the  disgraceful U.S. defeat at Tabas in the desert. In addition to  being a testimonial to U.S. military ineptitude, this incident  also brought home the reality that the U.S. hierarchy are savage  aggressive individuals who trample on all international  standards in order to attain their own illicit interests and do  not obey even a single law. What has occurred all over the  world for the past 14 years merely affirms the daily growth of  their savagery.    The record of U.S. brutality in Vietnam, the deployment of  its troops in Panama, Iraq, Somalia, its multifaceted support  for the Zionists' atrocities in occupied Palestine, and the U.S.  pressure on the United Nations to remain silent in the face of  the Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all these are evidence  of U.S. barbarianism in past years. On the one hand, it  professes to be a champion of human rights but with the other,  it crushes human beings all over the world under its military  boots. This is the true nature of the United States and of all  of today's domineering powers.    The most serious and appropriate approach to such bestiality  is the one the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted toward the  United States. The occupation of the U.S. den of spies in  Tehran by the student followers of the imam's line and the  categorical stance taken by Imam Khomeyni against the U.S.  Government on this incident and in all other cases is exactly  the kind of treatment that the Americans merit.    Even today the Muslim nations who wish to live in freedom,  who do not want their rights to be transgressed, who do not want  their women and children to be massacred by the malicious  enemies of Islam, have no recourse but to take up a serious and  decisive struggle against the United States.    "The United States is the mother of all the evils of the  century." The truth of this profound statement by Imam Khomeyni  becomes clearer with the passage of every moment. What is  happening today throughout the Islamic world from  Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir, from Palestine to the Caucasus  and Afghanistan, is all under the auspices of the criminal  United States, the United Nations is a mere instrument in its  hands.    Therefore, in order to lift the arms embargo from the  Bosnian  Muslims, to halt the Serbs' aggression in Gorazde, and to quell  all the trouble making against the Muslims, one should fight  against the United States and scorch the roots of its  mischief-mongering. It is an immutable reality that "the United  States is the mother of all evils of the century."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xia Ruge (1115 0320 7041)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- Shanghai achieved a  satisfactory result in its imports and exports this year. In  the January-May period, Shanghai exported $3.244 billion worth  of goods, an increase of 26 percent over the same period last  year. Shanghai's imports increased simultaneously.    The Shanghai municipal government readjusted its strategy  for  promoting foreign trade last year. The move, including the  organization of large foreign export companies, has facilitated  the formation of many great exporting armies, brought the role  of Shanghai as a trading port into full play, linked Shanghai  with export enterprises across the country, encouraged export  enterprises to directly participate in international market  competition, and developed technological and service trade.    At present, there are more than 10,000 export enterprises in  Shanghai, which make up six great exporting armies -- foreign  trade, industrial trade, local trade, self-run export  enterprises, the three kinds of enterprises that are either  partially or wholly foreign-owned, and enterprises run by the  central authorities in Shanghai. Since the beginning of this  year, all of them have experienced an increase in exports.    About 460 overseas enterprises set up by Shanghai's  companies  in 60 or more countries and regions have begun to play an  important role in foreign trade. They have helped increase  export earnings. In addition, by providing an international  sales network for Shanghai's enterprises, they have enabled a  large amount of commodities to be exported to other countries in  the world.</p>

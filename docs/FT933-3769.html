			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead CURRENCY effects should help Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, to report on Monday a lift in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 117m to more than Pounds 140m. The recovery in UK car sales will be balanced by the downturn in the continental European market. Continuing growth in Hong Kong will also mask more difficult trading conditions in Japan, but the group will be quizzed closely over the future of China's experiment in rapid economic development. British Aerospace is expected to return in the black when it reports its interim results on Wednesday. Analysts expect it to show a small pre-tax interim profit ranging from Pounds 20m to Pounds 50m, against an interim loss of Pounds 129m last time. The figures will confirm the company's gradual turn-round, although core military profits are likely to show a decline. Losses in the civil aircraft side of the business will be covered by the hefty provisions made last year. Monday also sees Dalgety announcing its full-year results. Something between a conservative Pounds 119m and Pounds 123m is expected, but the pre-tax figure will mask a motley collection of divisional results. Agribusiness and ingredients should be good, although the consumer goods, snacks and pet-care sides will probably have performed less well in tough and ever more competitive trading environments. The final dividend is forecast at between 12.3p and 13.65p for a total between 20.2p and 21.55p, against 19.5p last time. On Thursday, United Biscuits is expected to report only a modest first-half recovery after the profits collapse inflicted by the US cookie wars a year ago. Forecasts range from Pounds 70m to Pounds 78m, compared with Pounds 70m last time. Any improvement by Keebler, the US snacks and biscuits division, is expected to be offset by margin pressures on McVitie's in the UK and a flat performance by Smiths, the Australian snacks business acquired last year. Also on Thursday, Laporte, the speciality chemicals group which in January snatched Evode, the chemicals and plastics group from the jaws of Wassall, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 46m and Pounds 49m. Last time it made Pounds 44.5m. On Wednesday Taylor Woodrow is expected to swing back into the black with interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10.5m compared with a Pounds 16m loss last year.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mortgage relief I was surprised to see in the article 'Plan to slash your tax bill' (Weekend, March 12/13), that mortgage interest can get tax relief at a taxpayer's top rate. I thought that relief was restricted to 25 per cent for 1993/94, followed by 20 per cent for 1994/95 and 15 per cent thereafter. You can you still get tax relief at your top rate for interest paid on a loan taken out to purchase a property which you let out at a commercial rent. The property must be actually let for more than 26 weeks in any 52 week period. When the property is not let, it must either be available for letting at a commercial rent or unavailable because of construction or repair work on the property. There is no restriction on the size of the loan. Generally, the interest can be set off against your rental income. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

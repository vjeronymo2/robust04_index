			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Weather-wise property - Worth Watching Many towns and villages owe their distinctive character to half-timbered houses, but pollution is damaging many of the timbers. The Wilhelm-Klauditz Institute in Braunschweig is investigating ways of halting the damage by modelling the effects of weather on wood in a large-scale climatic simulation unit. By taking on-site measurements - the degree of moisture trapped in the timber, the presence of fungus - researchers can model what deterioration will take place and future action can be determined.

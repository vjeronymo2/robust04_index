			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Russia's basic foods 'will last 19 days' BASIC food supplies in Russia will be exhausted within 19 days despite new programmes for radical reform designed to replenish store shelves, a newspaper reported yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. Another newspaper accused Russian leaders of 'committing planned genocide' against the Russian people because salaries, pensions, and student grants have risen insignificantly compared with soaring food prices. The reports, two of many such pessimistic items that have appeared in the Russian press since President Boris Yeltsin freed most prices on January 2, came one day after an official forecast two more years of economic hardships. 'Market prices are absolutely out of reach for 85 per cent of the population,' the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported. 'Thus, the transition. . . to a 'market-led' economy has resulted in a shortage of protein in people's daily diets, which (as has been proven on numerous occasions) will soon lead to health disorders,' it said. Although President Boris Yeltsin's reforms have increased the availability of some products in state stores, many staples such as milk remain hard to find. Privately run shops and farmers' markets still sell a variety of different products, but their inflated prices are beyond the reach of most Russians. Sovietskaya Rossiya said the government's policies would lead to genocide, predicting that the Russian population will drop by 10m within 10 years because of insufficient vitamins and other essential nutrients in people's diets. The Russian State Statistics Committee, or Goskomstat, has predicted that Russia's stocks of beef and poultry will run out in 19 days and vegetable oil in 20 days, the newspaper Pravitelstvennyi Vestnik (Government Chronicle) reported. It said butter supplies are expected to disappear in 30 days, and sugar in 41 days. Trade Ministry spokesman Mr Vasily Tikhonov blamed the pending crisis on other former Soviet republics He accused them of refusing to honour contracts to sell food to Russia because they needed to feed their own residents. Mr Tikhonov said Ukraine has provided only 1,000 tons of beef to Moscow and St Petersburg so far this year, a tiny portion of the 30,000 tons promised for the first three months. Belarus has supplied only 4,000 tons of meat products out of an agreed 46,000 tons, he said.</p>

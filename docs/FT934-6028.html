			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts boost National Grid - Developments at three electricity industry companies National Grid, the operator of the England and Wales electricity transmission system, benefited from cost cutting to increase pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 285.3m in the half year to September 30, against Pounds 261.6m. The company also revealed yesterday that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, had increased its market share from 21.4 to 24.9 per cent, a more significant improvement than had been expected. Nuclear Electric will use its share gain, made mainly at the expense of National Power, to argue for privatisation in the forthcoming nuclear review. Mr David Jefferies, National Grid chairman, said the rapid changes in the generation market emphasised the need for his company to have flexible control systems. This was being helped through the opening this year of a new national control centre which employed Pounds 32m of software. The system could be operated more remotely and the six satellite centres had already been reduced to four. National Grid's profits improvement was achieved on turnover ahead 3 per cent from Pounds 666m to Pounds 687m. The company declared an interim dividend of Pounds 46m, or Pounds 920 per ordinary share - a 9.5 per cent increase - for the 12 regional electricity companies which own it. Mr John Uttley, finance director, said National Grid aimed to pay about a third of dividends at the half year stage. He said the profits improvement was achieved in spite of tighter regulatory controls on prices and reflected cost reductions more than anything else. The workforce was now 5,100, an 11 per cent reduction on last year. Mr Jefferies said the aim was to reduce manpower to 4,750 by the year-end and 4,250 by the end of March 1995. Transmission operating profits rose from Pounds 248.1m to Pounds 291.6m but the generations/interconnection business suffered a fall from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 18.6m. The fall was partly the result of a less favourable contract from April with Electricite de France. Mr Uttley said generation/interconnection would probably be down at the full year but less so than the half year results suggested.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/327: "Republic of Korea -- </F> Partial Suspension From the GSP"]    [Text] The Commission yesterday adopted a proposal for a  Council regulation to partially suspend the GSP [General Scheme  of Preferences] benefit for the Republic of Korea. This  suspension will be applicable to textile products covered by the  multifibre arrangement, with effect from 1 July 1994.    This action is the result of the decision of the Republic of  Korea to unilaterally increase its customs import duties for  some products for which the European Union is a major supplier  to the Korean market. This action, has had a direct and  detrimental effect on exports from the Union.    The measures taken by the Republic of Korea, given the  actual  timing of their implementation, are contrary to the spirit of  the Uruguay Round GATT agreement, which calls for freer, more  liberalised Union, in particular, when it is taken by a country  whose per capita gross domestic product is similar to that  enjoyed by some regions of the European Union.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Observer: Fast growth Meanwhile the law according to Parkinson looks to be exerting its grip in Bonn, where worries about the future of the Transatlantic Relationship have inspired the ever active Bertelsmann Foundation to spend at least DM4m on research into same. The study, it was announced, would be carried out by a 20-member Euro American strategy group. Its first session yesterday was attended by eight Germans, 12 Americans, two Brits, and one each from Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland. So even without the French member, kept away by illness, the group has already expanded itself by 25 per cent. The driving force behind the project is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long-time confidant Werner Weidenfeld, a professor at the University of Mainz. His team includes Helmut Schmidt's erstwhile economic adviser Horst Schulmann now on the Bundesbank council, and Bob Zoellick who was deputy chief of staff to George Bush, not to mention the FT's Edward Mortimer. The plan is to commission searching studies into relations between Europe and North America with the aim of producing some resounding conclusions, possibly in televised form, in four years. Let's hope the alliance is still around to benefit.</p>

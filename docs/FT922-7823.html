			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson depresses market LOWER than expected figures from international conglomerate Hanson cast a dark shadow over the London market, helping to send equities in general into retreat. The group's half-year profits, which came in at Pounds 488m, down from the corresponding period's Pounds 588m, were Pounds 2m below the lowest City forecast. Several analysts also took the accompanying trading statement to be downbeat, and brokers moved immediately to cut full-year forecasts by about Pounds 100m to around the Pounds 1.1bn mark. BZW, however, said it was leaving its current forecast at Pounds 1.14bn, although this figure now includes Pounds 27m from the recent sale of the ICI stake. Hanson shares closed 9 down at 232 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 15m and further heavy business in the London Traded Options Market, where the equivalent of more than 6m shares were dealt. GrandMet pleases Encouraging half-year results from Grand Metropolitan lifted the stock 7 to 509p in its biggest turnover for 18 months, 9.3m shares. Its core drinks business was the power behind a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 402m. Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest said: 'Stripping out the forex and other variables, the organic growth in the drinks division was 7.1 per cent, which is an outstanding performance.' The food and the retail sectors proved slightly diappointing, and analysts were also surprised by the losses at the Pearle optical business in the US. County is looking for full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.015bn, down Pounds 35m, and Pounds 1.184bn for 1993. Mr Martin Hawkins at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken has cut his forecasts to Pounds 1.025bn and Pounds 1.17bn respectively. Shell Transport was one of a handful of stocks that bucked the trend as the market was cheered by the group's first-quarter results, which beat the most optimistic expectations. Analysts, however, pointed out that the figures were greatly enhanced by non-recurring exceptional items. The shares ran forward on the release of the figures and at the day's high point were ahead 21 at 505p. Profit-taking at the high levels, coupled with closer examination of the figures, saw the stock relinquish some of the earlier gain to end a more modest 12 up at 496p after heavy turnover of 11m. A sizeable amount of the day's business was reported to have come from the traded options market. Commenting on the figures, Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said: 'The actual underlying trading performance was modest after allowing for a large number of special items. But the shares look attractive compared to those of BP.' Regulation worries, as British Gas reported figures in line with expectations, hurt the shares, which ended 5 lower at 251p on volume of 12m. The regulation worries in Gas spilled over into the Electricity Package, down Pounds 117 at Pounds 3138. Profit-taking was also said to have been a factor in the day's fall. The package is due to be unbundled in September. Anglo-French paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins tumbled after it announced the chief executive's resignation following differences over future development. The shares fell 18 to 263p. Kleinwort Benson favours the stock and yesterday issued a buy recommendation, saying: 'The shares have significant upside and they are a good long term buy.' Among metals and engineers, British Steel shed 2 to 81 1/2 as increasing fears emerged about the size of the dividend cut expected with the company's full-year results next month. A select group of analysts is currently on a company outing to Seville, in Spain. A positive annual meeting at GKN lifted the shares and they closed 6 up at 372p. The recent clutch of broker recommendations continued to benefit British Aerospace and the shares gained 6 to 372p. Good interim results from Burton Group pushed the shares 7 1/2 higher to 49 1/2 p, the Pounds 21.8m pre-tax profits being around Pounds 3m ahead of most analysts' forecasts. The retail group also reported a slight pick-up in sales in the past 10 weeks, leading to hopes that the long-awaited consumer recovery was starting to show. However, some analysts pointed out that sales were bound to see some increase this year after being hit last year by the onset of recession and by the rise in VAT. The level of costs also drew some criticism. New profit forecasts fell in the range of Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m for 1992 and Pounds 18m to Pounds 23m for 1993. Burton was the most heavily traded stock yesterday, with 26.6m shares changing hands. Reflection on results from Marks and Spencer, and talk that its mail order business was holding up, helped Great Universal Stores, the 'A' shares rising 30 to 1588p. A weak Wall Street hit drugs stocks, Glaxo tumbling 18 to 739p and SmithKline Beecham relinquishing 12 to 871p. Catering concern Compass Group jumped 21 to 539p as the market centred on the sale talk surrounding its chief rival Gardner Merchant, a subsidiary of Forte. A management buyout had been rumoured, with a possible listing to follow. Yesterday there was also talk that Compass, in alliance with a US company, may be interested in Gardner, but monopoly implications would seem to rule this out. BZW reiterated its buy stance on Rank Organisation, off 2 at 758p, and Queens Moat Houses, a penny firmer at 88p. In a lengthy view on the sector, the securities house also remained a seller of Forte, 2 down at 251p, and Ladbroke, where rumours of imminent downgrades refuse to die and which lost 4 to 250p. A weak property sector was enlivened by news of the proposed merger between Capital &amp; Counties and its majority shareholder, TransAtlantic, a Luxembourg-listed group owned by Liberty Life. The offer values Capital shares, which started the day at 200p, at 233p. After leaping to 228p, they later fell back to close at 205p on consideration of the dilution to shareholders of the all-paper offer. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (320).

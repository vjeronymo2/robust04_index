			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Scandinavian markets struggle through the confusion SCANDINAVIAN bond markets struggled through another day of confusion, after the Swedish central bank raised its marginal lending rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent, to stem the outflow of funds. The move followed Tuesday's decision by the Bank of Finland to let the Finnish markka float against other currencies. However, Swedish bond prices held up relatively well, considering the swings in money market rates. The yield on the 10-year and 11-year Swedish government bond rose about  1/4 point, on top of Tuesday's half-point yield increase, while two-year bond yields rose from 13.65 per cent to 14.15 per cent. Signs that the rise in short-term interest rates - overnight rates reached 90 per cent - had succeeded in stemming the outflow of funds helped calm fears of devaluation of the currency, restoring some confidence in the bond market. However, the success of the central bank in fending off devaluation may have negative political consequences, given the dire straits of the Swedish economy. 'The focus of the bond market will have to shift from the Riksbank's hawkishness to domestic political implications,' said Mr Richard Gray, a director of international bond research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Trading conditions remained very difficult, amid widespread confusion over rate movements. 'It was a very frustrating day,' said one trader. 'It has been extremely difficult to get hold of paper.' See Lex ITALIAN bond prices proved volatile yesterday, recouping losses of more than  1/2 point to end a point up on Tuesday's close. The market opened lower, on renewed concerns of a currency devaluation. However, news later in the day that the government was seeking stronger powers to tackle Italy's economic problems provided a fillip for the market. CONCERN about pressures on sterling again pushed down prices in the gilts market, which ended half a point lower. Dealers reported selling mainly among foreign investors, exacerbated by reports that the Bundesbank might favour devaluation of the pound, the lira and the peseta. The focus in the gilts market is firmly fixed on currency worries and the implications of the French referendum on Maastricht. However, attention may turn back to the domestic economy shortly. With retail prices and producer prices data due for release on Friday, followed by a spate of figures including unemployment, industrial production and money supply next week, bond dealers will, unusually, be looking for signs of strong economic data. 'Weak data would simply increase the pressure on the government to devalue the pound,' according to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Midland Montagu. FRENCH bond prices ended nearly half a point lower after the release of a second opinion poll yesterday showed a narrow 51 per cent majority for a Yes vote on Maastricht in the referendum. An earlier poll showed only a slightly wider 52 per cent Yes vote. Traders said the market seemed to be having second thoughts about discounting a narrow yes vote. AFTER two days of strong gains, US Treasury prices fell yesterday as enthusiasm over the outlook for interest rates fizzled. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/16 at 100, yielding 7.244 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year note was also lower, down  3/32 at 100 3/8 , yielding 3.834 per cent. Intermediate-dated paper fared better early on, with the 10-year note firming to 100 19/32 (yielding 6.284 per cent) as institutions continued to move out of mortgage-backed securities, fearing the latest drop in interest rates would trigger refinancings and early repayments of mortgages by homeowners, and into intermediate-dated Treasury securities. However, intermediates eventually succumbed and the 10-year ended down  3/16 at 100 3/8 . The rest of the market was subdued, with investors giving back some of the gains earned last week.</p>

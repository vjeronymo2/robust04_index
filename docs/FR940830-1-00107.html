			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A related issue is the point at which a student's earnings must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be counted. For example, a household applies on June 10, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student will be 21 on June 20. Or, a household is certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through December 31, and the student turns 21 on August 10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This issue was addressed in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 dated October 24,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1983, which has since been rescinded. The Policy Memo provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if a student turned 18 in the month of application, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caseworker should determine at the time of the interview how much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income the student received or anticipated receiving after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turning 18. That amount would be counted as income to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household, and any amount received prior to the 18th birthday  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be excluded. For participating households, the Policy Memo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that the student's earned income should not be counted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before he or she turned 18. Because it would not be feasible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine and count only the portion of a month's income that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received after the birthday for an ongoing household, the income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be counted in the month the student turned 18 only if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change occurred on the first of the month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 4, 1991 (56  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 63597), amended the regulations for retrospective budgeting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate the provisions of Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrospectively budgeted households into the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the earned income of a student is counted only if the student is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18 years of age or older ``at the beginning of the budget month.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By way of providing an example, the preamble to the rule (56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 63602) clarifies that in a two-month retrospective budgeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, if a student turns 18 during the month of September, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's earned income is not counted until the month of October  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes the budget month. That is when the student is 18 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of age at the beginning of the budget month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An objection was raised to the provision in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required State agencies to treat applicant and ongoing households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differently. For the month of application, workers were required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to count the income received by a student after he turned 18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in an ongoing household, the income was not to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted unless the student turned 18 on the first of the month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To make the requirements for applicant and ongoing households and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective and retrospective budgeting procedures the same, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are proposing to add a new paragraph (E) to 7 CFR 273.10(e)(2)(i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide that for prospective eligibility and benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, the earned income of a high school or elementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school student shall be counted beginning with the month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the month in which the student turns 22. We are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii) to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrospective eligibility and budgeting purposes that the income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an elementary or secondary student shall be counted beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the budget month after the month in which the student turns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. In the examples above, the earnings of the student who will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be 22 in the middle of June, the month of application, would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in household income until July. The earnings of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who turns 22 in August in the middle of the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period would not be included in household income until September.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligibility workers would have to be alert to a change in the age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a student during the certification period. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, a student's earnings would be included in budget month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income the month following the month the student turns 22 under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both prospective and retrospective budgeting and at application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and during the certification period. Under retrospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgeting, the effect of including a student's earnings would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reflected in the allotment until the issuance month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding to the budget month following the month in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student becomes 22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule proposes to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to provide that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earned income of an elementary or secondary school student shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be excluded if the student is (1) 21 years of age or younger; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> living in the same food stamp household with a natural, adoptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or step-parent, under the parental control of another member of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same food stamp household other than a parent, or in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate food stamp household but living with a natural, adoptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or step-parent; and (3) attending school (including GED classes)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least half-time. We are retaining the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations regarding the continuation of the exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during temporary interruptions in school attendance and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proration of income when the child's share cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differentiated. We are also proposing to amend 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.10(e)(2)(i) and 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) to provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the earnings of elementary and secondary school students shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be counted until the month following the month in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student becomes 22. For clarity, we propose to amend the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the first sentence of 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaged income to add a reference to 7 CFR 273.21(f), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies the circumstances under which retrospectively budgeted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income may be averaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

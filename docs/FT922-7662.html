			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: No justice in the jungle FOUR HOURS IN MY LAI: A WAR CRIME AND ITS AFTERMATH by Michael Bilton and Kevin Sim Viking Pounds 17.99, 430 pages THE FACTS are well established. Early morning March 16 1968 a company of US infantrymen, led by Captain Ernest Medina and Lieutenant William ('Rusty') Calley, arrived at the hamlet of My Lai in Son My village, Quang Ngai province, in the northern part of South Vietnam. They were preceded by an artillery barrage. Detailed to flush out a communist unit military intelligence had falsely imagined to be in the area, the American warriors were disappointed not to encounter a single enemy cadre. But their bloodlust, primed by three months' fighting in one of the most treacherous battle zones of the war, was not to be gainsaid. With impeccable bestiality, and without one shot being fired against them, the members of 'Charlie' company spent the next few hours laying waste everything in their path. Some four to five hundred babies, children, women and old men - civilians all - were ritually slaughtered. Multiple rape, sodomy, mutilation and torture were integral hallmarks of the atrocity. There were two sets of victims: those killed, and those who perpetrated the killings, the 'boys next door' turned murderers. The real culprit was the very nature of the conflict. 'Vietnam' was what the North's commander, General Vo Nguyen Giap, has said it was: a people's war. Famously, in their efforts to expel the foreign invaders, the communist forces went amongst the rural population of the South 'like fish swimming in water'. In some cases that population was sympathetic to Hanoi, in others not. For the US army however this provided intractable difficulties either way. The fish and the water were interdependent, and there was no reliable means of identifying and isolating the enemy. Any hamlet might or might not be a communist stronghold. Add in the gnawing terrors of jungle warfare, the increasing deficiencies of American battalions in terms of training, acclimatisation, leadership and discipline, the widespread availability of drugs, the sheer sense of displacement, and My Lai-type episodes were inevitable. That at least is the drift of Four Hours In My Lai, by Michael Bilton (a British television documentary maker) and Kevin Sim (a British journalist). Of the many accounts of My Lai, this may rightly be regarded as the fullest and, for that matter, the most compellingly readable. The grim niceties, both of the massacre itself, and of Charlie Company's war up until My Lai, are accumulated tellingly. Twenty-four years on, in as far as that sort of thing ever can live on the printed page, the horror is revived. But what makes and breaks this account is the authors' handling of My Lai's aftermath: of both the cover-up within the Quang Ngai-based 'Americal' Division, that kept the episode under wraps for a year, and of the subsequent 'trials'. Unlike other similar atrocities, of which there were many, My Lai stuck to become a front page news story for two reasons: the persistence of Ronald Ridenhour and Seymour Hersh in exposing it, and the availability of colour photographs taken with his personal camera during My Lai by army photographer Ronald Haeberle. Once these latter had appeared, first in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, then in Life magazine, a media avalanche was guaranteed. Bilton and Sim have slogged through the vast reams of paper produced by two overlapping US Army investigations, as well as transcripts of the actual hearings. The result is an awesome picture of perverted justice. Resisting all calls for an international or even independent tribunal, and responding to pressure from Richard Nixon's administration and that part of America's press that was rightwing and racist, the Army clung to its decision to make My Lai an internal affair. A virtual whitewash ensued. While the investigations incriminated, on overwhelming evidence, 30 participants in the massacre itself, and 28 officers in the cover-up, only one man, the hapless Calley, was brought properly to book in the resultant courts-martial. Once Medina and his superior officer, Colonel Oran Henderson, had been acquitted, the phoney legal process ground to a halt. In a sickening cameo we are told how a cake 'complete with candles' was introduced into the court-room to help Medina celebrate his 35th birthday. 'At the risk of poor taste,' quipped the judge, 'we wish you a happy birthday.' As the American establishment successfully manouevred to defend its chosen sons, My Lai collapsed into an unholy farce. Yet it must be said that in dwelling upon the court scenes at Fort Benning the authors have been sold a pass. Like nearly every other book about Vietnam published in the West, Four Hours In My Lai focuses on America, and the damage done to American self-esteem. The other half of the equation is marginalised. Although Bilton and Sim dutifully record the eye-witness accounts of a handful of survivors of My Lai, the engulfing sorrow that still pervades Quang Ngai as a result of eight years' occupation by US and South Korean forces is here unsung. Instead the reader is swamped by any amount of often trivial biographical detail pertaining to the lives of nearly every American mentioned in the text. More seriously, in attempting to provide the massacre with background context, the authors ignore what was the central feature of the South Vietnamese state: that the mainly Buddhist masses were ruled by a venal, largely Catholic oligarchy. It was the latter that the US strove to protect and prolong. My Lai happened not just because, as Bilton and Sim suggest, there was a dichotomy between notional principles and actual behaviour under duress within the American army, but also because of a fundamental disjunction between the rhetoric and the objectives of Washington's policy-makers.</p>

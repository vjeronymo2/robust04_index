			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey </F> Krasnoshchekov and Konstantin Pribytkov]    [Text] Crans Montana, Switzerland 18 June TASS -- One can  have an absolutely tranquil vacation in the Crimea. It is the  best resort place in the former Soviet Union, Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview on Friday  [17 June] in the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana. The  president is attending an international forum on East-West  cooperation.    "There is no need to worry, and this is not because I am  optimistic by nature, but because the reality proves premature  character of rumors claiming aggravated situation in the  Crimea," he said.    Commenting on the Simferopol-Kiev relations, the president  said that the "stage of unilateral pressure and force methods  has ceased to exist." The tension can be removed through  negotiations following the example of Russia and Tatarstan. The  current situation is "not a confrontation but the necessary  elucidation of relations," said Yuriy Meshkov. Further dialogue  will help to reach accord to ensure certainty and stability.    If Russia influences the situation rather actively, things  will normalize for both Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, stressed  the Crimean leader. As for the Crimean-Russian relations, the  bilateral trade and economic agreements, including the agreement  with the Moscow government, shall be filled in with content.  "This opens up great prospects, and it is up to us not to miss  them," he added.    Asked what Russia shall do now, the president said it  "should  use all of its possibilities and finally satisfy its state  interest." Solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem would,  certainly, help the stabilization but, unfortunately, there are  attempts to settle the problem without the Crimean  participation, noted Meshkov.    "The Black Sea Fleet can and must be located on our  territory. The Crimea does not and will not have problems with  the Black Sea Fleet," said the Crimean leader.</p>

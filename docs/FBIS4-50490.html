			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P.C. Tang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Geneva, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes to become a  founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said here Tuesday  [17 May].    "So we hope we can be admitted to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by the end of this year," Sheu stressed  at the opening session of the fifth meeting of the GATT working  party screening Taiwan's membership application.    The Geneva-based world trade regulatory body is scheduled to  be superceded by the WTO early next year.    In preparation for joining GATT, Sheu said, Taiwan is ready  to open its merchandise and service markets. "We are also  determined to abide by the GATT-initiated trips (trade  related-aspects of intellectual property rights) regulations,"  he added.    Sheu continued that Taiwan has adjusted its trade regime to  meet GATT requirements. In addition to slashing tariff rates  for a number of industrial and agricultural products, Taiwan  will also gradually open its telecommunications, tourism,  construction and financial markets to foreign companies. "We'll  also revise our copyrights, trademark and patent laws to comply  with trips provisions," Sheu said.    He further promised that Taiwan will begin consultations  with  GATT contracting parties on the signing of agreements on  government procurement soon after it joins the organization.    By signing such accords, Taiwan will allow foreign companies  to bid for its public construction and government procurement  projects, valued at more than US$20 billion annually.    Taiwan originally planned to sign such accords one year  after  its accession to GATT. Pressured by many GATT members, Taiwan  has decided to start such negotiations upon its entry, but it  will follow the South Korean example requiring those accords not  to take effect until 1997.    Sheu also presented a written statement detailing Taiwan's  plan to overhaul its decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly  system in accordance with GATT requirements.    Sheu asked GATT contracting parties to submit lists of  products for which they want Taiwan to cut tariffs and lists of  services they hope Taiwan will open to foreign investment before  the end of July to speed up Taiwan's GATT entry.    Sheu said Taiwan hopes to begin discussion on the protocol  defining Taiwan's GATT accession in the next meeting of the  working party. "We hope the sixth meeting of the working party  can be held in late July," he added.    In a meeting with GATT Deputy Director-General Warren  Lavorel, sheu said GATT should give Taiwan a 10-year adjustment  period before it fully opens its rice market now that South  Korea, a GATT member, has that grace period.    Sheu is heading a 33-member delegation to the fifth  multilateral meeting on Taiwan's GATT bid, which will last  through Thursday.    In addition to multilateral discussions, the Taiwan  delegation will also hold formal or informal bilateral tariff  concession talks with several GATT members, including Japan, the  European Union, Switzerland, Colombia, Mexico and South Korea,  during its stay here.</p>

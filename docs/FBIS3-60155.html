			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News Conference by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro </F> and Honduran President Rafael Callejas with foreign and domestic  reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Presidential  Palace in Managua; broadcast in progress--live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moderator] We can take two  more questions, considering the president must leave now. Daniel  Croto from REUTER and Roberto Vargas from Radio Mundial.    Croto: Good evening, a question for President  Callejas. I would also like to ask him about the guerrilla  commander, known as El Chacal. During the Honduran election  campaign, the Nicaraguan media quoted the Nicaraguan Army as  saying that El Chacal had entered Honduran territory. The  Honduran Army confirmed his presence but later denied it. My  question is if (politics) is generating the information we are  receiving on this case?    Callejas: I met with AFP and Univision  representatives and both told me that the so-called El Chacal  was a Honduran. If that is the case, it would be a whole  different situation if he were in our country. I actually think  we are giving too much importance to a situation that does not  have any significance in my country. I personally have not  received any report from any government source about the  existence of this gentleman. As I told the journalist who asked  me the same question, we in government have no knowledge of the  whereabouts or the actions of El Chacal.    I can tell you frankly that we have no reason to avoid  releasing that information. I asked the foreign minister and we  have had no military intelligence reports. I have no information  of any kind. The only information I have received about El  Chacal in the past few months came from a Univision journalist  and an AFP journalist.    Moderator: Roberto Vargas and [name indistinct]  after him.    Vargas: Mr. President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, as  a Nicaraguan I am proud to have you in my country. For the two  years I lived in Honduras I was treated well. My question is the  following: We are alarmed about drug trafficking. We have four  cartels in Managua. A drug trafficking cartel was caught near  Atahualinca. I would like to know if you could give our  Nicaraguan Army or our National Police some type of training so  they can better locate drug traffickers. Apparently we do not  have that many well-trained people.    I would also like to ask her excellency, the president of  the  Republic, who loves us so much, a question: Could you ask the  DEA for technical assistance to train young men, people who want  to work and locate drug traffickers?    Chamorro: Could you repeat your last question  please? I did not hear it, perhaps because of the echo here.    Vargas: I also have voice problems. Could you ask  the DEA for technical assistance to train policemen so they can  locate drugs. Drugs enter Managua and the police never find out  about it.    Callejas As for the drug trafficking problem in  the Central American and Caribbean region, I would like to note  that there are a series of agreements signed among ourselves.  The Central American region has an agreement to fight drug  trafficking. This agreement, which includes all Central American  countries, also has direct relations with Venezuela, Colombia,  Mexico, and the DEA. We are all part of a program in the fight  against drug traffickers. There are even radar installations  that cover the Caribbean, and there are information service  installations at the U.S. Southern Command.    All Central American countries are making a great effort to  fight drug trafficking. It is a difficult fight because, while  the drug traffickers have economic resources, the Central  American countries have huge limitations. The latest U.S.  foreign policy decisions do not emphasize the fight against drug  trafficking as much as in the past. It concentrates more on the  producing countries, and therefore, all Central American  countries must make a common effort because drug trafficking has  no borders.    There are agreements, there are direct relations, and I  would  like to say that what one reads in the media are police success  stories in this fight in each one of our countries. There was an  important drug seizure in Honduras and Nicaragua recently. The  effort done by the Honduran police against this scourge of  society is very important despite the huge limitations.    Chamorro: As president of Nicaragua, I can tell  you we have an agreement with the United States under which we  will continue helping as they continue helping us. A large  number of drug traffickers have been identified, who, by the  way, are under arrest. Besides, my dear journalist friends, I  wanted to tell you I believe that all Nicaraguans, as President  Rafael Leonardo Callejas has just said, have to work to produce.  As good reporters you should report to the authorities when  something wrong is going on. We should help each other as [words  indistinct] in this field. We all have to get down and work for  our nation to achieve peace and tranquillity. No one should be  abusing or selling drugs. I condemn all of these things that are  taking place. We all have to work for our fatherland. [passage  omitted]</p>

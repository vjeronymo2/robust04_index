Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's representative on the Cyprus issue, and  Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's acting representative,  met with President Glavkos Kliridhis this morning. The meeting,  which lasted almost two hours, was attended by UNFICYP [UN  Forces in Cyprus] political adviser John Paul Kavanagh, on  behalf of the United Nations, and by Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis, Deputy Minister to President Pandelis Kouros, and  government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis.    In a statement after the meeting, Joe Clark avoided  commenting on the contents of Rauf Denktas' letter on the CBM's.  Asked if Rauf Denktas accepts the CBM's, the UN official  avoided giving a straight answer but said that he is obliged to  discuss the Turkish Cypriot leader's letter with both President  Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas and would only comment on it  afterward. Asked by a CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  correspondent whether he agrees with President Kliridhis'  position that discussions on the substance of the Cyprus issue  should be conducted at the same time, Mr. Clark said that he had  always thought that the CBM's cannot be an end in themselves.  Joe Clark said finally that he would not like to comment on  anything before he meets with the leaders of both communities.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, in a statement  after the meeting, said that Mr. Clark had handed President  Kliridhis a copy of Mr. Denktas' letter. The spokesman added:  President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that he remains ready to  discuss ways to implement the CBM's when the Turkish sides  clearly accepts in principle the UN Secretary General's three  documents. As for the concern expressed publicly by Rauf  Denktas that security problems will increase because of the  CBM's, President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that security problems  probably do exist, especially for our side, and that if Denktas  insists on it these questions can be discussed. Mr. Kasoulidhis  concluded: As you know, President Kliridhis has already made a  proposal for demilitarization.</p>

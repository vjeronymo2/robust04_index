			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leaders shrug off defence defeat Mr Tony Blair suffered his first defeat when the conference yesterday endorsed earlier demands for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear submarine force, Ivor Owen writes. Constituency activists roared approval when it was announced that a card vote had resulted in a motion condemning Trident being carried by 54.2 per cent to 45.8 per cent. It also called for Britain's defence expenditure to be reduced to the average of other countries in western Europe. Labour leaders shrugged off the defeat as a ritualistic gesture which would not change existing policy.

He stressed that on Wednesday the conference approved a statement on defence policy by the national executive committee which reflected the views of Mr Blair.</p>

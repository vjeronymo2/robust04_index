			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl" report: "The Mistakes That Were Made Are Normal"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel  expects overall debts of about 275 billion German marks [DM] by  the end of the year, the official end of her work. Speaking at  the Bundestag's Trust Agency Investigation Committee, she said  that gross losses will be DM345 billion, of which DM68 billion  in revenues must be deducted after the conclusion of  privatization.    So far, 75,000 privatization contracts and 100,000 leases  have been concluded. By the beginning of the year sales of DM49  billion had been agreed on, of which a "double-digit  billion-mark sum" had not yet been received by the Trust Agency.  During her first appearance at the responsible investigation  committee, which took about eight hours, the Trust Agency head  defended the agency's method of privatization and closing down.  Without any experience and, at the beginning, only "with a law  as a tool," it was necessary to transform the GDR economy, which  was generally in need of improvement, into a market economy.  The mistakes that were made in the process are normal.    These mistakes and a number of decisions, which are  difficult  to explain to the public, gave rise in the east to the  accusation that the agency was "ruining everything" and in the  west that it was "wasting money." However, the Trust Agency has  always tried to save as many companies and thus as many jobs as  possible. Through privatization alone, about a quarter of the 4  million jobs existing in the Trust Agency companies in 1990 were  preserved. According to Breuel, in many cases it would have been  easier for the Trust Agency to send companies on to a summary  execution. However, in the interest of the companies, one  decided in favor of time- and cost-consuming liquidation "to  save what could be saved." So far, about 3,200 Trust Agency  companies have been closed down. The president estimates the  costs for closing down at DM45 billion and the revenues from  closing down at DM2 billion.    Committee chairman Otto Schily, Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD], doubted the information provided by the Trust  Agency concerning the preservation of jobs in the course of  closing down companies. In his view, it was not 30 but less  than 15 percent of the approximately 200,000 jobs, taken over in  the course of the proceedings, which have been preserved. On  the fringe of yesterday's meeting in the Red town hall in  Berlin, Schily also accused the Federal Government of massively  hindering the work of the investigation committee. Files are  released with delay or are blocked entirely.  <H5>  Impediment of Work </H5>   Schily thus indirectly commented on the demand of the  Federal  Government, which has called on the Federal Constitutional Court  to reject the SPD group's suit for releasing the minutes of the  meetings of the Trust Agency Administration Council. In late  March the SPD had filed a suit, upon initiative by the SPD  members of the Trust Agency Investigation Committee, in line  with Article 44 of the constitution, because they see locking up  the minutes as impeding the work of the committee.</p>

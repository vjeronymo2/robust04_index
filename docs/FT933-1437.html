			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Croatia wants UN to disarm Serb rebels CROATIA said yesterday it would demand more muscle for United Nations peacekeepers to disarm Serb rebels. Otherwise it would refuse to renew the international body's mandate at the end of this month. The Croatian cabinet called for the 14,000-strong peacekeeping force to disarm Serb rebels who have set up their own state within Croatia or withdraw within two months. Impatient with Serbian intransigence, Zagreb has previously demanded Nato muscle to assert control over Serb rebels. Croat officials have criticised the UN's failure to fulfil the Vance plan, agreed in January 1992, which called for the disbanding of Serb militias in Croatia's four UN zones and the return of refugees. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, this week accused Zagreb of 'willfully misreading' the role of the peacekeepers. He recommended the extension of the mandate by six months but emphasised that negotiations were the only way to solve the conflict. The deployment of the peacekeepers in 1992 froze the six-month war. But the peace plan was sidelined when war erupted in Bosnia. In a stark reminder of the continuing violence, UN officials said the bodies of 66 Serbs, many burned and mutilated, had been recovered after Croat forces seized three Serb-held villages. 'The corpses were in terrible condition - burned, charred, hacked and so forth,' Mr Cedric Thornberry, UN civil affairs director, said in Zagreb. UN officials said the condition of the corpses made it impossible to confirm Serb claims that at least 30 people were civilians. Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnia's wartime parliament will meet on Tuesday to vote on the plan for partition of the republic. Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic yesterday held talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, to thank Britain for helping to secure his release from detention this summer. The Foreign Office said Mr Draskovic, who is in London with his wife as a guest of the government, would hold further talks about the situation in Serbia. The Foreign Office decision to receive Mr Draskovic seems to mark an another attempt by Britain to step up pressure on the Serb government to counter accusations that Britain has not acted with sufficient resolve in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

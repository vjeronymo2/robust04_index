			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN HEALTH SAYS RESEARCH UNIT CAUSED $4.7-MILLION LOSS IN '88  </P> <P> American Health Services Corp., a medical diagnostics-imaging firm in Newport  Beach, reported a net loss of $4.7 million for 1988, even while revenues  climbed 158% to $14.6 million.  </P> <P> A year earlier, the company, which operates imaging centers in hospitals and  health centers, had a net loss of $4.6 million on revenues of $5.7 million.  </P> <P> The 1988 losses came from a subsidiary's research division, according to the  company. The imaging centers, while amassing hefty losses in their start-up  phases, were profitable for 1988, contributing to earnings of $736,000 from  continuing operations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discontinued Operations  </P> <P> TCET -- the research division of American's subsidiary, Neuromedical  Technologies -- was responsible for a $5.4-million loss from discontinued  operations.  </P> <P> Neuromedical Technologies, which also operates the profitable Stop Smoking  Clinics chain, is considered a discontinued operation because American Health  expects to spin off ownership of the subsidiary next week.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, American Health plans to turn over to its stockholders one share in  the new Neuromedical Technologies company for every 10 shares of American  Health stock they own. In addition, shareholders will have a right to buy an  equal number of shares in the new company at $2 per share. The offering is  expected to raise $1.8 million.  </P> <P> The TCET division -- which is developing an advanced medical treatment that  uses an electrical stimulation brain therapy to treat nicotine, alcohol and  drug addiction -- has been a drain on American Health because the division has  not received federal approval to market its product.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help Continue Research  </P> <P> Spokesman Donald Reynolds said the money raised from the spinoff will help the  company continue research until it begins selling its treatment.  </P> <P> American Health expects TCET to receive Food and Drug Administration approval  by the end of this year to market its "electro-stimulation" therapy.  </P> <P> Larry Selwitz, director of research for Cruttenden &amp; Co., an investment  banking firm in Newport Beach, said prospects for approval are promising.  </P> <P> But he said that FDA approval might not come as soon as expected and that other  financing sources may be needed. "The FDA is swamped with applications right  now," he said.  </P> <P> Selwitz described Neuromedical's prospects of sales success after approval as  similar to "a dice roll. The odds aren't great, but if they have what the tests  say they do have, it's incredibly exciting."  </P></p>

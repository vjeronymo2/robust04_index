			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Sales of new cars show further steep decline UK NEW car sales in February were 12 per cent lower than in the same month a year ago as the 2 1/2 -year recession in the industry was deepened further by uncertainty about possible changes in car taxation in next week's Budget. New car registrations in February fell to 109,414 from 124,342 a year before, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported. Sales were the lowest for the month of February since 1976, and have plunged by 42.4 per cent in the past three years from 189,850 in February 1989. Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, said the continuing decline underlined 'how urgently a boost for new car sales is needed if jobs and production are to be safe-guarded'. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, which urged the government to act next week to cut the 10 per cent rate of special car tax, warned that '28 consecutive months of falling sales have inevitably resulted in job losses and business closures'. Registrations of new cars in the first two months of the year were 263,096 - 8.6 per cent lower than a year ago. Ford new car sales tumbled in February by 30.3 per cent to 21,732. The company, which is under severe pressure after record financial losses last year, held on to its market leadership by the narrowest margin. It sold only 149 cars more than Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors. The Ford marque retained its lead only after staging an extraordinary spurt in sales in the final days of February. It achieved 35.2 per cent of its February sales in the final five days. The company has insisted that it took no measures last month to 'buy market share', but in the last five days it captured daily shares of 24.9 per cent, 24.1 per cent, 32.3 per cent, 36.4 per cent and 26.4 per cent. After the first 20 days of the month it held only a 16.1 per cent market share and was in third place behind both Vauxhall and Rover. Ford said yesterday: 'We cannot understand why we had this sudden surge in sales. It was not something that was inspired by the company.' Vauxhall, which has enjoyed a sharp revival in its fortunes in recent years, increased its share of UK new car sales in February to 19.7 per cent from 17.4 per cent a year ago, while Ford's share fell to 19.9 per cent from 25.1 per cent a year earlier. While Vauxhall as a marque failed narrowly to win market leadership from Ford, as a group General Motors, which includes Saab and Lotus, led the UK market last month for the first time in its history.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 7 -- During the second and last day of  debates on Poland's eastern policy, Minister for Foreign  Economic Relations Leslaw Podkanski said that Poland has a  chance to double its trade with the East by 1997. In order to  do so however, the minister emphasized that Poland must take up  a more active economic policy.    "We are a few months, if not a few years, late in renewing  ties with the East," said the minister Tuesday. He stressed  that one of the major problems lies in the lack of insurance of  transactions and trade contacts with the states of the former  USSR.    Podkanski further informed the conference that a draft law  on  insurance of transactions against political risk has already  been prepared. However, the issue of mutual indebtedness of  Poland and Russia still remains unsettled and there is no  efficient system of settlements, he said.    According to Podkanski Poland is behind the Czech Republic  and Hungary in renewing its economic ties with the former  communist states. "Poland's policy must be more aggressive," he  argued stating that Poland's turnover with these countries last  year amounted to 5 billion U.S. dollars.    The minister further declared that the strategic aims and  assumptions of Poland's eastern economic policy centre above all  on Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and, next  on the Baltic states.    According to chairman of the world trade and finance centre  for the East Jaroslaw Mulewicz any programme of economic  cooperation with Russia should embrace several decades since the  process of reforms cannot be expected to be completed earlier.    Mulewicz also pointed to the threat of "Russification" of  the  Polish economy, namely of adopting bad examples of the Russian  economy. In order to avoid this it is necessary to create a  clear system of competition, he said. In his opinion the West's  policy of concessions towards Russia is wrong. He stressed that  part of the assistsnce funds allocated to Russia are being  deposited on private bank accounts.    Participants in the conference also familiarized themselves  with the assumptions of the partnership for development  programme conceived as a complementary programme to the  Partnership for Peace plan. The programme designed to support  economic cooperation, restructuring processes and adjustment to  Western structures would cover the countries of the Central  European Free Trade Zone (CEFTA) and other Central European  states as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States. The  CEFTA states would play the role of a bridge between the East  and the West, it was stressed.    The conference also discussed on Tuesday the question of  Polish community in Kazakhstan. According to chairman of the  Polish community association Andrzej Stelmachowski Poland should  prepare a long-range plan for repatriation of Poles from  Kazakhstan. In the opinion of the Polish Foreign Ministry the  decision on the issue of repatriation should be taken by the  government.    Marek Nowakowski of the government foundation of assistance  to Poles living in the East argued that it was necessary to  create not a plan of repatriation but rather a programme of  education and scholarships for Poles from Kazakhstan. According  to the Foreign Ministry's data some 70,000 Poles living in  Kazakhstan (70 per cent) want to return to Poland.</p>

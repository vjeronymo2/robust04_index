			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / BNL report hints at government links to loan scandal A FORTHCOMING report by a special Italian Senate committee investigating the scandal over Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of improper Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) raises the possibility of US and Italian government involvement in the affair, writes Alan Friedman. The draft report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, states that the BNL affair 'certainly cannot be considered a simple fraud involving a few people'. The report goes on to say there is evidence to suggest a broader scheme tied to Iraq's military requirements and affected by 'international political factors'. The report, which places the affair in the context of the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and US leniency towards Baghdad during this period, also laments the lack of co-operation received from both BNL and the US Department of Justice. It states that the BNL loans, which helped to finance Iraq's development of nuclear, chemical and missile projects, was not the sole undertaking of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager. Mr Drogoul and several others were indicted on fraud and related charges in the US on February 28 1991. One senior Italian investigator has told the Financial Times he believes that US and Italian intelligence services were aware of BNL's Iraqi loans and may have been involved. The Senate report quotes Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the US House of Representatives banking committee, expressing scepticism that US and other intelligence services failed between 1987 and 1989 to track more than 3,000 telexes between BNL Atlanta and Iraqi government ministries involved in military projects. The Italian report, which is expected to be released next month, also notes that FBI documentation from Atlanta remains incomplete. Last year Mr Richard Thornburgh, then the US attorney-general, specifically denied the involvement of any Reagan or Bush administration officials in the BNL affair.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Perot might re-enter race MR Ross Perot said last night he might return to the presidential race if the two main political parties failed to address the economic crisis facing the country, writes Jurek Martin. In an interview with CBS-TV from nearby Dallas, the Texas billionaire said that, if enough of his volunteers asked him to run, then 'like a fire extinguisher, if all else fails' he might re-enter the fray. The interview was vintage Perot, never acknowledging the reasons given for the abrupt withdrawal last month of his never-declared candidacy. It also coincided with the publication of his new book, containing some of the economic policy prescriptions he promised but never made public. When he quit, Mr Perot was on the ballot in about half of the 50 states. He has continued some funding of registration drives in the others, but his movement appears to have died. Mr Ed Rollins, hired to give shape to the campaign but who resigned before Mr Perot pulled out, said he was not surprised by the latest remarks, as 'he liked the limelight'.</p>

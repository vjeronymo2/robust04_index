			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Vicious Propaganda Aimed at </F> Justifying Nuclear Armament and Overseas Aggression"]    [Text] In an interview with Fuji Television on 6 February,  Ichiro Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, made  absurd remarks libeling and slandering our Republic. He talked  about our Republic's nuclear armament, and stressed that Japan  must examine countermeasures to cope with an emergency situation  on the Korean peninsula, saying that if North Korea takes a  military action, it is a big problem.    We can never overlook the fact that this fellow, who is  known  as an influential person in Japanese political circles, has  created a spirit of hostility against us, thus libeling us.    The absurd remarks by Ozawa are an open challenge to our  Republic's dignity and authority and, also, show as it is the  indiscriminative madness of the Japanese reactionaries who  suffer pains because they cannot crush [apsal] our Republic,  thus being frightened at the might and invincibility of the  popular mass- centered socialism of our country.    Why he made such remarks by picking a quarrel with us is not  because Japan is actually threatened by someone. Even Yohei  Kono, president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, has  denounced him, saying that his remarks are intended to agitate  the people by striking terror into their hearts. The Japanese  reactionaries' systemized bad habit are to achieve their heinous  goal by persistently sticking to their insistence.    Through a shock and strategic propaganda against the  so-called threat from North Korea, Ozawa has tried to make an  excuse for the Japanese arms build-up, in particular, for the  acceleration of its nuclear armament and has also attempted to  lead the Japanese public opinion to justify its goal.    It is well known that Japan's nuclear armament has already  been in the level of danger. Japan has largely accumulated  plutonium to use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and has  continued to increase its nuclear reprocessing capacity.    The Swedish paper SVENSKA DAGBLADET has recently reported  that Japan possesses everything -- such as plutonium, an  electronic explosion device, and technicians -- capable of  immediately producing nuclear weapons, and that it has already  produced nuclear warheads which can be operated when they are  filled with plutonium as much as they need.    Even the recent papers of the United States, Denmark, and  Finland reported that based on their documents, the British  Defense Ministry and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency have  proven that Japan actually possesses nuclear weapons. Japan's  nuclear armament and its goal to become a military power, which  are earnestly pushing ahead with, gravely pose a threat to peace  and security in the Northeast Asia, including the Korean  peninsula. Nevertheless, they are talking about a threat from  someone. These are preposterous remarks.    What we cannot overlook is, particularly, the fact that  Ozawa  has openly claimed that Japan must examine countermeasures to  cope with the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. When  we remind of his previous remarks that if a war breaks out on  the Korean peninsula, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces must be  sent there as a member of the UN forces, it is very clear what  his real intention is. This means that Japan must prepare for  taking military action on the presumption that it should  participate in a war in case it breaks out on Korea.    Availing themselves of this opportunity in which the great  powers' positions have been reduced after the Cold War ends, the  Japanese rulers attempt to achieve their domination-oriented  goal by militarily advancing in the Asia-Pacific region. As the  first target of their overseas military invasion, they have  selected Korea. It is clear that to make an excuse for their  aggressive military action, they pick a quarrel with us by  saying that we can take military action. This is an act similar  to a thief shouting "stop thief."    We cannot but be alert to the reckless remarks and acts of  Japanese reactionaries, who are unsteady in their mind because  of their ambitions for nuclear armament and reinvasion. Our  people will never allow anyone to infringe upon the dignity and  sovereignty of our Republic. They will resolutely confront  aggressors.    The Japanese reactionaries must know the consequences  arising  from their reckless act and act with discretion.</p>

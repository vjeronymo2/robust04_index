			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule provides regulatory guidance in accordance with the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 1995, Title VIII of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317, 108 Stat. 1724, 1778 (``Appropriation Act''), which provides $130 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program for Fiscal Year 1995. Section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), as amended (8 U.S.C. 1365), authorizes the Attorney General to reimburse the States for costs associated with the incarceration of illegal criminal aliens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title II, subtitle C, section 20301, of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;322, which amends section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), also authorizes reimbursement to State and local governments for the costs associated with incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens, and authorizes, as well, the option of federal incarceration of such criminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program authorized by the Crime Bill, though similar to section 501 of IRCA, differs in certain respects. One issue raised by the differences among the two statutes is whether local governments can apply for reimbursement. The Crime Bill language authorizes reimbursement to State and local governments. However, the Appropriations Act only provides reimbursement to States. The Appropriations Act provided funding for FY 1995 only for State reimbursement pursuant to section 501 of IRCA. No funding has yet been provided for the program authorized by the Crime Bill. Accordingly, the interim rule only implements the Appropriations Act and section 501 of IRCA. When funding is made available in the future to implement the Crime Bill Program, this rule will be amended to effectuate it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Appropriations Act provides that one-third of the funds must be distributed within 120 days of the start of the fiscal year and that final applications be received from all States by September 30, 1995. In addition, regulations prescribing the distribution of these sums must be promulgated to govern the process. These regulations must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Prescribe requirements for program participation eligibility for States;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Require verification by States of the eligible incarcerated population with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Prescribe a formula for distributing assistance to eligible States; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Award assistance to eligible States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The presence of illegal criminal aliens in this country has presented a formidable challenge to State law enforcement officials and policy makers. Some States with disproportionate numbers of undocumented aliens have been particularly challenged by this population in light of crowded State prison facilities, which have made it exceedingly difficult to keep up with the burdens of incarcerating these individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BJA commissioned a study, conducted by the Urban Institute, entitled ``Fiscal Impacts of Undocumented Aliens: Selected Estimates for Seven States'' (1994), which focused on the seven States in which the largest majority of aliens are concentrated (Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas) and that are most affected by illegal immigration. The study estimates that incarcerated illegal aliens number 21,215 in these States. California alone, according to this study, had 71% of all these incarcerated aliens. The Urban Institute study also estimates the numbers and costs per State of incarcerating illegal criminal aliens. The Study will be used to make preliminary distribution of funds as is explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aliens covered by the program are defined within the authorizing legislation and this regulation in some detail. Essentially the term refers to foreign-born persons who entered the United States without inspection or who entered the United States legally as non-immigrants, but whose period of authorized stay expired before commission of the crime for which they are incarcerated. Only those illegal aliens convicted of a felony are included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with the mandate that one-third of the funds be distributed within the first 120 days, BJA will make an initial award to the seven States covered in the Urban Institute Study based on the estimates contained in the study. The rationale for this initial procedure, described in more detail hereafter, is that use of an independent estimate of number of aliens and cost of incarceration will allow an equitable but quick calculation of partial award amounts for these States, without need to await the type of substantial documentation necessary for final awards, as described herein. The known burden upon their correctional systems due to criminal aliens justifies immediate assistance to these seven States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No reliable estimates are available for other potential applicants, but the overall administration plan described herein will result in an equitable distribution of FY 1995 funds to all eligible applicants on a reimbursement basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- The National Party [NP]  on Sunday [1 May] lodged a formal complaint with the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] regarding allegations that IEC  officials tampered with ballot boxes at the KwaZakhele voting  station in the Eastern Cape earlier this week. IEC spokesman  Humphrey Khoza made the announcement at a media briefing at  Gallagher Estate on Sunday night. The matter was being  investigated by police and the IEC, he said.    IEC northern [Orange] Free State Regional Commissioner Rosil  Jager told reporters that results from only 10 counting stations  were outstanding and she was confident counting in the region  would be completed on sunday night.    Ms Jager said the commission was investigating several  complaints lodged with it, and a team of 100 attorneys had been  appointed to investigate alleged irregularities. Efforts would  also be made to determine to what extent irregularities would  influence the overall result in that region.    It was also announced at the news conference that a ballot  box containing 1,000 ballot papers was found at the  Steytlerville Police Station in the Eastern Cape.    Mr Khoza said the box would be counted separately.</p>

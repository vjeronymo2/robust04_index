			<p>BFN     [Text] Kingston, 2 Jun (PL) -- Jamaican Prime Minister  Percival Patterson has confirmed, here before Parliament, that  his government will allow the United States to use Jamaican  territory to process Haitians intercepted on the high seas.    The next group of Haitians detained on the high seas will be  taken to Jamaica, where U.S. vessels anchored in the ports of  Kingston, Port Antonio, and Montego Bay will be converted into  floating platforms to conduct interviews and to provide  temporary shelter for those seeking asylum.    Reports from Washington note that the U.S. Navy hospital  ship  "Comfort," with a capacity of 1,000 beds, has sailed from  Norfolk, Virginia, for Kingston and that another vessel, flying  the Ukrainian flag, may also leave Tampa en route to Kingston.    Labor leader Edward Seaga voiced opposition to the  government's decision. Although he stressed he supported Bill  Clinton's change in policy of not returning the Haitians without  a preliminary hearing, he said it was unacceptable to use  Jamaican territory to do this.    Patterson disclosed that on Wednesday, U.S. and Jamaican  specialists worked out a bilateral memorandum of understanding  to outline each side's responsibility and in which the White  House has promised to pay all operational expenses for the six  months Jamaica has granted.    Some observers believe strong pressure has been exerted on  Jamaica, which opposed this idea at the beginning, but the  presence of a high-level delegation proved that the report was  not merely media rumors. The delegation included U.S. Under  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; William H. Gray, President  Clinton's special adviser on Haitian affairs; and eight other  officials.    Several analysts believe there is a consensus among members  of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) on the commitment they  must make as a regional organization to resolve the Haitian  crisis and to help President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to  his post as well as to cooperate in reestablishing democracy in  the neighboring country.</p>

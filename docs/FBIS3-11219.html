The meeting will be held on the eve of the 27 March vote in  Washington, at which the continent's 35 foreign ministers will  choose the replacement for Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares  as OAS secretary general.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli -- who is  one of the three candidates for the post -- will attend the  three work sessions of the ministerial meeting, which will be  held on 21 and 22 March at Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign  Ministry headquarters.    The other candidates are Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Berns Niehaus.    Even though it is not on the meeting's agenda, the OAS  secretary general's election will be discussed in the corridors  and even during formal sessions, which are flexible and during  which any delegate can raise an issue, diplomatic sources told  EFE.    Brazil, the country that hosts the meeting in its capacity  as  holder of the annually rotating secretariat of the most  important Latin American political forum, supports Gaviria and  is confident he will win, a high-ranking Itamaraty official told  EFE.    Gaviria should win, despite the fact that "the situation has  not yet reached a definitive status," he said.    The majority of Rio Group countries that referred to the  matter -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico  -- support Gaviria.    The Costa Rican candidate has assured that he has the  support  of the Caribbean and Central American bloc, while the Venezuelan  candidate has called on his two opponents to hold a television  debate to be aired to the entire continent for the purpose of  outlining their positions toward the OAS.    The winner of the 27 March vote will be installed during the  OAS general assembly to be held from 5-10 June in the Amazon  city of Belem do Para (northern Brazil), the hometown of Baena  Soares, a former Brazilian deputy foreign minister who has held  the OAS secretariat for two consecutive five-year periods since  1984.    The Rio Group ministers and government delegates will  address  various international issues dealing with commerce, disarmament,  UN bylaws' reform, the environment, the antinarcotics fight,  democracy, human rights, and initiatives to end the military  regime in Haiti.    They also will exchange views and seek a consensus on the  position of Latin American governments on a continental summit  called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami.    The ministerial meeting will coincide with the official  visit  of 5.5 hours that U.S. Vice President Alberto Gore will pay to  Brasilia on 21 March with the objective of promoting the  continental summit with Brazilian President Itamar Franco.    Gore today began in La Paz a short tour of Latin America  that  will include stopovers in Buenos Aires and Brasilia.    Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister Ralph Maraja  and Jorge Gordillo, one of Peru's deputy foreign ministers,  already have arrived in Brasilia to attend the Rio Group meeting.    Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim (Brazil), Antonio Aranibar  (Bolivia), Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), Luis Ramirez  Boettner (Paraguay), Manuel Tello (Mexico), Gladys de Vielman  (Guatemala), Carlos Figueroa (Chile), and Sergio Abreu (Uruguay)  have confirmed that they will attend.    Other delegations scheduled to arrive today or on 21 March  will be headed by Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando  Petrella and Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia,  while Ecuador will be represented by its ambassador in Brasilia,  Cesar Valdivieso.</p>

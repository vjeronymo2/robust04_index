			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Daf wins Pounds 22m temporary lifeline from bank creditors DAF'S NINE leading bank creditors yesterday threw a temporary lifeline to the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker by granting it Fl 60m (Pounds 22m) in new bank funding. Daf, which has a workforce of 12,650, was forced to file for protection against its creditors on Tuesday after running up losses of Fl 800m in the past three years. The new bank funds would allow Daf to pay wages and meet other trading expenses for a month. In that period, the receivers of Daf's European businesses, operating under UK, Dutch and Belgian insolvency law, will review the long-term prospects of the company's operations. Administrative receivers were appointed late yesterday to Daf's main UK operations, while in the Netherlands strenuous efforts were under way to salvage the Daf operations. Dutch government officials met union leaders and provided guarantees that the Daf payroll would still be met for the coming month. The government would act as a short-term financier in the unexpected event that the bank consortium, led by ABN Amro, failed to provide the bridging finance. It is understood that an attempt is being made to create a new company in the Benelux countries, which could include Daf's present medium and heavy truck production units based there. It is unclear if any of the UK operations would be included. Mr Koos Andriessen, Dutch economic affairs minister, said he believed Daf could survive in a concentrated form but warned of painful job cuts. A spokesman for Mr Luc Van den Brande, who heads the Flemish regional authority, said the receivers were considering liquidating the old company and regrouping its heavy and medium truck activities in a new business. Other plans were also being considered. The Dutch administrators, Mr Louis Detering, of Eindhoven, and Mr Friso Meeter, of Rotterdam, were unavailable for comment. In the UK, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, two partners at accountants Arthur Andersen in London, were appointed administrative receivers to the three principal UK subsidiaries of Daf. The company has a workforce of about 5,500 in the UK, mainly in Leyland and Chorley, Lancashire, Birmingham, Thame and Glasgow. Mr Talbot said trading would continue in the companies and he hoped to develop a strategy to ensure the survival of the businesses and their sale as going concerns. He would not comment on the prospects for employees, but said his staff would be working closely with both management and unions. Mr Talbot's appointment covers Leyland Daf, Leyland Daf Holdings and Leyland Trucks. It does not cover Leyland Daf Finance. A management buy-out of the Leyland truck plant in Lancashire was proposed yesterday by Mr Ian McKinnon, a former manufacturing head of Leyland Trucks, who led a buy-out of Leyland Bus in 1987 and sold it to Volvo the next year. The surprise provision of new bank funds came from a banking syndicate led by the Dutch bank ABN Amro and included Rabobank of the Netherlands, Generale de Banque of Belgium, Credit Lyonnais of France and three UK banks, Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster. NatWest has taken charge from ABN Amro of the process of co-ordinating bank creditors in the UK. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said on BBC radio yesterday: 'The government stands ready to work closely with Leyland DAF, the receivers, the banks and other interested parties to mitigate as far as possible the impact on UK jobs.' But he said the government would not offer a loan to subsidise losses. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, has written to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC commissioner for industrial affairs, urging him to intervene. He asked the commissioner to bring together the three member countries involved to find a common approach to save Daf. The Daf crisis, Page 6 Observer, Page 19</p>

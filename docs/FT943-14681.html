			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round increase lifts Jacques Vert to Pounds 2.1m On turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 45.1m, pre-tax profits of Jacques Vert, the ladies' fashionwear group, doubled to Pounds 2.09m for the 53 weeks ended April 30. This compared with Pounds 1.03m last time. Earnings per share expanded from 8.8p to 13.45p while the dividend is stepped up 50 per cent to 4.5p (3p) with a final payment of 3p. Mr Alan Green, chairman, said that the level of activity in all areas of the business continued to increase with retail activities 'particularly pleasing'. He added that directors planned to extend the group's national coverage of concessioned units. Operating profits from continuing activities rose from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 2.33m and were achieved after costs incurred in the setting up of two new brands, Mr Green stated. The level of net bank borrowings continued to fall and was reduced from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.02m, resulting in gearing of 24.2 per cent (37 per cent).</p>

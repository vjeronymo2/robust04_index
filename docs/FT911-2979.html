			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (40): A new channel for grievances - Pensions / But the Ombudsman's influence does have limits EMPLOYEES and their dependents, who have a grievance about their pensions or other benefits from their company pension scheme, can now have their complaint investigated by the Pensions Ombudsman, Michael Platt. He opened his doors for business at the beginning of this month, operating from an office* in London. The Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), under the guidance of its founder, Margaret Grainger, has provided a very successful voluntary complaints service for the past seven years. But it had no legal teeth, and had to rely on tact and persuasion. If this failed, the only recourse open to a person with a pension grievance, and who could get no redress from a company scheme or an employer, was through the courts - a time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive exercise. The Pension Ombudsman, set up under the 1990 Social Security Act, provides a free, user-friendly service. He has wide statutory powers to investigate and settle disputes. The government's original intention was that the ombudsman would handle all complaints relating to private-sector pensions, including personal pensions; but subsequent regulations have required it to draw back from this all-embracing concept. Nevertheless, he still has very wide powers. He can adjudicate on complaints about injustice caused by maladministration, and in a dispute of fact or law. A clearer idea of how Mr Platt is developing his role will emerge when he makes his first annual report. Nevertheless, any individual with a grievance over pensions should not stop to consider whether or not it falls within the Ombudsman's reference, but contact the bureau. The ombudsman cannot usurp the functions of the trustees in exercising their discretions, such as the payment of a death-in-service benefit; but he can ensure that the trustees have operated within the rules of the scheme, and that they have taken all relevant facts into consideration. Again, the ombudsman cannot directly overrule the scheme actuary in the calculation of transfer values. But he can ensure that the actuary has conformed to the professional guidelines in making the calculation, and that the basic details, such as length of service, are correct. The ombudsman has adopted the policy long followed by Opas, that no one making a complaint will get a purely negative response. If he cannot deal with the complaint, then advice and guidance will be given as to whether another complaints body might handle it; or, failing that, the complainant may be given an explanation of his situation. For the ombudsman has incorporated Opas into his operations, to handle the advisory and conciliatory aspects of the service. The stages of handling a complaint are: 1, The complainant must first raise the matter with the trustees or managers of the scheme. 2, If he or she fails to get satisfaction, then he should contact Opas for help. If the complainant contacts Opas without having first raised the matter with the trustees or managers, Opas would tell him to do so, though would also give guidance on who to approach and how to raise the matter. This service is useful to a person who has a complaint or enquiry about benefits from a previous employer's scheme with whom he has had no dealings for some time. 3, Opas, through its countrywide team of voluntary advisers, would examine and investigate the complaint. Most of the complaints so far received by Opas arose through misunderstanding on the part of the complainant, or maladministration by the scheme, and can be resolved by explanation or negotiation. The complainant can go direct to the ombudsman, but the ombudsman will encourage him to go to Opas first. 4, Where Opas is not able to resolve the complaint, either through unwillingness on the part of the scheme trustees or the complainant, or because adjudication is required, then the Ombudsman will investigate the complaint. He has the statutory powers to require schemes to produce documents, explain their attitudes and decisions and attend hearings. He can seek the guidance of the courts on points of law. Above all, his decision is binding on both the scheme and the complainant, subject to appeal on a point of law. Michael Platt hopes it will be possible to handle most cases by letter. But where necessary, he will have personal hearings, either separately with both parties, or jointly with both present. Complaints must be made within three years of the matter's arising, though this can be extended if the facts were not known within the time, or if it was not practicable to complain within the time-limit. The ombudsman can deal only with individual complaints; so where there is a general complaint, such as occurred recently with the pensioners in the Imperial Tobacco pension scheme, a person must be selected to make a test-case complaint. Complainants can be legally represented, and the Ombudsman has the power to award costs. But since this is not a tribunal, a complainant cannot apply for legal aid. *The address of both the Pensions Ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service is 11, Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB. But there are separate telephone numbers: the Ombudsman is 071 834-9144, and Opas 071 233-8080.</p>

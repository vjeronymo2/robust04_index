			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / One regulator urged for banks and societies There should be a single regulator for building societies and banks, Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, said yesterday. Mr Birch told a Chartered Institute of Bankers' seminar that, in spite of the differences in ways of operation, he believed it would make sense for the two types of organisation to be regulated by a single body. This might mean the Building Societies Commission becoming part of the supervisory department of the Bank of England. The question of regulation is set to arise as a result of the consultation document on societies which the government is due to publish this month. The Treasury, however, is likely to address the point only obliquely, and may argue that changes in societies' powers and duties do not necessarily imply a change of regulator. Abbey National used to be a building society, and Mr Birch has been among the most outspoken critics of the arrangements by which building societies are accountable to the millions of customers who own them. He used his speech to press once again for further duties on society boards to put all takeover and merger offers to their members in a way they are not obliged to do at present. Mr Birch also suggested that as mutual organisations, societies should not make so much profit, and should return surplus profits to their members, perhaps through dividends.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen weakness continues THE YEN continued to show signs of weakness during a quiet day in the UK currency markets, writes Emma Tucker. The frailty of the Japanese currency was a reflection of growing concern about the domestic economy, analysts said, with the plunge in the Japanese equity market undermining the yen. The dollar gained on the Japanese currency to Y133.23/33 in London from the previous day's close of Y132.65. The short-term outlook for the dollar was still dominated by worries about the US recovery, proving to be slower than expected, and speculation over a consequent cut in US base rates and a possible rise in German interest rates. By mid-afternoon in London the dollar was sitting at DM1.6255/65 after a DM1.6275/85 start. After trading firmly against the yen and the D-Mark in late Asian trading, it closed in Tokyo at DM1.6280/85. It finished in London at DM1.6250. Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain in a narrow range until tomorrow's UK general election. US producer and consumer price data, released later this week, could also give the market a jolt. The US currency finished New York trading last night at DM1.6210/20 and Y133.05/15, compared with Monday's close of DM1.6255 and Y133.17. The pound perked up and regained some of the ground lost to the D-Mark recently. Many traders suspected the Bank of England had been buying through the UK clearing banks. Sterling ended in London at DM2.8425, up from a previous DM2.8375. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, said: 'It was very much a quiet day. The markets are going to stay in their current state until the end of the week. With all the opinion polls showing pretty much the same result, the key test now is election day itself.' While many traders are expecting a rise in interest rates to protect sterling if Labour were to win the general election, Mr Lyons said the real influence on base rates would be the attitude of international investors, likely to be influenced by what domestic investors do on Friday. The growing support for far-right parties in Germany's state elections last Sunday contributed to the D-Mark's fall across the board. 'The D-Mark has been upset by political movements,' said one dealer, although she added that there was enough political uncertainty elsewhere in Europe to prevent it falling too far. Meanwhile, the French franc continued to benefit from the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister last week. Mr Beregovoy is due to make a policy statement to parliament today. Some dealers said it might be a signal for a further advance by the French currency.</p>

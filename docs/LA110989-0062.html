			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SMOKERS URGED TO TAKE MORE VITAMIN C, WITH VEGETABLES A  GOOD SOURCE  </P> <P> The 10th edition of the Recommended Dietary Allowances, which were recently  announced, encouraged smokers to increase their intake of Vitamin C to 100  milligrams per day in order to replenish body stores depleted by smoking. Since  winter produce is a primary source of the nutrient, now is a good time to take  advantage of its nourishing effect.  </P> <P> According to USDA Handbook 8, oranges, kiwis, Brussels sprouts, broccoli,  kohlrabi, cauliflower and raw cabbage are ideal for meeting the body's need for  Vitamin C. Oranges and kiwis provide more than 100% of the daily allowance for  Vitamin C. They are the fruits of choice -- boasting 70 mg. per whole orange,  about 74 mg. for each kiwi.  </P> <P> As vegetables go, Brussels sprouts and broccoli are best. A one-half cup  serving of either cooked sprouts or diced broccoli pieces has about 48 mg. of  Vitamin C. The same size portion of kohlrabi has about 44.5 mg. Cooked  cauliflower, a one-half cup serving of flowerettes, provides about 34 mg.  Cabbage, a lesser source, offers about 15 mg. per one-half cup.  </P> <P> While the RDA of 60 milligrams is sufficient to prevent scurvy (10 mg. is  required for protection), it is thought that the additional intake may provide  some protection against cancer for smokers. However, there is no data to  support a link between increased Vitamin C intake and decreased risk.  </P> <P> What is known about the nutrient is its value in the formation of collagen, the  protein that provides elasticity to tissues. Collagen is the foundation for  various organs within the body, such as bones, teeth, skin and tendons. It also  is an element of scar tissue, which heals wounds. It makes up the reinforcing  structure that mends fractures and the supporting material of capillaries that  prevents bruises. Vitamin C protects against infections, enhances iron  absorption and serves as an antioxidant, as well.  </P> <P> Vitamin C is, however, easily destroyed. As a water-soluble substance, it is  easily leached out of foods by overcooking and it is excreted in the urine  daily. Therefore, health professionals recommend replenishing blood stores each  day with foods rich in the vitamin. This should eliminate the need for  excessive intake through vitamin supplements.  </P> <P> BARLEY-STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS  </P> <P> 4 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> 1 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon caraway seeds  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/3 cup barley  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 2 (16-ounce) cans whole tomatoes, crushed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves, crumbled  </P> <P> 1 large head cabbage  </P> <P> Heat 2 tablespoons oil in small nonstick saucepan until hot.

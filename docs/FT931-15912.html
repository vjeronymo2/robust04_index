			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Our fingers on the button BULLY for George Bush, and bully for Boris Yeltsin. The scale of their latest arms reduction pact, Start 2, is generous enough to bring tears to the eyes. But I was in for a shock when I studied the small print of this week's news stories detailing the extent of Britain's nuclear arsenal and explaining that its nuclear deterrent was unaffected by Start 1 or 2. Apparently, Britain has 192 nuclear warheads at present, and will increase this to as many as 512 warheads under the Trident submarine programme. Perhaps this is commonly known. But I was not aware of the numbers. According to one defence correspondent: 'By the time Start 2 (has been) implemented in 2003, those 512 warheads will represent about 15 per cent of the total number of warheads across the whole spectrum of American strategic nuclear weapons. . . Trident's raison d'etre is still principally to help counterbalance the former Soviet strategic arsenal, to deter would-be blackmailers and to keep Britain's place as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.' This seems to me outrageous. What business has Britain got with 512 nuclear warheads, or playing tit-for-tat with hypothetical 'blackmailers', or clutching, like a drunken dowager, to the illusion of power via permanent membership of the UN Security Council? In my view, there should be a referendum, the result of which, I am sure, would be a call by the populace for the immediate cancellation of most of those warheads. One of the reasons that I was attracted by Ross Perot's US presidential candidature last year was his fascination with teledemocracy, electronic town halls, on-line voting, real-time decision-making by voters. Perot, like me, believes in power for the people. The UK Establishment - not just Laurel and Hardy, but all the other comedians - hate referenda. Presumably, they hate the populace, are afraid to consult it directly. (I do not count general elections. They are held too infrequently, under rough and ready rules, and are as useless as opinion polls, if you ask my opinion.) What we need are frequent referenda on topics large and small. To kick things along, I am reviving my plan to launch the British Board of Referenda. Ross Perot will be its first life president. Security will be in the hands of his boys from Dallas. We shall hold a referendum at least once a week, possibly in tandem with the national lottery. Excitement is guaranteed. Voting will be obligatory. The government will be instructed (by the populace) to enact necessary legislative changes within four working days. I have consulted Ross Perot. It is our belief that many improvements to our national life could be achieved quite quickly. The populace will be asked if it wants to: 1) Sack Norman Lamont, then ponder which other government ministers should be pensioned off because of decrepitude, weariness or hubris. (Michael Heseltine, for example, scores three out of three.) 2) Sack most of the shadow cabinet. Their performance, if anything, is worse than the government's. 3) Appoint Paddy Ashdown ambassador to Bosnia, Serbia, Scotland or Fiji. 4) Sack a Treasury mandarin a day until there are unequivocal signs of profound economic healing. This idea was suggested last summer by Teresa Gorman, a Tory MP, and then endorsed by hairy-chested pundit Anatole Kaletsky and by Hawks &amp; Handsaws. Gorman to receive a Pounds 5,000 cash payment for all-round gumption; Kaletsky and H &amp; H Pounds 2,500 each. 5) Reduce, at a stroke, the number of British nuclear warheads to five, and specify their targets. For example, one could be targeted on Bonn, to concentrate German minds. A second could be pointed at Paris. A third could be aimed at Sainsbury, to make it clear that none of us is fooled by its current chicken-feed price reductions, and to encourage the supermarket giants to make deep and lasting price cuts instead of bleeding us all white. That leaves two warheads for emergencies. 6) Bring back capital punishment. 7) Fine the Queen Pounds 500m in back taxes, set Prince Charles aside, and name Princess Diana next in succession. That would just be scratching the surface. The enfeeblement of Britain has gone too far. Steps must be taken. Ross Perot and I will be in touch with you shortly.</p>

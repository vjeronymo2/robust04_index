			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 ANITA BAKER "COMPOSITIONS" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> On one level -- as a showcase for Baker's vocal expertise -- this is an  admirable album. Those who appreciate canny vocal attacks can marvel at her  jazzy styling -- complete with offbeat phrasing, anguished wails and novel note  extensions.  </P> <P> As a female jazz/R&amp;B singer, Baker has no peer.  </P> <P> But on other levels, this album of sad love songs has problems. Though  generally spare, the arrangements suffocate the songs, which seldom flow  smoothly. "Fairy Tales," extended by a graceful piano solo, is the lone  exception. The mostly slow, sometimes medium tempos seem to drag.  </P> <P> Also, the album's scope is too narrow -- too much melancholy. Even a  medium-tempo song like "Soul Inspiration" is more suitable for a blue mood.  Despite its slight bounce, "Lonely" is tinged in gloom.  </P> <P> If you're down in the dumps, listening to this album can be fun, like  commiserating with someone in the same boat. Otherwise, unless you really love  Baker's voice, the album will be a real bring-down.  </P> <P> Baker needs to lighten up a bit. A cheery song or two, about nothing very  serious, would have given this album some badly needed variety.  </P> <P> She has accumulated a large pop following with her previous two albums -- which  do have some pop appeal. But this album, with its much stronger jazz/R&amp;B  slant, may alienate the pop crowd. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

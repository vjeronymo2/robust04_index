			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: China's Exim bank begins operations China's growing international commercial links will be strengthened today when its Export and Import Bank begins operations. Mr Lei Zuhua, the bank governor, said the bank would focus on export credit initially and already had plans to support three projects. These include the launch of an overseas satellite, the sale of aircraft to Pakistan and a ship to Norway. Some Yn500m (UDollars 57.5m) has been earmarked for these projects. Mr Lei said the new bank would approve loans worth Yn3bn to exporters this year, with about Yn2bn of the funds being disbursed. The bank's registered capital is Yn3.38bn. It plans to raise additional funds by issuing three-year bonds with a target this year of Yn1bn-Yn1.5bn. The Exim bank's charter also permits it to float bonds internationally and participate in syndicated loans. The bank is being launched as part of a far-reaching shake-up of China's banking system, which includes the formation of policy banks responsible for lending to infrastructure and agriculture. The new export credit bank falls into the same category as the policy-lending institutions.</p>

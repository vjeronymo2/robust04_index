Amorim refuted criticism that the implementation of Mercosur  was being delayed. He added that the member countries are  merely negotiating schedules with longer adjustment terms for  the implementation of the common custom fee.    The minister told the congressmen that trade among the  Mercosur member countries has increased from $4.5 billion to $8  billion in the last three years.</p>

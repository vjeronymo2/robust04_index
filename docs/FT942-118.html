			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Dollar hits yen low on Japanese political uncertainty The dollar slipped to a post-1945 low of Y98.55 yesterday amid market uncertainty about the implications of the appointment of a socialist prime minister in Japan. Traders were unsure how Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime minister, would handle the US-Japan trade talks. Concern was also expressed about the Social Democratic party's more sympathetic attitude towards North Korea. However, European bond and stock markets stood firm in the face of dollar weakness. The fall in the dollar came in spite of an earlier fillip from overnight comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, saying the US would not use the dollar as a tool of trade policy. In the most forthright defence yet of a strong dollar from a senior administration official, Mr Bentsen told a New York audience: 'A stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the world's economy.' Analysts said it was important that that message was should be repeated by a broad range of senior administration officials, but emphasised that it was only one component of a successful defence of the dollar. Most agree that the Federal Reserve will also have to raise US short-term interest rates. Although the US currency remained weak, trade was not particularly heavy. Confused market conditions have driven many participants to the sidelines, and there are few signs of heavy speculation against the dollar. The dollar closed in London at Y98.765 from Y100.210 on Tuesday. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5825 from DM1.5849. In London the September long gilt future, helped by a successful floating-rate note auction, was nearly  3/4 of a point higher. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 37.3 higher at 2946.3. In France, the CAC Index rose 10.57 to 1936.33 while in Germany, the DAX jumped 28.04 to 2046.30. Government bonds made modest gains in both countries.

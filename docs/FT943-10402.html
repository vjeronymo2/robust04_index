			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Tyneside aid move 'hinders recovery' The government's proposal for an enterprise zone to help Tyneside recover from shipyard job losses has blighted development of a key economic regeneration site, it was alleged yesterday. Local urban-regeneration leaders, MPs and councillors agree that the activities of government-funded North Tyneside City Challenge were seriously hampered by the enterprise zone announcement in May last year. The five-year City Challenge initiative began operating just a month before the government said a Tyneside enterprise zone might be declared. It had focused its Pounds 37.5m programme on the economic spin-off from developing the Silverlink business park beside the A19 corridor, with the aim of attracting up to Pounds 100m of inward investment. But the possibility that part of this 200-acre site might win enterprise zone status, bringing a decade of capital allowances and exemption from business rates, has deterred the private sector from making commitments. The government is unlikely to come to a final view on a zone until it is clear whether Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, can be sold as a going concern. If it does then specify sites for the proposed 250-acre zone, it will need approval from the European Community, a process taking up to 18 months. Mr David Clouston, chairman of North Tyneside City Challenge and chairman and managing director of Silverlink Properties, the site's developer, said yesterday: 'It's a damn stupid thing to have announced. The government preaches the market but they don't appear to have a feel for how it works.' Mr Clouston said that because of the uncertainty, multi-million pound developments due to start on the site were on hold, as was the City Challenge marketing programme. A decision may now have to be taken on changing the entire thrust of the City Challenge programme away from economic activity. Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, whose constituency includes Swan Hunter's main yard, said: 'What this shows is the need for some proper strategic planning in the whole area of economic regeneration and development.' Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside council, said the uncertainty about the zone meant the City Challenge A19 corridor site was being 'blighted'. The Department of the Environment, which is responsible for enterprise zones, said the offer was part of a package of aid measures for Tyneside. There had since been discussions with North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Newcastle councils to determine whether they wanted the zone and which sites might be included. It added: 'If people think an enterprise zone may be designated they may well hold off.' North Tyneside council yesterday wrote to Swan Hunter receivers Price Waterhouse urging them to finance the cost of Swans' tendering for a Ministry of Defence ocean survey ship. The council, which said it was a 'significant creditor' of Swans, said it believed other creditors would share its view.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The peace talks continued in the Zambian capital  yesterday, even though it was a Saturday. There was no plenary  meeting, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and  the troika of observers held a lengthy meeting with the Luanda  team led by Faustino Muteka to discuss issues pertaining to the  second round of presidential elections. This issue had already  been discussed with the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] team on 15 April. It would  appear that there were not too many problems and UNITA and the  government managed to overcome some of their differences.    However, no progress has been made concerning national  reconciliation. Sources said that nothing major is expected  until Luanda has responded to UN proposals concerning UNITA's  participation in the government of the country. The two sides  have decided to leave those matters for discussion at a later  stage.    Today is Sunday and there is no negotiation under way in  Lusaka. The peace talks are scheduled to resume tomorrow.</p>

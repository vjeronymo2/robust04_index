N. Illarionov and A. P. Komarov, Military </F> Academy of Chemical Defense, Moscow; UDC677.4-96:541.183.12]    [Abstract] Safeguarding the air and water media from  harmful substances is a pressing problem, especially in regard  to compounds of sulfur, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and other  toxic substances. Chemosorption on fibrous materials has evolved  as the preferred method for removal of these substances. These  fibers may be produced by: a) graft polymerization of active  monomers capable of chemosorption to a finished monomer; b)  forming a fiber from a copolymer containing chemically active  groups; c) forming a fiber from a mixture of polymers containing  chemosorbing groups. However, the output of these fibers by all  known methods does not exceed several tons annually, and the  immediate task consists of developing broad scale production of  these materials in so far as experience indicates their  undisputed advantages in resolving problems in safeguarding the  environment. At the same time, the assortment of chemosorbent  fibers should be broadened to include oxidation-reduction groups  and groups capable of selective sorption. The report [sic] also  discusses experimental data on the use of the chemosorptive  fiber Vion for sorption of pollutants from industrial effluents.  Results are presented on the testing of protective clothing  which has good moisture and air breathing qualities, but is also  impermeable to chemically active substances such as acids.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Backs Off: Eastern Airlines withdrew a request to abrogate its pilots  contract with the striking Air Line Pilots Assn. The company said the filing to  abrogate the contract "may be an impediment to resolving the (contract)  dispute" and that it therefore decided to withdraw the motion. The pilot union  hailed the withdrawal of Eastern's motion as a victory.  </P></p>

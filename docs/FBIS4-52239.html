			<p>BFN     [Text] Breakaway communist leader Felimon Lagman faces  assassination from the military and anti-communist agents for a  bungled anti-communist plan last year, self-exiled communist  founder Jose Ma. Sison said yesterday.    In a statement sent from his base in Utrecht, The  Netherlands, Sison said Lagman need not worry about being  executed by former comrades in the Communist Party of the  Philippines [CPP] because agents of the military and  anti-communist forces are likely to get to him first and blame  the New People's Army [NPA] for his death.    According to Sison, he has information that Lagman, former  chief of the Manila-Rizal Committee of the CPP, was part of a  plan hatched in December last year to form a national  coordinating board for an anti-communist "united front."    Lagman, however, backed out of the plan and "torpedoed" it,  earning the ire of the military and anti-communist forces who  had designed the plan, Sison said.    "In my opinion, Lagman has more to fear from the military  and  his fellow contras. They are capable of eliminating him and  then holding the New People's Army responsible," said Sison.    Sison also belittled a warning by Lagman that should there  be  a communist arrest order for him, his men will kill Sison in  Utrecht.    "I should thank Lagman for unwittingly confirming the  assassination plot designed by the military and such renegades  as Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, and Antonio Cabardo," said  Sison.    "I now laugh it (death threat) off because since the first  time he (Lagman) had made the threat, precautionary measures  have been adopted on my part," he added.    The Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (RCTU), an  underground labor organization, said there is yet no order for  the arrest of Lagman, although charges will be filed against him  before so-called people's court.    The RCTU also said in a statement that the so-called split  in  the communist movement is nothing but a "breakaway of some  elements hostile to the ongoing rectification movement led by  the CPP."    "The media hype and distortions about the revolutionary  underground is unduly creating an atmosphere of animosity that  could endanger the lives of comrades," the statement said.    The RCTU also clarified that the CPP never issued any hit  list for the summary executions of breakaway rebel leaders  Lagman, Kintanar, Tabara, and Ricardo Reyes.    "There are no such hit lists, only charges that have still  to  be duly processed in the revolutionary courts," the group said.    According to Sison, Lagman faces possible death in the hands  of the NPA only if he resists arrest and "continues to be armed  and dangerous."    Sison also said Lagman should not fear trial by a people's  court because his former comrades assure him of due process.    Lagman, in a telephone interview with INQUIRER dared former  comrades to "come and get me."    He said if any armed partisan tried to arrest him, he and  his  men will retaliate against Sison in Utrecht.    "We will not retaliate against Sison's men here. We will hit  the head itself in Utrecht," said Lagman.</p>

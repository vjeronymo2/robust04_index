			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: Desert cities gamble with change ALL RIGHT, OKAY, YOU WIN: INSIDE LAS VEGAS by David Spanier Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 275 pages LOS ANGELES: CAPITAL OF THE THIRD WORLD by David Rieff Jonathan Cape Pounds 17.99, 270 pages UNLIKE WRITERS such as Tom Wolfe or Hunter Thompson, who see Las Vegas as an opportunity for satire, David Spanier chooses to give us the straight dope on the place in his loving, informal account, All Right, Okay, You Win: Inside Las Vegas. Casting his eye over its daily life, he depicts a city that is shedding its image as a venal pleasure dome in an effort to become legitimate. Gone are the days when Bugsy Siegel and his mobster friends ran the casinos, now replaced by corporate-minded, law-abiding entrepreneurs whose 'family entertainment centers' just happen to include slot machines and poker baize. And instead of some pin-striped Mafioso at the baccarat table you are more likely to see a grim Japanese businessman. The irony of all this legitimacy, of course, is that a high-tech, squeaky-clean Las Vegas might be a contradiction in terms. By replacing Tony the Ant and Jimmy the Weasel with Mickey the Mouse, the people who run Vegas may be sacrificing the city's unique allure in order to make it just another knob on America's increasingly bland national entertainment console. Spanier chronicles this metamorphosis with an unblinking, kindly eye. He is as good on the small print as he is on the big picture, showing us, for instance, the distinctly unglamorous life of the 'soiled doves', the prostitutes who work more or less legally on the Strip as an adjunct to the gambling. There is also a fascinating chapter on sign making, which has grown into a multi-million dollar business as rival casinos try to out-shine one another with garish neon creations. Spanier is at his best describing the mechanics of gambling, showing how the big casinos walk a fine line between fleecing their customers and treating them like gods. In Vegas, it would seem, chance is an exact science - it is no surprise to learn in this lively, informative book that the man hired to design the modern slot machine was an engineer who had previously spent 20 years at NASA. David Rieff's Los Angeles: Capital of the Third World depicts another desert city undergoing rapid transformation. Rieff's premise is that LA, swamped by immigrants from the Third World, will soon be a non-white, non-Eurocentric city with closer ties to Tokyo and Mexico than London or New York. Resident whites are confronting this fact with varying degrees of bemusement, from those who throw up electric fences around their properties in anticipation of a coming race war to others who see it as a blessed opportunity to recruit cheap household help (who are now referred to as 'enablers', as in 'now that I have a maid, I'm able to take up jogging'.) Either way, it is a change that even the most blinkered of Beverly Hills residents is going to have to confront eventually. Rieff's account is exhaustive and often fascinating, offering up compelling facts such as the astonishing news that the LA public school system now has pupils who speak 82 different languages. He is also very good at portraying the rather pathetic attempts of liberal whites to deal with the changing face of their city - sampling spicy cuisines and mariachis music seems to suffice for most. And yet, though he is alive to the dangers inherent in this demographic upheaval, Rieff remains bullish on its possibilities, seeing the legendary sunniness and mutability of native Angelenos as well suiting them for finally adapting to the inevitable. What is lacking here is a view from the 'other side'. By relying so heavily on statistics, published sources and interviews with resident whites, Rieff fails to give a clear sense of what exactly it is that LA's new immigrants are searching for. The emphasis on trend spotting and incisive sociology results in a strangely underpopulated book; a few case studies on individual immigrants would have helped provide a picture of the faces behind the numbers. After all, it is easy to assume they all want a piece of the American Pie: the question that remains unanswered in this otherwise fine book is what sort of pie that might be once somebody else is doing the cooking.</p>

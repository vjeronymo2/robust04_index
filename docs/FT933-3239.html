			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Presidents combine to push Nafta cause THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a North American Free Trade Agreement. 'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.' The ceremony was for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge side agreements. Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford all urged support for the deal. In Mexico City, however, President Carlos Salinas yesterday played down the importance of Nafta, in apparent response to concerns that the treaty might be rejected by the US Congress. He said neither the treaty nor the side accords were a panacea.</p>

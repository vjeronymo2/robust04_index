			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] Arms exporters' hopes of huge orders from the Gulf  receive a major boost this week with a five-day visit to the  region by Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.    His trip to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait comes  just  weeks after Defence Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken visited  the region to promote defence equipment.    Brian Newman, defence analyst at London stockbrokers  Henderson Crossthwaite said: "The Middle East remains the  market with the highest spend and best prospects for British  industry. It is encouraging that the current government is  giving exporters so much support."    Britain has already clinched massive contracts in the  region,  spearheaded by the 20 billion pounds sterlin Al Yamamah deal  with Saudi Arabia. And industry is chasing numerous lucrative  new contracts, including Hawk aircraft, Challenger tanks and  minehunters for Saudi Arabia, Piranha armoured personnel  carriers, AS90 howitzers and Super Lynx helicopters for Kuwait,  and more Super Lynxes for Oman. Saudi Arabia is also  considering leasing the Royal Navy's 1 billion pounds sterling  fleet of four new Upholder submarines.    Mr. Rifkind, who left today, said: "This will be my first  visit to the Middle East for more than a year, and my first ever  visit to Oman.    "The UK is fully committed to supporting security and  stability in the Gulf region and I hope my visit over the next  few days will be seen as further evidence of that resolve."</p>

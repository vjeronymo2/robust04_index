Following is the text of the cable:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    Your Excellency President Saddam Husayn: Greetings. I have  received with great appreciation your brotherly, sincere  congratulation on the 29th anniversary of the launching of the  Palestinian revolution. I am pleased in the name of our  Palestinian people and my brothers, in the name of the members  of the PLO Executive Committee, and in my own name to thank you,  your esteemed government, and the fraternal Iraqi people very  much and to wish you all the best.    I will also seize this opportunity to express to your  excellency, dear brother, our mujahid Palestinian people's  feelings of solidarity with and gratitude to the fraternal Iraqi  people under current circumstances and the unjust blockade that  is imposed on them and that is targeting the food and medicine  of their children.    We also express our deep belief that fraternal Iraq will be  able, thanks to its great efforts and capabilities under your  brave leadership, to overcome this ordeal, difficulties, and  conspiracies surrounding it and to restore its prominent role in  our glorious Arab nation's march toward freedom, development,  and prosperity, which our people lack at this decisive and  crucial stage of their history as a result of the great  difficulties they are facing in their fateful negotiating battle  to regain their freedom and independence and to start building  their national and economic institutions as a basis for their  independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital.    I beseech Almighty God to guide our steps in our efforts to  unify the ranks of our nation, restore its unified position, and  overcome its wounds in the interest of its generations and it  dignity. I thank you again and wish your excellency good  health, happiness, and success, and I hope that the fraternal  Iraqi people will overcome the ordeals surrounding them and  resume their march toward progress, development, and prosperity  under your wise leadership. We will march together to  Jerusalem, with Almighty God's help.    [Signed] Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine  and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee</p>

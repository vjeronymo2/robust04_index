			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thai group outlines plans for Dollars 4bn China projects CHAROEN Pokphand, the Thai industrial group which is one of the largest foreign investors in China, has outlined plans for further projects in China worth about Dollars 4bn, including petrochemical and telecommunications projects. Mr Dhanin Chearavanont, group chairman, said in an interview that the company's Hong Kong subsidiary, Guah Kua Shen, was expected to hold a 70 per cent stake in a Dollars 3bn petrochemical complex at Linpoh, near Shanghai. According to a preliminary agreement with the Chinese authorities, the remaining 30 per cent would be held by the state-owned China Petrochemical Corp. Mr Dhanin said the first phase of the project would be a refinery with a capacity of about 200,000 b/d. Solvay of Belgium, one of CP's partners in Thailand, is thought likely to collaborate with the company. Another proposed CP project is a fibre-optic cable television network in north-east China aimed at about 700,000 potential subscribers.</p>

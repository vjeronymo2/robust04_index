			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito </F> by unidentified SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI reporter: "Discussion on  Major Modification Required of Aviation Administration"; place  and date not given]    [Text] [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] This publishing house has been  extremely troubled by your statement, during a press conference  after the 8 March cabinet meeting, which became a topic of  controversy in the newspapers and in which which you said, in  effect, "A paper was published in SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI through  oversight, without a thorough check on my part."    [Ito] What I wanted to say at the press conference was,  "That  was a paper that was written in collaboration with a friend and  the lack of a thorough check on my part resulted in a failure to  express myself adequately." In that respect, I would like to  apologize for having troubled the editorial staff of your  magazine as well as the readers. I have learned a lesson from  the fact that I did not adequately review the paper as minister  of transportation.  <H5>  Passionate Sentiments About Narita </H5>   [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] What sections of the paper are you  referring to when you say you "failed to express yourself  adequately"?    [Ito] I would like to say one thing before I discuss that  aspect. It will not be long before we enter the 21st century,  but the question now is whether it will be acceptable for  21st-century transportation administration to remain an  extension of current policies? I have strong feelings about  this. I feel that our planning actions should be more  comprehensive and mobile.    For example, I feel that there should be closer coordination  between ministries for programs and actual construction of  highway arteries like freeways that fall under the jurisdiction  of the Ministry of Construction and the construction of railways  and airports which come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry  of Transport.    The other day, I spoke with the chairman of the German  national railways, but in Germany almost all matters concerning  transportation are the responsibility of the Ministry of  Transport, including railways, roads, and airlines. Accordingly,  gasoline taxes are allocated to cover costs of roads as well as  railroads. Logically, they operate under the concept that a  balance will be achieved in the administration of transportation  systems as a whole in utilizing the special features of each  means of transportation to the optimum degree feasible.    In this day of internationalization, Japanese domestic  transportation networks are not complete in terms of domestic  facilities alone. I believe we need to approach the issue from a  much broader perspective.    Japan must not limit itself to its current midterm program  and devise a plan which assumes a broader perspective of this  nature and rethink its strategy so as to implement government  investments that are consistent with the new approach. Absent  such an approach, it will be impossible to create policies for  the 21st century. I feel it is desirable to establish a forum  consisting of interministerial representation and industry,  public organization and business world participation, to debate  such issues.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Having established that premise, I  believe the airport issue, especially the issue of Narita is of  special significance...    [Ito] Yes, you have delineated the most important issue. I  believe it is acceptable to have a comprehensive array of  opinions concerning policy relative to Narita.    I have strong feelings about Narita because I was in charge  of issues concerning Narita within the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ].    Narita Airport was approved by the Sato cabinet in 1966,  making it a full 28 years in July. Considering the situation at  that time, it was as if the airport had fallen upon local  residents from heaven. It was a decision made with hardly any  reference to the logical rules of democratic society, resulting  in an unfortunate and sustained dispute and complaints from  local residents that "democracy did not exist in our locality."  Even I participated in several opposition demonstrations and  rallies and joined in scrambles with local residents. Whenever I  reminisce about Narita, I feel I am looking back at the first  half of my lifetime.    During sessions of the Diet's Standing Committee on  Transportation, I was sharply questioned by members of the  Liberal Democratic Party with the words, "We recall you  participated in the movement to oppose Narita. What do you think  of Narita now, as minister of transportation?" My reply in those  instances would be, "It was wrong to approach the construction  of the airport from an authoritarian posture. That being the  case, the opposition movement was a logical phenomenon. I feel  that my personal behavior at that time was correct in principle.  However, I do not believe that I was 100 percent correct. I  believe politicians should examine their pasts on a mutual and  frank basis and assume a posture as to how they will cope with  the future."    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand a settlement is in  progress  with the opposing alliance.    [Ito] Because of the efforts exerted by Mr. Mikio Sumida of  the investigation team, symposia open to the public were held  for about 18 months which were attended by former Transportation  Ministers Okuda and Ochi who expressed frank words of regret.    After my appointment as minister, roundtable discussions  were  initiated and I attended the first session. I conceptualized the  establishment of an "airport for coexistence" with local  residents and hope to exert sincere efforts in this area.  <H5>  Need for Hub Airport </H5>   [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] In the minister's treatise published in  the 12 March edition of this magazine, you advocate the  construction of an international hub airport which can serve as  the center for international flow of people, things, and  information. Can you explain the relationship between that  concept and Narita?    [Ito] At the present time, Narita has only one runway. Even  the Kansai International Airport which is to open in September  has only one runway, which means that the complete conceptual  development of the Kansai airport becomes a matter of the  future. The Chubu International Airport will require further  development in that it too has only one runway. Moreover,  take-off and landing fees are the highest in the world.    Japan is surrounded by Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, Taiwan,  China, and Hong Kong, which have plans to build airports with  two to six 4,000-meter runways, scheduled for opening within  several years.    I believe there are two schools of thought on this issue.  One  assumes the stance that we cannot afford to lose out to  competition from our neighboring nations. And the other assumes  the stance that Japan does not have the land, land prices are  high, and it is acceptable that Japan will not possess an Asian  hub airport.    However, I believe both postures reflect extremism and it is  my belief that, disregarding any perception relative to status,  there is a compelling reason for Japan to have an international  airport that is compatible with its economic strength and its  relationship with the rest of the world. I believe we should  give serious consideration to an international airport based on  the two premises covering coordination with neighboring nations  and Japan's geographical configuration forming an extended  archipelago from north to south.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand your goals. However, it is  difficult for us to visualize a future design for Narita.    [Ito] Airports are not built only because there is a need  for  international hub airports. The aspect of coexistence with the  local community is very important in the building of an airport.    Relative to Narita, I hope to hold symposia and roundtable  discussions for thorough exchanges of views and strive  assiduously to build an airport that can coexist with the local  community. The approach of attempting to resolve issues through  dialogue on the Narita issue is extremely significant in today's  situation.    I hope to cherish this trend and continue my efforts aiming  at early resolution of outstanding issues.    I feel sincere remorse in the sudden publication of the  paper  and the distrust inspired in the local community and among  others concerned with Narita.    Further, speaking of the future, a supersonic aircraft  capable of linking Japan and the United States in five to six  hours is being developed for production sometime in the early  21st century. Airports visualized for that aircraft when it goes  into production include one each on the east and west coasts of  the United States, one each in northeastern Asia and Australia,  and one or two in Europe. There is a need to formulate policies  with a view towards the age of the supersonic aircraft.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Is the Ministry of Transport conducting  research on that?    [Ito] No. We cannot say that an official study is being  conducted. As a general statement, the business world and others  can present the issue of a "superior international hub airport  for Japan," but any such proposal from my perspective must be  preceded by additional research.  <H5>  Narita's Position </H5>   [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] We too feel that a sense of crisis  calling for a Japanese international hub airport lest we be  abandoned by the rest of the world is logical.    One premise of a hub airport is that it must be a joint  airport serving both international and domestic routes. However,  it appears that the Ministry of Transport's plans for the  second-stage project at Narita do not consider the idea of a  joint airport.    [Ito] This is an item that requires future study. Full-scale  international airports currently in existence are Narita and  Kansai Airports.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] That being the case, can we interpret  your statement to mean that if Narita can be expanded, that  domestic services will be increased and that it can become a  hub-type airport?    [Ito] Construction at Narita Airport is being implemented  with the primary idea of making it responsive to international  airline requirements. We still haven't come to a decision on  what we will do about domestic routes at Narita. As stated in  the beginning of this discussion, we are currently engaged in an  all-out effort to bring an end to 28 years of confrontation and  dispute and to overcome those barriers.    When Narita is completed, the Kansai Airport opens and the  Chubu International Airport is finished, we need to conduct a  comprehensive study about how we will make use of each airport's  special features and capabilities.  <H5>  New Ideas About Airport Funding </H5>   Whether we speak of building a new airport or expanding an  existing airport to establish hub-type capabilities, funding  becomes an important issue. Needless to say, there are methods  such as funding from the general account budget or investing  fiscal investment and loan program funds, but there is the  argument that using such methods only for aviation would be  unfair to competing projects such as those for railways.    However, the high take-off and landing fees at Japanese  airports and the high airport user fees that are charged to  individuals have become major international issues. What are  your thoughts on the use of government funds?    [Ito] I believe we must exert new efforts in this area.    As an example, the idea that "rigidity in the distribution  of  public works investment funding must be modified" is an item  agreed upon among the coalition parties and the Fiscal System  Council is in the process of trying to assign priority to  existing projects.    In the postwar period, many midterm programs were developed  and implemented and some of them underwent more than 10 stages.  I believe we have reached a point where such repetitive programs  should be subject to reexamination. Those programs must be  reexamined on the basis of the question of what policy goals are  to be sought in a comprehensive outlook for the 21st century.    As an example, we speak of a welfare-type society, but we  are  not speaking of limited welfare programs. We are speaking of  ensuring that roads and urban areas are designed so that they  accommodate a wide array of welfare needs. Both the nature and  content of public works projects must be designed to meet  welfare needs.    Further, in the past we have been prone to place excess  emphasis on hardware, but I believe we need to invest in  software as well. We hear the slogan, "My Town Tokyo," but there  is a need to consider the cultural and international environment.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Would it be correct for me to interpret  your statements as saying that we should consider the use of  government funds once we arrive at a consensus on the  requirement for building airports, including hub airports, as we  approach the 21st century?    [Ito] In the 50 or so years of the postwar period, separate  actions were taken in building roads, airports, railways, and  harbors. Roads were built with special funding derived from  gasoline and automobile weight taxes and the five-year program  incorporates the vast sum of 76 trillion yen.    On the other hand, central government and local government  subsidies are provided for railways, subways, and the new trunk  railways, but the approach is that their construction is handled  autonomously, while the national railways have been privatized  under the national railway reform program and are now referred  to as JR [Japan Railways]. Some airport construction is  government-funded, but the bulk of the money comes from usage  fees.    Earlier I spoke of the German approach. I think we should  consider their approach and the preceding discussion and decide  on the government-investment approach.    [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] The high take-off and landing fees have  been criticized both internationally and by the general public  and require early resolution.    [Ito] They are certainly a major problem in terms of  take-off  and landing fees for international airports and are the subject  of negotiations handled by the IATA (International Air Transport  Association). However, this too is a structural issue. On the  other hand, if fiscal investment and loan program funds or  general account budget funds are used for the construction of  domestic airports, we should be able to lower take-off and  landing fees and opinions exist that say that that should lead  to lower fares.    These issues are being energetically examined by the  Aviation  Council in terms of construction funding and take-off and  landing fees with a target date of June of this year. I believe  we should wait for the results of that study.</p>

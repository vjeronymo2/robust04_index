			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>   [Text] The closing of the preliminary investigation period  has been ordered in the suit being brought in the Fourth  District Court of Criminal Proceedings against the ex-secretary  of safety and roadways, Santiago Tapia Aceves; the Federal  Judicial Police ex-first commander, Fulvio Jimenez Turengano;  and the presumed drug trafficker, Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias  "El Chapo." They are presumed guilty of the crimes of improper  exercise of public service and bribery. The order was given by  the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, who called  for the maximum penalty, 15 years in prison, to be imposed on  them, since their guilt of the criminal acts ascribed to them is  considered to have been demonstrated.    The defendants' legal representatives, for their part,  stated  to the administrator of justice responsible for bringing the  pertinent criminal suit, Pablo Vicente Monroy Gomez, that,  during the process, the criminal liability of those indicted was  not accredited. Claiming that, on the contrary, their clients'  innocence had been proven, their defenders declared: "Therefore,  they should be acquitted of the charges brought against them and  their immediate release should be ordered."    After this final day of the period in question, the  aforementioned administrator of justice will have 15 working  days to set the date for the hearing in these proceedings. On  that occasion, both parties (the accusers and defendants) will  ratify their concluding arguments, so that the judge may finally  set the date for a judgment in the case.    According to the records of the proceedings, on 18 June  1993,  the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic brought  criminal action against the following: Tapia Aceves, who  recently received a provisional release; the presumed drug  dealer, "El Chapo" Guzman; the Federal Judicial Police ex-first  commander, Fulvio Jimenez Turengano; the ex-chief of the  Oriente-Venustiano Carranza Second Sector, Rogelio Herrera  Perez, aka "El Pispion"; and the deputy chief of that Crime  Prevention Police sector, Oscar Daniel Salcedo Ochoa, aka "El  Caballo." With this action, criminal proceedings 85/93 were  initiated.    The federal judge decided to order the formal imprisonment  of  those implicated, since the Federal Public Ministry believed  that there was sufficient evidence to establish their  participation in the crimes of which they were accused. Of the  group, only Joaquin Guzman Loera was notified of his formal  incarceration in the federal maximum security prison at Almoloya  de Juarez, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, on the Guatemalan  border, where he has been confined since his capture.    During the proceedings, it was indicated that the amount of  the bribe with which Santiago Tapia Aceves is charged had not  been determined, because there is no exact sum that he is  considered to have received from "El Chapo" Guzman for his  release. Meanwhile, the nine Crime Prevention Police members who  made the pertinent charge ratified their claim on the judicial  premises. There, the representatives of the news media were  asked to keep the identities of these policemen confidential,  because of the reprisals that might be taken against them.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party  (PRD) presidential candidate, toured Arraijan District on 17  March where the various communities  greeted him. When asked about the foreign debt issue, he said  "the debt was used for great works during President Torrijos'  time, but the current government has handled it irresponsibly."  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17  March 94)    While touring the corregimiento of Calidonia on 23 March,  Perez Balladares said the other presidential candidates who are  trying to unite the political force to undermine his  presidential candidacy in the 8 May elections "will fail." Perez  Balladares said his opponents were once united against Noriega,  but now nothing is holding them together. (Panama City LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 24 March 94 p A1)    Ruben Dario Carles, Change 94 presidential candidate, has  visited a mining company which is seeking to exploit gold  deposits in Canazas, Veraguas Province. Carles then told the  community he requested the company pay just salaries and conduct  reforestation programs. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 17 Mar 94)    Carles has vowed to defend the continuity of democracy and  reduce energy rates. At a rally in Tole, Chiriqui Province,  Carles promised he will revise energy rates. Carles said: "We  must reduce energy rates; energy service is too expensive and  inefficient." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish  2300 GMT 21 March 94)    Carles is reportedly recovering from an accident he had on  22  March and therefore is limiting his political activities.  Carles and a group of supporters fell from a balcony, and he  reportedly twisted his ankle. Although his health was not  endangered, Carles was advised to rest until his swollen ankle  improves. Regarding this mishap, Carles concluded: "We have  talked with other candidates to adopt appropriate measures to  prevent people from continuing to live in old, rundown homes."  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23  March 94)    Carles has requested the national government "to immediately  suspend the renegotiation of the foreign debt with international  banks, as it is unadvisable and extemporaneous," adding the  government "should concentrate all of its efforts until  September on attaining free elections which will pave the way  for the new president and his team." (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 24 March 94 p 2A)    Should she win the 8 May elections, Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber,  Arnulfista Party (PA) presidential candidate, has promised she  would revise the minimum wage. De Gruber announced her intention  after visiting several communities throughout the country where  she found there is economic stagnation due to an increase in  basic market products. De Gruber said: "Our government program  establishes, after assuming the Presidency on 1 September, that  we will conduct an in-depth and prompt study on the minimum  wage. We must increase the minimum wage." (Panama City Circuito  RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17 March 94)    In statements to the newscast "Telemetro Reports," de Gruber  has admitted that political forces have become polarized between  the PRD and the PA. Given this situation, de Gruber reiterated  her call to all political parties to form one single political  coalition behind the PA so as to confront the PRD. De Gruber  asked other candidates to decline their candidacies in her  favor. Regarding electoral violence, de Gruber has said she  hopes violence could be averted. (Panama City Telemetro  Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 21 March 94)    The Solidarity Party will not heed other parties' call to  form a civic alliance, Solidarity Party presidential candidate  Samuel Lewis Galindo has warned. Members of the National  Consensus Alliance, comprised by the Solidarity and National  Unity Mission, have visited the Central Avenue area. Lewis  Galindo said he does not favor a civic alliance. Galindo said:  "The people are beginning to realize that in the fights between  the candidates, we are the only ones who can attain the  requisite national unity to fight poverty." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 March 94)    Carlos Anel Cordero, Political Capsule columnist, reports  Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate for the Christian  Democratic Party, PDC, has addressed the National Federation of  Business and Professional Women where he said the PDC government  will insist on a more active role by women in administrative  functions. Cordero adds all presidential candidates, except for  the PA's Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, recently attended a meeting  with the civic clubs during which they committed themselves to  promote, respect, and strengthen civic values and morals.  (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 19 March 94 p 3A)    A 500-word article by Marco Julio de Obaldia states the PRD  has one-third of the people's vote, "and this will be evident on  8 May." De Obaldia writes "these votes were cultivated  throughout 21 years," and most of the voters feel "they cannot  go wrong by voting for the PRD." In conclusion, the writer urges  the people to forget voting for the party of their choice,  rather, to vote for the civic candidate who has "the greatest  chance of winning," the only way to defeat the PRD candidate.

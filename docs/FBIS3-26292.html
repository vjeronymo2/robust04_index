Goods shipped in this way made up one quarter  of all goods passing through the province's border.    The province invested more than RMB [renminbi] 30 million in  the construction of roads and bridges linking border ports with  storage depots as well as in the development of industries  including machinery, electronic products, chemical industry,  construction materials, real estate and tertiary industry.  Foreign investment has also expanded into these fields with  many such investors earning good profits.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ONLY CHILDREN BY ALISON LURIE (AVON: $7.95)  </P> <P> A vivid, warmly nostalgic novel that evokes a child's vision of the 4th of July  weekend, 1935. While visiting a farm in Upstate New York, Mary Ann Hubbard (who  prefers to style herself Princess Miranda) and her shy friend, Lolly Zimmern,  play games of make-believe as they watch the grownups play games of their own:  some silly, some deadly serious.  </P> <P> Mary Ann's father, a stuffy bureaucrat, arrives with a briefcase full of papers  and refuses to leave his work for even a few hours of leisure. Her mother, a  fading, flirtatious Southern belle, turns her charms on Lolly's calculating,  hearty father -- to the horror of his neurotic, clinging wife. It falls to  Anna, the wise Earth Mother figure who owns the farm and the progressive school  the girls attend, to show the nominal adults the the meaning of independence  and maturity.  </P> <P> Alison Lurie's gentle sense of irony ensures that the resulting contretemps end  happily and teach the adults the folly of believing too strongly in their own  make-believe worlds.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLD WATER IS THROWN ON COMEDY  </P> <P> Brandy Snyder, a 21-year-old acting student, is looking for a job to pay off  debts exacerbated last weekend after a fire marshal closed her play.  </P> <P> Snyder, a senior at United States International University, had directed a  weeklong production of the three-person comedy "The Lady and the Clarinet" in  rented space at the Progressive Stage Company in the Old City Hall building  </P> <P> downtown.  </P> <P> Saturday night was the last scheduled performance in the run that Snyder had  bankrolled with $800 of her own money and a $600 loan. She had expected her  efforts to pay off that night when a Los Angeles director was in the audience,  as well as a professor from San Francisco whom Snyder wanted to see the work.  Critics from two local newspapers also attended.  </P> <P> At 8:30 p.m., half an hour into the 1 1/2-hour performance, fire inspector Don  Waldman walked in and ordered Snyder to close the show or be arrested.  </P> <P> Snyder said she was upset that the Fire Department had not closed the theater  at 433 G St. either before or after the show; still, she didn't fault them,  because Waldman told her he had warned the Progressive about fire violations  "hundreds of times."  </P> <P> "This was my first venture out, and it was very upsetting," she said.  </P> <P> Fire Department spokesman Bob Zepeda said Tuesday that two exits are required  for the second-floor performance space whenever more than 10 people are in the  theater, which seats between 45 and 70. Officials said no one has been fined or  cited.  </P> <P> Progressive plans to shift its presentations to the ground floor this weekend,  where the Fire Department has said 49 people can safely be seated. The  department Wednesday approved the use of the upstairs space for rehearsal and  classes.  </P> <P> Zepeda said the department had been concerned about the situation for months,  but that Saturday was the first night an inspector had been on duty during a  performance.  </P> <P> However, Progressive's producing director, Carlos X. Pena, said that, although  fire officials had told him Saturday they wanted the safety of the theater  improved, they had no intention of shutting it down.  </P> <P> Pena said the Progressive can't build another exit because the Old City Hall  building is labeled a historic site.  </P> <P> Since its opening, the Progressive has been a haven for small theater groups in  search of affordable space.  </P> <P> Pena said the Progressive will be back on schedule Tuesday, when it presents  the second play in the Teatro Meta's Latino Play Festival in the downstairs  space.  </P></p>

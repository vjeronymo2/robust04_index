			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on decline in futures prices WORRIES over a possible political scandal shrouded the market yesterday. The Nikkei average plunged on a decline in futures prices, falling through the 21,000 level for the first time since January 21, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 507.16 at the day's low of 20,883.86, after a high of 21,405.85. The index extended its losing streak to four days, falling 5.9 per cent on the week. Volume fell to 180m shares from 200m. Reports that public prosecutors arrested four figures linked to an alleged bribery scandal shook investor confidence. Losers overwhelmed gainers by 890 to 96 with 127 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 30.77 to 1,555.31. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.87 to 1,182.10. Proposals by the Big Four brokerages to invigorate the market, announced on Thursday, failed to affect share prices. The move was seen as another attempt by regulators and leading brokerage leaders to 'talk up' share prices. Last week, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party called for measures to increase the attractiveness of stock investments, temporarily propping up the market. 'The regulators and political leaders are in disarray, and the market is disturbed by the uncoordinated comments and proposals,' said Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. This week, a leading LDP politician called for a cut in the official discount rate, and the foreign minister suggested denomination of the yen to boost economic activity. 'There is no instant cure for current conditions, and attempting to revive the market by announcing such proposals and measures will only have adverse effects,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life. He added that lower interest rates and higher dividends were the only effective ways to bring individual investors back. Concerns over corporate earnings for the current fiscal year depressed some issues. Brokers, which are expected to suffer from the low trading volumes lost ground. Nomura Securities fell Y30 to Y1,520 and Daiwa Securities declined by Y50 to Y990. A total of 65 issues hit new lows since last year's start, including high-technology issues, which were weaker on expectation of poor business results. Fujitsu fell Y13 to Y755 and Hitachi lost Y12 to Y870. The continuing investigation of the financial scandal involving officials of a parcel delivery company drove speculative issues lower. Clarion fell Y60 to Y1,080 and Nippon Carbon plunged Y210 to Y1,730. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 391.53 to 22,711.65 in volume of 59.6m shares. Market action centred on active cross trading for book closing purposes. Roundup Pacific Rim markets were generally mixed with Hong Kong's rally continuing. HONG KONG hit its fifth record high in seven sessions after selective afternoon buying helped erase initial declines. The Hang Seng index closed 8.82 higher at 4,772.32, up 1.3 per cent on the week as turnover contracted to HKDollars 2.33bn. KUALA LUMPUR enjoyed a late rebound on last-minute orders from institutional and corporate investors. The composite index ended up 1.12 at 595.75, 1 per cent better on the week. SINGAPORE's further consolidation took the Straits Times Industrial Index down 8.21 to 1,503.91, a fall on the week of 1.5 per cent. BANGKOK's turnover fell from a record Bt14.83bn to Bt10.21bn, three property stocks accounting for half of that as the SET index ended 2.58 higher at 805.78, a gain of 3.3 per cent on the week. AUSTRALIA eased in cautious trading, with the All Ordinaries index closing down 4.0 at 1,618.9, 1.8 per cent higher on the week.

			<p>BFN     [Text] King William's Town June 6 SAPA -- The Border region  of the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] has decided to launch a  recruitment drive in predominantly white areas and to  discontinue the use of the slogan "One settler, one bullet".    A resolution to this effect was adopted at a regional  meeting  at King William's Town at the weekend. The meeting was attended  by the PAC's sole representative in the Eastern Cape  legislature, Mr T T Letlaka.    PAC regional secretary Mr Mvuyo Mhangwane said the  organisation would work with other community organisations to  eliminate no-go areas in the province and to strive to make it  "peaceful enough" to attract investors.    Mr Mhangwane said the meeting also endorsed the integration  of Azanian Peoples Liberation Army members into the South  African National Defence Force.    Structures to prepare for the local government elections  would be set up, he said.</p>

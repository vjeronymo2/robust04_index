He  Saw Kravchuk. He Won"]    [Text] On Wednesday night, young followers of Michurin from  Rukh and the USS [Ukrainian Student Union] met a high-ranking  visitor at the Borispol airport, where several flights,  including one to France, were delayed in honor of Bill Clinton's  visit. The imagination of Michurin's followers cross-bred a  bizarre hybrid on their signs--"Clinton + Kravchuk =  Zhirinovskiy." However, the presidents did not know this,  because the picketers who, according to them, had gotten the  blessing for this action from Vyacheslav Chornovil, together  with their modest militia escort, remained at the opposite  entrance to the airport. At precisely the time when they were  tirelessly chanting "Kravchuk, retire," Clinton was joking that,  if Kravchuk did not hold his high position, he would offer him  the job of the press secretary of the White House.    Today, on Friday, the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the  United States are supposed to sign a trilateral agreement  according to which Ukraine will give up all of its strategic  nuclear weapons, receiving in exchange nuclear fuel for nuclear  power stations (for the highly enriched uranium that is placed  in nuclear weapons) and monetary compensation, the amount of  which has not been ultimately determined but, according to  preliminary projections, will not exceed $1.5 billion. The U.S.  President promised that Ukraine will receive some compensation  for tactical nuclear weapons removed by Russia--actually from  the United States, greater financial support than in 1993 ($155  million) and lobbying on behalf of Ukraine in the IMF and the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The U.S.  President announced the establishment of the Enterprise Fund,  the monies of which will be addressed to Ukraine, Belarus, and  Moldova in order to assist small enterprises and privatization.  This is precisely how, very cheaply, Ukraine was persuaded to  surrender virtually all nuclear arsenals which until recently  were the main "emergency store" of Ukraine, saved for the  rainiest day of the national economy.    Most likely, today Leonid Kravchuk will affix his signature  to a trilateral compact. However, no matter what form it assumes  (an agreement, a treaty that the parliament must mandatorily  ratify, or a communique, a statement that becomes legally valid  after being signed by the head of state), an overwhelming  majority of the Supreme Council will not approve the  presidential decision. It could be assumed that, having exceeded  his authority, Kravchuk is ignoring the parliament and heading  for authoritarian power, if it were not for the land under the  president's chair shaking in an increasingly perceptible  earthquake of a lack of confidence on the part of both the lower  strata and the supreme echelons of power. Leonid Kravchuk has  always left one move to retreat. It appears that lately he has  been playing without writing down his moves, and his intuition  has failed him. As he expressed his expectation that the Supreme  Council would support his decision because "the parliament grows  wiser together with life," Leonid Makarovych may have already  imagined the forthcoming battle in the parliament. After all, as  they are struggling for seats in the post-March parliament, the  people's deputies will arm themselves with the thesis about the  betrayal of the national interests of Ukraine by the president.  The chances of Ivan Plyushch to secure the presidency are  growing automatically (of course, if Kravchuk keeps his word and  does not freeze the date of the presidential election).    Did it make sense to surrender the missiles with lightning  speed, at ridiculous prices, when our eastern neighbor, with its  very unpredictable future and in the accent of Zhirinovskiy, is  putting pressure on all sensitive points of Ukraine ever more  perceptibly?! Did it make sense to bid farewell to the weapons  without having obtained full-fledged security guarantees? After  all, the American initiative Partnership for Peace which was  approved by NATO and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--the  ones that Clinton guaranteed in Kiev--do not provide  full-fledged guarantees.    As the U.S President assured us, we will receive a  "considerable amount of funds" in keeping with the Nunn-Lugar  law (a program for assistance to Ukraine by the United States);  these funds may be used, in particular, for defense and  conversion. This may be the most dramatic aspect at  present--given a lack of large-scale, specific reform programs,  there are reasons to doubt that American aid will not be  dispersed in economic chaos.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tania Malheiros] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 20 May (AE) -- Today, former  Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, president of the  Association of Brazilian Exporters (AEB), announced that the AEB  is starting a national campaign to make the Senate approve the  new patents law. In his opinion, upon signing the GATT Uruguay  Round accord, Brazil assumed international commitments "that now  must be reflected in the country's laws on intellectual  property." Pratini said: The draft law, which has been in the  Senate for almost a year now, must now be approved so Brazilian  commercial interests on the international front "will not again  become the target of threats of protectionist or retaliatory  measures as a result of the isolated Brazilian position in the  patents area."    Pratini reported that the executive branch has just  submitted  to the Senate new suggestions for amendments relating to the  GATT agreements signed by the country and criticized the delay  in resolving the issue. Because of this, he said, "in 10 years,  China has already tripled its exports compared to those of  Brazil." He added that, because of inadequate legislation,  Brazil is already losing trade opportunities in the area of high  technology, in addition to leaving itself open to trade  sanctions, such as the case of newsprint from 1989 to 1991.  These sanctions provoked a $300 million loss for Brazilian  exports and the loss of markets, like that of the United States,  which have never been regained." [quotation marks as received].    Pratini added that the AEB also is alerting the government  about the problems a fixed exchange rate will cause for  exporters. He said: "We pointed out the need to reduce some  taxes bearing on exports as a way to compensate the Brazilian  foreign trade sector for the losses it may sustain as a result  of the freeze in the exchange rate during the initial stage of  the real." In his opinion, the market recognizes that it is  essential to have a fixed exchange rate during the first stage,  but "the problems experienced with the Cruzuado Plan, which  provoked a sharp drop in exports and a large increase in  imports, must be avoided." Pratini added: "Both exports and  imports must increase." AEB, which consists of 900 companies,  accounts for 98 percent of Brazilian exports.</p>

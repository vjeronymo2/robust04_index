			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Carlos' testimony could reveal guerrilla networks Carlos 'The Jackal', the international terrorist, was formally placed under investigation for a 1982 bomb attack by a Paris judge yesterday amid hopes that he would reveal details of guerrilla networks and concerns that his arrest could prompt reprisals from extremist sympathisers. Mr Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, said that Carlos' testimony could unveil links to guerrilla networks and foreign nations which support terrorism. Responding to the potential security threat involved in detaining Carlos, the interior minister said that 'the risks of attack naturally exist. But measures have been taken.' Mr Pasqua rejected allegations of a trade-off with Sudan to secure Carlos' extradition. The claims included press reports that France had provided Khartoum with surveillance photographs to help Sudan's Islamic government combat rebels in the south of the country. A lawyer acting for Carlos also claimed that he had been kidnapped from Sudan in a deal between Paris and Khartoum. Western diplomats in Paris said France had been cultivating contacts with Sudan recently with the aim of capturing Carlos. They said Sudan had extradited Carlos to improve its standing in the west. Following Carlos's arrest, Sudanese officials urged the US to remove Sudan from its blacklist of states that support terrorism. The arrest of Carlos represents a coup for the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur and for Mr Pasqua in particular. Mr Balladur claimed the arrest, after collaboration between Sudan's security forces and the French intelligence service, demonstrated France's tough stance against terrorism. Mr Pasqua has been pursuing a crackdown against suspected Islamic extremists following the killing of five French citizens in Algeria earlier this month. A CSA poll showed that a majority of French people believe the measures employed by Mr Pasqua, which have involved sweeping stop and check searches, are an effective response to the threat of terrorism. Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, is due to face charges relating to a 1982 bombing near the Champs Elysees in Paris in which one person died and 63 were injured. The 1982 attack is the only one for which France has issued a formal arrest warrant. Carlos was separately sentenced to life imprisonment in his absence two years ago for the 1975 killings of two French counter-intelligence agents. Mr Pasqua said that Carlos himself had claimed responsibility for 83 killings, at least 15 of them in France in a career of terrorism which started in 1970 when he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Appearing yesterday before Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the anti-terrorist judge, Carlos appeared calm and relaxed. 'We also had Famas (the French army issue assault rifle) in Lebanon, they are good,' he told his guards.</p>

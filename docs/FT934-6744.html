			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Way cleared for rubber pact talks Rubber producing and consuming countries yesterday agreed to start negotiations on a new price-stabilising accord to succeed the 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement. The International Natural Rubber Council, which took the decision at its meeting in Kuala Lumpur, also agreed a one-year extension of the present pact, which was due to expire on December 28. Importing nations consented to renegotiate the pact after producers earlier this month yielded to their condition of a 5 per cent cut in the reference price for current buffer stock operations. However, producing countries have served notice that they will seek a higher price range in any new accord, negotiations on which are expected to begin in Geneva early next year.</p>

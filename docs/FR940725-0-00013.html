This amendment requires inspection of an expanded area, deletion of the reporting requirement, and expansion of the applicability to include additional airplanes. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking of the fuselage skin in certain areas and findings of additional countersunk fasteners. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective August 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

The action proposed to require inspection of an expanded area, deletion of the reporting requirement, and expansion of the applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (e) be revised to reduce the area of inspection to coincide with the area specified in the service bulletin (Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992) referenced in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA does not concur. An FAA investigation has revealed that countersunk fasteners may be installed in areas other than those specified in the referenced service bulletin. Therefore, the FAA has determined that a one-time inspection along the entire lap joint of the skin panel must be accomplished to positively confirm the exact location of these countersunk fasteners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests an extension to the proposed compliance time of 11,000 total landings to conduct the high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection required by paragraph (g) of the proposal. The commenter states that the compliance time should coincide with the time recommended in the service bulletin (Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992) referenced in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The compliance time in the service bulletin specifies that, for airplanes on which only the minimum number of countersunk fasteners have been installed, the HFEC inspection should commence at 20,000 total flight cycles. The commenter notes that for airplanes on which only the minimum number of countersunk fasteners have been installed, the potential for widespread multi-site damage is significantly lessened than for airplanes on which more than the minimum number of countersunk fasteners have been installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety implications of any cracking in this area. The FAA acknowledges that cracking in the upper row of countersunk fasteners in the lap splice in the area adjacent to the wing-to-body fairing intersection may not result in catastrophic consequences; however, the FAA finds that any cracking in this area has the potential for developing into an unsafe condition. This AD is issued to address that unsafe condition, which may result in reduced structural integrity of the fuselage of the airplane as a result of cracking in these areas. Further, since cracking has been found in this area on in-service airplanes that had accumulated less than 20,000 total flight cycles, the FAA has determined that 11,000 total landings represent the maximum interval of time allowable wherein the inspection can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests clarification of the proposed compliance time for reinspection of previously modified lap joints. The commenter requests that the HFEC inspections required by proposed paragraph (k) commence from the time the lap joint was modified in accordance with AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, rather than from the time the lap joint is modified in accordance with proposed paragraph (j). The FAA finds that clarification is warranted. Paragraph (k) of the final rule has been revised to state that HFEC inspections are to be performed prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings following modifications (of locations where countersunk fasteners were found) accomplished in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, dated June 12, 1989, Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990, or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992, which includes modifications accomplished in accordance with AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07 or in accordance with paragraph (j) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters question the necessity for the inspections following modification of the lap joints required by proposed paragraph (k). One of these commenters does not see adequate justification for requiring these inspections since AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07 terminated the inspections after accomplishment of the modification. The other commenter states that, since other lap joints are not required to be inspected following modification, this lap joint should not be inspected following modification. From these comments, the FAA infers that these commenters are requesting that the requirement to inspect following modification be deleted. The FAA does not concur. An FAA evaluation of currently available inspection techniques reveals that current technology may not be able to adequately detect cracking beneath protruding head fasteners. Further, in-service experience has demonstrated that cracking has gone undetected beneath these protruding head fasteners. Therefore, the FAA's intent in requiring these inspections following the modification are to detect any cracking that may develop after accomplishment of the modification and to repair any cracking prior to it adversely affecting the structural integrity of the fuselage of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

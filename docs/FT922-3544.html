			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / New Japanese store ponders vanishing customers EIGHT HUNDRED employees and only 100 customers yesterday attended the grand opening of Japan's largest department store. Conceived at the height of the 1980s economic boom, the Tobu company's Y100bn (Pounds 429m) steel and glass palace opened its doors amid the steepest fall in consumer spending since the 1960s. Cheer leaders and a brass band were on hand as white-gloved Tobu directors, led by the company president, simultaneously cut the red-and-white tape. April department store sales fell 2 per cent from a year ago, after a 4.1 per cent drop in March, the worst fall since 1965. Some economists predict no upturn in consumer spending until spring next year. Moreover, department stores, already hit by a sharp fall in sales of luxury items, are finding customers are switching from high-margin goods with famous labels to non-branded products which offer retailers smaller profits. Tobu certainly expected to see more customers on the first day - 90 policemen and 95 security guards were on duty during the ceremony yesterday morning. A man in his early twenties, at the head of the queue at the main entrance, said he had arrived two hours before the 9 am ceremony to be in front of the crowds. In the event, he need hardly have bothered. Tobu expects to cover investment costs of the new store in five years. For the year to next June, it expects sales of the new Ikebukuro store to total Y180bn. However, most customers browsing through the store yesterday failed to contribute to revenues. A middle-aged woman who walked around the store finally left with a bag of croissants.</p>

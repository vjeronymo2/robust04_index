			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / S African markets hit as finance minister quits Mr Derek Keys resigned suddenly yesterday as South Africa's finance minister in a move which threw markets into turmoil and raised concern about the country's future economic policies. Mr Keys denied that any policy clash lay behind his announcement, and cited unspecified 'personal reasons' for his decision. President Nelson Mandela, who told a hastily summoned press conference last night that Mr Keys had informed him of his request last Thursday, moved quickly to allay market concern by naming Mr Christo Liebenberg, a prominent banker, to replace Mr Keys. Mr Liebenberg, 60, retired in February as chief executive of the Nedcor banking group. Mr Keys' efforts to reassure markets were undermined only hours later by a sharply critical statement from the powerful Congress of South African Trade Unions, which charged that by his actions yesterday the minister had put at risk the government's reconstruction and development programme, and had betrayed Mr Mandela's trust. In his official announcement released yesterday, Mr Keys praised Mr Mandela and Mr FW de Klerk, the deputy president, as 'remarkable leaders' and said that his aim as finance minister had been to contribute to an orderly transfer of power and 'protect the country's economic base'. His resignation created South Africa's first crisis since the inauguration of Mr Mandela in May. It was greeted by widespread shock and dismay in the local business community. Mr Keys was respected both domestically and abroad for his prudent stewardship of the South African economy and had become a symbol of integrity and competence in the administration during a two-year term of office which began under the white-led government of Mr de Klerk. Adding to the distress was the inept way in which the news yesterday was handled. If Mr Keys' statement can be taken at face value, news of the move was inadvertently leaked earlier in the day and the result was that for several hours confusion reigned. Rumours about Mr Keys' decision began to reach the Johannesburg stock market by mid-afternoon, and bond yields climbed sharply while the financial rand, the main barometer of foreign sentiment, weakened by 2.6 per cent against the dollar. However the appointment of Mr Liebenberg, who has no formal political affiliations, will partially help to stabilise the situation. By again going outside the political arena to appoint a minister with credibility in the private sector, Mr Mandela will hope to allay fears that Mr Keys' departure will also mean a shift from the government's commitment to fiscal restraint. The appointment also means that the National party, which in terms of the constitution is entitled to six cabinet posts, will be given another cabinet appointment. 'In the short term at least it's very bad news for the markets,' said Mr Michiel Bester, economist at the consulting firm Econometrix. 'It creates a lot of unwelcome uncertainties.'

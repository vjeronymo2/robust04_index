			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, the Commission is satisfied that the NYSE proposal contains adequate safeguards to protect investors in the securities markets. In this respect, the Commission notes that a comprehensive regulatory framework has been developed for the trading of listed securities, including listed options. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  For example, in 1983, an Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') was formed to coordinate more effectively surveillance and information sharing arrangements between the stock and options markets. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Using procedures developed in that forum, among other things, the national securities exchanges identify and investigate stock and/or options transactions that, used on certain parameters, raise manipulative concerns. The Commission believes that this regulatory scheme, including NYSE monitoring and surveillance of amended Rule 96, should be sufficient to detect and deter intermarket manipulation and other fraudulent or abusive practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Listed options are standardized contracts traded in an open auction market environment. Exchange-traded options are subject, among other things, to real-time quotation and last-sale reporting; anti-fraud provisions; and minimum criteria for initial and continued listing. Transactions in listed options become part of the integrated audit trail. In contrast, OTC options are individualized contracts that are negotiated between the counterparties. There is minimal, if any, public disclosure and a relatively illiquid secondary trading market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The full members of the ISG are the American Stock Exchange; the Boston Stock Exchange; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; the Chicago Stock Exchange; the National Association of Securities Dealers; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the NYSE has informed the Commission that the Exchange will increase the frequency of its examination of the trading activity of Competitive Traders and RCMMs. The Commission expects that NYSE staff will utilize such information as part of its on-going efforts to ensure compliance with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and Exchange rules. In this respect, the Exchange has assured the Commission that, if a transaction raises concerns about intermarket manipulation, NYSE staff, with the cooperation of the options exchanges where appropriate, will conduct a thorough examination of all the relevant facts. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the NYSE's monitoring and surveillance of Rule 96, as amended, will aid the Exchange in detecting any trading abuses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More generally, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that, independent of Rule 96, other NYSE rules, which the NYSE will continue to monitor for compliance, should help to keep Floor professionals from being in a position where they can engage in trading abuses. As examples, the NYSE cites the yielding requirement imposed on certain on-Floor orders for a member's own account, <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  and the conditions placed on when a Competitive Trader or RCMM can initiate a proprietary Floor trade. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  Further, Competitive Traders and RCMMs, like other NYSE members, are subject to the prohibition on frontrunning of block transactions. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under NYSE Rule 108, an on-Floor order placed by a member to establish or increase a position in the member's proprietary account is not entitled to priority, or precedence based on size, over an off-Floor order placed by a public customer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , notes 3&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See NYSE Rule 122.20(d) and Information Memorandum 89&hyph;53 (November 27, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission notes that, Competitive Traders and RCMMs currently are not prohibited from trading in stocks in which they have an existing option position. Such transactions, however, must be initiated off-Floor. To the extent that the amended rule will permit such transactions to be initiated on-Floor, NYSE surveillance should detect and deter any trading abuses derived from informational advantages. In sum, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change should not materially affect the NYSE's ability to address the regulatory concerns raised by Floor professionals' intermarket trading activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) is approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

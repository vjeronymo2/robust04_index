			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS AND A COMMUNITY: THE IMPACT ON THE GAY LIFESTYLE IN LAGUNA BEACH  </P> <P> Thank you for printing the article chronicling the lives of several gay men and  their experience with AIDS. The article struck many of my emotions as I read  the history of gay men's sexual conduct in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> But the title of the article is a misnomer.  </P> <P> I am concerned that the article will leave in many the impression the majority  of gay men still indulge in promiscuous unsafe sex as many of the interviewees  with AIDS in Smith's article had.  </P> <P> As a young gay man of 22, I would like to point out most of the subjects in  this story are well over 30, and two of the most revealing quotes on homosexual  conduct in Laguna Beach were by men ages 58 and 52.  </P> <P> The article chronicles the impact of AIDS on an older generation, but not the  entirety of Laguna Beach or of all gay men, as it may have been construed.  While the older generation in this fine article deserves every bit of our care,  compassion and love, their sexual conduct does not, I believe, represent the  future of Laguna Beach: gay men in their 20s and younger.  </P> <P> It is because of articles like this portraying the human sacrifices made of  people with AIDS (and who have received little help from our government, thank  you Ronald Reagan) that men my age practice safe sex. But while I am close  enough in age to the generation hardest hit by AIDS to realize and learn from  its devastation, younger men and women are not, and must be educated by our  schools in a frank and honest manner about AIDS and safe sex.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. SHINDLER, Laguna Beach  </P></p>

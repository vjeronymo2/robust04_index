			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Redwood hits back on valleys renewal drive Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has strongly defended the government initiative to regenerate the south Wales valleys after last week's official report which cast doubt on the success of its efforts to create jobs. He said: 'I think that without the initiative the valleys would have been much worse off.' The report published by the Government Statistical Service said manufacturing jobs created had been more than offset by job losses, and that more factories had closed than had opened. The initiative was launched in 1988 by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary, and who now chairs the regeneration agency English Partnerships. Public funding totalling Pounds 773m has been spent on the Welsh initiative, and a second five-year programme was launched this year. Mr Redwood said the figures concealed the impact of the recession. He said: 'In the recession the valleys performed relatively very well. Had we been in boom conditions, I think we would have seen very strong positive advances in the valleys.' The valleys programme has been criticised as a marketing exercise encompassing projects such as land reclamation and house renovation which might have taken place anyway and with little additional funding. But Mr Redwood described marketing as vital. 'It was very important to try to lift the image of the valleys, both within the valleys themselves to encourage more self-help and to the outside world to persuade new investors that this was a beautiful part of Wales with a future, and not just a scarred piece of Wales with a past that had gone wrong,' he said. Mr Redwood emphasised the need for private-sector investment but said he supported intervention by the government in such severe circumstances. He said: 'I think it is quite reasonable for government to spend money to take action when some or all of the problems have been aided or abetted by public-sector activity. In the valleys it was the rapid decline of nationalised industries which had created the unemployment and left enormous scars on the landscape. 'I was a strong supporter of the valleys initiative at the time (it was launched), although people will now try to claim that the leopard has changed his spots.' Mr Redwood accused Labour of attacking the initiative from contradictory standpoints. He said: 'They're both arguing that the expenditure of these large sums of public money hasn't done any good, and they're arguing that we ought to spend a lot more.' The valleys had done 'extremely well' in terms of relative government funding.</p>

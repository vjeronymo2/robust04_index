			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, Crimea -- According to some reports, a  slight increase in the contingent of the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry's special forces has been observed in Crimea.  Representatives of the Republic of Crimea's presidential  administration told UNIAN they have information that the  Ukrainian president is preparing a directive introducing a state  of emergency in Crimea. Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on  6 April, Vasyl Rudenko, the official in charge of the Ukrainian  president's service for territorial matters, denied rumors of a  state of emergency being introduced on the peninsula, said they  are totally groundless and are being spread by members of Yuryy  Meshkov's team.    Vasyl Rudenko also pointed out that a body representing the  Ukrainian president was set up in Crimea and that "under the  legislation of Ukraine, relations between the autonomous  republic and Ukraine are based on the law delimiting powers  between their authorities."    Interviewed by journalists on the same day, Yevgenyy  Saburov,  Crimean deputy prime minister, did not rule out a possibility of  leaving that post in the situation that was arising.    Interviewed by Crimean TV on 5 April, Mykola Mykhalchenko,  head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy service, who  now is in Crimea, stated: "Many decrees being passed in Crimea  surprise and genuinely distress me. A directive may contain two  to three clauses and yet violate not only five to six Ukrainian  laws, but also provisions in the Crimean Constitution." This,  in his view, is "an example of disrespect for Crimea's own laws  and is legal arbitrariness."    The head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy  service  also said the main task of the newly appointed representative of  the Ukrainian president to Crimea would be encouraging political  stabilization in the region and harmonizing political and  economic relations between the governments of Crimea and  Ukraine. "This is a very important task without which things  will be bad both for Ukraine and Crimea," Mykola Mykhalchenko  added.    On 6 April, Crimean President Yuryy Meshkov met Valentyn  Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian deputy internal affairs minister, who is  on a planned working trip to the peninsula.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Decision expected on foreign role in Telekom sale The German government will today end weeks of waiting by naming which US or European bank will play the main foreign role in the DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. The announcement by the postal ministry at a press conference in Bonn follows several days of uncertainty about when the names would be made known. The decision was expected on Monday and then postponed. Because Deutsche Telekom intends to list its shares in the US, the position is almost certain to go to a New York-based bank. Merrill Lynch of the US is regarded as one of the strongest candidates, with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers also prominent among the 22 banks which made presentations in Bonn. Some bankers said the government favours Merrill Lynch, while it is understood that Deutsche Telekom's choice is for Goldman Sachs. Among UK banks hoping for a parallel or subordinate foreign role are Kleinwort Benson, SG Warburg and NM Rothschild. European banks have lobbied strongly for one of them to play a prominent part in the issue, scheduled for the first half of 1996, because of the experience of UK investment houses in handling large privatisation deals. They have also argued their case on political grounds. Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank are expected to be appointed joint lead managers of the issue, in which a quarter of Telekom's shares will be sold in the first privatisation tranche; the second will take place in 1998. Dresdner Bank is likely to oversee the domestic share side and Deutsche Bank the international. Like the recent privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, which raised just over DM1bn, the Deutsche Telekom issue is expected to be 'ring-fenced' with banks restricted to consortiums covering geographical areas. The DM530m share offer by Hanover Re, the world's fifth-largest reinsurance group, was subscribed twice over with foreign investors taking more of the issue than expected, Commerzbank, the lead manager, said yesterday.</p>

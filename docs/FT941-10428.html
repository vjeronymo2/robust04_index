			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Highveld Steel checks four-year profit slide Pre-tax profit at Highveld Steel and Vanadium, the Anglo-American owned metals producer, has advanced 16 per cent to R86.1m (Dollars 25.1m) in the year to December 31, against R74.4m in 1992. The result marks the end of a four-year slide in profitability. An improved total dividend of 50 cents is declared, compared with 45 cents last time. Highveld has offered a scrip alternative - taken up by controlling shareholder the Anglo American Industrial Corporation - to conserve its cash resources as it continues to finance its 33 per cent share of the R2.5bn Columbus Stainless Steel expansion project. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said resurgent domestic demand for steel - associated with the construction of a number of large capital projects and renewed economic growth - improved export steel prices, lifted by good demand from China, and the rand's weakness against the dollar were the main features of the year. Turnover rose to R1.69bn from R1.49bn, with about half of sales derived from steel operations and the remainder spread between the group's ferro-alloy, aluminium can and stainless steel interests. Mr Boyd said most of Highveld's facilities were operating at or near full capacity, with the exception of its Vantra vanadium plant. A higher tax charge offset the improved operating performance, so that distributable profit before abnormal and extraordinary items slipped to R69.3m from R70.8m, equivalent to 78.3 cents against 80 cents a share. However, Highveld benefited from a one-off R57.9m deferred tax credit, related to the reduction in the corporate tax rate in 1993, and R23.5m in proceeds of the sale of one-sixth of its original stake in Columbus to the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation. Bottom-line income jumped to R150.7m from R76m.</p>

Savluk, doctor of economic </F> sciences: "Inflation in Ukraine: Its Sources and Its Current  Status"]    [Text] The most important negative phenomenon in Ukraine's  economy in its market-reform stage is inflation. From a barely  perceptible devaluation of money during the eighties, inflation  has very rapidly (in close to three years) reached the level of  hyperinflation. The odd thing is that this upsurge of inflation  has occurred in one of the most economically developed and  prosperous republics of the former USSR. This phenomenon has not  been properly analyzed and objectively assessed and remains  poorly understood by the general public. This makes it possible  to exploit the threat of inflation as justification for opposing  Ukraine's leaving the single ruble zone and for opposing the  building up of an independent Ukrainian state per se.  Consequently, an analysis of inflation in present-day Ukraine  assumes exceptional importance.  <H5>  Was There Inflation in Ukraine Before Ukraine Proclaimed Her </H5> Independence?    In order to objectively assess the inflationary processes  currently under way, one must first determine whether there was  inflation in Ukraine during the Soviet period. It is, however,  very difficult to find a simple nswer to this question today.  During the Soviet period, Ukraine was a component part of  another state and did not have an independent monetary system.  We are thus left with data on inflation in the USSR as a whole  on which to base our investigation. This approach is  methodologically justified inasmuch as the state of monetary  circulation in Ukraine was then determined by the Union center  and differed very little from the state of the monetary sphere  of the Union as a whole.    With rigid state controls and containment of prices as their  policy, the official Soviet authorities [as published] denied  the very possibility of inflation in a planned economy, and  government statistics simply kept silent about the problem of  inflation until 1989.    If one were to judge inflation by the dynamics of the  state-set retail prices at which the majority of goods and  services were sold in the Soviet Union, one could conclude that  until the beginning of the restructuring of the Soviet economy,  there really was no inflation or that it was insignificant (see  Table 1).    Table 1. State Retail Price Indexes (in % of average annual prices in 1970)*   Indicators          Years   1975                1980           1985           1990   All Goods   throughout the      99.7           103.0          108.0          119.9  USSR   in Ukraine          100.0          101.6          108.0          117.7   Food Products   throughout the      100.9          103.0          112.0          128.8  USSR   in Ukraine          100.1          100.4          110.3          122.4   Nonfood Consumer  Items   throughout the      98.0           103.0          104.0          112.3  USSR   in Ukraine          97.6           102.4          104.0          112.3   * See: The National Economy of the USSR in 1985, Moscow, Finansy i  statistika, 1986, p 478; The National Economy of the USSR in 1990, Moscow,  Finansy i statistika, 1991, p 166; The National Economy of the Ukrainian SSR  in 1985, Kiev, Tekhnika, 1986, p 315; The National Economy of the Ukrainian  SSR in 1990, Kiev, Tekhnika, 1991, p 108.      The data in Table 1 indicates that a perceptible rise in  prices began concurrently throughout the whole Soviet Union and  in Ukraine particularly in the eighties. The greatest increases  occurred in the prices of food products. Inflation began to  assume an open form. This forced the USSR Ministry of Finance in  1989 to acknowledge officially that inflation had begun in the  country and that it was running at an annual rate of  2-4%.[.sup]1[/]    Approximately the same data on inflation in the former USSR  were cited by official IMF sources and some Western economists.  In particular, R. Dorybush (Massachussetts Institute of  Technology), citing IMF sources in a work entitled The  Lessons of High Inflation, provided the following figures  for inflation in the USSR: 1986 -- 2%, 1987 --  1.3%, 1988 --  0.6%, 1989 -- 2%, 1990 --4.8%.[.sup]2[/] But these  data do  not take into account hidden constituent inflation. In reality,  the monetary sphere of the former USSR (including Ukraine's) was  in much greater disequilibrium than indicated by the index of  state retail prices. Through the mechanism of preferential bank  credits, a surplus money supply was constantly being injected  into circulation. Goods shortages and unmet effective demand  were growing steadily, creating a significant hidden  inflationary potential (see Table 2).    Table 2. The Dynamics of Some Macroeconomic Indicators of the Development  of the USSR (in % compared with 1965)*   Indicators         Years   1970               1975       1980       1985       1990   Gross Social       143.0      192.0      240.0      307.0        395.1  Product (in real  prices)   Retail Goods       148.0      201.0      258.0      309.0        446.2  Turnover (in  real prices)   Financial Means    168.0      212.0      280.0      356.0        1,926.0  (profit, tax on  turnover,  depreciation)   Short-term Bank    164.0      230.0      341.0      591.0        355.5  Credits  (remaining  indebtedness at  the end of the  year)   Personal Savings   249.0      490.0      837.0      1,182.0      2,039.8  Deposited in the  Savings Bank  (remaining at  the end of the  year)   * See: The National Economy of the USSR in 1980, Moscow, Statistika, 1981,  pp 39, 40, 380, 503, 511, 521; The National Economy of the USSR in 1985, pp  39, 448, 548, 561, 586; The National Economy of the USSR in 1990, pp 5, 6,  15, 20, 29, 48.      The first two indicators reveal changes in the material  sphere of the economy, and the other three indicate changes in  the monetary sphere. From the very beginning of the period under  investigation, the indicators of change in the monetary sphere  were rising faster than the indicators of change in the material  sphere, and this gap grew steadily wider, indicating the growth  of a chronic disequilibrium between the supplies of goods and  money in the economy and a hidden inflationary potential.  Although indebtedness on short-term bank loans fell markedly  after 1985, this did not alter the overall situation. At the  same time, there was a sharp rise in such indicators as  financial means (5.5-fold), the state budget deficit  (approximately 3-fold),[.sup]3[/] and the national  debt.[.sup]4[/]    The conclusion concerning a chronic buildup of inflationary  potential (particularly in the consumer sector of the USSR  economy) is also confirmed by a growing discrepancy between  prices in the state trade network and at collective farm  markets. In the USSR as a whole, the average prices of goods  sold at collective farm markets at unregulated prices exceeded  state prices: in 1960 -- 1.35-fold, in 1970 --1.55-fold, in 1980  -- 2.09-fold.[.sup]5[/] In Ukraine, these unregulated prices  were 2.27-fold higher in 1980, 2.38-fold higher in 1985, and  2.87-fold higher in 1990.[.sup]6[/]    The data cited to reflect the disequilibrium in the economy  between the supply of goods and money reveal that the surplus  money supply in circulation in the consumer sector constituted  70-75% of the total volume of money held by the  population on  the eve of the collapse of the former USSR. At the end of 1990,  this amounted to approximately 350-400 billion rubles. According  to our estimates, Ukraine accounted for 75-90 billion rubles of  this sum. This money reflected unmet demand and put constant  pressure on prices, causing them to rise. We estimate that a  sudden liberalization of prices alone would have caused the  general level of prices to at least triple. Calculations of the  real rate of inflation made in 1991 at the state level revealed  that in 1989 inflation measured 7.5% and in 1990,  19%.[.sup]7[/]    Thus, Ukraine approached her declaration of independence  with  a moderate level of open inflation and with a large hidden  inflationary potential, which was capable of causing significant  inflation with the first attempt to liberalize prices.  <H5>  The Condition of Ukraine's Monetary Sphere During the Period </H5> Between Ukraine's Proclamation of Independence and Her Leaving  the Union    The Declaration of Independence of Ukraine proclaimed in  July  1990 could not suddenly change the course of economic processes,  including those taking place in the monetary sphere. These  continued under their own momentum, which had been created by  the totality of the development that had come before: the  "cost-is-no-object" nature of the economy, the falling volumes  and effectiveness of production, decreased labor productivity,  the irrational, militarized structure of production, etc.  Moreover, for nearly another one and a half years, Ukraine  remained part of the Union and part of the common economic and  monetary space. Therefore, the Union center continued to decide  all key issues relating to Ukraine's economic development: it  set policies on wages, prices, emission, credit, etc. Not only  did Ukraine's proclamation of independence in July 1990 not  change the internal negative economic processes, but it provoked  a response from the Union center and some of the other Union  republics that spurred inflation. There began increased external  pressure on the economy of the Ukrainian state, manifested in  the issuance of harsher directives in response to Ukraine's  desire for independence.    The 1990 forecast for the Union as a whole anticipated a  significant increase in emission, while "freezing" emission for  Ukraine at the 1989 level, i.e., at 1.2 billion rubles. In  reality, emission in 1990 for the Union as a whole significantly  exceeded the predicted level and reached an unprecedented amount  -- 24 billion rubles. At the same time, Ukraine removed 446  million rubles out of circulation -- an action that Ukraine's  government hailed as a notable accomplishment in carrying out  the center's directive regarding emission.[.sup]8[/]    The result of this "accomplishment" for the economy and  people of Ukraine was slower growth of personal income than in  other republics, accelerated growth of unmet demand while large  quantities of goods flowed out of Ukraine, and a redistribution  of credit resources to the benefit of other republics.    Since 1991, the Union center's negative influence on  Ukraine's monetary sphere was gradually compounded by the  destructive effects of the centrifugal actions in the monetary  and credit policy of the government of the Russian Federation.    Against the background of the active struggle for  independence that unfolded in many republics of the Union, the  government of Russia also proclaimed war on the Union center and  began to pursue an openly independent economic policy. To bring  over large segments of the population to its side in this  struggle, the Russian government decided to promote a rapid  increase in personal incomes, grant credit and tax preferences  to enterprises that recognized the jurisdiction of Russia,  immediately meet all the demands of striking collectives for  expanded economic independence, etc.    The result of this policy was an unprecedented increase in  emission by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). During 1991, it  put 32% more cash into circulation than during all the  preceding 30 years (1961-1990). At the same time, Ukraine put  40% less money into circulation than during the entire  preceding 30 years. As a result, the total supply of money in  circulation in Russia in 1991 increased 2.26-fold, while in  Ukraine this amount increased only 1.44-fold.[.sup]9[/] The  huge money supplies issued by the CBR circulated freely in the  single ruble zone, "flooding" the markets of all the Union  republics, and especially Ukraine's.    The CBR pursued an identical policy through its mechanism of  credit emissions, which provided Russia's enterprises with  maximally favorable terms on which to gain access to credit  resources. Although Russia, like all the other republics, was  still part of the Union and therefore bound by the terms of a  single credit policy set by the State Bank of the USSR, in 1991  the CBR began openly ignoring these terms.    In particular, the USSR State Bank recommended a minimum  reserve requirement averaging 14% for the central banks  of the  Union republics and an interest rate on credits for refinancing  commercial banks averaging 12%. By the beginning of 1991,  the  CBR had set these same standards for Russia's banks at a much  lower level -- 2% and 8%, respectively. It also  exceeded the  centralized quota for credit emission by almost 200 percent.  Throughout 1991, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the  central banks of other republics continued to maintain the  centrally established standards and quotas. The result was a  2.3-fold increase in credit extensions by Russia's banks, and  only a 1.7-fold increase by Ukraine's banks.[.sup]10[/] Thus,  the importing of inflation into Ukraine began even before she  left the Union, and its effect was so perceptible that the  government of Ukraine was forced to apply organizational  measures to protect the Ukrainian consumer market from the  inflow of money from outside. It introduced single-use coupons  in retail trade, as well as export controls.    At the same time, the effects of internal inflationary  factors were becoming more perceptible -- in particular, the  growth of crisis phenomena in Ukraine's own economy. Production  volumes were falling at an accelerated rate: in 1991 the gross  social product decreased (as against 1990) by 11.3% and  national income by 11.2%. Meanwhile, the state budget  deficit  amounted to 21.1 billion rubles, or 27.4% of total  revenues, as  compared to 1990, when budget revenues had exceeded budget  expenditures by 1.4 billion rubles.    The situation in the monetary sphere grew radically worse  after controls over spending on wages were abolished in July  1991. In August 1991 alone, the amount of money issued by banks  for this purpose increased 2.1-fold and reached 7.5 billion  rubles. Personal income in 1991 increased (as against 1990) by  87% and once again significantly exceeded personal  spending and  savings -- by 11.3 billion rubles.[.sup]11[/] Unmet demand  and goods shortages mounted and constituted hidden components of  inflation.    At the same time, the rate of open inflation rose  unremittingly throughout 1991. In January-February, wholesale  and purchase prices were raised by a significant amount. In  April, fundamental changes were made in price formation --  agreed-to (free) prices were permitted for a large assortment of  consumer goods, and state retail prices were also raised. This  was the first obvious step in the direction of price  liberalization, which helped to transform hidden inflation into  open inflation.    The index of state retail prices for the whole of 1991 (as  compared with 1990) measured 187%. Prices in the  collective and  "black" markets were wholly unregulated and were two and three  times higher than in state and cooperative trade. Wholesale  prices in industry more than doubled.[.sup]12[/] There are  therefore grounds to believe that open inflation in 1991 across  the whole spectrum of prices and tariffs in Ukraine exceeded  200% and began to pose a serious threat to the country's  economy.    The government was forced to take steps to provide a social  safety net for the population. In particular, it carried out the  indexation of Savings Bank deposits, indexation of incomes, etc.  However, in a very short time income indexation was replaced by  the complete lifting of state wage controls in the production  sphere and by periodic increases in the incomes of employees of  budget-financed institutions. As a result of these measures,  personal income growth began to catch up with price increases.  Over 1991 as a whole, the rate of growth of personal income even  exceeded the rate of growth of prices, which, in turn, helped to  fuel inflation.  <H5>  The Rise in Inflation Following Ukraine's Exit from the USSR </H5>   The USSR finally collapsed in December 1991, and Ukraine won  independence at last. This gave rise to a new inflationary  phase, in which all the inflationary factors were rendered  significantly more active and the manifestations and processes  of inflation changed.    First and foremost, the nature of inflation imported from  other CIS countries changed significantly and its spectrum  expanded. Having won independence from the Union center and  having taken over its emission system, the Russian Federation  fundamentally changed its policies on prices, emission, and  credit. In January 1992, set on liberalizing prices, the  government of Russia unilaterally raised retail prices on an  average to triple and quadruple their previous levels. The  government of Ukraine was forced to raise the prices of most  goods by the same factors.[.sup]13[/]    After Russia left the Union, the CBR began to implement a  harsh policy of "expensive money" -- it significantly increased  the reserve requirements for commercial banks (from 2% in  1991  to 10% in January, 15% in February, and 20%  in March of 1992)  and raised the discount rate (from 8% in 1991 to  20% at the  beginning of 1992).[.sup]14[/] Insofar as the NBU maintained  the earlier standards that had been recommended by the former  USSR State Bank, these actions by the CBR upset the balance in  settling accounts between Ukraine's and Russia's enterprises.  Russian enterprises were finding it increasingly difficult to  pay for deliveries of goods from Ukraine, and in the middle of  1992, their total indebtedness was twice as high as that of  Ukraine's enterprises. This situation further disrupted economic  ties, produced a drop in production, and resulted in there being  fewer goods in Ukraine's markets. Secondly, to prevent the  bankrupting of Ukrainian enterprises, which were not receiving  payment from Russia, the NBU was forced to increase the volume  of preferential credits it extended to them and increase the  emission of credit.    However, Ukraine's total dependence on Russia for energy  supplies proved to be the principal channel through which  inflation was imported in 1992. Exploiting this dependence,  Russia's government began to raise the prices of the oil, oil  products, and gas that Russia sold to Ukraine. This caused the  price of oil products in Ukraine to rise nearly 300-fold in 1992  as a whole.[.sup]15[/] Such a jump in prices would have  destabilized the economy and monetary sphere of even a highly  developed country, let alone Ukraine.    Ukraine's exit from the Union significantly activated the  internal inflationary factors as well. Responding to social  pressure, Ukraine's government in January 1992 sharply increased  the wholesale prices of goods manufactured by the basic branches  of industry. The average level of wholesale prices in the coal  industry in February 1992 was 51 times higher than the  corresponding indicators in 1991. In January 1992, the general  level of wholesale prices in industry as a whole increased (as  gainst December 1991) 8.4-fold, and in February by an additional  factor of 2.3.[.sup]16[/] Serving to push retail prices up  even further, this government measure produced an even stronger  impact than Russia's unilateral price increases. It made state  regulation of retail prices extremely difficult, and the prices  of most goods and services were completely "freed." There began  a spontaneous process of a chronic rise of "free" prices and a  saltatory rise of regulated prices (see Table 3).    Table 3. The Dynamics of Prices Throughout 1992* (times greater than  previous level)   Indicators        Months   January           March      June      September      December   Wholesale         13.9       18.6      25.0           26.0          42.0  Prices in  Industry  (compared with  the  correponding  month in 1991)   Retail Prices     4.0        5.2       6.4**          8.4**         13.0  and Rates  (compared with  December 1991)   * See URYADOVYY KURYER, No 21, 1992, p 4; URYADOVYY KURYER, No 9-10, 1993,  p 5.   ** Not including rates for services.      The large jump in prices after their "liberalization" at the  beginning of 1992 produced the necessary equilibrium and, in  effect, destroyed the entire surplus supply of money in  circulation that had accumulated over preceding years. But  because at the beginning of 1992 current income growth lagged  behind price growth, the scarcity of demand for goods was felt  very quickly, trade slowed, and the first quarter already showed  signs of a crisis in sales. It even became necessary to lower  the prices of some goods.    However, this process soon came to a halt. The monopolistic  position and state status of most enterprises made it possible  for them to avoid lowering prices, succeed in obtaining  preferential credits and direct financial assistance (in  particular, in the form of indexation of working capital), and  quickly raise their employees' wages. Thus, by the first half  year of 1992, the average monthly wage in industry increased  11.4-fold, despite the fact that the volume of production  decreased (as against the relevant period in 1991) by  12.3%,  and retail prices in state and cooperative trade rose on an  average by a factor of 6.4.[.sup]17[/]    In light of the forced growth of incomes in the production  sphere, the government had to substantially increase the incomes  of employees in the budget-financed sphere, of pensioners,  military personnel, etc. The rate of income growth began to  surpass the rate of spending (in September -- 1.22-fold), and  unmet demand and goods shortages increased.    The government's policy of liberalizing prices and incomes  was fully supported by the National Bank of Ukraine, whose  excessive emission created favorable conditions for the  realization and intensification of all the inflationary factors  operating in the Ukrainian economy.    The NBU was implementing a policy of "cheap money" and  maintaining the discount rate at a level well below the rate of  inflation in Ukraine and the discount rates in other CIS  countries. Thus, in the fourth quarter of 1992, when inflation  measured 30% per month, the NBU's discount rate averaged  22-25% per year. At the time, Russia's discount rate was  already more than 80%. This had extremely negative  consequences  for Ukraine's economy.    Personal savings on deposit at the Savings Bank began to  shrink, the demand for convertible currency on the "black"  market rose, the exchange rate of the karbovanets began to fall  at an accelerated rate, and the outflow of capital from the  country intensified (including to Russia). The NBU's low  discount rate and the commercial banks' unregulated interest  rates on loans caused the "flight" of capital from the state  sector to the private sector of the economy, which meant, in  effect, a so-called "shadow privatization" and intensified the  payments crisis in the state sector.    Thus over the first 11 months of 1992, overdue payments in  the national economy of Ukraine increased 125-fold and on 1  December amounted to 406 billion karbovantsi.[.sup]18[/] All  these processes increased demand for credit and compelled the  NBU to release new credit flows. The total amount extended in  credit by Ukrainian banks in 1992 was 27 times greater than in  1991.[.sup]19[/] As a consequence of this policy on the part  of the NBU, economic reforms were curbed, a free-ride mentality  was reinforced, and nonpayments mounted causing a new demand  for credits.    The negative effects of the NBU's policy of "cheap money"  became especially apparent in the second half of 1992 when  Russia halted the flow of excess rubles from Ukraine. By setting  up clearing operations with Ukraine through centralized  correspondent accounts in central banks, Russia in effect pushed  Ukraine out of the ruble zone as punishment for an inadequately  thought-out monetary policy. This confined the entire supply of  issued payment means to the territory of Ukraine, and the  Ukrainian ruble (karbovanets since November) began to lose value  even more rapidly. At the end of 1992, the rate of inflation  exceeded 30% per month, reaching an annual rate of  2,100%.[.sup]20[/] Moreover, the price rises could not keep  up with the growth of the money supply, because the prices of  some essential goods were still being set by the state. Demand  for these goods could not be met despite rising prices.    The critical situation that developed in the monetary sphere  at the end of 1992 exacerbated the political situation in the  republic and was probably the main reason for the change in the  leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of  Ukraine. The new government, headed by L. Kuchma, was granted  special powers to conduct a stabilization policy. However, the  inflationary potential that had accumulated under the preceding  government was so huge that the first thing the new government  was forced to do when it took office was to raise fixed prices  1.8-fold at the beginning of 1993.    Having promised to halt inflation, the government of L.  Kuchma confined its anti-inflation policy to restricting  consumption funds at enterprises and "freezing" monetary incomes  in the budget-financed sphere. Even these measures -- albeit not  sufficiently resolute and consistent --produced some positive  results: between the end of January and the end of March 1993,  prices on the consumer market and the exchange rate of the  karbovanets were relatively stable.    But the stabilization proved short-lived, because it was not  backed by cardinal reforms of Ukraine's economic system per se  and a suitable monetary policy on the part of the NBU. The old  economic system, with its "cost-is-no-object" nature, was itself  transformed into a powerful inflationary factor when economic  ties were broken and state controls weakened, and the NBU's  policies helped to keep this system alive. Ukraine's  agroindustrial complex is an especially telling illustration of  this.    In the first quarter of 1993 alone, the agroindustrial  complex received nearly one trillion karbovantsi in preferential  credits (at an annual rate of 30%) and close to three  trillion  karbovantsi of state financial assistance for its  needs.[.sup]21[/] Other sectors of the national economy also  needed huge credits -- in March they were granted 606 billion  karbovantsi in credits to settle accounts amongst  themselves.[.sup]22[/] The total sum of cash issued in the  period between January and April 1993 amounted to 598.3 billion  karbovantsi, which exceeded emission during the corresponding  period of 1992 tenfold.[.sup]23[/]    With production volumes continuing to fall and the costs of  imported energy supplies continuing to rise, it was inevitable  that such huge injections of money would disturb the delicate  market balance that had formed after the January price increase.  Indeed, starting in March, it became apparent that goods were  again becoming scarce, demand was not being met, production  outlays that were not covered by the enterprises' own revenues  were growing, the amount of nonpayments among enterprises was  mounting to its previous level, etc. Although the NBU seemed to  come to its senses and in April-May applied a series of monetary  measures designed to fight inflation (raised the annual discount  rate to 240%, established stronger controls over the  operations  of commerical banks, began to finance the government within the  limits of the budget deficit approved by the Supreme Council,  etc.), these steps were not able to alter the situation in the  monetary sphere as a whole.    By the end of the first half year of 1993, the hidden  inflationary potential had been restored and now exceeded the  level that had existed at the end of 1992. Nonpayments and  losses reappeared in the national economy and amounted to  trillions. The government was forced to raise once again  (1.5-fold) fixed retail and wholesale prices, as well as all  forms of personal income. The Supreme Council passed a decision  to grant enterprises financial and credit assistance in the  amount of nearly seven trillion karbovantsi to be used to cover  losses, pay off debts, and for other expenditures. Thus a new  steep spiral of hyperinflation began, which made the economic  and the social situation in Ukraine even worse.    The data contained in Table 4 confirm the steep climb of all  the components of inflation in 1993. The most rapid rises are  occurring in wholesale prices and the exchange rate of the  karbovanets. During the first nine-month period, industrial  wholesale prices increased 57.3-fold (as against 11.1-fold for  the whole of 1992), and the exchange rate of the karbovanets  against the U.S. dollar increased 22.8-fold. At the same time,  the retail prices of goods and services increased more than  16-fold, that is, almost by the same factor as for all of 1992.    Table 4.

Throughout the entire third quarter, the money supply increased  each month by more than 50%. The duration of each wave of  inflation became markedly shorter. The first inflationary peak  in 1993 occurred in January and the second in June, that is,  four months later. The next upsurge took place only two months  later -- in September. Inasmuch as the money supply grew at a  faster rate than prices during the last cycle, there is every  reason to expect another sharp rise in prices.    A very clear link between the market exchange rate of the  karbovanets and the money supply appeared during the first seven  months. The exchange rate changed every month (except February)  in the same direction and at approximately the same rate as the  money supply. Not until August, when on the initiative of the  Cabinet of Ministers the National Bank of Ukraine made it  mandatory to sell 50% of all foreign exchange earnings to  the  state at a fixed rate, did the exchange rate of karbovanets  increase 2.2-fold without a clear link to the change in the  money supply.    The rise in inflation in 1993 was also caused by faster  monetary circulation. Thus, the rate at which money circulated  in the first nine months of 1993 (as compared with 1992) more  than doubled. This can be explained by a continually growing  negative discount rate and an increased level of anticipated  inflation.    Given the conditions that developed in the second half of  1993, the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of Ukraine  took a number of purely administrative steps to influence the  monetary and credit sphere (such as, fixing the foreign exchange  rate, instituting the mandatory sale to the state of 50%  of  foreign exchange earnings, setting a five-percent credit limit  and high quotas for mandatory reserves for liabilities for  banks, etc.) Inasmuch as they are purely monetary, these  measures can result in the build-up of a new inflationary  potential in Ukraine, because they leave in place the  deep-rooted structural problems in the economy, which are the  principal causes of inflation.

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARYLOUISE OATES: A GLITTERY, MILLION-DOLLAR PARTY OF A LIFETIME FOR 1,000  CLOSE FRIENDS  </P> <P> Great parties are not like trolley cars or men. If you miss a good one, another  one is not likely to be by in a short time.  </P> <P> So too bad if you missed the massive, maddeningly marvelous (and probably close  to a million-dollar) bash Fred Hayman threw Saturday night. Always a  perfectionist and a stylish showman, Hayman brought together 1,000 of his  closest friends, a handful of California's best restaurants, took over an  entire sound stage, added the sets from the film "Phantom of the Opera" in the  entrance way and gave away a $25,000 door-prize-of-your-life vacation at Paris'  Plaza Athenee.  </P> <P> "This is a party you won't see twice," said a Chaneled Jane Nathanson, who  should know because she hosted the multiacclaimed Armani party at the Museum of  Contemporary Art last January.  </P> <P> "I'm so glad I'm here," said Jill Halverson, director of the Downtown Women's  Center, to May Co. veep Jim Watterson, both of whom are active with Hayman on  projects for the homeless, to which Hayman has contributed more than $1 million  in the past two years.  </P> <P> "Here, let me spray you!" ordered Patti Skouras, one of the cabal of the  cognoscenti who were the "fragrance panel" for Hayman's new scent, 273. The  launching of the perfume, plus the renaming of his landmark Rodeo Drive store  as "Fred Hayman Beverly Hills," was the purpose of the party. Brilliant yellow  with a red signature appeared on balloons, tables, sweat shirts of the valet  parkers and even the tulip centerpieces.  </P> <P> "This reminds me of Berkeley in the '60s," quipped investment counselor Jim  Birdwell, making his way through the crowd with his wife, Nancy.  </P> <P> "Where's Chasen's?" said Barry Kaye to Jimmy's Peter Luda. Jimmy's, the Bistro,  Bistro Garden, Spago, La Scala, the Grill and, of course, Chasen's had all  provided their specialties, and their regulars patiently queued up, unmindful  of black-tie and spangles.  </P> <P> For one night only, Hayman, there with steady Betty Endo, had managed to  transform a Universal sound stage into a little, diamond-crusted piece of  Beverly Hills. And he assembled the most mixed-media guest list since the  Olympics. Top party-goers were on hand -- Virginia and Gerald Oppenheimer  chatting with Maude Chasen and Henry and Jayne Berger, Ellen and Bernie Byrens  (she in a knockout Bill Blass) greeting Teddy Orgell, Richard and Geri  Brawerman (in a spangled Bill Blass jacket copied from a Matisse) and Henry and  Sedge Plitt.  </P> <P> Glamour girls like Shirlee Fonda, Frances Bergen, Altovise Davis, Vanna White  and Connie Selleca were there, along with Jackie and Sydney Rosenberg, designer  Jack Lowrance, Doris Fields Heller with the Westwood Marquis' Jacques Camus,  who is hosting Franco and Anne Marie Cozzo of the Plaza Athenee, who came from  Paris just to present the door prize.  </P> <P> And, for those into social fortunetelling, the drawing was a symbolic end to  the Reagan era. Bernice Brown came up the winner of the UTA first-class air  fare for two to Paris and a week in a suite at what Hayman described as "the  most wonderful hotel in the world." As her husband, former Gov. Pat Brown,  cheered, Bernice went on stage. "Oh my God," Hayman greeted her, with a look of  happy surprise, then shook his head vigorously as she asked: "Do you want to  take it back?"  </P> <P> Other well-known Democrats were in attendance, like songwriters Marilyn and  Alan Bergman (who, with Marvin Hamlisch, wrote a special song for the occasion,  "We Go So Well Together"); Roz Wyman (with Republican John Berl) talking with  Bob and Sally Burkett; Mickey Ziffren (in a slinky black dress) with her  brother-in-law, Leo; Atty. Gen. John and Andrea Van de Kamp chatting with Marc  Nathanson; Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his wife, Judge Diane Wayne; State  Comptroller Gray and Sharon Davis, and Lisa Specht and Ron Rogers.  </P> <P> Maureen Reagan, in pink, headed the list of well-known Republicans. (Earlier in  the week, Hayman had sent Nancy Reagan the first bottle of 273, with a note  welcoming her back to the neighborhood.) Mary and Brad Jones were there, as was  Giney Milner with Jim Wharton.  </P> <P> Publicist Wanda Henderson was there in a feathered hat and boa: "I molt at  midnight, darling." Elaine Goldsmith was in a striking black and red gown, the  one she, as a faithful board member, bought at the Otis/Parsons student fashion  show last year.  </P> <P> Downtown types were there: City Council president John and Margaret Ferraro  chatted with attorney Neil Papiano and Sharon Thralls. Entertainment types:  Ricardo and Georgiana Montalban and Columbia Television's Gary and Anne  Lieberthal, Charlton and Lydia Heston, Henry and Ginny Mancini (after their  successful Music Center party Friday night), and Alan Carr with Wendy Stark, as  well as Burt Sugarman and Mary Hart.  </P> <P> And, of course, the restaurant mavens: Jimmy and Anne Murphy (she in a purple  ruffled gown "which Fred did"), the Bistro's Kurt Niklas and Ini Asman, lining  up for some Spago food from Wolfgang Puck (perhaps the happiest man in  attendance, because his glamorous wife, Barbara Lazeroff, expects their first  baby in May).  </P> <P> Political consultant Joe Cerrell, with the warm smile he gets at the approach  of the USC Marching Band, asked cutely: "I want to know if anyone ever has seen  the UCLA Marching Band?" Everyone at the party had a special connection to  Hayman. Cerrell said that when Hayman was at the Beverly Hilton, he did all the  Democratic political dinners: "He even did Lee's and my wedding on Nov. 17,  1963. And he left the Hilton the next day."  </P> <P> As the big band left the stage, as the jazz club was set up in a tent where the  Beluga caviar and Chasen's chili were served as appetizers, before the  dozen-plus "dirty dancers" did their routine, and the quartet of rock 'n' roll  women singers took over the stage -- Fred Hayman thanked his friends "for a  brilliant evening."  </P> <P> This is, he said, "the American dream." And there was probably not a party-goer  who would argue with that.  </P></p>

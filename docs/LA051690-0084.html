			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORDSTROM FIGHTS LABOR ALLEGATIONS AT ANNUAL SESSION  </P> <P> Nordstrom Inc. launched a counterattack Tuesday against allegations that it  makes employees work without pay, defending its business practices and  challenging union officials to hold a referendum to see if they have the  backing of employees.  </P> <P> Management's defense took center stage at the annual shareholders' meeting at  the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, overshadowing disappointing earnings.  </P> <P> Bruce, James and John Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer's co-chairmen,  managed to avoid any direct clashes with union officials. Their closest brush  came when a pro-union shoe salesman from a Nordstrom store in Seattle walked to  the front of the room and told shareholders that the company "has serious  problems that need to be addressed."  </P> <P> He was referring to Nordstrom's continuing problems with labor grievances and a  union class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the firm's roughly 100,000  employees alleging that clerks were encouraged to work extra hours without pay.  The retail chain, known for its attentive customer service, also faces a  shareholders' lawsuit that claims the company failed to reveal the extent of  its labor problems.  </P> <P> Several pro-management workers were applauded when they rose to say they backed  the store's policy of personal service and were proud to be associated with  Nordstrom. Earlier, they had joined in a rally in front of the hotel to show  their support for the company.  </P> <P> Nordstrom, with $2.7 billion in sales last year, operates 59 stores in  Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Virginia and Utah. Employees in  California do not belong to a union.  </P> <P> Bruce Nordstrom, in a defense of what he termed "a media smear campaign" waged  by two Washington state locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union,  said the chief issue was freedom. Employees should have the freedom to decide  their representation and the company should have the freedom to continue to  conduct business as it has in the past, he declared.  </P> <P> "Our people resent having to be members of a union that to them represents  mediocrity," Nordstrom said. If Nordstrom workers seek a decertification vote,  "we will stand by whatever the employees tell us," he added, receiving a round  of applause.  </P> <P> He repeatedly defended company sales policies, in which clerks receive both an  hourly wage and commission. He asserted that the company's workers are the  best-paid in the retailing industry. He offered examples of a men's suit  salesman who earned $100,000 in salary and commissions last year and a shoe  salesman who garnered $82,000.  </P> <P> The company's defense drew a sharp rebuttal from Joe Peterson, president of  UFCW Union Local 1001 in Seattle. Peterson, dressed in a tuxedo, noted that the  National Labor Relations Board has pending complaints against Nordstrom,  including an allegation that the company tried to sidestep the union by  illegally encouraging employees to negotiate directly with the company to  resolve back-pay disputes. In addition, the Washington State Department of  Labor and Industries has found Nordstrom in violation of minimum-wage laws and  ordered it to pay back wages.  </P> <P> Also, the union has filed a lawsuit demanding back pay for all Nordstrom  workers who worked unpaid hours performing such duties as writing thank-you  notes or making deliveries. Peterson estimated that Nordstrom faces a potential  $300 million in back-wage claims. The company has established a $15-million  fund to pay such claims.  </P> <P> "I think the company recognizes we're not going to go away," said Peterson. But  he said the company refuses to meet the union at the bargaining table and can  expect a continued "public relations nightmare."  </P> <P> A group of Seattle-area Nordstrom employees who said they paid their own way to  Orange County to attend the annual meeting joined in Bruce Nordstrom's  challenge to the union to allow a decertification vote.  </P> <P> Larry McCargar, an NLRB official in Seattle, said the agency would not  authorize a decertification election "until the unfair labor practices are  remedied."  </P> <P> Nordstrom officials downplayed the effect of labor problems on lackluster  earnings.  </P> <P> Nordstrom earnings plunged 43% for its first quarter ended April 30 to $13.2  million, down from $23 million a year earlier. Sales, however, were up 8%.  </P> <P> James Nordstrom said the retailer lowered its prices to keep pace with  competitors, which squeezed profits. Also, he said, inflation and expenses  related to the labor strife kept costs high.  </P> <P> The company said it believes that the $15 million set aside to pay back-pay  claims is sufficient and that the claims should not substantially affect  earnings this year.  </P> <P> John A. McMillan, Nordstrom's president, said the firm's earnings for its  fiscal year ended Jan. 31 were hurt by the effects of the San Francisco  earthquake in October, and by general disarray in the retail industry.  Nordstrom had earnings of $31.4 million in fiscal 1990, compared to $47.5  million in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zhongluo (2621 0022 3157): "Newly Appointed </F> Commander of Beijing Garrison Command He Daoquan"]    [text] In early February 1994, the JIEFANGJUNBAO carried a  news about the leader of the CPC Central Military Commission,  accompanied by He Daoquan, visited the PLA troops under the  command of the Beijing MR to extend his Spring Festival  greetings. This news proved that He Daoquan has been appointed  Deputy Commander of the Beijing MR and concurrently Commander of  the Beijing Garrison Command. He predecessor Lt.Gen. Zhang  Zhijian was transferred to take the post of Political Commissar  of the Chengdu MR.  <H5>  Joined Army in Hubei in 1951 </H5>   Lt.Gen. He Daoquan was born in Huangpi County, Hubei  Province. He was born in the same county as Xu Haidong who was  granted the military rank of a full general when the Chinese  Communists first started the military rank system in 1955.  However, they were military officers of two different  generations. When Xu Haidong led the 25th Army of the Red Army  to march from Hubei, Henan and Anhui to northern Shaanxi, He  Daoquan was born in that year. He had never participated in any  of the campaigns in that year. In July 1951, two years after the  founding of the PRC, He Daoquan, who was a 17-year old middle  school student, joined the PLA in Hubei. He, together with  Lt.Gen. Liu Jingsong who later became his superior, were sent to  study at the PLA 27th Infantry School in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang.  The 27th Infantry School grew out of the Military and Political  Academy of the Northeastern Military District. It trained  infantry company and platoon-level commanders. The 27th Infantry  School was renamed the 7th Infantry School. In the school, the  students received strict training from Soviet instructors and  were prepared to fight in Korea at any time.  <H5>  Graduated From Infantry School in 1954 </H5>   He Daoquan graduated from the infantry school in 1954.  One of his veteran instructors was an officer who used to work  for Gen. Feng Yuxiang. He hoped that all the graduates of this  class would become generals. Soon after that He Daoquan was  assigned to the 23rd Army Corps of the Chinese People's  Volunteers Army as a platoon leader. The Korea War stopped on 27  July 1953. In order to prevent the war from breaking out once  again, the Chinese Communists left some troops in North Korea.  The 23rd Army Corps was one of the PLA units left in Korea. This  army corps entered the Korea War on 5 September 1952. Originally  it was the 4th Column of the East China Field Army officially  formed in January 1947. It grew out of the guerilla units left  in Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi when the Red Army started the  Long March in 1934. In the early stage of the War of Resistance  against Japanese Aggression, it was reorganized to become the 2d  Detachment of the New 4th Army. Later, it became the 1st  Division of the New 4th Army and the 1st Division of the Central  China Field Army. It fought many battles under the direct  command of Su Yu. When the civil war between the Kuomintang and  the Chinese Communists broke out in an overall manner, it took  part in the Suzhong, Laiwu, Menglianggu, Eastern Honan, Huaihai  and Yangtze River Crossing campaigns. It remained one of the  main forces of the 3d Field Army. Prior to the Korean Armistice,  the 23d Army Corps took part in the third offensive campaign in  the summer of 1953. At that time, Zhong Guochu was Corps  Commander and Lu Sheng the Corps' political commissar. When he  stationed in Korea with the 23d Army Corps, He Daoquan took the  post of a staff training officer and department head in an  infantry battalion.  <H5>  Withdraw From Korea With 23d Army Corps in 1958 </H5>   He Daoquan withdrew from Korea with the 23d Army Corps  and returned to China in March 1958. After returning to China,  the 23d Army Corps stationed in Heilongjiang for a long time. It  was placed under the command of the Shenyang MR. He Daoquan was  the corps' deputy director and then director of its training  department and Deputy Divisional Chief of Staff. During the  Sino-Soviet border clash, he went to the frontier command post  to direct the PLA units under his command.  <H5>  Outstanding Contributions to Automating Army Command System </H5>   In 1975, He Daoquan held the post of divisional chief of  staff. Later he was promoted to Deputy Division Commander and  then Division Commander. During that period, he strived to  achieve automation for the command system. After 1977, China's  first automated military command vehicle appeared in his  military compound. The automation engineering project for the  command system was further developed after 1980. He Daoquan was  promoted to Chief of Staff of the 23d Army Corps in 1983. Not  long after that, he personally led the staff members in his  office to visit the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing, the  National Defense University, the Air Force Academy, the Armored  Force Engineering Institute and other military academies. Later  he went to Xian and Changsha to learn from the experience of the  University of Science and Technology for National Defense, and  worked hard for command system automation.  <H5>  Build a Quick Response Regiment in the Army </H5>   He Daoquan was promoted to Commander of the 23d Army  Corps in 1985. On 8 February 1985, the JIEFANGJUNBAO carried a  report on its frontpage, entitled: "A Battlefield without Smoke  of Gunpowder." It reported on the automated command system  network which included one army, three divisions and one  regiment. The network was developed by the group army led by He  Daoquan. Their "Battlefield No. 1" model was sent to Beijing for  exhibition, attracting the attention of many foreign military  attaches. Later, He Daoquan decided to establish a quick  response regiment in the army, adding a pair of skis to the  standard equipment for each soldier. His immediate target was to  train this regiment to enhance its mobility on snow-covered  land. His long-term target was to use motorized sledges with  which all military equipment and personnel could move quickly  from one place to another. The establishment of the quick  response regiment and He Daoquan's concept on quick response won  approval from Commander Liu Jingsong and Chief of Staff Li Haibo  of the Shenyang MR. In the next winter, the division to which  the quick response regiment belonged was supplied with skiing  equipment. Each soldier got a pair of skis as a part of the  standard equipment.    At the 13th National CPC Congress held in November 1987,  He Daoquan was elected an alternate member of the CPC Central  Committee. After the PLA resumed the rank system in October  1988, he was awarded the rank of an army major general. At the  14th National CPC Congress held in October 1992, He Daoquan did  not get elected as an alternate member, because he had left the  23d Army Corps and worked for the PLA General Staff  Headquarters. Wu Yuqian, who replaced He Daoquan as the  commander of the 23d Army Corps, was elected alternate member of  the CPC Central Committee.  <H5>  Promoted to Army Lieutenant General in 1993 </H5>   He Daoquan became Deputy Commander of the Beijing MR and  concurrently Commander of the Beijing Garrison Command in  January 1994. Prior to this, he was promoted to army Lieutenant  General. This shows that his position in the army is rising.    The Beijing Garrison Command which was established in  January 1951 mainly shoulders the heavy responsibility of  performing garrison duties and guarding the capital. Right now,  it is placed under the command of the Beijing MR. At the same  time, it is a department of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee  in handling military affairs. It is placed under the dual  leadership of the Beijing MR and the Beijing Municipal CPC  Committee. Chen Xitong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC  Committee and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee, is concurrently the First Secretary of the Beijing  Garrison Command's CPC committee. After the "Cultural  Revolution," Fu Chongbi, Yan Tongmao, Dong Xuelin and others  held this post before. In view of the importance of this  position, there are good chances for the 59-year old He Daoquan  to move upwards in the next few years.    He Daoquan believes that we never complain about having  too many friends, but we are not sure that one will never become  our enemy. As long as border lines are not eliminated on earth,  it will be impossible to eliminate frictions and conflicts for  survival among the various nationalities. The armed forces must  be ready to launch attacks at all times.  <H5>  Armed Forces Must Be Ready to Launch Attacks At All Times </H5>   He Daoquan often sigh with a soldier's feelings about  the perverse and changeable, but sometimes soft and tender  history. He is not sure that he has reached the peak of his  life, but he accepts the historic facts imposed on an  individual. Because he believes that one must commit oneself for  being a high-ranking general and that one's obligation is always  commensurate with his power.    One who wishes to become a general thinks more about  honor, and one who is a general thinks more about one's  responsibilities. He Daoquan is one who thinks more about his  responsibilities. At a time when cries for peace are causing a  temporary clamor, this general, laden with anxiety, is improving  his military machinery all by himself night and day. He believes  that his efforts and those of his colleagues will not be wasted.  Once the page of "complex and changeable" history is turned  over, our descendants will joyfully find that their world will  be more secured than ever before.</p>

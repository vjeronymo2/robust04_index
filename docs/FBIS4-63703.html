			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Before flying to Brussels  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev signed a special  directive which orders heads of all ranks to tighten measures to  economize on funds allocated for the national defense.    First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and the chief  department for the military budget and financing of the Defense  Ministry are assigned to control the implementation of this  directive, informed sources from the Russian Defense Ministry  told ITAR-TASS today.    The document accentuates that under the conditions of the  stiff budget it is necessary to maintain the most important  components ensuring combat efficiency of the Russian Armed  Forces.    At the same time, military experts note, these measures  taken  by the defense minister, will hardly save the situation if the  State Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) does not  agree to increase the military budget from 37.1 trillion roubles  to at least 55.0 trillion roubles which was approved in  principle by the duma Defense Committee.    In the estimation of the chief department of the military  budget and financing of the Defense Ministry, in the first four  months of 1994 the Defense Ministry received about 4 trillion  roubles which put the Armed Forces and enterprises carrying out  military orders in an exceptionally complex condition.    Military representatives do not agree that they are guided  by  narrow departmental interests. Speaking at a news conference on  a military budget recently held at the State Duma, Andrey  Kokoshin noted that he was taking measures to resolve the  current crisis of mutual non-payments by enterprises and  stimulate the output of high technology products for the civil  use -- transport, communications, television and power grids --  with the aim of increasing the budget revenue item.    He explained that in a bid to get a larger sum of  allocations  for the defense, experts meant not to increase it but maintain  this sum of financing at the level of 1993 in comparable prices.  No less than 60 per cent of these funds will be spent on social  needs which have considerably grown in connection with the  withdrawal of Russian troops from republics of the former Soviet  Union and former socialist countries, and providing them with  dwellings and amenities.    The Russian president, the head of the government and the  chairman of the Federation Council expressed their agreement in  principle with the need to increase the defense budget, Andrey  Kokoshin pointed out.    "The 37.1 trillion roubles intended for the defense and  approved by the State Duma at the first reading will be enough  only to pay salaries and money allowances to the troops," the  defense minister told journalists at a news conference on May  19. "If the Army splits the most awful thing may happen --  nobody will be able to stop hungry soldiers," Pavel Grachev  emphasised.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Party voting reform 'popular' THE PRINCIPLE of one-member-one-vote for the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates is popular with the electorate, according to a survey carried out for the AEEU engineering and electrical union by MORI, the poll organisation, published today. This found that 30 per cent of trade unionists would be more likely to vote Labour at the next general election if the principle came into force and 26 per cent of Liberal Democratic supporters.</p>

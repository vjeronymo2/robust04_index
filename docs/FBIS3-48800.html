			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by YOMIURI SHIMBUN investigation team: "Twenty-Two </F> Urban and Rural Prefectures Do Amakudari Introductions;  `Intimate Arrangement' of Local Government and Construction  Industry; Allotment and Selection of Persons for Jobs"]    [Text] On 7 October it was learned through an investigation  by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN Company that 22 urban and nonurban  prefectures throughout Japan, and three government-regulation  designated cities are using their good offices to enable  officials who are scheduled to retire to find employment in the  construction industry and are transmitting to industry members  information on officials who are scheduled to retire. At least  seven urban and nonurban prefectures among these 25 autonomous  bodies have established "amakudari [the practice of retiring  officials assuming good positions in the industries with which  their agency deals] systems" in which reemployment committees,  construction-related departments, and so on become interface  points to handle such business as selecting former officials  and allotting them to each company. In response to it being  pointed out that amakudari has become a hotbed of  "government-industry adhesion," in August [1993] the Ministry of  Construction set forth the policy that it would independently  refrain for the time being from amakudari of executive-level  officials, but in local government, only Okayama Prefecture gave  up amakudari recommendations. And only two prefectures, Chiba  and Tottori, indicated that they would "reconsider."    Local governments that are using their good offices and  introducing retiring personnel are of two types: 1) ones in  which the autonomous body allots and selects personnel if there  is a request from contractors for their former officials to  take a position upon retirement--Iwate, Miyagi, Tokyo, Shiga,  Wakayama, Yamaguchi, and Ehime; and 2) ones which, if there is a  request, ask the retiree's own wishes and make an  introduction--Hokkaido, Aomori, Chiba, Kanagaws, Niigata,  Shizuoka, Mie, Osaka, Hyogo, Tottori, Kagawa, Kumamoto,  Nagasaki, Oita, and Miyazaki Prefectures and the cities of  Sapporo, Chiba, and Nagoya.    Typical of the first type is Miyagi Prefecture, whose former  governor, Shuntaro Homna, was arrested. The usual practice is  for such industry members as general contractors to submit to  the prefecture documents called the "application for transfer of  talented staff" and "employment application," and for the  Construction General Affairs Section, for example, to allocate  reemployment positions by checking the inclinations of the  retiree with those of the company.    In Yamaguchi Prefecture an employment committee headed by  the  lieutenant governor studies reemployment positions for those  scheduled to retire based on "transfer applications" from  construction companies. Finding reemployment via one's own  connections is called "self-development," but such cases are 20  to 30 percent. The majority are said to find new positions in  the private sector through the good offices of the prefecture.  In Tokyo, each bureau coordinates through its own connections,  and at the Bureau of Construction the bureau's executives become  the point of interface, receiving requests from companies and  introducing staff to prospective new employers. There are also  many cases in which the contractor-side designates the person  desired; in Aichi Prefecture contractors were making inquiries  to the persons in charge of the Civil Engineering Division and  Construction Division regarding such things as prospective  employees' efficiency reports and state of health.    The Ministry of Construction not only independently  refrained  from amakudari for its own officials at the division-chief and  office-chief levels, and at the department-chief and above level  in local construction bureaus, but also made a practice of  obtaining from general officials a written promise that they  "will not engage in the operation of public works construction."  But on the local government side there is a strong view that,  "in order to make the most of officials' experience and  technology after their retirement, one ought not establish  limits to the places in which they can be reemployed. Firms in  which former officials find employment do not have an advantage  in bidding and so on."    In regard to using good offices and making introductions,  standing out are such opinions as "We are different from places  like Sendai and have no special problem, so there is no need to  change" (Yukio Yamauchi, chief of Niigato Prefecture's Civil  Engineering Department), and "Civil Engineering Department  former officials who have found positions in the private sector  are generally in charge of operations, but the objective of  operations is to receive designation [as an approved bidder], it  does not go beyond that" (Tetsuo Enamiya, chief of Kochi  Prefecture's Civil Engineering Department).    For Okayama Prefecture, which has a positive attitude toward  independent restraint, it had become a usual practice for two to  five of the 10 or so persons who retire annually from the Civil  Engineering Department to find new employment by receiving  recommendations from the department chief, but beginning in the  current fiscal year the prefecture stopped serving as a  connection.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by National Dialogue Commision spokesman </F> Abdelkader Bensalah at a news conference in Algiers on 11  January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] After having listened to all  the parties in the dialogue, the National Dialogue Commission  will remain in contact with them to consult them on several  issues related to the contents of the platform and the national  conference.    These clarifications do not prevent replies to a number of  issues raised by the national press, citizens, or parties in the  dialogue. Among these, we will mention the pilot study for the  platform of dialogue with its contents. It has introduced clear  amendments to the constitution, and in this the commission went  beyond its powers.    The pilot study also included a chapter devoted to the  economic, social, and security guidelines. In this chapter  there were some people who said these were not enough. There  were also those who said that by including these guidelines in  the document, it means participation in issues that have a  relationship with the social project.    Regarding the chapter on commitments, there were some people  who said that it should remain unchanged, whereas some other  people demanded there was a need to amend it. A third side  raised the possibility of discarding it altogether. There were  also those who demanded there was a need to drop the preamble  because it came up with ideas close to the social project.    On this occasion the commission wishes to make the following  clarifications:    The pilot study endeavored to go along with the spirit of  the  constitution. Those who drafted the pilot study never had an  intention to amend the constitution. In the view of the  commission, the constitution remains a basic reference document  and the basic law that regulates the state's institutions. But  the institutions of the transitional period and particularly the  state presidency and the provisional national council are not  elected. Therefore, they cannot occupy the same status of the  republic presidency and the national people's assembly.  Consequently, the powers of the interim institutions have a  special nature, a matter which necessitated they run under  special rules.    This is on the one hand. On the other hand, in view of the  seriousness of the multi-faceted crisis and the results of this  crisis that prevent the literal implementation of the  constitution, and in view of the inevitability that dictates on  us the need to provide the maximum level of success to attain  the aims of the interim stage to ensure a return to the  electoral course, the commission believed in its drafting of the  pilot study. The commission also believed the implementation of  the chapters on regulating the powers governing the transitional  stage so that they can provide the greatest possible extent of  effectiveness -- a matter that was misunderstood and regarded by  some as an amendment to the constitution. In view of these  considerations, the commission believes that this action on its  part is in keeping with the constitution and not an amendment to  the constitution.    Concerning the economic, social, and security objectives,  the  commission believes, on the basis of a request by the sides to  the dialogue, that defining the economic, social, and security  objectives is a requirement imposed by the reality of the  transitional period.    The government, whose objective is to restore the country to  normal life and civilian peace, needs general directives from  the conference that would clarify to it the landmarks on the  road. This led the commission to devote a chapter to this  matter.    The question of enriching and amending the contents of the  chapters remains a valid point. This is a matter to be decided  by the sides to the dialogue in the end. The question of the  commitments was also raised by the commission, at the request of  the sides to the dialogue. Its aim is to make the sides to the  dialogue committed and obligated to one another and to public  opinion on the need to respect the essence of these undertakings.    The commission did not come up with these commitments on its  own accord, but it derived them particularly from the  constitution and from the laws enforced in the country. We have  made these clarifications in answer to some of the questions  raised by some sides to the dialogue and quoted by the the  press.    As the commission has promised you in the past, it is still  continuing its efforts with the aim of involving these  tendencies. Contacts were established during the past few  months. These contacts are still continuing. However, because  of the private and sensitive nature of these contacts, the  commission apologizes for not providing more details about the  issue. Whenever it realizes there is something worth informing  the public opinion of, it will not hesitate to inform you.    We are a few days away from the convening of the national  dialogue conference. To clear the air, restore tranquillity to  the people, and consequently make available the best conditions  for the success of the conference and achieve national accord,  the commission reports that it has received definite guarantees  from the authorities concerned that a first batch of people will  be released from [detention] centers in the south in the next  few days. Second, it has received definite guarantees that also  in the next few days house arrest orders will be lifted with  regard to all those to whom the measure applies. The commission  hopes that these measures will constitute a major turning point  in the path leading to the restoration of peace of mind and  gradual return to civil peace.    The issue of participating in the national conference has  been in the forefront of the national press for a few days.  [passage omitted]    On the eve of holding the national conference, the  commission  sees that this is the time for closing ranks and uniting. At  this time, those who love Algeria and those who want the reins  of power will come to light. This is a test period, and history  will certainly be the judge and arbitrator. Thank you.</p>

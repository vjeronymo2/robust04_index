			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> NO RELIEF SEEN FOR SMOG CONDITIONS  </P> <P> Weather forecasters said there is no relief in sight for the conditions that  have caused a heavy layer of smog over the San Joaquin Valley in recent days.  Warm, stagnant air over the valley the last week has combined with the  extensive use of fossil fuels to increase smog to the unhealthful level. "The  lack of wind causes an inversion layer that keeps everything packed in and  gives it no chance to escape," said Katie Bearden, county air quality planner.  "The air quality index levels have ranged between 90 and 100 for the past  week." Levels between 90 and 100 are considered unhealthful by county  officials.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: DnB returns to black at nine months DEN norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday returned its best result since it was formed out of a merger in 1990 between Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank. The nine-month net profit of NKr699m (Dollars 99.6m) compared with a NKr2.46bn loss in the same period last year. The group forecast a net profit of at least NKr1bn for the year. The turnround was due mainly to a fall in domestic interest rates which pushed up net interest income by NKr593m to NKr4.01bn due to a fall of NKr2.81bn to NKr7.77bn in interest expenses. Other operating income - gains on securities, foreign exchange and other financial instruments - doubled to NKr2.65bn as operating expenses were cut by NKr241m to NKr3.36bn. Mr Ole Lund, DnB's chairman, said the crisis had passed for the bank but that loan losses and the level of non-performing loans remained unacceptable. Losses on loans and guarantees fell by NKr754m to NKr2.53bn as the volume of non-performing loans declined by NKr500m to NKr11.6bn. In the third quarter, loan losses declined to NKr820m from NKr1.17bn in the second quarter. The bank aims to lift its core capital through a share issue by the second quarter of 1994 from a current NKr6.3bn, or 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets, to 5 per cent and then to 6 per cent. The company gave no details of the planned issue. The board intends to seek the authority to increase the bank's foreign ownership quota to a maximum 33.3 per cent under domestic regulations from a restricted level of 12.5 per cent. The state has injected about NKr1.68bn in fresh share capital in DnB in the last three years and holds a 69 per cent stake. The state has supplied NKr3.5bn in preference capital which could be converted to share capital, bringing its ownership in the bank to over 80 per cent. The state has written off an injection of preference capital of NKr1.25bn. Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, said the market valuation of the bank indicated the government would be able to recover all of the capital provided to DnB, 'and possibly more', depending on the bank's share price when the state offers its DnB shareholding to the public.</p>

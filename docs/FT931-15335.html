			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Schluter in fight to beat 'Tamilgate' DENMARK's minority government yesterday laid plans to prevent its possible downfall over the 'Tamilgate' affair, the scandal alleged to involve deliberate delays in granting entry visas to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister, held the first cabinet meeting of the new year to discuss the likely fall-out from a 6,000-page judicial report to be published tomorrow. The report investigates charges that Mr Schluter knowingly misled parliament over the visa restrictions which legal experts argue were introduced in 1987 in breach of Denmark's liberal immigration law. A damning report could seal the fate of Mr Schluter's conservative liberal coalition, which has held power for 10 years, and prompt an early general election, an embarrassment for Denmark, which holds the EC presidency. An election campaign could also complicate plans for a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty, which Mr Schluter said yesterday could be held on April 27. But Danish officials and politicians yesterday insisted a switch of government would not harm prospects for Maastricht since seven out of Denmark's eight parties now supported the treaty under a special deal agreed at the Edinburgh summit last month. Mr Helvig Pedersen, leader of the Radical Liberals, who hold the swing position in parliament, said one reason voters rejected Maastricht last June was their concern about losing Danish citizenship in a European political union. 'We are a homogeneous population with almost the same race and the same religion. We are not used to black people coming in,' he declared. In the past, most immigrants in Denmark came from Scandinavia, Germany and the UK, but the collapse of the Soviet empire and the Yugoslav civil war has raised migrant pressures on Denmark's 5m population. Last year, 15,000 asylum seekers came to Denmark, including 9,000 from Yugoslavia. As in Germany, Danish politicians are considering tighter laws on asylum seekers. Visas are required for people coming from Serbia, but broader controls are provoking opposition from the Liberal and Social Democratic parties. One option is to introduce 'temporary refugee status', offering shelter without incurring the obligation of taking in relatives of refugees. This would probably have prevented the 'Tamilgate' scandal which turns on whether the then justice minister broke the law by denying Tamil refugees the right to bring their close relatives to Denmark. Iceland voted narrowly yesterday to join the European Economic Area (EEA), closing the longest debate ever in the world's oldest parliament, Reuter reports from Reykjavik. After bitter arguments over sovereignty, the Althing accepted the agreement reached between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Voting was 33 in favour and 23 against with seven abstentions.</p>

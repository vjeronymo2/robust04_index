			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to qualifications for supervisory personnel, Rule 748 merely requires employees with delegated supervisory responsibility to be ``qualified,'' and persons responsible for any group of employees to ``reasonably discharge'' those duties. The proposed new language is intended to bridge this gap by expressly requiring supervisory personnel to qualify with the Exchange by successfully completing the appropriate examination, which will be indicated in the Exchange's memorandum to its membership. The Exchange notes that although options activity and personnel, including foreign currency options, are also subject to Rule 748, additional supervisory requirements for option accounts apply. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Phlx Rules 1024 and 1025. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission anticipates that the other appropriate SRO participants also will file the revised Specifications and Content Outline for approval by the Commission. The Phlx and these other SROs, may use the revised Examination, Specifications and Content Outline after the Commission has approved the proposed rule changes of the other appropriate SRO participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 6(c)(3)(B) provides that a national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange, and may require any person associated with a member, or any class of such persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with procedures so established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) and (c)(3)(B) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that revising the Series 8 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline should help to ensure that only those securities sales supervisors with a comprehensive knowledge of current Exchange rules, as well as an understanding of the Act, will be able to supervise general securities branch offices and registered representatives. The Commission believes that the revised areas covered by the Examination, Specifications and Content Outline are appropriate subject matters and include a sufficiently broad range of topics to ensure an appropriate level of expertise by supervisors. Additionally, the revised examination tests relevant subject matters in view of changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, products, and industry practices. By ensuring this requisite level of knowledge, the Phlx can remain confident that securities sales supervisors have demonstrated an acceptable level of securities knowledge to carry out their responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

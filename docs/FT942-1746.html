			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / SDP loves Scharping when he gets angry: Social Democrat leader revives party's hopes of beating Kohl Mr Rudolf Scharping, the embattled leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, lost his cool with his party comrades yesterday, and they loved it. In an angry and even passionate speech to the pre-election conference of the SPD, he demanded party discipline, denounced his detractors, and sought above all to galvanise the delegates out of a mood of mid-election blues. They responded with a resounding vote to back him as the party candidate to challenge Mr Helmut Kohl for the chancellor's office in next October's general elections - with 479 votes out of 502 in his favour, or more than 95 per cent. For a man who has made his name as super-cool and massively self-controlled, to the point of being dull and wooden, it was a remarkable performance. It was also an essential one for the party and its leader, to revive their hopes of defeating Mr Kohl. The venue was the giant indoor ice rink on the outskirts of Halle, in the east German state of Saxony-Anhalt. On Sunday, the local electors vote in another critical poll for a state parliament, which the SPD must hope to win to recover momentum in the current election marathon. Yesterday's conference came just 10 days after the party suffered a severe reverse in the European elections, losing five percentage points to score just 32 per cent - its worst result since direct European elections began in 1979. When Mr Scharping rose to speak yesterday, it was against a background of bitter recriminations in party ranks and widespread blame for his lacklustre leadership and failure to challenge Mr Kohl head-on for the chancellorship. 'He is absolutely colourless, much too bland. No wonder the PDS are stealing our votes,' said Mrs Edith Braun, mayor of Stendal in Saxony-Anhalt, before he started to speak. And yet he was preaching to the converted, for they were longing to hear good news. 'There is a majority for change in this country,' he said. 'A party which believes in itself, in itself and its goals, can win the confidence of Germany, and a majority.' He flatly rejected any suggestion the SPD should commit itself to a future coalition with the Greens, as its left wing wants to do. 'We are not for spelling out our alliances,' he said. 'We are involved in an election campaign, and every other party is our competitor. Anyone who suggests otherwise damages the chances of the SPD to win a majority.' He admitted he was accused of being too dry and emotionless, but he was capable of being angry, too. 'Anyone who wants to defeat me wants to defeat the SPD. That is what is behind it,' he said. The applause rolled in. He safely won a five-minute standing ovation. But much still depends on the outcome of Sunday's state poll. The SPD was still 1.5 points behind the CDU in the state, according to last week's local council elections. Mr Scharping needs a clear win to launch his campaign for the chancellor's office.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Inquiry urged into in-store credit LABOUR yesterday called for the Office of Fair Trading to set up an inquiry into in-store credit cards after a survey by party researchers found interest rates as high as 34.4 per cent. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the average interest rate was 27 per cent - more than four times higher than the base lending rate at most banks. Mr Cook said Marks and Spencer was the only store which had reduced interest charges in line with the fall of 9 percentage points in bank base rates since September last year. He added: 'Some stores must be making a bigger profit out of their excessive interest rates than out of selling their goods.' Ms Elizabeth Stanton, director of the Retail Credit Group, which represents most of the large stores, said interest charges reflected processing costs which were higher than those incurred by bank credit cards.</p>

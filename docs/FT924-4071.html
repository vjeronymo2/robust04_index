			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Yeltsin seeks to be economic supremo PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, has proposed a sweeping increase in his powers over the economy, virtually excluding the Russian parliament from any competence in the field. A resolution released yesterday by Mr Yeltsin's office to be put to the Congress of People's deputies later this week or next, and now the subject of furious behind the scenes debate and negotiation, would also give Mr Yeltsin the right to appoint the government and to make the final judgment on all legislation proposed by the parliament. The proposal, in effect, would usher in a system of presidential rule in most areas of government. However, the draft resolution is being treated as a bargaining ploy rather than a fixed intention, and is the subject of discussions between the parliamentary factions and between the president, the government and the powerful Civic Union group. Mr Vassily Lipitsky, leader of the Free Russia party within the Civic Union, said yesterday 'everything was open for negotiation' on the president's powers. A series of constitutional changes proposed by the deputies will be tabled today - one of which will give parliament the right to veto not just the prime minister, but all the deputy prime ministers and the main cabinet ministers as well. In a fierce argument about whether or not the debate on these constitutional points should be open or closed, liberal and hardline deputies resorted to exchanging blows and wrestling at the base of the podium last night. This scene involved Mr Vladimir Varov, a liberal deputy, trading ineffectual punches with Mr Ilya Constantinov, a leading nationalist. It is now clear that both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, have decided to show a determined face to a hostile Congress which so far hasfailed to display a united resolve in moving against them. A committee representing 600 international banks yesterday granted the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) another 90-day grace period on principal payments on its foreign bank debt.</p>

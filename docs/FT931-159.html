			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Personal View: Shock therapy disguised as science Reporting on the fate of the Yeltsin government has tended to propagate a fundamentally false dichotomy between the democratic reform-minded president and a conservative parliament, confusing the personal popularity of Boris Yeltsin with support for the crucial elements of his marketisation and privatisation programme. This obscures both the doubtful character of the Russian president's commitment to democracy (a plebiscite to allow strong-man rule, following a year of rule-by-decree, hardly suggests an affection for democratic process) and the catastrophic character of much of the economic policy pursued under his name. Insistent and generally effective propaganda that there is no third way denies that there is room for choice or any need for public discussion of transition policy. While it is true that economic policy details are largely entrusted to experts in normal economies, Russia is not a normal economy at the moment. The Yeltsin programme is constitutional-level social decision-making disguised as the application of neutral economic science. Public discussion of these policy choices is discouraged and arrangements for privatisation are made exclusively by presidential decree, without parliamentary influence. Under the banner of 'no more experiments', the wildest imaginable social surgery is being performed without informed consent or anaesthesia. The resulting 'shock therapy' has been an equal mixture of policy incompetence and uncontrolled corruption, causing immense structural damage of a particular type which has proved to be effectively irreversible in eastern Germany. Regardless of political motive, this tactic destroys the institutional bridges that could lead to a sustainable and socially palatable future performance. It is the failure of the Yeltsin government to deal with the core organisational and structural realities of economic transition that should earn it contempt. Popular support for such shock measures is virtually non-existent, and the socialist model of entitlement and citizens' economic rights is deeply rooted, despite popular hostility to the word 'socialism'. Foreign advisers and Yeltsin administration economists talk of capitalism and privatisation as indistinguishable means and ends; they present rapid privatisation as the only path to achievement of the 'optimality' intrinsic to market capitalism; and they presume broad support for their programme. Unfortunately for the proponents of the Yeltsin programme, the widespread assumption that the population enthusiastically awaits a recognisable form of market capitalism has been largely based on a simple mistranslation - privatisation being understood by ex-Soviet (and many eastern European) respondents to mean 'no longer totally owned by the national-level government'. The widespread citation in the Russian republic of the Kamaz truck factory as an example of successful privatisation is vivid evidence of this, since, as your reporting has made clear, it has literally no private owners. Privatisation with zero ownership by private persons should be called denationalisation or something else. Much reported popular support for privatisation (beyond small shops and restaurants) has been based on this semantic confusion. As a result the shock reform programmes which are regularly applauded in the west are only politically viable if the population is either bamboozled or given no role in deciding what will happen. When local opinion is able to have a significant effect on the privatisation process, reality moves far from the assumptions of the free-market economists who currently dominate national level decision-making. While even uninformed resistance to a manifestly catastrophic policy deserves some respect under these conditions, many of the positions of parliamentary conservatives, especially the Civic Union group headed by Arkady Volsky, represent a more coherent analysis of the realities of the current situation than can be found in the government programme. Civic Union correctly points out that without an integrated industrial transition strategy, International Monetary Fund-style macro-level adjustment policies create only ruins and not viable 'commercial' entities. The Yeltsin-Gaidar programme simply will not work as the basis for either a sustainable productive economy or a civilly peaceful society. Adoption of an unmodified market economy as the goal, and its achievement by shock methods, will require authoritarian methods, not just in the short run.

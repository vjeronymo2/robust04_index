			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosi Ahuatxil] </F>   [Text] Chiapas Governor (Elmar Checher) has requested the  protection of the powers of the union and the intervention of  the Mexican Army to settle once and for all the violence  prevailing in the State of Chiapas and, of course, to prevent  more bloodshed.    (Checher) has said that the government's concern has been to  make the civilian population a priority, and this is why the  national Army had not intervened earlier as the subversives were  occupying San Cristobal de las Casas.    He urged the people to act prudently to avoid being  controlled by panic and rumors and to facilitate the work of the  national Army to reinforce the protection and security of the  affected towns.    (Checher) has said that government efforts to establish a  dialogue have not been well received, and this shall be  construed as defiance and contempt toward the institutions;  this, he added, has changed his attitude on the actions that  should be adopted to immediately restore order, peace, and  tranquility, which have always prevailed in the State of Chiapas.    Thus, the governor has urged the population to remain calm.  He said that with the government's leadership, Chiapas society  will continue to improve its standard of living with strength,  firmness, and enthusiasm, and with the dignity of a people who  know where they are headed, because they have a well-defined  course and fate.    This was the message of encouragement issued by the governor  of Chiapas State to his people.</p>

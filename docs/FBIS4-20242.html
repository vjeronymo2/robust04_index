			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefan Galoppi: "Khol: `This is More Dangerous </F> Than Any Time Since 1945'"]    [Text] In Vienna, too, [South Tirol politician Pietro]  Mitolo's demand for a change in the South Tirol package has  given rise to excitement. Andreas Khol, the South Tirol expert  of the Austrian People's Party, said in an interview with KURIER:    -- about Mitolo's demand:    "He is not alone; his statements must be taken very  seriously. For the first time, the neofascists are in the  government in Rome. In this respect the situation is more  dangerous than any time since 1945."    -- about consequences for Austria:    "We must remain level-headed. We are willing to defend the  vital rights of the South Tiroleans, if they are threatened.  The conference in Vienna must send a clear signal to Italy that  we will prevent any restriction of autonomy. At the moment  everything is just a controversy among the parties, but if the  new Italian Government were to implement specific measures, the  Austrian Government would have to react."    -- about potential countermeasures:    "The ambassador could be recalled for consultations and the  Italian ambassador could be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to  receive a note of protest. One could call for negotiations.  Rome knows that any violation of the autonomy package will end  up before the International Court of Justice. It is the great  advantage of the package that it guarantees an international  instance."    -- about the effects on the border at the Brenner:    "The other side determines the tone. We are interested in  friendly relations. If Italy, however, were to question the  borders, it must accept that we will call the Brenner border  into question."</p>

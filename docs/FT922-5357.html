			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Cityair to begin services from London to Stockholm CITYAIR Scandinavia, the Swedish carrier, is to begin services today from London to Stockholm in what is claimed to be Europe's first jet link between city centres. Flights from London City airport to central Stockholm are due to begin after the decision by the Swedish authorities to reopen Bromma airport, which was closed 10 years ago because of aircraft noise. Aviation officials in Stockholm approved the route because the airline is using BAe 146 jets, which are quieter than most other passenger jets. CityAir was set up with the specific aim of forging the new link. Mr Malcolm Ginsberg, an official of London City airport, said: 'We believe this is the first city-centre-to-city-centre route in Europe.' Stockholm brings to six the number of destinations that can be reached from London City airport. The others are Paris, Brussels, Rotterdam, Zurich and Lugano.</p>

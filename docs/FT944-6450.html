			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (4): Quality is crucial - Professional and business services The quality of professional services is crucial to Bristol's success as a financial centre, and from this point of view it is well placed. Accountancy and law firms are well represented and the standard of service is high. 'The accountancy profession is very healthy in Bristol. The big six national firms are here as well as some smaller firms,' said Mr Ian Robinson, managing partner specialising in corporate finance at KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the largest accountancy practices in Bristol with 17 partners and 260 staff. 'This is a well-fished pond for the client and there is a very good choice of professional advice available,' he said. 'Regional law firms are winning business from London firms. In Bristol, we are competing on quality and winning on price to the extent that we are now a force to be reckoned with,' said Mr Jeremy Phillips, a partner at Eversheds Holt Phillips &amp; Buck, a recent addition in Bristol to the Eversheds national network of legal firms. Mr Phillips is optimistic about Bristol's future and the role the professions have to play in it. 'Bristol has a bright future as a financial centre. There are some very encouraging signs and that is one of the reasons why it was so important for us to have a representative in the city,' he said. After years of lobbing, Bristol has recently been granted its own mercantile court, one of only two outside London. The hope is that it will provide an opportunity for Bristol to make further headway against London. Osborne Clarke is probably the leading law firm in Bristol - and probably also in the whole of the south-west region. It has a staff of 300 in Bristol, including 28 partners, and acts for, among others, the local independent television franchise holders HTV, the local electricity company SWEB and local health authorities. Osborne Clarke is in a strong position and is expanding - it has an annual fee income of about Pounds 12.5m, almost double that in 1989. 'The message nationally is that we can offer clients superior access to our partners, that we have a very high degree of technical skill and we offer value for money,' said Mr Leslie Perrin, a partner specialising in litigation . Second to Osborne Clarke in the region is Burges Salmon, nationally renowned for its expertise in agricultural law. Bevan Ashford, Veale Wasborough and Wansbroughs Willey Hargrave are the other leading Bristol firms. Most of the present growth in the legal profession in Bristol is being seen in litigation and corporate finance. Accountancy is also focusing on corporate finance. 'We have seen a very substantial increase in corporate finance activity since the spring of 1993,' said Mr Andrew Hillman, a partner specialising in corporate finance at Touche Ross in Bristol, which merged with BDO Binder Hamlyn in October. 'Whereas in 1992 we were doing only two or three transactions, last year we undertook 13 corporate finance transactions,' said Mr Hillman. 'Audit and tax are also growing, partly because of relationships made through the corporate finance deals but also because of the economic recovery.' He said: 'For three to four years our clients have kept their heads down but now increasingly they are out looking for business.' 'Business is coming to Bristol,' said Mr Hamilton of KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Incoming firms can get a whole range of professional services including accountancy, legal advice, venture capital and stockbroking. All of it is here and it is in good shape.' He estimates that this year his firm will be doing 50 per cent more business in transactions terms than in 1993. Solomon Hare is smaller than the 'big six' accountancy firms but is nevertheless one of the largest of the independent practices in the West Country. Its client base, says Mr Nicholas Reeve, a partner at the firm, has tended to be smaller public limited companies with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 50m 'which are relatively plentiful in this region.' He said: 'On several of our deals this year we have managed to persuade clients that the team should be Bristol-based and so we have attracted work to the other Bristol professions - lawyers, brokers and merchant banks.' If there is a weakness in the financial support services in Bristol, it is in stockbroking and merchant banking, which are relatively poorly represented. 'There is only one local stockbroker to speak of catering for corporate clients and there is only one merchant bank,' said Mr Hillman. 'That is a real weakness in the south-west. On the other hand, there is a high level of actuarial support.' Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, has an office in Bristol with a staff of seven covering the south-west and Wales area. On the stockbroking side, there are nine firms operating in the Bristol area. Probably two of the largest firms are Albert E. Sharpe and Laws &amp; Co. Albert E. Sharpe, the Birmingham-based broker, took over the private client operations of Stock Beech in Bristol following the demise of British and Commonwealth, its parent. Laws &amp; Co., part of Allied Provincial, has a staff of 24 dealing mostly with private clients in and around the Bristol area. Rowan Dartington, of which Singer &amp; Friedlander is the largest shareholder, deals more for institutional corporate clients - the split is 70 per cent institutional and 30 per cent private clients, according to Mr Barrie Newton, managing director. He says the firm, which has a staff of 15 in Bristol, has 20 corporate brokerships and is dealing for 80 mainstream blue chip institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies. Despite their general healthy state, there is a wide consensus among those in the industry that the professions in Bristol face important challenges over the coming years. 'Historically, many large companies had their headquarters in Bristol and as a result used the city's financial services a great deal,' said Mr Robinson. 'But many of the decision-makers have now disappeared and been replaced by subsidiaries and their headquarters in London use London services. In the last 12 months there has been the beginning of some return of locally-based companies and it is our job to convince them to use our services here in the city.' The professions' success will depend critically on their continuing ability to offer high quality services at competitive prices and with a high degree of accessibility compared to their London counterparts. Mr Martin Warren, a partner at law firm Eversheds Holt Phillips &amp; Buck, said: 'The rise of the regional firms will continue to depend on being competitive, providing quality services in specialist subjects and offering accessibility. Clients want accessibility, despite the age of the fax and the phone, and however big the London firms are they cannot do that in the regions.'</p>

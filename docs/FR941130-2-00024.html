			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. CNG Transmission Corporation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP95&hyph;81&hyph;000]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on November 16, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;81&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon certain pipeline facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNGT proposes to (a) abandon in place one old deteriorated pipeline, and (b) abandon by sale to CNG Producing Company (CNG Producing, an affiliate) three short lines, a segment of another line, and a small leased field compressor. CNGT states that the facilities would be sold at net book value, $168,542. CNGT encloses letters from the only affected producers (other than CNG Producing), Shawmut Development Company (Shawmut), and Fairman Drilling Company, consenting to the proposal. CNGT explains that the facilities are no longer necessary to its operations because CNGT is not a merchant under its Order 636 reorganization. CNGT anticipates that the facilities would be operated as part of a non-jurisdictional gathering system, once acquired by CNG Producing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, CNGT proposes to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Abandon in place 2.71 miles of 8&hyph;inch pipeline (Line H&hyph;176) in McElroy District in Tyler County, West Virginia, due to deterioration. CNGT states that the line was built in 1925 and certificated on May 12, 1942, in Docket No. G&hyph;290 (3 FPC 994 (1943)). CNGT further states that the sole customer of Hope Gas Inc., which was located on the line, has been relocated to another line, and the line temporarily has been closed off pending action on CNGT's abandonment proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Abandon three lines (LN 2270, LN 2272, LN 2397) and part of line LN 2246, by sale to CNG Producing. CNGT states that the lines are located in the East Cherry Tree area of Clearfield and Cambria Counties, Pennsylvania, and total 3.22 miles of 2, 3, and 6&hyph;inch pipeline. CNGT further states that the lines currently are operated at a pressure of approximately 150 psig. It is stated that the lines were constructed under CNGT's blanket certificate as reported in the annual report of blanket certificated projects for 1984 and the budget application report for 1982 filed by CNGT's predecessor in Docket No. CP80&hyph;293&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Abandon, by sale to CNG Producing, a 340&hyph;horsepower leased field compressor and 63 feet of related 2&hyph;inch field pipe at Bells Landing in Ferguson Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. CNGT states that the compressor enables gas from a CNG Producing well to enter a gathering system jointly owned by Shawmut with CNG Producing, and operated by Shawmut. It is further stated that the compressor was built in 1988 and reported in the annual report filed in November 1989 in Docket No. CP82&hyph;537&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. NorAm Gas Transmission Company <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP95&hyph;82&hyph;000]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on November 16, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed, in Docket No. CP95&hyph;82&hyph;000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's Regulations for an order permitting and approving the abandonment and removal of a 300 h.p. skid-mounted compressor unit which will result in the down sizing of its Calhoun Compressor Station in Quachita Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGT states that it received authorization in Docket No. CP87&hyph;458&hyph;000 to construct and operate the Calhoun Compressor Station, consisting of three skid-mounted compressor units with a total of 980 horsepower (h.p.) on NGT's HT&hyph;1, Section 34, Township 18N, Range 1E, Quachita Parish, Louisiana. NGT relates that the compressor station was installed to receive gas supply from the Calhoun Field central point for the transmission of such gas through Line HT&hyph;1 into its mainline system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGT maintains that due to declining production from the Calhoun Field, it is no longer necessary to operate the 300 h.p. unit to receive gas from this field. Additionally, NGT says the 300 h.p. unit has been inactive for some time and would require repair before becoming operational. NGT asserts that it will continue to operate the two 340 h.p. units and no production will be interrupted or abandoned. NGT further states that the removal would only be above ground facilities within an existing fenced compressor station yard and no soil would be disturbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

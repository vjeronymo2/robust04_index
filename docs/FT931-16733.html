			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Bosnia peace talks break off: Conference to resume after factions have considered proposals PEACE TALKS between the three warring factions in Bosnia broke up in disagreement in Geneva last night, but will resume next Sunday after the participants have consulted political and military colleagues on constitutional and ceasefire proposals tabled by international mediators. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of what have been described as 'the last chance' negotiations, said they would travel to Yugoslavia in the next few days to pursue their quest for a peace settlement of the nine-month-old conflict which has cost tens of thousands of lives. Mr Vance said he would be seeing Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in Belgrade. The first face-to-face talks between the Bosnian Moslem, Serb and Croatian leaders since the start of the conflict began last Saturday in a surprisingly positive atmosphere. But they adjourned last night without any sign that deep differences between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs could be resolved quickly. After announcing that the co-chairmen had submitted two linked constitutional and cessation of hostilities draft agreements to the participants for signature, Mr Vance conceded that 'much remains to be done'. 'We had hoped that all three would sign the documents we had prepared, but the feeling among some of the participants was that they should go home and consult', Mr Vance said. In the event, only one of the three representatives, Mr Mate Boban, leader of the Bosnian Croat community, signed both documents. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, said that while he approved proposals to create a sovereign, independent and decentralised Bosnia-Hercegovina, he could not accept the map of the 10 provinces into which the country would be divided under the Vance-Owen plan. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said he needed time to consult with colleagues at home. In practice, the territorial disagreements are less extensive than at first appeared. Bosnian Serbs and Croats have already indicated they could agree to an adjustment of disputed boundaries of some of the three provinces that have been allocated to each ethnic group. Apart from territorial questions, the main disagreements between the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs is over the constitutional status of the future Serbian provinces of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The co-chairmen's proposals make clear that only the new state of Bosnia-Hercegovina will have international legal status. But Mr Karadzic is demanding the creation of an independent state within Bosnia-Hercegovina, a solution incompatible with the Vance-Owen plan. Royal Marines, due in Norway this month for an annual exercise, are being placed on standby for Bosnia in a move described by UK defence officials as 'prudent contingency planning'.

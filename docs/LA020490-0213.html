			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION, ETHICS TURN SENATE RACE TOPSY-TURVY;  </P> <P> ELECTION: THERE ARE NO CLEAR FAVORITES IN THE BATTLE FOR THE 31ST DISTRICT.  INCUMBENT LAWMAKERS SEEKING THE VACANT SEAT ARE BEING STUNG BY CHALLENGERS.  </P> <P> Conventional political wisdom said that Assemblyman Frank Hill, who had climbed  the ranks and gained the right endorsements, was best positioned as the heir  apparent to the 31st State Senate District seat left vacant by William  Campbell's resignation in December.  </P> <P> The prospects brightened for Hill (R-Whittier), the best-financed and  best-known candidate in the district, when Gov. George Deukmejian in late  December scheduled a Feb. 6 special election to fill Campbell's seat, making  the campaign one of the shortest ever in California.  </P> <P> But the campaign for the heavily Republican seat -- which straddles the  boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties -- is being watched closely in  Sacramento because, in the politics of 1990, conventional wisdom is getting a  thorough review.  </P> <P> In this campaign, two independently wealthy Republican candidates are expected  to spend almost a combined $1 million of their own money to pound two other  Republican candidates, Hill and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach),  with some of the most thorny issues of the year to confront state-level  officeholders.  </P> <P> The two Republican challengers are Ron Isles, a Brea city councilman and former  owner of an electronics manufacturing company, and Gary Miller, a Diamond Bar  city councilman and owner of a land-banking business.  </P> <P> Both have battered Hill and Ferguson on an issue that might be used against  many state legislators this year -- ethics. Isles and Miller have campaigned  hard on an anti-incumbency theme, telling voters that Sacramento is so plagued  with corruption that they should elect an entirely new Legislature.  </P> <P> Polls have shown that the public is receptive to such a message in the wake of  a series of corruption scandals, including an FBI investigation in Sacramento  that resulted in the conviction Friday of state Sen. Joseph Montoya  (D-Whittier).  </P> <P> Hill has been most heavily attacked because he is still a target in that same  FBI investigation. But Ferguson complained that "they tar the brush over and it  gets on my name too."  </P> <P> "You could have a guy with impeccable credentials, and if he's in politics  today, it's to these two guys' (Isles' and Miller's) advantage that they can  say these guys are all bad," Ferguson said.  </P> <P> Another issue that could play a major role in the outcome Tuesday is abortion.  </P> <P> The pro-choice movement, which was a major factor in two recent state-level  upset victories, has been working on behalf of Isles, the only pro-choice  Republican in the race. Pro-choice groups from both Orange and Los Angeles  counties endorsed Isles, believing that a Democratic victory is unlikely.  </P> <P> As a result, Isles is using the same formula that Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter  (R-San Marcos) employed in her victory last summer by appealing to Democratic  voters to cross party lines and cast their votes on the abortion issue.  </P> <P> "In a low turnout race, a candidate who is pro-abortion and Republican . . .  can pick up enough Democratic votes on that single issue . . . to tip the  scales," Ferguson said. "The potential is strong" for a repeat of the Hunter  race, he added.  </P> <P> Nancy Skinner, a Republican leader with Pro-Choice Orange County, said: "I see  no reason why this should not be a major factor. The people who are working  with me are people who have never been involved in politics before. It's that  kind of energy I'm feeling all through Orange County."  </P> <P> Because the candidates are relying almost entirely on direct mail, the campaign  has been invisible to many, making it hard to predict the outcome. Most  believe, however, there is no clear front-runner.  </P> <P> Sources said a recent poll by state Republicans found the four GOP candidates  bunched in a tight pack, with Isles and Miller holding a slight edge over  Ferguson and Hill. However, the poll also showed a large bloc of undecided  voters.  </P> <P> Ferguson is counting on Republican-rich South Orange County to make the  difference for him. And Hill's edge is in his Los Angeles-based Assembly  district, where he won reelection in 1988 with 63% of the vote even after the  FBI's investigation was announced.  </P> <P> If none of the candidates receives more than 50% of the vote on Tuesday -- as  experts predict -- a runoff is scheduled April 10 between the top vote-getters  in each party.  </P> <P> The 31st Senate District stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the north  to Laguna Beach in the south.  </P> <P> There are three Democrats in the race and one American Independent Party  candidate.  </P> <P> Democrat Janice Graham, who ran unsuccessfully for the 31st Senate seat against  Campbell in 1988, is hoping to reach the runoff and defeat the Republican  candidate on either abortion or ethics.  </P> <P> Graham, a former schoolteacher from Laguna Hills who is pro-choice, said she  would use the abortion issue against any of the candidates with the exception  of Isles. However, on Friday, she held a press conference to blast Isles for  purportedly unethical behavior in his business dealings.  </P> <P> The Senate race has been dominated by mudslinging in the mail, at press  conferences and in an angry exchange at a recent candidates' forum. Hill and  Ferguson were originally the main targets. But in a possible indication of  their unexpected strength, the attacks have turned to Isles and Miller.  </P> <P> Isles and Miller have been criticized by their foes for their campaign-reform  proposals. Both are financing their own campaigns and don't have to solicit  contributions.  </P> <P> And while Isles has blasted his opponents for unethical behavior, he was  criticized this week for allegedly abusing a tax loophole. Isles is involved in  a court battle with the Internal Revenue Service about how much he should pay  in taxes for a company that he located in the Virgin Islands.  </P> <P> Isles' critics have charged that the location of the company was intended to  avoid taxes. He said, however, the dispute is over different interpretations of  the tax law.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, opponents of Miller accused him this week of misconduct related to  his land-banking business.  </P> <P> Miller was accused of profiting on a land deal as a result of his negotiations  as a city official for a new road in Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> Miller said, however, that he told officials about the property he owned before  he was appointed negotiator. He said the property has since been sold and that  he did not profit from the decision.  </P> <P> Miller attributed the charges to his emergence as a threat to Hill and  Ferguson. He said that they and other legislators should fear his campaign's  theme of running against the government in Sacramento.  </P> <P> "I shined the light on something here," he said. "It's going to be a tough year  in Sacramento for incumbents. If I win this thing, they better doggone start  shaking."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 31ST STATE SENATE DISTRICT  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS  </P> <P> Gil Ferguson  </P> <P> Home: Laguna Beach  </P> <P> Age: 66  </P> <P> Occupation: Assemblyman  </P> <P> Background: Former Marine Corps officer, serving 26 years; owner of Corporate  Communications, a Newport Beach public relations agency he founded in 1972.  </P> <P> Issues: Campaigned on his record as a military officer, businessman, family man  and legislator.  </P> <P> Contributions: $60,969 (includes $17,000 loan to himself).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ron Isles  </P> <P> Home: Brea  </P> <P> Age: 51  </P> <P> Occupation: Brea city councilman  </P> <P> Background: Lawyer since 1986.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Nigeria arms sales to continue Britain, Germany and other European Union countries are expected to maintain existing arms sales contracts to Nigeria despite last week's assumption of power by General Sani Abacha, the country's defence minister. European foreign ministers are preparing a joint response to the forced resignation of Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's civilian head of government, but are understood to have ruled out a ban on current arms supplies. At least two European countries have substantial arms contracts with Nigeria. Britain is supplying 150 Vickers tanks under a deal negotiated two years ago. The order is thought to be critical to Vickers' Newcastle factory, where 750 jobs would be lost if the plant closed. The Nigerian Air Force is understood to have ordered Air Beetle training aircraft made by the German manufacturer Dornier, cancelling the provision in the 1993 budget to buy 36 Slingsby Firefly aircraft at a cost of N500m (based on exchange rate of N20 to the dollar). The British-built Fireflys were the only defence item specified in the 1993 spending plan. A local press report said the new order is for 100 German aircraft (64 more than budgeted) and would mean one trainer for each trainee pilot in the air force. In a confidential report to the Shonekan administration, delivered at the end of August, a committee appointed to monitor state spending warned that the country's defence ministry had run up 'huge debts' which the government would be hard pressed to meet. Gen Abacha' action was strongly condemned by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary. He deplored 'the decision of the Nigerian military to reverse the democratic process in Nigeria and to dissolve all democratically elected institutions. . . Mr Hurd went on: 'Military dictatorship cannot solve Nigeria's problems. This is a serious step backwards, not only for Nigeria but for Africa as a whole.' A package of limited international sanctions was introduced earlier this year, after President Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June presidential poll and extended military rule beyond the promised August handover date. He subsequently stood down after extending Mr Shonekan's tenure as head of an interim government, which promised fresh election in February and a handover in March. In response, Britain suspended visas to military members of the government and ended military training programmes. In an address to the nation shortly after taking office, Gen Abacha promised a constitutional conference in the coming months but has not given a new date for civilian rule. Nigerians returned to work on Monday after the main trade union federation reached an agreement with the government on domestic fuel prices and called off a week-long strike.</p>

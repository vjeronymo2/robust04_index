			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels deputy chief and adviser quit Resort Hotels was plunged further into difficulties yesterday when both its deputy chairman and its financial adviser resigned. The two announcements followed Thursday's news that the company would be unable to prepare accounts for the year to end-April in time for the annual meeting on December 31. The resignation of Mr Tim Barker, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, and a non-executive director of Resort since February, was announced yesterday morning. The company said he had left as a result of a disagreement over the future direction of the company. Mr Barker confirmed that there had been a difference of opinion over Resort's future, but declined to comment further. Then, late in the afternoon, Barclays de Zoete Wedd resigned as financial adviser, and its broking arm de Zoete &amp; Bevan quit as stockbroker to the group. BZW refused any further comment. Resort's shares were suspended in July at 45p, when it said it was calling in independent accountants to write a report following concern over 'a number of financing and reporting issues.' At that time Mr Robert Feld, managing director, was stripped of his executive duties. He has remained a director, although the company has started a High Court action to remove him, which Mr Feld is resisting. Mr Feld said yesterday that Mr Barker had been instrumental in his removal from executive duties. He said the rest of the board now met as a committee to exclude him from meetings. He had called two board meetings himself, neither of which Mr Barker attended, he said. The board now consists of two executive directors and a non-executive chairman, aside from Mr Feld, who co-founded the group and speaks for about 8 per cent of the equity. There was speculation last night that Resort could, like Queens Moat Houses, be having problems with too much debt and falling asset values.</p>

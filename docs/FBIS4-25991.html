			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Li  Ruihuan said here today that there is much to be done in  implementing the principle of "one country, two systems" and  maintaining Hong Kong's smooth transition, stability and  prosperity.    As in other activities, he said, "strategically we should  despise them, but tactically we should take them all seriously.    "So we should not only have determination and confidence,  but  also the capabilities and methods in handling these things," he  added.    Li, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the  Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, made these remarks at a meeting with a  delegation from the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong  Kong led by its president Herbert Liang.    He said the principle of "one country, two systems" has been  created by Deng Xiaoping, which conforms to the interests of the  Chinese people including the Hong Kong compatriots and is of  important and far-reaching significance.    "We will unswervingly implement this principle," he added.    Li urged the Hong Kong compatriots to unite and make more  contributions to the process of realizing that Hong Kong is  governed by Hong Kong citizens themselves.    During the meeting, Li congratulated the Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on the 60th anniversary  of its founding.    He noted a great deal of work that the association has done  in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development and  supporting the mainland's reform and opening to the outside  world and its modernizations.    He expressed the hope that the association will continue its  efforts to contribute to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.</p>

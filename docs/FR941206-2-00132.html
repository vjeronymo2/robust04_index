Cooper also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 29, 1994, and an opportunity was afforded for comment (59 FR 38659). This notice grants the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 109 specifies that each tire be labeled with ``[o]ne size designation, except that equivalent inch and metric size designations may be used.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the periods of the 8th week through the 18th week of 1994, Cooper produced 8,097 175/70R13, Cooper Sport 1000 Metric GT, polyester/steel belted, tubeless, black sidewall, radial tires with incorrect size designations. These tires were incorrectly stamped near the beads with a designation of 175/75R13 in characters 0.156 inch in height, whereas they should have been stamped 175/70R13. However, the tires are correctly labeled with 175/70R13, in characters 0.400 inch high, on the mid-sidewall area. Cooper has recovered 1,281 of these tires to correct them prior to sale. At the time it petitioned the agency, 6,816 remained unaccounted for.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooper supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following, and also provided mold stamp drawings which show the two areas on each side of the subject tires where the size is molded into them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tires in question are incorrectly stamped on both sides, in the area of the sidewall closest to the bead, with the designation 175/75R13. The tires are correctly stamped on both sides in the mid-sidewall of the tire with the correct designation 175/70R13 in characters 0.400 inch in height. In addition, each tire contains an adhesive paper tread label which is attached to the tread area of each tire indicating the correct size of 175/70R13.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mislabel on each tire is incorrect only as to the aspect ratio (or series), that is 75, of the tire. The cross section width of 175, the designation of radial, and the rim diameter of 13 are all correct. Also the maximum load and inflation stampings on both sidewalls of each tire are correct for a 175/70R13 tire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, a 175/75R13 [tire] has never been produced by Cooper, has never been standardized by the Tire and Rim Association, and to the best of [Cooper's] knowledge, has never been produced by anyone, therefore, the possibility of misapplication does not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tires produced from this mold during the aforementioned time period comply with all other requirements of 49 CFR 571.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mislabeled aspect ratio does not affect the ability of the tire to be identified in the event of a recall. It has no effect upon the performance of the tire. The correct aspect ratio appears elsewhere on the tire, on both sides, and in larger characters. This minimizes the presence of the noncompliance. Moreover, there has never been a 175/7513 tire standardized by the Tire and Rim Association, nor has Cooper produced one. Therefore, there is no possibility of misapplication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Cooper has met its burden of persuasion and that the noncompliance with FMVSS No. 109 herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, the Administrator exempts Cooper from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30120. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50, 501.8). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29884 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

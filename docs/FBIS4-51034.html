			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Navy ship,  while enforcing the international sanctions against Haiti, fired  warning shots Monday [23 May] night at a ship off Haiti, the  Defense Department said here today.    The U.S. frigate Antrin encountered a Panamanian-flagged  ship, called "Leonese," off the north coast of Haiti and ordered  the ship to lay to, but it did not, Pentagon Spokesman Dennis  Boxx said at a news briefing.    The U.S. Navy ship fired 10 50-caliber warning shots across  the bow of the Leonese, and the ship did lay to, said Boxx.    Boxx also said another incident occurred on Sunday. A  Bahamian- registered seagoing tug, called the sea search,  ignored instructions from a U.S. Navy ship to stop and warning  shots were fired across the bow.    Two additional U.S. Navy ships have been ordered to help  enforce the sanctions against Haiti after President Bill Clinton  signed on May 21 an executive order participating in the tougher  sanctions authorized by the United Nations.    That brings ships involved in the sanctions enforcement to a  total of 8 U.S. Navy ships and two other ships, one Argentine  and one Canadian frigate, Boxx said.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Float puts miracle in new orbit - Alice Rawsthorn considers BSkyB's plans for reducing its debt There can be few people involved with business start-ups who do not dream of the day when their company will go public. But for British Sky Broadcasting's management the prospect must at times have seemed little short of miraculous. The short, but turbulent story of BSkyB has been one of the most exciting media sagas of the early 1990s. The company has, under the aegis of Mr Sam Chisholm, its abrasive chief executive, staged a stunning recovery since the traumas of its launch in 1990 following a shotgun marriage between the struggling Sky satellite television venture, and its ailing rival, BSB. This week's announcement that BSkyB was considering plans to float on the London and New York stock markets before Christmas, set the seal on its resurgence. The flotation should also yield significant financial and structural benefits to the company and its investors. 'BSkyB is very different today than it was a few years ago,' said Mr Richard Brooke, its finance director. 'But some aspects of our financial structure and ownership are more applicable to the old BSkyB than the successful company we've become. The flotation will change that.' One of the main incentives in going public is financial. It hopes to raise up to Pounds 1bn by selling new shares, representing 20 per cent of the enlarged equity, from the flotation, to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers. All the money will then be used to reduce its Pounds 1.7bn debt. None of BSkyB's four shareholders, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Granada, the UK leisure group, Chargeurs, the French textile company, and Pearson, the UK media concern that owns the Financial Times, will sell shares. Indeed Chargeurs intends to buy more to prevent the dilution of its stake. All four will benefit from the debt reduction as the proceeds will be used to repay most of the Pounds 1.2bn tranche of debt that they provided or guaranteed. This strategy makes sense for the company in that the shareholder debt, which was taken on during its early crises, is more expensive to service than the Pounds 500m external loans. The interest bill for shareholder debt came to Pounds 84m in the last financial year to June, so BSkyB should save as much as Pounds 70m in annual interest payments. News Corporation, as the biggest investor with 50 per cent, is responsible for the largest chunk of the shareholder debt. It should be repaid Pounds 500m of the Pounds 550m loans it advanced to BSkyB after the flotation. Analysts suspect Mr Murdoch will channel the cash into Star, his Asian television network. Chargeurs, Granada and Pearson will also be repaid a large proportion of the combined Pounds 250m they lent and be absolved of most of the Pounds 350m debt they guaranteed. The three companies provided equal shares of the debt and guarantees. BSkyB will then decide how to deal with the remaining Pounds 200m of shareholder debt and obligations. Its advisers say that the loans will either remain intact or be transferred into external debt. The reduction in the company's interest bill should have a dramatic effect on its financial performance. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, media analyst at Morgan Stanley Securities, calculated that BSkyB could make pre-tax profits of Pounds 210m in the year to June, against her previous forecast of Pounds 158m. She has pencilled in profits of Pounds 350m for the next financial year. Meanwhile the publicly-quoted BSkyB will have the flexibility to tap the market for more capital if it requires additional funding to launch ambitious ventures such as a pay-per-view digital satellite television service. Funds may also be needed to meet tougher competition for programming from the increasingly consolidated ITV companies and its emerging rivals in cable television. The flotation also offers an opportunity for the company to streamline the complex ownership structure whereby its four shareholders have unusually strong controls over various aspects of the company, notably investment. As for the issue itself, observers seem confident that it will be a success. 'It's a great corporate story,' said Ms Winnington-Ingram. 'And this is the perfect time to tell it.'</p>

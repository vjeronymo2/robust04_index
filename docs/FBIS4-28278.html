			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Kim Yong-sam by Yi Song-chun, </F> HANGUK ILBO editor-in-chief, at Chongwadae, presidential  offices, on 8 June on the 40th anniversary of HANGUK ILBO's  founding]    [Excerpt] [Yi Song-chun] What do you think are the  biggest achievements from your visits to Russia and Uzbekistan?    [Kim Yong-sam] The ROK and Russia have established  constructive and reciprocal relations, and the ROK and  Uzbekistan have built a basis for stepping up substantive  cooperative relations. It is important, in particular, that the  ROK and Russia have stepped up a cooperation system to resolve  the North Korean nuclear issue, confirmed that the North  Korean-Russia Mutual Assistance Treaty would be nullified, and  that Russia promised it would stop supplying weapons and parts  to North Korea. I think another big achievement is that I have  inspired a sense of pride in ethnic Koreans in Russia and  Uzbekistan and that those two countries promised that they would  not discriminate against those ethnic Koreans.    [Yi] Separately from sanctions by the UN Security Council,  the ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries have  reportedly been discussing independent sanctions against North  Korea with regard to the North Korean nuclear issue. Is it true?    [Kim] The UN Security Council adopting a resolution on  sanctions against North Korea is the most important task at the  moment. I do not think it is appropriate to mention any other  sanctions other than those by the UN Security Council at a time  when multilateral consultations have been under way to impose  sanctions through the UN Security Council.    [Yi] Have you examined ways to induce North Korea to come to  dialogue to give it an opportunity to prove the transparency of  its nuclear activities?    [Kim] North Korea unilaterally continued to replace fuel  rods and, thus, destroyed a basis for dialogue. Our  government's clear position is that we cannot turn a blind eye  to one or even half of a nuclear weapon. North Korea does not  seem to realize that if it continues to develop nuclear weapons,  it will lead to its own destruction. The prevailing  international atmosphere is that North Korea must no longer be  left intact and that no group that commits such acts must exist.  I will discuss sanctions with U.S. President Clinton over the  telephone. Therefore, if North Korea again wants dialogue, it  must come up with a method that can facilitate such dialogue.  We think the international community must take appropriate  measures regarding North Korea's unilateral action. I do not  think it is time for the ROK and the United States to discuss  ways to induce North Korea into dialogue.    [Yi] If the intensity of UN sanctions increases and if North  Korea tries to find a way out of this, will the tensions  intensify?    [Kim] North Korea has threatened us by saying sanctions  would lead to war. Therefore, the possibility is that tensions  would intensify as the intensity of sanctions increases.  However, we will not tolerate any reckless action by North  Korea. Unlike in the past, we have sufficient strength to deter  war and are following North Korean movements around the clock.  We have on hand countermeasures against any unforeseen  accidents and a few scenarios.    [Yi] Do you have a way in mind to persuade China to join in  UN Security Council sanctions?    [Kim] It will be difficult for China to veto a UN Security  Council resolution on sanctions. We have discussed this matter  with China, as the United States has done. China profoundly  perceives the seriousness of the situation. China has not said  it would veto a resolution. China has a sense of responsibility  because the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement  at China's request, even though the ROK and the United States at  first pursued to pass a resolution. China knows very well that  North Korea has not shown any sincerity, even though the  countries concerned have made efforts for a peaceful solution.  I think, therefore, China will eventually join in the  international efforts.    [Yi] Would you consider invalidating the joint declaration  on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if North Korea's  nuclear transparency cannot be verified in the end?    [Kim] The joint declaration on the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula deserves respect in terms of establishing the  order for nuclear-free peace. Our government's will to comply  with the joint declaration on the denuclearization remains firm.  However, I am afraid that if North Korea does not stop  developing nuclear weapons, our government's will to comply with  the joint declaration on the denuclearization will be seriously  challenged.    [Yi] Many people observe that reunification by absorption  will be inevitable. Are you willing to modify the reunification  program in a more practical way?    [Kim] It is the government's firm stance that reunification  should be achieved step-by-step through negotiations between the  South and the North. In this way, reunification can be achieved  with minimum aftereffects and in the meantime a bright future  for the nation will be guaranteed. Thus, at the moment, I do  not feel the need to modify the reunification program.    [Yi] Some people point out that the ROK people are relaxed  about security. What is your plan for consolidating security  and redressing military appearance, which has been downgraded?    [Kim] Our security is only possible when all our people bear  a solid sense of security and when a strong Army is maintained  to safeguard peace. However, I am concerned that some people  tend to be too optimistic about the situation on the Korean  peninsula where North Korea is still a threat. Common sense  cannot be used when judging North Korea. Our people are too  ignorant of this. They think North Korea is not a match for us,  but you never know when and what they will do. We can prevent  misjudgment about North Korea when all the people bear in mind  that a cornered North Korea might be provoked anytime and be  fully prepared for it. I have endeavored through reform to form  a clean Army free from political influence. I am sure military  morale is up rather than down because military reform has a pure  intention and was desired by the majority of the soldiers.  There had been temporary pain in the beginning, but now the  Army is respected and loved by the people. I recently visited  frontline units and witnessed that many officers and men are  silently working to fulfill their duties. The ROK people should  recognize and respect the utmost devotion of the officers and  men in defending the country under difficult conditions.    [Yi] What is your plan in the humanitarian aspect regarding  North Korean fugitives in China?    [Kim] Our government is deeply concerned about and seeking  resolutions for the safety and freedom of North Koreans who  escaped to China. Please understand that it is difficult to  reveal the details. [passage omitted]</p>

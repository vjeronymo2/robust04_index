TK-143 cells infected with the derived  recombinant plasmids in the presence of infections  TK[.sup]+[/] vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) yielded  recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed both large surface  protein and HBcAg/HBeAg. The large surface protein was not  secreted but two polypeptides between 36-45 kilo-daltons were  revealed in SDS-PAGE following immunoprecipitation by anti-HBs.  HBcAg was not secreted either, it remained in the cells. But  HBeAg could be secreted into the medium, and was present in much  higher amount that HBcAg. Rabbits vaccinated with the  recombinant viruses made antibodies that recognized HBsAg and  HBcAg epitopes. The additional immunogenicity provided by  expression of large protein HBcAg/HBeAg may be advantageous for  the development of an HBV vaccine.</p>

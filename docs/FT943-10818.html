			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / SFO casts BCCI net more widely: Arrest warrant names second Gokal brother The Serious Fraud Office has named a second Gokal brother in connection with investigations it is pursuing into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The SFO confirmed yesterday that a warrant for the arrest of Mr Abbas Gokal issued two weeks ago also names Mr Mustafa Gokal and a number of other individuals linked to BCCI. The two brothers, with a third, Mr Murtaza Gokal, were controllers of the Gulf shipping group, which was the largest debtor to BCCI before it was closed by banking regulators around the world in July 1991. The liquidators to BCCI at accountants Touche Ross began legal action in London last November against the three Gokal brothers for several hundred million dollars in efforts to recover money for the bank's creditors. They are pursuing the Gokals for damages for conspiracy and unlawful interference with the plaintiff's business, deceit and procuring breach of contract, and for damages and compensation for fraud. The SFO warrant against Mr Abbas Gokal was issued after word reached British investigators that he was travelling through Germany to north America. It charges him with conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to falsely account in relation to BCCI. Mr Gokal was arrested in Frankfurt as a result of the warrant, and is currently detained there while the police negotiate his possible extradition to London. His extradition could trigger one of the most significant trials so far in relation to the alleged frauds at BCCI. It is believed he was travelling to hold discussions at his suggestion with the US Department of Justice and the District Attorney's Office of New York, which had granted him temporary protection from arrest for any offences committed before his arrival in the US. Separately, it emerged yesterday that a Paris-based bank had launched a bankruptcy petition against Mr Abbas Gokal for unpaid debts of Dollars 22m. Alef Bank SA filed the petition in the High Court in London. It names Mr Abbas Kassimali Gokal, formerly of Ascot, Berkshire, whose address is listed as Karachi, Pakistan. It is believed that the liquidators to BCCI have been made aware of the petition and may attempt to block it to prevent Mr Gokal escaping their own pursuit of substantial claims against him.</p>

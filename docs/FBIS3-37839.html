			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Parliament Deputy Sergey Stankevich by </F> presenter Jon Snow from the "Channel 4 News" broadcast;  Stankevich in Moscow, Snow in London -- live]    [Text] [Snow] Well we're joined now from Moscow by Sergey  Stankevich, who is a member of the Russian parliament and former  adviser to President Yeltsin. First, Sergey Stankevich, on the  spying matter, from a Russian perspective, how seriously would  you assess the strain between America and Russia on this issue?    [Stankevich] I think that mutual spying is normal, routine  practice, not only for totalitarian but also for democratic  states. I am absolutely sure that we have enough American spies  now in Moscow, maybe now even more than before, and I see no  reason to over-dramatize this particular case. I think that if  we use this case as a ground for revising previous long-term  agreements and relations between Russia and United States, it  would bring quite serious damage, not only for our bilateral  relations but for international situations also. Strategic  partnership is such a thing that should be preserved by all  countries. This case should not be over-dramatized.    [Snow] So you don't think there is any danger that the  Americans may move back to a rather sort of Cold War stance?    [Stankevich] I hope that the reception, that the estimation  of this case will be more moderate than maybe first reaction.    [Snow] On what's been going on in the Russian parliament  today, a very important session because it's giving us a clue as  to what sort of an institution you are now sitting in, this  pardoning of the people who staged that hold-out in the White  House last year, does this mean we're going to see Khasbulatov  and Rutskoy back on the streets?    [Stankevich] I think yes, they will be freed in several days  as far as I can understand the result of the current decision,  and I think it was quite reasonable decision. One should take  into account that Russian society is deeply splitted,  politically, ideologically and so on. We adopted new  constitution and now it's necessary to give Russian people a  chance for national reconciliation. It is not a one sided  decision just to give pardon to these people, Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov and others, it is a package of decisions and the  appeal for national reconciliation is the essence of this  package...    [Snow, interrupting] ...not good news though, for the man  you  used to be so close to -- Boris Yeltsin?    [Stankevich] I think that Boris Yeltsin also in his  tomorrow's speech, tomorrow he will address to the Russian  parliament, also will take some measures to guarantee that  national reconciliation can be possible. So I think that it  will be good initiative for him and he can use this chance to  make his part of the way [as heard].    [Snow] Now you're a reformist, a moderate. What's it like  sitting in there with Mr. Zhirinovskiy on the far right? How far  is he able to play fast and loose with what's going on in the  parliament?    [Stankevich] Mr. Zhirinovskiy is quite exotic maybe  demonstration of some serious political affects for Russia.  Russia should have maybe more national interest oriented  foreign policy. It should be strengthened as a state and it is  up to President Yeltsin, and up to Russian democrats to show  their ability in strengthening Russian state.    [Snow] That does suggest you see this institution as  something that may well be able to take in hand the nationalist  aspirations that this exotic Mr Zhirinovskiy has conjured?    [Stankevich] Yes, I think that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is a very  serious signal and Russian democrats including Russian  president, should take this lesson seriously and should hear the  voice of Russia.    [Snow] Mr. Stankevich, thank you very much indeed for  joining  us.</p>

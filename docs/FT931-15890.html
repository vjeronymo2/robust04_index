			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Cannoned into a divine vocation IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A SAINT by WW Meissner Yale Pounds 20, 480 pages UNPREDICTABILITY is the only common characteristic of divine callings. Martin Luther's less friendly biographers report that he received his summons while satisfying nature's needs, 'as if,' one wrote, 'elimination prompted illumination'. For Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, the vehicle of divine vocation was much more dramatic. It was a cannonball. Ignatius was a nobleman's son, born in the Spanish province of Guipuzcoa in 1491 and brought up as a military courtier. He enjoyed the work, and took a leading part in several battles, including the defence of Pamplona against the French in 1521, at the height of which Ignatius's legs were swept from under him by a cannonball. A French surgeon set his right leg badly, leaving it inches shorter than his left leg, and deformed by a protruding bone. Ignatius was only five feet tall; but he was vain, so he limped home to Loyola, and had the bony protrusion sawn off and his leg rebroken and reset. Throughout these agonies he uttered no sound. It was during his recovery that Ignatius found vocation. The only two books available in the castle were a bible and a book of saints. They inspired him. He decided to reject his old life of gambling, drinking, women and war, and to embrace holiness. WW Meissner, a Jesuit and a Professor of Psychoanalysis at Boston College, has attempted to write a psychoanalytical study of Ignatius. We are taken through his conversion, his period of self-discipline at Manresa where he wrote the celebrated 'Spiritual Exercises', his journey to the Holy Land and his studies in Paris, all leading to the foundation of the Society of Jesus in 1539. The remainder of Ignatius's life, involving his generalship of the Jesuits, is somewhat briefly discussed. Meissner's aim is to identify the psychological factors which made him a saint. This, if done well, would have made an intriguing and worthwhile study. Alas, Meissner does it as badly as possible. Indeed this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Why review it, then? Because it is published by a highly reputable body, Yale University Press, which should know much better, and because there is something profoundly questionable about a book masquerading as an objective study which is in fact a romantic hagiography tricked out in psychoanalytic terminology. There can be no objection to a Jesuit writing about the founder of his Order, providing that the result is not merely a disguised excuse for yet another apologia. There are plenty of these in propagandistic Lives of the Saints manufactured for the faithful. But this is just what Meissner gives us, performing wondrous contortions to reconcile his devotion to Ignatius with Freudian theory. Take, for example, Meissner on Ignatius's sexuality, since sexuality is a major Freudian preoccupation. Ignatius was wet-nursed in a blacksmith's cottage on his father's estate. Meissner writes: 'The conditions regarding the separation of the sexes, nudity, sleeping arrangements, and the dangers of primal scene exposure would have put little Inigo in a state of high sexual stimulation, intensifying his oedipal desires and the corresponding level of libidinal conflict, oedipal guilt, and castration anxiety'. ('Primal scene exposure' is gobbledygook for 'seeing sex happen'.) We are then told that women found the adult Ignatius magnetically attractive, that they gathered round him wherever he went, drawn by his 'powerful masculine style', and that 'the apostolic endeavours closest to his heart were the care of poor women and prostitutes'. His 'spiritual conversations' with the 'pious ladies of Manresa' attracted scandal, and Meissner says this might have prompted Ignatius to leave the city. Later, when the Inquisition tried Ignatius for heresy, there were suggestions of impropriety with the veiled young girls 'constantly coming and going' to be instructed by him. Meissner psychoanalyses this data, and startlingly concludes that it was not sexual pressures Ignatius felt, but the need of a mother figure. There is no suggestion of struggle to conquer libido: 'his dealings with women,' Meissner says, 'were always marked by concern, respectful warmth, tact, circumspection'. This may be true, but it is a tame result after so much infantile exposure to 'primal scenes' and so many girls responding to such powerful masculinity. The question is: could a Jesuit writing about Ignatius have concluded otherwise? The book is hugely repetitive and its naivety beggars description. It reads like a children's book, coyness and whimsy squirting out at every opportunity: 'So Inigo found his first benefactress. On his first day in the hospice of Santa Lucia, the good widow sent him a boiled fowl for supper.' Biography is interspersed with equally awful theory: 'From a psychoanalytic perspective' we are told in the section on mysticism, 'psychic process and psychodynamic influence are present in both primary and secondary manifestations of the mystical state'. The least of this sentence's crimes, as you see when you translate it into English, is that it is tautologous. Yale and Meissner deserve a stinging rebuke for publishing this book in this state.</p>

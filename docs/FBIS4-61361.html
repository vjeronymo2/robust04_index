			<p>BFN     [Text] St. Petersburg, April 25, RIA -- Mikhail Gorbachev  is "extremely critical" of the NATO Partnership for Peace  programme, he said to the press on his two-day business visit to  this city.    "European political processes are too dynamic and  sophisticated to be understood and influenced even with UN help.  It's good that the Duma is debating the situation round the  NATO programme. Russia can't afford to stay aloof to Poland's  and other neighbour countries' NATO membership."    The ex-president of the ex-USSR doesn't think the European  destiny can be determined with the help of a former cold war  tool -- or Europe will be in for a new split.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): BES - The basics You can invest up to Pounds 40,000 in business expansion scheme companies in each tax year. Tax relief is available at your top marginal rate of income tax, provided you hold the investment for at least five years. Thus, a top-rate taxpayer will receive a rebate worth 40 per cent of his original investment. BES companies can either invest in trading companies (for which there is a total limit for subscriptions of Pounds 750,000) or in assured tenancy rental accommodation (up to a maximum of Pounds 5m). Some 'buy-back' companies acquire property on behalf of a second party (usually a housing association or university) with a covenant from the second party to buy back the property at a fixed price after five years. Some of these companies also arrange financing for the 'buy-back,' which should further reduce risk. Exit at the end of five years can otherwise often present a problem, but capital gains tax is not payable.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Notman: "What Does the River Carry?"] </F>   [Text] For many Novosibirsk residents the latest holiday  ended with an alarming report on Russian television that our  city is threatened by contamination and that some sort of yellow  foam with a high concentration of arsenic and other hazardous  substances is approaching the Ob Sea by water.    As it turned out, this report was correct to a certain  extent, but at the same time somewhat exaggerated. It is true  that an observer at the monitoring center in Shabalino (which is  between Kamen-on-Ob and Barnaul) noticed yellow foam on the  water surface and collected a sample. Analysis showed a markedly  reduced content of oxygen in the water. With respect to some  hazardous substances, on the other hand, the maximum allowable  concentration [MAC] was considerably exceeded. In keeping with  procedures, the observer notified control services of this. This  is the way the information reached Moscow, where it was somewhat  dramatized.    After the first analysis, samples were taken daily. They  were  sent to relevant services in both Barnaul and Novosibirsk. This  is when the strangest signals began to arrive. One service (SES)  discovered an increased content of arsenic in the yellow foam.  First at the maximum allowable level, then exceeding this  maximum 1.5-fold, and then on 25 April--14-fold. With respect to  petroleum products content, the MAC exceeded the norm  16-19-fold. At the same time, other services did not detect  anything in the samples. Nothing alarming, that is. What  happened is anybody's guess: different samples; someone trying  to paint over the problem; or imperfect measuring equipment. In  any case, the Altay Kray SES [Environmental Service  Station]--and very often water contamination comes to our oblast  precisely from there, from Altay--refuted its initial data. The  Altay Committee for Environmental Protection came to the  conclusion that mineral fertilizer had been washed into the  water. And spring melting of snow brought more muck into the  river.    Currently samples are taken daily. This will continue until  the end of May. So far nothing alarming has been detected in the  water reservoir. So we can stop worrying. Unfortunately, not for  long. We are being helped by the spring thaw. There is a lot of  water, which reduces the concentration of hazardous substances.  In other words, once again we are being helped by accident  rather than by people. There is potential trouble, however.  Purification facilities in Barnaul have been idled today for  several days for repairs. During these days it is permitted to  dump 5,000 cubic meters of sewage a day into the river without  treatment. After 25 May this untreated water will definitely  approach Novosibirsk. What will be the concentrations then and  what else will the mass media be reporting?</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Doubt on microchip plant for Saxony Advanced Micro Devices, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, said yesterday it had yet to reach a firm decision on whether to build a Dollars 1bn plant in the eastern German state of Saxony. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's federal economics minister, had claimed the decision was almost certain. 'We have held preliminary discussions with Saxony officials,' said an official at company headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. AMD, which last year had revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, started negotiations with Saxony six months ago. It is 'actively investigating potential sites to build a new plant devoted to microprocessors,' the official said. A spokeswoman at Saxony's economics ministry said she expected AMD to start building the plant in Dresden early next year, while Mr Rexrodt had issued a statement that the plant, which would produce logic chips, would create more than 1,400 jobs. AMD will next month open a new memory chip plant in Japan, jointly owned with Fujitsu. It is also building a Dollars 1bn microprocessor manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas, where production is expected to begin in mid-1995. 'Given the current growth in the microprocessor market, there is a real possibility that we will need another large facility,' AMD said. However, it is unlikely that construction will begin before late 1995 at the earliest. There was speculation last night that Mr Rexrodt and the Saxony government were trying to push AMD into committing itself publicly to the investment before state elections due on September 11. Such a commitment would be a welcome fillip to Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the premier of Saxony. His Christian Democratic Union government - the only CDU administration in eastern Germany to be elected in the last elections with an outright majority - faces a challenge from the opposition Social Democratic party and the Greens. According to the federal economics ministry, AMD's proposed investment follows an earlier decision by Siemens to invest DM2.7bn in the same city in a new research and production complex specialising in memory chips. 'This decision shows Saxony, and particularly Dresden, is set to become the new centre of high technology in Germany,' an official at the state's economics ministry said. Saxony was one of the main centres of German industry before the second world war, and the former East German communist regime continued this tradition by locating its electronic industry in and around Dresden.</p>

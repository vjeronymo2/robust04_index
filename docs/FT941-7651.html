			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Steps to slow China growth are ruled out Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, yesterday appeared to rule out immediate measures to calm the Chinese economy which grew by 13 per cent last year and which shows little sign of slowing. Mr Zhu, who was speaking before leaving on a nine-day visit to Japan, voiced concern about the possibility of social unrest should the government crack down too hard on economic activity. 'China is aiming for fast, healthy and sustained economic growth and if the rate of growth was forced down artificially, it would cause social instability,' he said. The Chinese official, who found himself at loggerheads with powerful regional officials last year over a 16-point austerity programme, repeated an official growth forecast for this year of 9 per cent. But western economists doubt China will be abe to bring its rate of real GNP growth down much below 10 per cent in 1994 without risking a 'hard landing'. This is something Mr Zhu has said he wishes to avoid at all costs. Mr Zhu predicted that China's rate of growth would be maintained at about 9 per cent for the next few years. He described prices in the first weeks of this year as 'stable.'' Inflation has emerged as the biggest challenge to the authorities. Retail prices (excluding services) rose by more than 15 per cent in December compared with a year earlier. The cost of living for 35 major cities increased by 24 per cent in the 12 months to December, with the cost of services increasing sharply - by 38 per cent compared with the rate of 16.5 per cent for consumer goods. Officials of the State Statistical Bureau were quoted yesterday as saying that 'inflation. . . still posed a threat to the sustainable and healthy growth of the national economy.' Many state enterprises are close to bankruptcy, starved of funds and beyond producing marketable products. Mr Zhu's lengthy visit to Japan indicates a warming of the business relationship. Japanese companies had been wary of investing in China, but sentiment appears to be changing. Two-way trade reached Dollars 37.8bn (Pounds 21bn), with Chinese exports to Japan totalling Dollars 20.5bn and imports Dollars 17.2bn.</p>

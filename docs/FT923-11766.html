			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Fiscal struggle THE GOVERNMENT is desperately trying to regain the control over public finances that it lost in the run-up to the election. That is the most important point to draw from yesterday's announcement, which confirms last year's target for the planning total for 1993-94; sets nominal increases of only around 3 per cent for the following two years; imposes a new top-down planning procedure; and establishes a committee chaired by the chancellor to oversee the whole process of expenditure control. Confirmation of last autumn's target of Pounds 244.5bn for the planning total for 1993-94 would, if successfully carried through in the forthcoming expenditure round, at least end the period when successive upward adjustments had become normal. But without an early and strong economic recovery, it will not be enough. Nor, given the 4 per cent real increase between 1992-93 and 1993-94 already built in to the figures, is it quite as tough as it looks. The new cabinet committee will have much hard bargaining this year, but that will only be the start of its problems. Meeting the targets for 1994-95 and 1995-96 will be still more difficult. Last year's spending round was a soggy, election-buying affair, which allowed an increase of Pounds 5.6bn in the government's planning total for 1992-93 and of Pounds 13bn in that for 1993-94. These upward adjustments were only partly cyclical. Taking a longer perspective, the latest OECD Economic Outlook argues that there was a structural deterioration of almost 2 percentage points of GDP in the UK's overall fiscal position between 1989 and 1992. This would have had to stop, in any case. But with the public sector borrowing requirement likely to exceed 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year and to be still larger in 1993-94, it has had to stop sooner rather than later. The most important problem is the lack of economic growth. Only four months ago the chancellor forecast real GDP growth at 2 per cent between 1991-92 and 1992-93 and 3 1/4 per cent in the following year. Now there may be no growth this financial year and little next year too. GDP could thus be considerably smaller than the chancellor hoped, which would make earlier spending plans correspondingly untenable. In the long run public spending cannot be allowed to rise faster than GDP. This is a government which has its back against the fiscal wall and knows it. It is starting to fight back. But the battle will be very hard and everything still depends on that elusive recovery.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Treasury to face critics from industry Senior Treasury officials are to meet 70 industrialists next month to answer charges that they are too secretive and have become divorced from the business community. The private meeting has been arranged for the Treasury by the Whitehall and Industry Group, a little-known charity funded by the government and 64 big companies. It comes as part of a broad effort by the Treasury to seek better contacts with business people after criticism that it had made mistakes in economic policy partly because it has not known enough about the world outside Whitehall. On the agenda will be ways of ensuring Treasury officials understand how economic policies affect companies - for example in investment allowances and efforts to attract private capital into government programmes. Senior Treasury officials think this process can be achieved by more swapping of staff between Whitehall and business. The gathering at the Institution of Civil Engineers in London is being billed as a no-holds-barred session in which participants will be asked to speak bluntly. Among those attending are Mr Robert Armitage, finance director of the UK division of US drugs company Merck, Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, Mr Keith Todd, ICL finance director, and Mr Clive Hopkins, finance director of Shell UK. Other companies being represented include Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher, IBM, British Petroleum, Royal Bank of Scotland, British Aerospace, and Texaco. The Treasury case will be put by a quartet of top officials led by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary. Mr Christopher Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, who has attacked the Treasury as being cut off from industry, will give an address aimed at pulling together criticism of the department. Others to speak include Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee. The other Treasury officials who have agreed to face a possibly hostile audience include chief economic adviser Mr Alan Budd, and Mr Andrew Turnbull and Mr Steve Robson, in charge of public spending and industry respectively.</p>

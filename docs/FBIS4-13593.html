			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] To quench its thirst for killing, the savage  militia of Golboddin-Dostam-Karmal today once again launched a  rocket attack on residential areas and public installations in  Kabul. A responsible security source reported to BIA that by  firing 25 rockets into the city, the criminal and sold-out  militia caused the martyrdom of one person and the wounding of  nine of our oppressed and innocent compatriots. Similarly, as a  result of the landing of today's rockets four residences were  destroyed. [passage omitted]</p>

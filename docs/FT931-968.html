			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Low first pay-out for Italian bank ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group in terms of assets, closed its first year as a listed company with a L300-a-share dividend, appreciably below some forecasts made at the time of the flotation. Although the bank had indicated a dividend of up to L400 a share, some analysts had set their sights even higher. The eventual pay-out reflects the effects of unexpected tax increases, which cut earnings by around L35bn (Dollars 22m) at parent bank level, and heavier loan loss provisions owing to the recession. The impact of tax and credit problems stood out at group level, where net profits after minority interests fell by about 7 per cent to L502bn from a pro forma L553bn in 1991. Provisions amounted to L647bn, while write-downs on securities and shareholdings reached L224bn. Overall group pre-tax income rose 8 per cent to L1,232bn. Net profits for the parent bank increased by 2 per cent to L390bn, while pre-tax earnings jumped by 17 per cent to L779bn, in spite of loan loss provisions of L520bn and write downs on securities of L120bn. Group deposits climbed by 12.4 per cent to L170,500bn, while direct lending to clients went up to L89,755bn. The effect of recession was made clear in the rise in non-performing loans to 3.38 per cent of the total loan book from 2.84 per cent in 1991. Credito Italiano, one of the prime candidates on Italy's privatisation list, suffered a steep fall in net profits to L208bn from L289bn in 1991. Group net earnings dropped to L202.2bn from L297bn. The falls, reflecting sharply lower earnings at most Italian banks last year, were particularly marked in the case of Credito Italiano, the country's sixth-biggest financial institution, on account of its prominent role in securities. Rising interest rates in the later months of 1992 triggered steep falls in government bond prices, leading to expectations - now realised - of heavy write-downs on many banks' securities portfolios. Credito Italiano wrote down L243bn on its securities holdings - the largest figure reported by any bank in the current results season. However, the dividend is being maintained at L85 for ordinary shares and L100 for savings stock. The bank escaped relatively lightly on loan losses, which have risen sharply elsewhere. The proportion of non-performing loans in Credito Italiano's total portfolio rose to 2.01 per cent from 1.99 per cent in 1991. Gross operating profits, which rose 16.5 per cent to L1,123bn, were helped by a 19.1 per cent surge in the bank's interest margin to L2,388bn.</p>

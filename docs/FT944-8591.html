			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / All cordial at UK-French summit Leaders of France and the UK yesterday capped a harmonious summit by declaring their joint intent to persist with peacekeeping in Bosnia and by acting to co-ordinate their air forces in future peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. They took their expected decision to set up a small planning unit of five officers from each air force with the long name of the 'Franco-British European Air Group'. Based at the Royal Air Force base at High Wycombe under the initial command of a French air force general, the unit's task will be to draw up requirements and procedures for joint peacekeeping actions. But UK prime minister John Major also went further than the French had hoped by agreeing to set up with France a study of possible UK participation in the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), an ambitious project for a new European military transport aircraft on which Paris sets great store. Mr Major separated this move from the immediate issue concerning that 'part of our (Lockheed) C130 fleet which is very near the end of its operational life'. The option here was to either refurbish these aircraft or to buy some of the newer C130J models, he said. He said the FLA study with France was 'without commitment' to Britain's eventual decision on its longer-term military transport plans. But 'we need to see if our economic and military interests can coincide, and if they do we can proceed together' with other Europeans. Deliberately focusing more on their mutual defence and foreign policy interests and less on more divisive internal European Union issues, UK and French leaders found it easy to reach agreement. But President Francois Mitterrand went out of his way to say that, measured by past Franco-British summits, yesterday's had taken place 'in the best climate for several years'. At a concluding press conference, Mr Mitterrand and Mr Major both seemed to see the European Union's planned constitutional conference in 1996 in remarkably similar terms. The French president said the 1996 conference 'should concentrate on securing the achievements of Maastricht, before passing on to fresh territory', while Mr Major said he did not believe it would be 'a great leap forward'. Mr Mitterrand leaves office next May and he sees Maastricht as part of his legacy. Clearly anxious not to rouse Eurosceptics' susceptibilities at home, Mr Major stressed that yesterday's new defence moves were 'not some startling innovation, but a natural development of longstanding co-operation' between France and the UK. However, the High Wycombe command is the first joint military organisation between the two countries. It may one day extended to 'our European partners', UK and French defence ministers said in a communique yesterday.</p>

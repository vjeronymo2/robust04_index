			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday [3 June], in Kishinev [Chisinau], the  Moldovan and Turkish presidents Mircea Snegur and Suleyman  Demirel signed a treaty on friendship and cooperation between  the two states. The presidents have also signed eight  agreements on technical and scientific cooperation, on  international automobile and air traffic, and so on.    One more document was added as a result of the negotiations.  In accordance with this document Turkey will grant a  $35-million credit to Moldova, which will be used to develop  Moldova's southern regions densely populated with the Gagauzs,  the Turkic-speaking population.    Snegur characterised Moldovan-Turkish relations as  excellent.  "Our cooperation is developing dynamically in many spheres," he  declared to Interfax.    For his part, Demirel expressed satisfaction that "those  contradictions which there were between the Gagauz population  and the republic's central authorities are being solved by  granting special juridical status to the areas densely populated  by the Gagauzs." He also reported that a conference of the  heads of the Black Sea region states is to be held in the near  term in Istanbul. Moldova has been invited to attend it.    The same day a festive ceremony devoted to the opening of  the  Embassy of the Turkish republic in Moldova was staged in  Kishinev.    Suleyman Demirel is to depart home in the evening.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: Analysis the hard way - A company that offers information with less technology JUST OVER two years ago, Nick Hill faced returning to a precarious life as a freelance journalist. He and several colleagues had been made redundant from writing economic commentaries and market reports for an editorial service closed down by publisher Robert Maxwell. After the service collapsed, Hill carried out a post-mortem on its failure. One of the biggest problems had been the cost of distribution of a service transmitted to customers by computer via telephone lines. Much to his surprise, many of the clients Hill spoke to, including leading City of London institution Merrill Lynch and Unigate, the dairy products group, said they would rather have received their daily package printed on paper anyway. When four of them said they would like to receive a new 'hard copy' service, Hill and his former colleagues formed Hilfe - the German for help - to provide it. 'The fact that customers wanted their editorial reports on paper or on computer disk meant that straight away we could establish an alternative service from a much lower cost base,' says 32-year old Hill, Hilfe's managing director. He invested his Pounds 5,000 redundancy while three colleagues gave their writing services on a part-time basis in return for an equity stake in the new venture. A friend who ran a motor cycle messenger group agreed to deliver Hilfe's material and provided office space in the City - albeit underneath a recording studio - in return for an equity share in Hilfe. Hilfe borrowed two computers and an archaic printer - which took 1 1/2 hours a day to hand feed the editorial reports. Hilfe bought office equipment cheaply from a government surplus supplier and started with no outstanding debts. The economic climate also favoured Hilfe. Companies such as Citicorp and Credit Suisse led a shakeout of research departments throughout the City - the area targeted by Hilfe for new business. Hilfe offers investment risk analysis. The daily package of editorial briefings covers a wide area. it might include a preview of a G7 conference or coverage of the Taiwanese insurance industry. There are also regular items such as stock market reports and economy profiles. All briefings include comment, analysis and as Hill says, 'taking a line' on an issue. 'If we were a news service then no-one would buy us. We are selling our opinions and we live or fall by them.' Sales were slow at first: 'We had no reputation and companies we approached were saying that they would try us if we were around in a year's time,' says Hill, a refrain familiar to many new businesses. With only two full-time staff, the first year was one of long hours and hard work. However, by the end of it, the client list boasted 18 names and turnover reached Pounds 75,000. Then a minor disaster struck. The office was burgled and the computers stolen. The next day's reports were bashed out on a reserve machine and delivered on time, with Hill sleeping in the office that night. Hilfe recovered its losses, moving to more secure premises shortly afterwards. Hilfe also benefited from the events of 1989, particularly the reforms in eastern Europe, which increased demand for independent expert analysis. 'It was important for us to demonstrate that we could respond to these changes,' says Hill. The start-up costs of an editorial service on eastern Europe meant that it had to pay for itself in three months. Peter Maxey, a former ambassador to East Berlin, and another analyst were brought in. The service has been taken by over half of Hilfe's 35 clients and pushed the company's annualised turnover to Pounds 175,000. Hill sees the next 12 months as a period of consolidating and expanding the service to respond to clients' individual or collective requirements - whether they be additional analysis of the Finnish timber industry or a more detailed account of the oil markets. The company has sacrificed faster growth, refusing to borrow money or bring in outside investors, but it has managed to keep costs to a minimum, and is ready to move into profit and grow.

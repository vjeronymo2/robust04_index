			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Azerbaijan sends in new troops THE Azerbaijan government has sent troops and tanks to the front-line town of Agdam on the border of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in a desperate bid to stop the advancing Karabakh Armenian forces from taking it. The regional centre's fall would be a severe blow for the new government of Mr Gaidar Aliyev, the former Communist party first secretary who is now acting head of state. The Azeri defence ministry said yesterday that as many as 2,500 soldiers had been sent to the front on Sunday and Monday with about 20 tanks. It claimed some villages around the town, captured and burnt by the Armenian forces over the weekend, had been re-taken. However, eyewitnesses in Agdam said there were fewer than 2,500 fresh troops and there was no indication the siege of the town had been lifted. Unconfirmed reports also pointed to the presence in Agdam of Mr Suret Husseinov, the new Azeri prime minister and former commander of the Azeri counter-offensive in Karabakh last year. It was his threat last month to march on the capital, Baku, with soldiers loyal to him that caused the downfall of President Abulfaz Elchibey and the return to power of Mr Aliyev  -as well as his own elevation.</p>

The minister was replying to a question as to how he viewed  the U.S. future role in the region just before the visit of  former U.S. President George Bush who is scheduled to arrive in  Bangkok tonight as the guest of business tycoon Charoen Pokphand.    Prasong was quoted by the local newspaper "THE BANGKOK POST"  as saying that there would be no official discussion between  Bush and himself on regional security, but adding he would brief  the former President on the situation if asked to do so.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 2 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Military authorities  have said there were no "bombings" in the confrontation with the  armed group in the Mexican southeastern state of Chiapas, and  they rejected media reports alluding to such alleged actions.    The National Defense Secretariat stated: "The reported  `bombings' never took place, and the proof of this is that there  is not any evidence of such actions" in the conflict area. The  Secretariat pointed out that the effects of aerial bombs cannot  be hidden because of the degree of destruction they would cause  on any type of terrain, "particularly in populated areas."    Military authorities assigned to the conflict zone have  taken  journalists to places where, according to media reports, the Air  Force had "bombed the civilian population," and the journalists  were able to confirm that nothing of that sort had occurred.    In a communique, the Secretariat discussed the actions  conducted by the Air Force during the confrontation with the  armed group. All military actions were suspended entirely on 12  January following the cease-fire ordered by President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari.    The Secretariat indicated that the Air Force's planes and  helicopters carried out reconnaissance and meteorological  flights, transportation of personnel, and shipment of provisions  to soldiers and civilians, in addition to rescue and evacuation  operations in isolated areas. The Secretariat also noted that  the Air Force provided "direct support to soldiers in  unpopulated areas by opening machine-gun fire and by firing  rockets in efforts to combat pincer and ambush operations" set  up by the armed group against military personnel.    Military authorities indicated that by reiterating these  statements issued on 11 January, they seek to reject any  references to presumed "bombings" and "heavy activity by  military airplanes."    The communique stated that: "With these statements, the  National Defense Secretariat rejects categorically and strongly  the occurrence of any `bombings' in the Chiapas conflict,  attacks in populated areas or attempts to damage personal  property."    The situation in the conflict area has become relatively  calm  and favorable because a direct dialogue appears "imminent"  between Chiapas Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the  so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army, which began the  conflict on 1 January.</p>

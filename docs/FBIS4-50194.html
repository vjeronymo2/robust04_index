			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Ethnic minorities in  China's southern and southwestern provinces who once often  fought over agriculture resources are now working together to  get rich.    About two dozen of China's 55 ethnic minorities live in  remote mountain villages in provincial borders between Guangxi,  Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces, like the Zhuang,  Yao, Miao, Dong, Buyi, Shuijia, Maonan, Mulam and Yi.    With China becoming market-oriented, these neighboring  ethnic  people have been convinced that they should work together to  lift themselves from poverty instead of wrangling with each  other over ownership of land, water conservancy and forests.    Encouraged by governments at various levels, ethnic  autonomous prefectures in these provinces have formed economic  cooperation councils to coordinate economic development.    As the neighboring ethnic prefectures belong to different  provinces, local highways often did not connect in the past.  Since 1985, however, 35 such roads have been built to connect  the bordering areas and 45 scheduled passenger and cargo bus  routes between different minority areas added.    Meanwhile, some 180 markets have been established in 17  neighboring counties.    The effort has brought prosperity for the ethnic villages as  over 30,000 local ethnic people have turned to business in  provincial borders in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region alone.    In the face of rapid economic growth, their cooperation has  now expanded from agricultural production, to industry, science  and technology, commerce, transportation and material supply.</p>

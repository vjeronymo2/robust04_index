			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Private housing starts down 10% THE number of new homes started by private housebuilders last year fell to the lowest level for more than a decade, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment Department. Private housing starts fell by a further 10 per cent last year to just under 121,000, compared with a peak of 221,000 private starts in 1988. The latest decline in private sector starts was partially offset last year by an increase in new construction by housing associations, which the government expects to take over from local authorities the responsibility for providing rented accommodation for poor and disadvantaged people. The department says the number of new housing starts made by associations jumped by 50 per cent last year from 21,600 to 32,600 - more than double the number of starts by associations in 1988. Over the same period the number of starts made by local authorities fell by more than three-quarters from 16,300 to 2,700 last year. Overall the number of private and public sector housing starts declined from 160,500 in 1991 to 156,300 last year. The latest figures from the department have been published as signs emerged that house sales have started to recover after the low reached last autumn during the sterling crisis. Building societies, estate agents and housebuilders have reported a marked improvement in mortgage applications from offers to buy and enquiries from potential purchasers since just before Christmas, although this has still to flow through in increased construction of homes. The department said private sector starts during the final three months of last year were 5 per cent lower than during the previous three months.</p>

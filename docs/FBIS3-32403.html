It compared the results  with those from previous polls, in order to analyze the people's  changing views on these matters.    For this purpose, it contracted the services of the Gallup  Colombia firm, which collected the information between 3 and 13  December 1993: in other words, during the 10 days following  Pablo Escobar's death. That event had unquestionable  implications for the general attitude and mind-set of  Colombians. The poll was taken at 100 sampling points in Bogota,  Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, among 1,000 men and women over  age 18, belonging to the three social classes.    On this occasion, SEMANA attempted to make use of the  information accumulated during the six years of polling, to  compare the changes in opinion.  <H5>  Outstanding Person of the Year </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who do you think is the outstanding Colombian personality of 1993? (figures  |  |are percentages)                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pablo Escobar                         |25                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cesar Gaviria Trujillo                |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carlos Vives [popular singer]         |8                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gustavo de Greiff                     |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Faustino Asprilla [soccer player]     |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Noemi Sanin                           |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Andres Pastrana                       |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carlos Valderrama [soccer player]     |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ernesto Samper                        |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Antonio Navarro                       |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gabriel Garcia                        |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Francisco Maturana                    |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rudolf Hommes                         |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Colombian Soccer Team                 |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carolina Gomez                        |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other persons                         |9                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know                            |21                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Because the poll was taken during the days following the  death of Pablo Escobar, the "capo's" image receives a high  degree of mention among those polled, exceeding President  Gaviria, with whom he shared first place a year ago. As an odd  note, Carlos Vives appears in third place, ahead of Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff, soccer player Faustino Asprilla, and  the best known political leaders. Noemi Sanin is by far the  leader among the women in this ranking.  <H5>  How Gaviria Is Faring </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All things considered, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way in w-|  |hich Cesar Gaviria is performing as president of the republic? (figures ar-|  |e percentages)                                                             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Satisfied         |Dissatisfied      |Don't know/no opi-|  |                  |                  |                  |nion              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1992          |22                |71                |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1993          |44                |49                |8                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      It is indisputable that 1993, with its economic results and  the death of Pablo Escobar, was the year of the recovery of the  president's image. Nevertheless, the indicator obtained last  December is lower than those recorded in 1991 when, after  Escobar's surrender and the approval of the Constitution,  Gaviria's performance attained degrees of satisfaction exceeding  65 percent.  <H5>  Gaviria's Reelection </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |If Cesar Gaviria should run again as a candidate for the presidency, what  |  |is the likelihood of your voting for him? (figures are percentages)        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Would vote for him|Wouldn't vote for |Don't know/no opi-|  |                  |                  |him               |nion              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1991*         |59                |35                |6                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1992          |13                |80                |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1993          |23                |68                |9                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      In this question as well, one can perceive that the recovery  of the president's image is a long way from the popularity  levels of 1991, when 59 percent declared themselves willing to  reelect him.  <H5>  The Most Serious Problem </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In your judgment, what is Colombia's most serious problem at present? (figur-|  |es are percentages)                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Climate of Insecurity                 |26                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Unemployment                          |15                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Violence                              |14                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guerrillas/Public Order               |10                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Corruption                            |9                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug Trafficking                      |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poverty                               |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Economy                               |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug Addiction                        |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost of Living                        |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Education                             |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Foreign Debt                          |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Waste Disposal                        |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other Problems                        |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      It is interesting to note that insecurity is currently  considered the most serious problem by far, having displaced the  guerrillas and violence combined, which had traditionally led in  this ranking. The higher ranking of the corruption problem is  also significant, now registering 9 percent, compared with only  1 percent the previous year.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In your view, which is more serious at present: the guerrillas or drug traff-|  |icking?

However, when  corruption is included among the options, it wins by a wide  margin: something that never happened in the past.  <H5>  Guerrillas and Armed Forces </H5>   What should the government do about the guerrillas? (figures are  percentages)                Combat them        Hold dialogue    Both         Don't know/no               militarily         with them                     opinion   Dec 1992     53                 38               6            3   Dec 1993     39                 51               6            4      When this question was asked at the end of 1992, the cruel  guerrilla offensive that had begun with a massacre of policemen  in Putumayo was just being unleashed. This could explain why,  last December, that question again produced the traditional  results, showing that Colombians favor dialogue with the  guerrillas. Nevertheless, this 51 percent supporting dialogue  falls far short of the 72 percent obtained by the National  Consulting Center in a poll taken during December 1991 in the  five major cities.    Do you think that the Armed Forces' ability to defeat the guerrillas is  better, equal to, or less than it was a year ago? (figures are percentages)                  Better           Equal           Less           Don't know   Dec 1992       41               30              23             6   Dec 1993       51               27              16             6      Those polled think that the Armed Forces have improved their  capacity to combat the guerrillas. This means that, if the  majority now support dialogue, it is because they believe in a  political solution, and not because they consider the guerrillas  invincible.  <H5>  Drug Consumption </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Have you tried any of the following drugs?                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Date              |Percentage of positive responses                        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Marijuana         |Cocaine           |Basuco            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nov 1990*         |5.2               |1.3               |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1993          |8                 |3                 |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* National Consulting Center poll of Nov 1990                              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Degree of Happiness and Optimism </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In general, all things considered, how happy do you feel? (figures are per-|  |centages)                                                                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Very              |Not very          |Not at all        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nov 1990**        |43                |44                |13                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1991*         |69                |29                |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1992          |63                |34                |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1993          |75                |23                |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities                            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Last December, just after Pablo Escobar's death, the country  registered its highest degree of happiness, at least for the  past four years. Three-quarters of those polled declared  themselves "very happy," compared with 63 percent a year before.  The November 1990 figure, which revealed a high rate of  unhappiness, should be read carefully, because it relates to a  poll taken in 20 large, medium, and small cities, and is not  readily comparable to a poll taken in the four capitals.  Nevertheless, it indicated a very high degree of dissatisfaction  among Colombians with their lives.    Would you say that your life, compared to that led by your parents, is better,  the same, or worse? (figures are percentages)                    Better           Same           Worse           Don't know   Nov 1990**       49               10             39              2   Dec 1991*        72               12             15              1   Dec 1992         44               19             36              1   Dec 1993         53               19             26              2   * National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities   ** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities      In this question, one can see the same positive state of  mind  in December 1993 as in previous years. The difference from 1992  (the year of Escobar's escape) is considerable.    Do you believe that your children's lives will be better than, the same as, or  worse than yours? (figures are percentages)                    Better           Same           Worse           Don't know   Nov 1990**       39               11             44              6   Dec 1991*        45               13             38              4   Dec 1992         31               10             53              6   Dec 1993         41               11             40              7   * National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities   ** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities      Just as at the end of 1991, the optimism regarding the lives  that the children will lead is slightly greater than the  pessimism. Again, one notes a significant difference from the  previous year, when the degree of pessimism among Colombians  appeared high.  <H5>  Economic Situation and Openness </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Compared with a year ago, do you feel that your economic situation is bett-|  |er, the same, or worse? (figures are percentages)                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Better            |Same              |Worse             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1992          |33                |35                |32                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dec 1993          |46                |36                |18                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The difference between the end of 1992 and that of 1993 is  appreciable. Nearly half of those polled admit that their  economic situation has improved. Only 18 percent claim that it  has worsened.

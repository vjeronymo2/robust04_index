			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU GOES DOWN FIGHTING . . . ITSELF;  </P> <P> WITH ROSS BANISHED TO BENCH AT END, UTAH BUMPS AZTECS FROM TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> In a season marked by controversy, maybe it was only fitting that the final  game for this San Diego State basketball team should end with at least one  more.  </P> <P> Tony Ross, the team's second-leading scorer and best outside shooter, was  benched for disciplinary reasons in the final minutes of a 70-57 loss to host  Utah Wednesday night in the preliminary game of the Western Athletic Conference  tournament.  </P> <P> Ross spent the final 4:23 on the bench after apparently getting into a  disagreement with Coach Jim Brandenburg.  </P> <P> Ross left with the Aztecs trailing, 62-53, and the game still within their  grasp. But the Utes (16-16) scored eight of the final 12 points to eliminate  SDSU (12-17) and earn the right to meet regular-season champion Colorado State  in the quarterfinals tonight at Huntsman Center.  </P> <P> Ross, a junior who scored 12 of his team-high 14 points in the first half,  would not discuss the incident.  </P> <P> "If I said something, it would be the wrong thing," Ross said.  </P> <P> Brandenburg would only say that "we had a little discussion."  </P> <P> Brandenburg and Ross have had their public disagreements throughout the season.  The two exchanged words several times last week during games at New Mexico and  Texas El Paso, and Brandenburg kept Ross on the bench at times during both  games. But not until the latest incident did Brandenburg take such an extreme  measure.  </P> <P> The decision to bench Ross was the latest and the last in what had been  season-long struggle for Brandenburg and his team. Before the game, Brandenburg  imposed his rule again, replacing senior forward Shawn Bell in the starting  lineup with freshman Dana Jackson.  </P> <P> Brandenburg called the move a "coach's decision" but did not elaborate.  </P> <P> The decision to not start Bell was not the only adjustment Brandenburg had to  make. William Dixion, a junior walk-on guard, returned to Los Angeles Wednesday  morning to be with his ailing grandmother and missed the game. That left the  Aztecs with only three guards -- Ross, junior walk-on Kevin Honaker and junior  Rodney Jones, who played despite pregame nausea.  </P> <P> Despite all their troubles, the Aztecs found a way to stay with Utah, even  though it appeared that their cause might be lost from the beginning.  </P> <P> The Utes scored the first seven points in a start reminiscent of their 15-0  opening in an 80-61 regular-season victory over the Aztecs atHuntsman. But this  time, the Aztecs rallied to take the lead by scoring the next eight points and  went on to take lead by as much as 21-15 with 7:40 left in the half.  </P> <P> The Aztecs' cause was not hurt by the sparse crowd of 5,508, Utah's smallest  since 5,017 attended a Dec. 12, 1975, game against Denver, that had come to  watch the game between the tournament's two lowest-seeded teams. Utah came back  to outscore the Aztecs, 19-7, to take a 34-28 lead at halftime. But SDSU was  still in the game, thanks in many ways to Ross, who had one of his best  statistical halves of the season: 12 points, six rebounds, three assists, three  steals.  </P> <P> "Tony did did some nice things for us," Brandenburg said. "I can't fault his  play at all."  </P> <P> But even when Ross cooled off in the second half and center Mitch McMullen, who  had 10 first-half points, found himself surrounded by a collapsing defense that  limited him to three points in the second, the Aztecs stayed close.  </P> <P> They trailed by two (51-49) with as little as 8:21 to play before, according to  Brandenburg and the players, their lack of depth finally caught up with them.  </P> <P> "We were tired, and they were pushing the ball down our throats," Jones said.  </P> <P> Utah went on an 11-2 streak to take a 62-53 lead with 5:54 to play. Soon after,  Ross and Brandenburg had the disagreement that prematurely ended Ross' season.  The end for the last-place Aztecs came a few minutes later; it was their  earliest exit in the tournament's six-year history.  </P> <P> The game was a snapshot of what went wrong for the Aztecs the later half of the  season. They made a tournament-record 22 turnovers, including nine by Bell, who  ended up playing 29 minutes. They were mediocre from the free-throw line (nine  of 18). They had difficulty defending perimeter shooting -- freshman forward  Josh Grant of Utah scored a game-high 19 points, including three  three-pointers. And there was internal turmoil on the bench.  </P> <P> "We went through a lot this year," Jones said. "Hopefully the guys comingback  will know how it was, and they will listen to the coaches more, have more  desire. We had it this year; we just couldn't put it together at times."  </P> <P> Aztecs Notes  </P> <P> Mitch McMullen finished his San Diego State career with a record he would have  liked to avoid. His two fouls gave him 110, breaking by two the seasonrecord  set by Rodney Hawkins last year. . . . The 22 turnovers broke the Western  Athletic Conference tournament record of 20 set by Hawaii against Utah in 1984  and were one short of the season high set in a 77-72 loss at Arizona State.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTAS FREE 1,190 IMPRISONED FOR POLITICS;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: SOME VIEW THE MOVE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS A  PLOY TO WIN VOTES FOR ORTEGA.  </P> <P> Two weeks before national elections, the Sandinista government on Friday freed  1,190 Contras, rebel collaborators and former National Guardsmen in a prison  yard ceremony that officials said emptied Nicaraguan jails of all political  prisoners.  </P> <P> Among the 39 National Guardsmen released were allegedly some of the most brutal  officers from the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, who was deposed by a  Sandinista-led insurrection in 1979.  </P> <P> Sandinista officials charged, for instance, that when Col. Isaias Cuadra served  as director of the Tipitapa Penitentiary under Somoza, he tortured at least one  prominent prisoner -- Sandinista Cmdr. Tomas Borge. Since the Sandinistas came  to power, Borge has served as interior minister, overseeing the prisons, and  Cuadra has spent 10 1/2 years in jail.  </P> <P> "I have suffered a great deal during these years I have spent in prison,"  Cuadra, 56, said on his release. "I have come to understand human beings. I  understand there are passions, there is pain and that anyone who is a Christian  has to know how to forgive."  </P> <P> But he denied having tortured anyone, although reports of torture under Somoza  were common.  </P> <P> President Daniel Ortega, who also spent time in jail for being a Sandinista  guerrilla, had announced the release last month as a gesture to reunite this  country, which has been divided first by the Sandinista revolution and then by  the U.S.-backed Contra war.  </P> <P> Under the Central American peace accords signed by the region's five  presidents, the Sandinistas are required to pardon and release political  prisoners. But Ortega is seeking reelection Feb. 25 as the Sandinista National  Liberation Front's candidate for peace and reconciliation, and the release is  seen by many as a campaign maneuver to win votes.  </P> <P> Cmdr. Franco Montealegre, head of prisons, read the release decree as the  convicts stood in single file on the prison yard's concrete basketball courts.  Diplomats, members of the media and international observers here to monitor the  elections watched the ceremony.  </P> <P> "The U.S. government must respond to this decree by stopping its support for  warlike options and by giving determined support to the peace process," the  decree stated.  </P> <P> Four former Contra commanders who have come back to Nicaragua to observe the  elections also attended the ceremony. When Montealegre greeted them during his  introduction, the prisoners broke into applause.  </P> <P> Many of the Contras and guardsmen interviewed after receiving their release  papers said they hope to move to the United States, where most of their  relatives live.  </P> <P> "There is nothing for me here," said former National Guard Capt. Orlando Hislop  Mercado, 45.  </P> <P> Sandinista officials accuse Hislop of having raped and tortured Cmdr. Doris  Tijerino during her imprisonment as a guerrilla. Now, Tijerino is head of the  Sandinista police.  </P> <P> "I have been accused of everything you can imagine. My release order says  'atrocious assassination.' I heard on the radio the other day that I had raped  a commander. I don't even know all they accuse me of, but . . . all the  accusations are false," Hislop said.  </P> <P> Another of the released former guardsmen was Maj. Jose Enrique Munguia Berrios.  He allegedly led the patrol that killed Sandinista hero Carlos Fonseca in 1976.  </P> <P> "I fought people who were armed just like me. I could have been killed just as  easily as them," Munguia said Friday.  </P> <P> The number of political prisoners in Nicaragua has always been widely disputed  and remained so Friday. Sandinista officials said that only common criminals  and Sandinista soldiers accused of abuses remain in jail now.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Umkhonto we Sizwe's [Spear of the Nation, African  National Congress (ANC) Military Wing] Rashid Patel says members  of the first intake to the proposed peace force will begin  training within two weeks.    Patel says the ANC will resist any attempt to convert the  South African Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] into  the national peace force. The ANC has been calling for the  ISD's removal from townships, but law and order spokesman  Captain Craig Kotze says the proposal to convert the ISD is  likely to be tabled after a defense subcouncil meeting for the  TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. That meeting will discuss  the composition of the force and its command council.</p>

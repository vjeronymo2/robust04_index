			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ni Guohe (0242 0948 0735)] </F>   [Text] The Fourth Shanghai Lawyers Congress opened  yesterday morning at the Education Hall in a bid to raise the  quality of lawyers in Shanghai and to accelerate the pace of  reforming the lawyer work. Justice Minister Xiao Yang attended  the opening ceremony and set demands on the Shanghai lawyers'  work.    Shanghai now boasts 108 law firms and the number of people  involved in the law profession stands at 3,647. Lawyers are now  serving as legal consultants for some 20,000 units and  individuals in the municipality. At the opening ceremony,  Minister Xiao Yang expressed the hope that Shanghai lawyers  would seize the opportunity, understand thoroughly their  historical mission, and play an active role in promoting and  developing a market economy. At the same time, he called on the  broad mass of law workers to provide quality legal services to  help maintain a normal market economic order, the government  carry out macroeconomic regulation and control in developing a  market economy, and bring about a virtuous economic cycle in  society and a steady increase of economic and social benefits.  He added that lawyers should provide quality legal consultation  and legal services to help develop production, distribution, and  consumption, form a social security system, and further ensure  social stability and protect the citizens' democratic and  legitimate rights and benefits. He called on them to constantly  raise their professional level and promote the constant  development of reform and opening up.    The current meeting will discuss the issues on law firm  operation and on developing mechanisms for voluntary law-firm  mergers, for law-firm autonomy, and for self-development and  self-restraint. The "Shanghai Lawyers' Association  Constitution" will be examined and revised at the congress.  Congress participants will also elect the fourth board of  directors for the Shanghai Lawyers' Association.</p>

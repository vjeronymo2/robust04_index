			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "False Propaganda -- Indian Style"] </F>   [Text] The Bangladesh Rifles [border security force of  Bangladesh] has termed as totally false, malicious, and  calculated the report published in a section of the Indian press  saying that a Pakistani intelligence agency is operating its  bases in Bangladesh with the consent of the Bangladesh  authorities with a view to carrying out subversive activities in  India. Commenting on this propaganda made by the Indian media,  a spokesman of the Bangladesh Rifles said that there are three  objectives behind publishing this report. These include 1)  confusing the Indian citizens, 2) diverting the attention of  the international community from the fact that India is  providing assistance to the Chakma rebels of Chittagong Hill  Tracts of Bangladesh and 3) obstructing the development of  friendly ties between India and her neighbors.    Except for Pakistan, all the other countries of the  subcontinent are very weak in comparison to India. It is  superior to these countries from all points of view including  wealth, manpower, army, and weaponry. Almost every country of  this subcontinent is aware of the superiority of India. Hence,  the question does not arise that they will make any move to  challenge India. These countries do not even dare to think of  making any such a venture. Each of these countries wants to  preserve its independence, sovereignty, national identity,  history, and cultural traditions. For this reason, the  fundamental principle of the foreign policy of Bangladesh is  "friendship with all and malice toward none." Since its  independence, Bangladesh has abided by this policy. However, it  has not been possible for Bangladesh to live in peace despite  its sincere desire. Its immensely powerful neighbor, India, is  continuing with its repression against Bangladesh and subjecting  it to various injustices. India's aggressive designs have  created tension along the border of Bangladesh. With a view to  disintegrating this country, India is providing shelter and  providing arms training to the secessionist forces of Bangladesh  known as Bangobhumiwallahs. These militants often intrude into  the country and carry out subversive activities. Apart from  this, by unilaterally withdrawing the waters of the Ganges  River, India is causing immense hardship to Bangladesh both in  the dry and the rainy seasons. It has also allured and provoked  the Chakma tribals living in Chittagong Hill Tracts of  Bangladesh to leave the country and take refuge in sanctuaries  in India. It has also imparted arms training to the Chakmas who  repeatedly carry out raids in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This  has threatened peace and stability in the Chittagong Hill Tracts  region for a long time. Every move made by Bangladesh to find a  permanent solution to the Chakma problem has been frustrated by  India through its illegal intervention. Under these  circumstances, the Indian media has launched a campaign saying  that Bangladesh is collaborating with the activities of a  Pakistani intelligence agency in India. What can be a greater  farce than this?    In fact, the rebellion, tension, disturbances, and  secessionist movements in the northeastern states of India is an  old problem. With the passage of time, this problem has worsened  and has become more severe. It is getting out of control and  threatening regional stability. This is, however, an internal  affair of India. A small country like Bangladesh never had the  time to ponder the problems of a neighboring country. Moreover,  the question of assisting any other country against India does  not arise. Despite this, a section of the Indian media has  leveled such allegations against Bangladesh. This is called the  Indian style of false propaganda. It is entirely fabricated and  malicious. This is their habit. They do not feel ashamed to do  such things. However, it is true that they will gain nothing by  doing so. By digging a ditch for others, they will fall into it  themselves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The evangelical community is gradually getting rid  of its conservative stigma, and is beginning to open up to  evangelical leaders identified with the left. The most recent  phenomenon is the creation of the MEPS (Socialist Popular  Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico Popular Socialista],  which is linked with the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the  former Brazilian Communist Party.    The MEPS was approved at the national convention of the PPS,  which elected evangelical members to run in the elections for  the PPS. One of them is Luis Cavalcante, candidate for state  deputy for Sao Paulo State.    "The PT [Workers Party] is very close to the Catholic  Church.  That is why I have come to the PPS," Cavalcante said. He added  that the PPS has evangelical candidates in Rio de Janeiro and  Sao Paulo States.    The increase of progressive members identified with the left  can be explained as a reaction to the behavior of evangelical  congressmen during the Constituent Assembly and at the  impeachment of Collor.    The MEP (Popular Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico  Popular] was created following Collor's election. "Our  objective is to encourage evangelicals to participate in social  movements," said Reverend Robinson Cavalcante, who supports Lula.    According to Reverend Cavalcante, the MEP encourages its  members to join leftist parties and the CUT [Sole Workers  Center]. Evangelical interest in participating in social  movements has increased in the past 10 years, Cavalcante said.    Reverend Oneide Bobison, who also supports Lula, mentioned  another factor that contributes to the increase of progressive  members. "Young clergymen prefer leftist and center-left  parties."</p>

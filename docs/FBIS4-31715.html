			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Vasovic-Mekina: "Germans Closer Than </F> the Croats"]    [Text] The southern neighbors are threatening the  Slovenes; why 36 Jews are threatening 20 percent of Slovenia's  citizens.    In a few days the findings of the "Slovene Public Opinion  '94" poll will be officially presented to the Slovene public.  The results of this year's undertaking are also interesting  because of the possibility of a long-term comparison; the  Slovene public opinion poll (which has been conducted since back  in 1968 by the Public Opinion Research Center of the Ljubljana  School of Social Sciences, under the leadership of Dr. Niko Tos)  can boast of the longest tradition of that type on the territory  of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This  year 1,050 respondents participated in the project.  <H5>  Strengthened Right Wing </H5>   This year's results undoubtedly show interesting shifts.  Last  year the constantly emphasized dispute between Slovene President  Milan Kucan and former Defense Minister Janez Jansa led to a  "rewarding" of Jansa's aggressive policy, and a partial  reconciliation of the electorate with Jansa's side, although  Kucan still remains the politician who enjoys the confidence of  all strata of Slovene society. At the same time, the recent  dispute between the Police and Defense Ministries (the arrest of  civilian Milan Smolnikar, overstepping the authority of the  Defense Ministry's commissioner, as a result of which Jansa then  took off), in spite of the stormy media campaign of the media  loyal to Jansa, nevertheless did not harm the police at all, but  rather primarily the Defense Ministry. Although the Slovene  Defense Ministry, after 1991 (the June conflicts with the  Yugoslav People's Army--author's note), received only the  highest assessments in comparison with all other state  institutions, after the above-mentioned case of the beating of a  civilian, the situation abruptly changed; the ministry lost  credit, and the public became much more critical of the  activities of the Defense Ministry, which is now headed by Jelko  Kacin.    Naturally, the most interesting indicators are those  concerning the oscillations of nationalism and interethnic  intolerance. A comparison with last year's results leads to the  assessment that those phenomena are slightly rising. The  researchers see changes in the social structure as the causes of  this. The feeling of being threatened is increasing primarily  because of the war in the vicinity of Slovenia, as well as the  increasingly clearer realization that the presence of refugees  in Slovenia will remain a lasting problem. Only two years ago,  at the time of the fiercest Serbian-Croatian war, polls at that  time showed a very high, almost euphoric solidarity with the  refugees; today the euphoria has vanished, and the solidarity  has turned to rejection. The most perverse fact in all of this  is that as many as 20 percent of the Slovene citizens polled  "would not like to have a Jew as a neighbor" (in the 1991  census, according to data from the Slovene Statistical Yearbook,  "as many as" 36 inhabitants stated themselves to be Jews);  although anti-Semitism has not flourished in Slovenia to date,  the latest results show the power of a stereotype, in which the  respondents' personal experience obviously does not play any  role at all. The researchers' interpretation is that such  extremely nationalistic and racist prejudices are the results of  "nonexperiential orientations," which means that the respondents  form their attitude indirectly, on the basis of shifts in other  societies close to them, for example in Austria, Germany, or  Italy.  <H5>  Foreign Brothers </H5>   Increased ethnic oversensitivity is being manifested in two  forms: as aggressive nationalism (the group that supports such  views represents about 10 percent of the population), and as  distrust on the part of a majority of Slovenes toward the  neighboring Yugoslav peoples, until yesterday "fraternal" ones,  toward whom a majority of the respondents today express great  coolness. In some cases, that deliberate emphasis on difference  goes to ridiculous extremes. For example, in response to the  question "How much are the peoples listed similar to Slovenes?"  the respondents ranked the Germans in first place as closest to  themselves, then the Austrians, and then, in order, the Swiss,  the Czechs and Slovaks, the Croats, the Italians, the Americans,  the Hungarians, the Russians, the Bosnians, and at the very  end--the Serbs and Turks. On the other hand, in response to the  question "Which languages do you use or understand?" the  respondents answered that almost 90 percent of them spoke or  understood Serbo-Croatian, 45.1 percent German, 37.3 percent  English, 17.2 percent Italian, 6.2 percent French, and so forth.  The irony is that thus, the vast majority of Slovenes, because  of linguistic closeness and coexistence for many years in the  same state, speak well and understand the languages of the  peoples whom they view as the most foreign to them of all the  peoples on the face of the earth. What lies behind such radical  responses is an expression of sympathy or antipathy toward the  actions of different peoples and states when Slovenia became  independent, and a critical view of the causes of the war in  Bosnia.    The coolness that Slovenes express toward their "brothers to  the south" is also apparent in connection with the answers to  the question "Who is threatening Slovenia?" According to the  majority's opinion, Slovenia is still most threatened by Croatia  (50.2 percent), immediately followed by Serbia (46.6 percent).  The third big and serious threat to Slovenia consists of the  refugees (30.2 percent of the respondents), then Russia (27.3  percent of the respondents), and only then Italy (16.2 percent),  with which Slovenia has a dispute over the Osimo accords, and  Austria (5 percent), which has not yet fulfilled (and probably  never will) its obligations from article 7 of the state treaty  on the protection of the Slovene minority in Austria.    Finally, after several years of critical reactions from the  respondents, some positive vibrations can be observed only in  the area of living conditions. Most of the respondents  optimistically expect an improvement in living conditions in the  future, even though no one expects dramatically rapid jumps.  Such views are even partly confirmed by the data on the growth  of exports, the halt in the growth of unemployment, and  increases in direct foreign investments last year in Slovenia,  which is trying right now to compensate finally for the loss of  the former Yugoslav markets through free trade agreements with  the members of the Visegrad group of countries.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |What Should Be the Condition for Receiving Slovene Citizenship?              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Knowledge of the Slovene language     |91|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Living for a long time in Slovenia    |88|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Familiarity with Slovene culture      |70|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Slovene descent                       |60|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Born in Slovenia                      |45|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Christian religion                    |28|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who Is Threatening Slovenia?                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Refugees                              |30.2|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Minorities                            |20|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Japan                                 |3|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |United States                         |4|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                               |4|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                                |27.3|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Serbia                                |46.6|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Croatia                               |50.2|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungary                               |3|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Austria                               |5|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italy                                 |16.2|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

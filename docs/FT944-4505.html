			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Mawhinney calls for transport ceasefire Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday made an impassioned plea for a national debate about transport issues and for 'an end to the shouting and the insults'. Mr Mawhinney, who became transport secretary just over four months ago, called for 'a ceasefire in the sterile feuding over transport issues'. He was speaking a few days after several hundred police officers and bailiffs had brought an end to an occupation of houses along the route of a new section of the M11 motorway in east London. Further protests are brewing over a number of new road schemes including a by-pass at Newbury in Berkshire and a widening of the A27 in Sussex. Mr Mawhinney cast doubt on 'the glorious visions' of some people which included 'millions of cycling school children, with shops on every street corner and with badgers and butterflies thriving in every neighbourhood'. Efforts to reduce road traffic would only be successful if acceptable alternatives could be found, he said. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, welcomed Mr Mawhinney's proposals to put environmental groups and issues at the centre of the debate.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Federal Express to sell French domestic service to TNT TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday announced an ADollars 80m (USDollars 60.1m) deal with Federal Express, the US express mail carrier, to buy the Chronoservice domestic express business in France and deliver inbound international shipments for FedEx in several European countries. The deal follows the decision by FedEx to pull out of the highly competitive market for express services between European countries, and to end domestic services in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Sir Peter Abeles, TNT chief executive, said the agreements, subject to approval from European regulatory authorities, would 'further demonstrate the leading position we have built in Europe.' The deal represents a significant expansion by TNT, which will become a strong competitor in the French domestic market, where it operates only international services. Chronoservice is one of France's leading express mail companies, with a network of 12 depots, about 450 employees and 235 trucks, mostly located in the west of the country. TNT claims to be Europe's leading operator of domestic express mail businesses, with strong and highly profitable operations in Italy, Germany, Spain and the UK. The second element of the deal stipulates that FedEx will appoint TNT's Express Worldwide subsidiary as its sub-contractor to handle inbound deliveries to 10 European countries. The effect will be to remove a strong competitor from the inbound international market, and increase the volume of packages being handled by TNT's road and air delivery network. TNT said the deal was supported by GD Net, the Dutch-based consortium of five European and North American post offices which last year agreed to form a joint venture to pool express mail shipments. The agreement did not affect TNT shares, which have strengthened considerably after falling below ADollars 1 last year as worries mounted about liquidity. The shares closed unchanged at ADollars 1.96 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hats off to thinkers Sir, If Edward de Bono (Letters, June 23) considers himself a philosopher, it is odd that he castigates Lucy Kellaway's article ('Put on your thinking caps', June 17). I certainly did not feel 'nannied' when reading it; indeed, a sense of enlightenment. It was good writing because it succinctly clarified de Bono's latest thinking fashion, with shrewd scepticism. Surely the essence of philosophy is a creative pursuit of new ideas - which are then criticised vigorously, to alter our very paradigms of thought. In such a contest there is no time for personal pride. Edward de Bono's reactionary tone could imply that he is more concerned to defend the commercial prospects of his 'Six Hats' approach, than genuinely advance understanding. This is not good philosophy. Its best thinkers have usually been absorbed in ideas for their own sake, not marketing potential. A reason for reading the FT is articles which inform and challenge us to think - without a need for gurus. Hats off to Lucy Kellaway] Edmond Jackson, Chenies, Butlers Dene Road, Woldingham, Surrey CR3 7HH</p>

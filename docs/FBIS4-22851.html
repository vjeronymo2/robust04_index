P. Yakimovich; UDC 621.397.13] </F>   [Abstract] A method for transmission and reconstruction of  three-dimensional wide aperture images is examined. The essence  of the method lies in obtaining three-dimensional coordinates,  brightness and spectral characteristic of object's points,  aperture of their visibility window and eventual reconstruction  of a three-dimensional picture as a totality of the object's  points, where each of them is visible only from its own  visibility window. This method allows to transmit high quality  wide-aperture three-dimensional images without significantly  increasing the bandwidth of the standard TV communication  channel. This method can be employed with any methods of point-  by-point scanning or monitoring the scenes. In this article the  method of horizontal cross sections is examined because,  compared to other, it requires a minimal bandwidth of the  communication channel for the information transmission. The  optical diagram for a possible implementation of the examined  method is provided. Figure 1, references 9: 5 Russian. 4 Western</p>

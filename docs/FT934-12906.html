			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Brussels warns on steel restructuring EC COMPETITION commissioner Mr Karel Van Miert has warned that Community steel prices could slump if EC industry ministers delay a vote next month on restructuring the Spanish, Italian and east German steel industries. Mr Van Miert wants to present Commission proposals on state subsidies and capacity cuts for the publicly-owned steelmakers to a meeting of EC industry ministers on November 18. But to do so, he needs first to agree a deal with the governments concerned. So far only the Spanish authorities have reached agreement with Brussels. The Italian government is still negotiating with the Commission about the proportion of debt which should be injected into a new privatised steel company, and the formula for calculating aid and capacity cuts. The German government has yet to disclose its formal plans for private sector investment in the Ekostahl plant in east Germany. In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Van Miert said the German case was now 'mainly a political issue', but he agreed it was likely to be the most difficult problem to solve. Bonn is insisting that it should be allowed to subsidise Ekostahl because its privatisation is an important element in the overall restructuring of eastern Germany. The EC is trying to put in place a rescue plan for the Community industry, to relieve problems caused by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports. So far the Commission has taken measures to restrict unfairly priced imports, monitor the steel market, and provide financial support for redundancies in the steel sector. But if it cannot present proposals to the November 18 meeting of ministers, Mr Van Miert fears that a 10 per cent rise in the price of EC steel products over the last few months will be wiped out, because the benefits and credibility of other elements of the EC's rescue proposals will be undermined. '(The current steel price) is still considerably below the price needed in order (for the industry) not to lose money any more.' Private-sector steelmakers will also be reluctant to cut production if they know that their state-owned counterparts are still receiving subsidies. Mr Van Miert said it was particularly important in this respect that closures at Ilva, the loss-making Italian steelmaker, were implemented quickly. 'That would be a sign to the market that the operation is really under way, and then the private companies will put their cards on the table,' he said. Three weeks ago Ilva announced plans to cut 11,600 jobs between 1994 and 1996. If Bonn and Rome do come up with restructuring plans in time, the commissioner believes ministers will reach unanimous agreement next month. Mr Van Miert is under particular pressure because he will be in Japan next week, and will therefore be unable to seek Commission endorsement for proposals on the Italian and German industries. That would leave very little time to prepare for a vote at the ministers' meeting. See Monday interview, Second Section</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The market in Australia started to sag again when sales were resumed this week and the Wool Corporation's market indicator yesterday fell 10 cents to 460c/kg, which is practically back to the lowest of the season. Withdrawals by woolgrowers are still very high, reaching as much as 55pc af the Fremantle sale on Tuesday, though 20pc is more typical. World demand is not matching present supply. Recession in the world economy provides a major reason, but the decline is itself creating a trading atmosphere of almost unprecedented gloom.</p>

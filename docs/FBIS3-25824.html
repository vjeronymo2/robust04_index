The  conference mapped out specific plans for implementing the three  reforms in our province in accordance with the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council's demands.    Provincial party and government leaders Lu Rongjing, Fu  Xishou, Yang Yongliang, and Liu Guangcai attended the  conference, which was chaired by Yang Duoliang.    Provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing spoke at the  conference. He urged principal party and government leaders at  all levels to assume personal responsibility for actively  organizing and spearheading reform of the three systems. We  should unify thinking, improve understanding, and truly convert  the central authorities' decision and arrangements into the  common understanding of party committees and governments at all  levels, as well as the conscientious actions of the masses. Lu  Rongjing emphatically said: We should devise overall plans and  make sound arrangements for economic work while planning for the  three reforms. At no time should we slacken economic work. We  should solve problems and find solutions during the course of  reform in a reform spirit. We should strictly implement  policies and enforce rigorous organizational discipline to  ensure smooth progress in the three reforms in our province;  promote changes in organizational functions; smooth work  relationships; promote social stability; inspire the enthusiasm  of the vast numbers of functionaries, effectively advance all  areas of work; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development in our province.    Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee  and governor, delivered a work report. He noted: Carrying out  the three supplementary reforms is of great significance because  it is urgently needed to deepen reform of the economic system,  an important aspect of reform of the political system, and the  inevitable choice for establishing a socialist market economic  system. Therefore, the entire province should actively but  steadily carry out organizational reform and promote reform of  the civil service and payroll systems in a planned and  step-by-step fashion in accordance with the unified plans of the  party Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party  committee, and the provincial government.    At the conference's closing, provincial party Deputy  Secretary Yang Yongliang arranged for implementing the  conference's guidelines. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang gave a  summing-up report.    Over 300 people attended, including members of the  provincial  leading group for organizational reform; leading party and  government responsible comrades from various prefectural, city,  and provincial and central-level units in Anhui; and directors  of personnel bureaus and divisions, organizational offices, and  payroll sections.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon advances DAVENPORT Vernon, the multi-franchise motor group , increased its pre-tax profits by 14.7 per cent from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 1.64m in the year to September 30 on turnover which rose from Pounds 99.73m to Pounds 114.15m. Mr Ralph Denne, chairman, said that as a result of the difficult conditions in the industry, opportunities had arisen which allowed the group to take the initiative to increase substantially the size of Davenport during the year. He pointed out that since the flotation in March 1989 the number of motor operations had increased from 14 to 21. Earnings per share have risen 11 per cent from 7.3p to 8.1p, but the dividend total is held at 4p with a proposed final payment of 2.5p.</p>

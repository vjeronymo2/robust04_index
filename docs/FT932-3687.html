			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Dread disease: the insurance for critical cases - Many people have never heard of this cover; yet, it can cushion family or firm from serious financial trouble DREAD disease: the very name is enough to put off anyone squeamish. But although it has been available in Britain for several years, many people have not heard of dread disease insurance, even under its other, less Gothic-sounding name of critical illness insurance. Basically, it is designed to pay a lump sum when one of a defined list of serious illnesses is diagnosed, chief among them heart attacks, strokes and cancer. While such problems are common, statistics show you are more likely to contract a critical illness than to die before retirement age. Watsons, the actuarial firm, says that a man aged 40 has a 1:12 chance of dying by the age of 60 - but a 1:10 chance of getting such an illness. The concept of this insurance stems from the fact that the impact of serious illness on a family's finances can be worse than death. Unlike life assurance, critical illness insurance pays out before death; the illness does not have to be terminal. And, unlike permanent health insurance, the amount paid out is not necessarily related to earnings or inability to work. Recipients are free to spend the lump sum how they choose: for instance, on home nursing care, a holiday to recuperate, to pay off the mortgage, or to make home alterations to take account of new disabilities. So far, the idea seems simple and useful. But confusion arises when you start to look at the details of individual policies. Some also provide a death benefit; some acquire a cash value; some cover illnesses that others do not; some allow partial payments on diagnosis of certain less-serious conditions; some pay out when you become unable permanently to do your own job, while others say you must be incapable of doing any job. Most importantly, the definitions of the core illnesses can vary in small but crucial details. The one disease excluded by all the policies is Aids. Indeed, the only claim any insurer will accept for an HIV-related illness (and only some will do this) is if it can be proved the virus was contracted from a blood transfusion in the UK while the policy was in force - something that is highly unlikely given the rigorous screening procedures now adopted. But haemophiliacs are excluded even from this. Confusion over the level of cover provided by different insurers is one reason that many independent financial advisers have been reluctant to deal with critical illness insurance. So, in an attempt to clarify the sector, a working party from the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers has produced a list of standard definitions for the main conditions covered. While only a handful of insurers - including Life Association of Scotland and Friends Provident - has agreed to adopt the list so far, others are considering it. At the least, the NFIFA is asking all insurers to make sure their definitions are as extensive as the list by autumn this year. Countrywide, one of the largest networks of IFAs, has examined most of the 60-odd policies on offer to check their definitions of key dread diseases. It was looking for definitions that would give clients the best opportunity to make a valid claim, which meant that those worded vaguely or too narrowly were out. Stuart Fulkes, one of Countrywide's researchers, said they had discovered that seven conditions were most likely to attract claims. 'Others are unlikely situations or marketing gimmicks. Policies should at least be competent in the core areas - after that it is just a bonus.' Countrywide found 16 companies with definitions it deemed acceptable: Allied Dunbar, Cannon Lincoln, Commercial Union, Eagle Star, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange, Liberty Life, London Life, Pegasus, PPP Lifetime, Prolific, Scottish Amicable, Skandia Life, Sun Life, Windsor Life and Zurich Life. Medical jargon can also put off potential customers who want to know exactly what a policy will cover. Several companies, including Allied Dunbar and Life Association of Scotland, now provide a plain English guide - in readable type - explaining their definitions. As critical illness cover remains a relatively recent addition to insurers' portfolios, new applications are still being invented for it, such as an add-on to endowment policies. It can also be taken out by businesses as a back-up to keyman life insurance. If a partner, director or other key employee becomes seriously ill, the pay-out compensates the company for their loss or allows their share of the business to be bought out. Adrian Kemp, an employee benefits consultant with Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, sees critical illness cover as particularly relevant to the executive and keyman markets, but he also expects growth in the general sector. 'I think it is going to be a developing market for the rest of the decade,' he says. 'We will see significant innovations - possibly more insurers entering the market, and that would be no bad thing.' David Thompson, a director at IFA Noble Lowndes in Bristol, adds: 'The attraction of critical illness cover is that an individual might not want to work any more. If somebody is struck down by a heart attack through stress, the last thing they want to do is go back to work.'</p>

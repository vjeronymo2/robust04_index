			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Aftershocks compound LA's misery Strong aftershocks have compounded the problems of earthquake-weary residents of Los Angeles and complicated the tasks of those struggling to restore basic services to the city. Two jolts, each measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred just two minutes apart on Wednesday afternoon, causing further structural damage to many buildings already weakened by Monday's pre-dawn 6.6 quake. Building inspectors, who fanned out across the city on Wednesday morning, will have to re-examine many of the damaged homes and commercial structures that they had previously deemed inhabitable. Schools, most of which remain closed , must similarly be re-inspected for damage. Of approximately 600 schools, over 100 have sustained significant damage, with 24 that are severely battered with collapsed walls and ceilings. There is no word yet on when many of the city's 640,000 students may be able to return to school. Preliminary damage estimates run to Dollars 700m. The aftershocks also increased the fears of those who have abandoned their homes. Despite the efforts of city officials to persuade them to find shelter, about 18,000 people spent a third night in parks and open spaces. For commuters, the aftershocks caused more misery. Residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, to the north of Los Angeles, now virtually isolated by freeway closures, have been encouraged to abandon their cars in favour of the Metro-Link suburban train service. That too, however, was temporarily closed on Wednesday afternoon when aftershocks caused a rockslide. Traffic congestion remains the most widespread impact of the earthquake with millions of people struggling to find alternative routes to and from work as businesses reopen. In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, some 40,000 homes are expected to be without running water for several more days.</p>

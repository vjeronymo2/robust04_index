			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: County stake shocked managers, jury told SENIOR managers at County NatWest reacted with shock and anger when they first learned of the size of the bank's holding in Blue Arrow and the resultant loss after the 1987 stock market crash, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr John Owen, treasurer of NatWest Investment Bank, told the court he attended a management meeting on December 17 held before County announced that it owned a disclosable 9.5 per cent stake in Blue Arrow which led to a loss of Pounds 49m. The general reaction to the draft announcement being discussed was shock and anger, he told Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting. 'Shock at the extent of the losses and the implications for the firm as a whole. Anger at the lack of general notice that many people felt they had had. 'It had clearly been unexpected to some. The scale of the losses in particular and the residual shareholding was much larger than many realised, he said.' Ms Christine Downton, the chief executive of County NatWest Investment Management, was very angry at the implications for the reputation of her division, he said. He later told Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the defendants, it would have been 'improper' for Ms Downton to have been told before of the holding, agreeing that that would have breached a 'Chinese wall' within the County organisation. Mr Owen agreed that he knew of the holdings taken by County, County NatWest Securities and Union Bank of Switzerland, but was unaware the UBS stake was covered by an indemnity from County. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the Pounds 837m rights issue. After the issue, NWIB faced a total risk of almost Pounds 160m. Mr Owen organised an options hedge to protect against a fall in the share price. That covered Pounds 83m of the risk and realised a Pounds 90m profit, he said. The trial continues on Monday.</p>

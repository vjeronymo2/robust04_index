			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT DECISIONS  </P> <P> If reversing 2 1/2 decades of civil rights progress in 2 1/2 weeks is not  activist, then what would cause Savage and Lauter to call the court "activist"?  </P> <P> Americans, in their rush to give up their much-touted "freedom," elected  Republicans to rein in "the other guy" -- criminals, drug users, women who want  control over their bodies, gay rights proponents -- the first two created by  society's corruption, greed, and neglect -- and the latter two simply trying to  take (or keep) what's theirs.  </P> <P> Now these Republican-appointed storm troopers in judicial robes are ripping up  the Constitution at Mach II. At this speed, it will be soon indeed that we all  feel the weight of their terrible heels.  </P> <P> DAVID VAN CHANEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> That "Married . . . With Children" failed to receive a single Emmy nomination  (let alone award) is a disgrace! Are the academy voters hypocrites, or are they  just so infused with self-importance that they can't find it in their hearts to  enjoy and acknowledge mere entertainment? Because that's all "MWC" is -- no  messages, no social relevance, just vulgar, tasteless low comedy. But brilliant  low comedy! Fall-on-your-face-from-laughing low comedy! Can't they see that?  </P> <P> Speaking on behalf of the unwashed masses without reputations to protect, I'd  like to present everyone connected with "MWC" an honorary award for giving us  the funniest American situation comedy since "I Love Lucy" went into reruns.  </P> <P> Mark Jones, Sun Valley  </P></p>

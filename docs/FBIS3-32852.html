			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin No. 29 issued by the Defense Secretariat in Mexico </F> City on 11 February; from the "24 Hours" newscast]    [Text] Several news media have reported the exodus of the  indigenous population toward larger cities and townships because  of the armed conflict in the state of Chiapas. Although the  National Defense Secretariat has kept the public informed about  the violence unleashed by the rebels against both people and  property, it wishes to offer the following figures and  information in an attempt to provide the people with a more  complete picture -- a picture to which they are entitled.    1. The migratory flow toward major cities and towns in the  region originates in the villages and hamlets under rebel  control or influence.    2. Testimony by the people who have sought shelter and  protection at the refugee camps indicates that they fled their  villages after being stripped of their land, animals, crops, and  property, and because of constant harassment for refusing to  join the armed groups.    3. As of this time, 19,188 displaced inhabitants are at  various shelters or with relatives and friends in the areas  under Army protection listed below:    In Escarcega, Campeche, there are 207 people; at individual  homes in Chanal there are 50; in (Ochuc), 100; in La Trinitaria,  1,042; in San Cristobal de Las Casas, 250; at shelters in  Ocosingo, 544 and 8,206 more are with friends or relatives; in  Altamirano there are 403; and in Las Margaritas, 8,283. The  total number of all refugees is 19,085. [figures as heard]</p>

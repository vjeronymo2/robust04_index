			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW REJECTED AT NISSAN PLANT IN MAJOR DEFEAT  </P> <P> The labor movement's prospects for organizing the rapidly expanding Japanese  manufacturing presence in industrial America suffered a major setback Thursday  when workers at a Nissan plant here overwhelmingly rejected United Auto Workers  membership.  </P> <P> In one of the nation's most closely watched union organizing campaigns, Nissan  workers voted 1,622 to 711 against joining the Detroit-based union. Nearly  2,400 production workers were eligible to vote in the federally supervised  election, which had been expected to be close.  </P> <P> In an early morning press conference, relieved Nissan executives hailed the  results and vowed to reunite the work force in the wake of the tense and  divisive election campaign.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Election 'Disruptive'  </P> <P> "We're glad this election is over . . . it's been somewhat disruptive," said  Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan's U.S. manufacturing operations.  </P> <P> UAW officers, visibly upset by the results, refused to talk with reporters  early Thursday. Instead, the union vowed in a statement that it will continue  trying to organize Nissan for "as long as it takes" to win.  </P> <P> But Benefield added that the election results had left him "more convinced than  ever before that the UAW will never organize Nissan."  </P> <P> The UAW's loss here means that the union still has not won a contested  organizing election at any of the new American assembly plants of the Japanese  auto makers, which are now perhaps the most visible Japanese manufacturing  operations in this country. The union abandoned a 1985 organizing drive at  Honda's Ohio plant before a vote was taken.  </P> <P> The UAW does represent workers at three Japanese-managed assembly plants, but  the Japanese firms have a unionized domestic auto maker as a partner in each of  those plants. Those affiliations allowed the UAW to use its leverage with the  American Big Three to win representation of workers at the plants without a  fight.  </P> <P> Yet the union has so far been unable to gain a foothold at the U.S. plants  owned and operated by Japan's Big Three -- Honda in Ohio, Toyota in Kentucky  and Nissan here. In addition, a non-union joint venture between Subaru and  Isuzu will be opened in Indiana this fall.  </P> <P> Industry analysts agreed Thursday that the surprisingly large margin of victory  represented a significant defeat for the UAW.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Convincing Victory'  </P> <P> "I think it's clearly a serious blow," said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist  at the University of California at San Diego. "This doesn't finish the UAW at  Nissan, but it was a pretty convincing victory for the company, and it will  make the union's job tougher at Honda, Toyota and Subaru-Isuzu," he added. "It  is also likely to stiffen the resolve against the UAW of many of the Japanese  auto parts suppliers opening plants here."  </P> <P> The voting, which continued from Wednesday morning until early Thursday morning  to accommodate workers on the plant's midnight shift, followed weeks of  aggressive campaigning by both the Japanese auto maker and the million-member  union. The two sides had put their reputations on the line in the campaign, and  the work force had become deeply split.  </P> <P> As the high-stakes election began to take on international significance in  recent weeks, the work force came under heavy media scrutiny; Japanese  reporters and television crews packed Thursday morning's press conference in  Smyrna.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long Organizing Drive  </P> <P> The UAW has been vowing to organize Nissan since the plant opened here in 1983,  but only this spring did it gain enough worker support to push for a vote. In  May, the UAW petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election  at the plant.  </P> <P> Many workers switched to the UAW side in recent months because of what they  charged has been a mounting injury rate caused by speedups on the assembly line  and increasing job loads.  </P> <P> Pro-union workers complained that Nissan's Japanese-style "team concept" labor  policies had been abused by Nissan's American managers in a push for greater  productivity.  </P> <P> The union's charges about a high Nissan injury rate seemed to have been aided  in the last few weeks when Nissan was cited by the state of Tennessee for  failing to publicly release injury data.  </P> <P> Both the company and union had mounted intense, last-minute drives to sway  undecided workers. The UAW brought in 30 organizers to Smyrna and aired  pro-union radio and television commercials. The company announced a major  expansion of the Smyrna complex, and, in the final days of the campaign,  managers met repeatedly with small groups of workers.  </P> <P> In the end, the union apparently had not convinced a majority that it could  offer any more benefits than management.  </P> <P> In fact, wages and benefits were not a central issue in the election, because  workers' pay here already approaches that of union workers at the Big Three.  Nissan workers even have a few benefits -- a leased car program and a 401-K  retirement plan, for example -- not available to production workers in the  domestic industry.  </P> <P> As a result, the union was forced to concentrate on the injury and speedup  issues, which were not enough to sway many workers who had not been injured.  </P> <P> "There's going to be injuries in heavy industry wherever you go," Danny  Smythia, an anti-union worker, said after the election results were released.  "The problem isn't any worse here than anywhere else."  </P> <P> Anti-union workers agreed with Nissan's Benefield that the vote will allow the  company to maintain the "team concept" approach to labor relations that it  contends it needs to remain competitive.  </P> <P> "We don't need two teams in the company," Sheikh Faye, a production worker,  said. "Now, we can unite in one team again to build the highest quality cars in  America."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DECLINING UNION VICTORIES  </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1979  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 6926  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 47.2%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1980  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 7225  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 47.9%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1981  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 6554  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 45.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1982  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 4247  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 43.7%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1983  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3483  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 47.7%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1984  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3561  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 46.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1985  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3749  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 46.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1986  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3663  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 47.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1987  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3314  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 48.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal years ended 9/30/1988  </P> <P> No. of NLRB union representation elections: 3509  </P> <P> Proportion of elections won by unions: 49.5%  </P> <P> SOURCE: UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations / NLRB  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: BIS report points to shortening of debt maturity profiles RESTRICTIVE lending policies, including the non-renewal of maturing long-term loans, continued to characterise banks' credit relations with countries outside the BIS reporting area in the first half of 1992, according to a report released today by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)*. The report highlights a further shortening of debt maturity profiles, noting the banks' preference for short-term trade-related credits and the accumulation of interest arrears. 'The maturity profile of reporting banks' claims continued to shorten in most instances,' said the BIS. The combination of a preference for short-term trade-related credits, additional interest arrears, debt sales and write-offs sent the share of short-term debt (defined as up to and including one year) to a new record high of nearly 48 per cent of total debt owed to banks in the first half of 1992. Short-term claims on Portugal surged to a record 61 per cent of total international bank lending to Portugal, reflecting persistent short-term capital inflows after the country's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. A reduction in exposure to Norway was more than accounted for by the cut in short-term credit lines to banks in distress. As a result, Norway's maturity profile lengthened and the domestic banking system's share of the country's external banking debt fell again to an all-time low of 33 per cent. The former Soviet Union was the only one of the eastern European countries whose combined banking debt increased, but the Dollars 2.4bn rise reflected the accumulation of arrears and the drawdown of existing unused facilities. The deferral of principal repayments accentuated the shortening of the debt profile: short-term debt jumped by three percentage points to 20.7 per cent. The increase in bank claims on Latin America was the biggest half-yearly rise for eight years, while at the same time a reduction in deposits outstanding largely reflected the repatriation of flight capital. The largest new borrowings in Latin America were by Brazil (Dollars 2.2bn), Argentina (Dollars 1.2bn) and Chile (Dollars 0.9bn), which all saw a shortening of their maturity profile. Trade-related credits and, for Brazil and Argentina, the accumulation of arrears, were mainly responsible for the maturity shift. China's short-term borrowing fell to 38.5 per cent from 42.5 per cent and its public sector's share of the debt fell by seven percentage points, to 37.2 per cent. *Bank for International Settlements 'The Maturity and Sectoral Distribution of International Bank Lending.

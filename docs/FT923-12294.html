			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: A new twist to ease the slump When two doctrinal opponents agree that a simple tactical change could at the same time support sterling, encourage investment and reduce government spending, their argument surely deserves official attention. It seems unlikely to get it, though, because it runs against fashionable theory, and breaks one of the government's self-imposed rules. This proposed trick is simply under-funding the public sector borrowing requirement - selling bills to the banks rather than gilts to the pension funds. Last week Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu argued for it. Professor Tim Congdon has been promoting it for a long time past. Prof Congdon is a monetarist Liverpool Sixer, Mr Bootle a pragmatic supporter of the ERM, and this may be the first time they have agreed on anything. And their proposal has another merit which they both overlook. Mr Bootle's main case rests on interest rates. If the authorities sold bills aggressively, and starved the market of long dated paper, short rates might edge up, and so support sterling; and gilt yields would come down, which would ease long-term industrial financing, through bonds and equities. How much would rates move? Not at all, according to fashionable theory, since short rates are supposed to be a function of exchange rate expectations (despite the fact the Professor Charles Goodhart has shown that interest differentials are hopeless exchange rate predictors). As for gilts, the market would not respond to lower sales, according to the efficient market hypothesis, since it would know that higher sales would follow later. The fact is that under-funding was tried in America a quarter of a century ago, before we learned it couldn't work. It was known as Operation Twist (twisting the yield curve), and it did work. It would work again; the laws of supply and demand are more reliable than later elaborations. But it is hard to say how much rates would move, and harder to say how much it would matter. The US is stuck in the doldrums, despite a 3 per cent discount rate (and a heavy devaluation). What about the Prof Congdon case? This is based on the fact that under-funding would cause a large rise in M4, the main Congdon indicator which is growing much too slowly. Here there is no doubt about the effect: the rise in M4 is an arithmetic certainty. But would this prove anything - apart from Goodhart's Law, which states that when you fiddle the money numbers, they become meaningless? Remember that a decade ago we contrived a slump despite exploding money numbers. It is memories like this which no doubt inspired the present Treasury rule of full funding - a gilt or a savings certificate to cover every debt. Under this rule, government borrowing has no effect on the money supply. It might be called Congdon's Benefit, since it ensures that broad money is, for a change, a reliable indicator of private bank credit. But this interesting statistic is unduly costly, to taxpayer, the banking system, and to the house-buyer. The taxpayer suffers, as Mr Bootle points out, because if you believe, as the authorities say they do, that inflation and interest rates are falling, issuing long gilts at current yields is recklessly extravagant. As for the banks, their balance sheets have been debauched by their own folly and earlier official over-funding, when the Bank of England bought all their best credits and sold gilts to pay for it. Under-funding in present circumstances would be simple justice, and would enable the banks to rebuild a decent holding of government paper - if not the 70 per cent they held before Competition and Credit Control started two decades of monetary bungling. The banks are now sober, and under-funding would help make them sound - perhaps the biggest long-term benefit to confidence. The saving on public expenditure would be worthwhile, and painless. It's not a panacea, but it's the right thing to do.</p>

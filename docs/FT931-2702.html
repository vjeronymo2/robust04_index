			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US pressure for managed Japan trade A NEW voice yesterday joined the swelling US chorus demanding a form of 'managed trade' with Japan to counter that country's massive trade surplus with the US. Mr Derek Shearer, designated deputy undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, told a conference organised by the Economic Strategy Institute that the administration should 'junk' the structural impediments initiative, a key element of President George Bush's Japan trade policy, and negotiate 'results-oriented' import agreements, with targets for individual sectors. The prestigious Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations last month recommended negotiating 'temporary quantitative indicators' with Japan  -that is, a series of specific trade goals along the lines of the current semiconductor agreement. President Bill Clinton expressed interest in the approach when he later met members of the committee. The consensus developing in Washington is for negotiated Japanese market shares for sectors in which free market forces are blocked by formal, structural or cultural trade barriers. This would avoid Japan 'bashing', strengthen interdependence and recognise that most US trade problems are 'made in America'. Mr Shearer, a former Clinton campaign adviser, said the administration had not yet had time to develop an international economic policy for the post-cold war world. However, its Japan policy had to recognise that 'Japanese capitalism is different'; the US ought to be 'humble' about its capacity to change Japan in the way the Bush administration had tried through the structural impediments initiative. 'We need a results-oriented policy, but one in the context of a global partnership,' he said. Japan should be fully involved in the attempt to help Russia because its expertise and capital were badly needed. US-Japanese co-operation was also required as regards China.</p>

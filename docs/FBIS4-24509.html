			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  on Friday [27 May] issued a position paper accusing the major  opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of blindly  pressing for a temporary pension plan for senior citizens.    The sternly worded paper came out as the fifth and final day  of a sit-in staged by the DPP to campaign for old-age benefits  drew to a close.    Some 800 elderly joined the sit-in, during which the  protesters called on the legislature to discuss the DPP-proposed  "temporary rules for old-age benefits," which would enable the  Executive Yuan to immediately earmark special funds for seniors.  Such a temporary pension would be a transitional measure before  a permanent pension plan could be implemented, the DPP said.    Saying "a wrong policy is worse than graft," the KMT accused  the DPP of pushing its temporary pension plan even though it  knows it is unworkable. It added that the pledge the DPP made  late last year during local election campaigning to pay old-age  benefits was actually a disguised means of vote-buying.    During the election campaign, DPP candidates promised that  each person 65 years of age and older would receive a pension of  NT$5,000 (us$185.18) per month, regardless of their financial  circumstances.    The commitment, however, has resulted in a dilemma for the  DPP, as five of the six counties where DPP members were elected  magistrates late last year have been plagued by financial woes.    The KMT said the DPP has declined to admit wrongdoing for  fear of losing face and future elections. The position paper  said the DPP's pension campaign is actually an attempt to win  the Taiwan governorship, and pointed to the immorality of  treating the elderly as "stage properties of politics."    Moreover, it stressed, "it does not make sense for the KMT  to  endorse the election check drawn by the DPP."    Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh made an apology to  Taiwan's senior citizens, saying he regretted that the KMT did  not respond favorably to the sit-in.    Reiterating the DPP's determination to pay old-age benefits,  Shih pledged that the opposition party will continue to strive  for the welfare of the elderly. A reasonable distribution of  the nation's overall resources would enable the government to  take good care of senior citizens, he said.    As a follow-up to the sit-in, the DPP has decided to launch  a  large-scale demonstration on June 26 to promote the well-being  of the elderly.</p>

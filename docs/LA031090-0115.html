			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> EU WANTS TO SPEED VOTER REGISTRATION  </P> <P> Pointing out that California ranks 37th of the 50 states in voter  participation, Secretary of State March Fong Eu called for legislation to make  it easier for citizens to register to vote.  </P> <P> Eu told a state Senate committee studying ways to encourage more people to vote  that low voter turnout is a "national shame." She noted in the November general  election, only 53% voted, the lowest since 1924. Eu called for measures to  increase voter participation -- particularly among young people, new citizens  and people on the move -- including such steps as allowing people to register  while changing the address on their driver's license.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] State President Guntis Ulmanis has returned from his  visit to the United States. At a news conference, Ulmanis said  that in his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, they discussed the issue  of the problems of the Skrunda radar station. Special attention  was also paid to the Russian Army's Paldiski nuclear center in  Estonia and the Kaliningrad region as possible flash-points in  the Baltic region. The UN secretary general agreed that the  progress of the treaty on the Skrunda radar station must also be  monitored by this internatonal organization. The state  president also particularly noted that no one has reproached  Latvia for not observing human rights, and this problem was not  discussed.    It is possible that in a few years a conference of national  leaders could be held in Riga on the problems of disarmament and  the environment.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIET GROUP WANTS OFFICIAL RECALLED;  </P> <P> MEMBERS UPSET OVER WESTMINSTER COUNCILMAN'S REMARK  </P> <P> A leader of Orange County's Vietnamese community announced plans Thursday to  recall Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr., who voted to deny a parade  permit sought by a group of South Vietnamese military veterans while telling  them, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam."  </P> <P> "The Vietnamese community will not sit still for this," said Arthur Suchesk, a  spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee who pledged to  start the recall drive.  </P> <P> Fry's statement, made at a Westminster City Council meeting earlier in the  week, was racially insensitive, Suchesk and Vietnamese veterans have charged.  The armed forces day committee sought a parade permit and approval to block  traffic on busy Bolsa Avenue in Westminster's Little Saigon.  </P> <P> Fry, who joined three other council members who voted against the request, told  the group's representatives that they should commemorate their war dead on a  U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day or Veteran's Day.  </P> <P> "It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be Americans. If  you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam," Fry said. "That may  be unfair, but that's my opinion, and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of  people around here."  </P> <P> Fry made the controversial statement during the city's first council meeting to  be broadcast on cable television.  </P> <P> "His statements were uncalled for," said Tony Lam, a Vietnamese community and  business leader. "It's an insult. He's so naive to make that kind of a  statement. We're trying to be in the mainstream of America, yet, on the other  hand, we're trying to maintain our cultural heritage. That's why we work in  harmony. But that kind of a statement really breaks up the harmony."  </P> <P> The Orange County Human Relations Commission on Thursday condemned Fry's  comments and called for both an apology and a reconsideration of the parade  request after hearing from three representatives of the Vietnamese veterans'  group.  </P> <P> "The Orange County Human Relations Commission deplores the comments attributed  to Councilman Fry as an affront to the Vietnamese community and to the general  community," Commission Chairman Daniel Ninburg said in a statement issued after  the regular commission meeting.  </P> <P> "These remarks caused the issue before the council to be clouded by  emotionalism. We therefore urge Councilman Fry to apologize . . . and we call  on the City Council to reconsider its denial in an atmosphere free of  prejudiced comments," the statement continued.  </P> <P> The Westminster City Council voted 4 to 1 late Tuesday to reject the proposal,  which would have honored all soldiers who fought the Communists in Vietnam.  Only Mayor Charles V. Smith, a Korean War veteran, supported the parade.  </P> <P> Tien Nguyen, another committee member and former officer in South Vietnam's air  force, said the parade would have commemorated all Vietnam veteran "comrades in  arms," including those from New Zealand, the Philippines, Canada, Thailand, the  United States and South Vietnam.  </P> <P> "This has nothing to do with the issue of assimilation; it's just to honor  their dead and our dead. That's the issue here," Suchesk said.  </P> <P> The veterans' group plans to mobilize the Vietnamese community and mount an  "anti-Fry" campaign with demonstrations, stories in the Vietnamese-language  media and posters publicizing Fry's statement, Suchesk said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Fry, whose brash, off-the-cuff statements in the past have landed  him in similar embarrassing situations, denied that he is a bigot.  </P> <P> "I'm not a racist. My vote was a protest against some of the divisiveness we  now have in the city," Fry said, alluding to Westminster's growing Vietnamese  community, which has established its own aggressive business base but still  retains its cultural identity.  </P> <P> "I hate to see two of everything like we got going in this city," Fry said. "We  have two chambers of commerce, and we even have two Lions clubs."  </P> <P> Since 1975, when Vietnamese refugees left their homeland, thousands were  relocated to Orange County, where an estimated 100,000 Vietnamese residents  live. Vietnamese living in Westminster, a city of 75,000 people, make up almost  15% of the population.  </P></p>

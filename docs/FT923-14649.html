			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: US Prudential arranges Dollars 1bn Euro MTN programme PRUDENTIAL Funding Corporation, the finance subsidiary of Prudential Insurance of America, has established a Dollars 1bn multi-currency Euro-medium-term note programme in an effort to expand its institutional investor base in Europe. The programme, arranged by Merrill Lynch International, will be used as an alternative to the Eurobond market, where the Prudential, the largest US insurance company, has been a regular borrower. However, the fast-growing Euro-medium-term note market 'provides greater flexibility,' said Mr Martin Pfinsgraff, managing director of the Prudential corporate finance group. 'We (will be) able to access smaller windows.' Prudential, the largest US insurance company, has also increased the size of its existing Euro-commercial paper programme from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn. There is less than Dollars 300m outstanding on the programme. Last year, the company raised Dollars 700m in the Eurobond market, mainly in Canadian dollars, subsequently swapping the proceeds into floating-rate US dollars; but swap opportunities have been on the wane, and the company has raised only Dollars 250m in the Eurobond market so far this year. Overall, Prudential plans to raise around Dollars 700m this year, split between the Eurobond and Euro-medium-term note markets. The Euromarket is an attractive source of funding for Prudential, because, as a mutual company, it is not registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and so cannot tap the US corporate bond market. Last year, the company raised about Dollars 400m in the US MTN (medium-term note) market, but its main source of funds is the US domestic commercial paper market, where it is the ninth-largest issuer, with Dollars 6.6 to Dollars 7.5bn outstanding. 'We are aiming to reduce (short-term borrowing) as a percentage of our total debt,' said Mr Pfinsgraff. The goal is a ratio of one third long-term versus two-thirds short-term debt; the company currently has around 23 per cent long-term debt. However, the shift does not require any reduction in the total amount of short-term debt, as the company's overall funding needs are increasing.</p>

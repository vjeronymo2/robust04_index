The sources were reacting to comments by Muhammad Jihad, a  central committee member of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  maintsream Fatah faction, that the organisation had overcome the  crisis after receiving 29 million dollars in fresh aid from Arab  and other countries.    "What Muhammad Jihad said is untrue," said an Abu  Dhabi-based  PLO official, who requested anonymity. "The crisis is  continuing. We have not received our salaries for more than  eight months."    Several employees at the PLO missions in the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) and other oil-rich Gulf states, contacted by AFP,  confirmed they had not received their salaries since mid-1993.    They said a circular sent by the PLO's foreign minister,  Faruq Qaddumi, four months ago asking them to resign if they  want was still in force.    The PLO has been facing increasing financial problems since  the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states halted aid to protest  its sympathy with Iraq during its seven-month occupation of  Kuwait nearly three years ago.    GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and  the UAE -- were the main bankrollers of the PLO before the Iraqi  invasion, providing it with more than two billion dollars in  official aid. Billions of dollars have also been extended  through private donations from Gulf shaykhs and businessmen and  a five-percent tax on Palestinians living in the region.    Repeated attempts by the PLO to mend fences with the GCC  were  crowned with a reconciliation meeting between 'Arafat and King  Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh last week. Kuwait, however, has  said it will not deal with 'Arafat again.    The PLO's financial woes coincided with its peace accord  with  Israel, which could also be a boon in financial terms. The  September 13 deal has already won he PLO pledges for two billion  dollars in aid in the autonomous areas.    In an interview with Wednesday's UAE daily AL-KHALIJ, Jihad  had said the PLO had received 15 million dollars from Greece,  five million from Malaysia, three million from Indonesia, two  million from Turkey, two million from Algeria and around two  million from Saudi Arabia.    "The PLO has overcome its financial crisis," he said. "We  have disbursed two-month salaries for all PLO staff."</p>

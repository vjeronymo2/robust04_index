			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Tax man scores at accountancy firm Ian Barlow, 42, plans to get his fellow partners out on the road to boost their profile, in his new role as head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the final appointments of the new senior team at the UK's second-largest accountancy firm. He intends developing a strong marketing strategy and is considering ways of exploiting the growing trend towards self-assessment in tax returns. He also wants to explore means of using the 'balanced scorecard', the management technique to measure business performance using a variety of indicators, which he helped introduce to the firm. Roger White, his predecessor, remains senior UK partner and chairman of firm's international tax committee, but will increasingly concentrate on professional indemnity work at KPMG. Barlow will take responsibility for strategy, management and other executive functions. He has a degree in engineering sciences from Cambridge University, and is a chartered accountant with the Institutes in both England &amp; Wales and Canada. Finance partner for the firm's south east region in 1991-93, he first joined in 1973 and became a partner in 1985. His tax clients have included Granada Group, MFI Furniture Group, Nestle and Ratners.</p>

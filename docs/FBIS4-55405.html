			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Croatian and Bosniak delegations, in  addition to numerous guests from the diplomatic corps in Geneva,  were present at the ceremony to mark the Vienna agreement. At  the end of the month, according to the Zubak-Silajdzic  [Croat-Bosniak] agreement, the Vienna agreement will be crowned  with the election of the president and prime minister of the  federation and the passing of several laws on the constituent  assembly.    At a Croat-Bosniak meeting with the U.S. team, which  included, apart from Warren Christopher, Ambassadors Charles  Redman and Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the  Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council, thanked the U.S. side, which  is hoping for better coordination between the Croats and  Bosniaks in their international statements and during the peace  process.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President  [addressing Zubak], what did you say to Mr. Christopher?    [Zubak] I only said that we have once again confirmed--by  signing the Vienna agreements--the readiness of both peoples to  live together in a common state, but at the same time, we  indicated that we could solve our problems in a dignified way by  political means; this confirms that our two peoples can also  resolve, in this way, the problems with the third people  [Bosnian Serbs]. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you know what people are interested in  most? What is going to happen with the Serbs? Are they still  being offered entry into the federation or what?    [Zubak] They have already refused to, you know. They have  rejected the idea. We want to offer this to them every day, of  course. It was a serious offer. If I may put it this way, it  was a noble offer, after everything that has happened. They  have rejected it. Those representing the Serb aggressors at the  moment could be replaced by others. It is possible that we  could make very rapid progress in our work with some other Serbs  who want to live with us. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary commission test looms for Kinnock MR NEIL KINNOCK and the Labour leadership face a backbench revolt over their plans not to oppose the first stage of the boundary commission legislation in next Monday's debate. Last night the shadow cabinet agreed the party should not vote against the bill next week, but should make its points through amendments at the committee stage. The bill sets new statutory deadlines for completing reviews of boundaries and introduces more frequent studies. That would change constituency boundaries before the next general election, a move expected to benefit the Conservatives. The Labour frontbench argument for not opposing the measure next week is that there have to be boundary reviews because it is undeniable that the population has moved. The Opposition's task is to ensure that the legislation prevents the government from manipulating the process. Backbench rebels are planning to force a vote on Monday, and may try to carry out guerrilla tactics in the bill's later stages. Because it counts as a constitutional measure, the convention is that the government would not curtail debate, and that the bill would take up the time of the Commons itself instead of being considered by a committee. The move comes against a background of discontent from Labour spokesmen and backbenchers that Opposition parliamentary tactics have not yet proved particularly effective against the reduced Tory majority of 21. Some MPs also recall angrily that Labour gave a relatively easy run to the bill three years ago which extended the voting rights of expatriates. Labour's estimates put the effect of the boundary commission reports between a net gain for the party of four seats and a net loss of ten. Mr John Prescott, a shadow cabinet member and a contender for Labour's deputy leadership, said: 'Gerrymandering is an ugly word for a very ugly and anti-democratic manipulation of people's right to a fair election.'</p>

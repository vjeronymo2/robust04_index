			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A payment of qualified stated interest;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A payment of points deductible under section 461(g)(2),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of the issuer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A pro rata prepayment described in paragraph (f)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A payment of additional interest or a similar charge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided with respect to amounts that are not paid when due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debt instruments distributed by corporations with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to stock_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of distribution.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the issue price of a debt instrument distributed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation with respect to its stock, the instrument is treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as issued by the corporation for property. See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1275(a)(4). Thus, under section 1273(b)(3), the issue price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed debt instrument that is traded on an established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market is its fair market value. The issue price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed debt instrument that is not traded on an established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market is determined under section 1274 or section 1273(b)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The issue date of a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed by a corporation with respect to its stock is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aggregation of debt instruments_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments issued in connection with the same transaction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related transactions (determined based on all the facts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances) are treated as a single debt instrument for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of sections 1271 through 1275 and the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereunder. This rule ordinarily applies only to debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments of a single issuer that are issued to a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder. The Commissioner may, however, aggregate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments that are issued by more than one issuer or that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued to more than one holder if the debt instruments are issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an arrangement that is designed to avoid the aggregation rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., debt instruments issued by or to related parties or debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments originally issued to different holders with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding that the debt instruments will be transferred to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single holder).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception if separate issue price established. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of which is traded on an established market within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of &sect;1.1273&hyph;2(f); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of which is issued for money (or for property traded on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an established market within the meaning of &sect;1.1273&hyph;2(f)) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties who are not related to the issuer or holder and who do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not purchase other debt instruments of the same issuer in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with the same transaction or related transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule for debt instruments that provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of additional debt instruments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If, under the terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a debt instrument (the original debt instrument), the holder may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive one or more additional debt instruments of the issuer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the additional debt instrument or instruments are aggregated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original debt instrument. Thus, the payments made pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an additional debt instrument are treated as made on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original debt instrument, and the distribution by the issuer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the additional debt instrument is not considered to be a payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made on the original debt instrument. This paragraph (c)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies regardless of whether the right to receive an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument is fixed as of the issue date or is contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon subsequent events. See &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c) for the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain rights to issue additional debt instruments in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples illustrate the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Exception for debt instruments issued separately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to other purchasers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  On January 1, 1995, Corporation M issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two series of bonds, Series A and Series B. The two series are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold for cash and have different terms. Although some holders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase bonds from both series, a substantial portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonds is issued to different holders. H purchases bonds from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both series. Under the exception in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, the Series A and Series B bonds purchased by H are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Tiered REMICs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Z forms a dual tier real estate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). In the dual tier structure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Z forms REMIC A to acquire a pool of real estate mortgages and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a residual interest and several classes of regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests. Contemporaneously, Z forms REMIC B to acquire as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified mortgages all of the regular interests in REMIC A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REMIC B issues several classes of regular interests and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual interest, and Z sells all of those interests to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrelated parties in a public offering. Under the general rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all of the regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests issued by REMIC A and held by REMIC B are treated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single debt instrument for purposes of sections 1271 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1275.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rules for Treasury securities_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and issue date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The issue price of an issue of Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> securities is the average price of the debt instruments sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue date of an issue of Treasury securities is the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement date on which a substantial amount of the securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the issue is sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reopenings of Treasury securities_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional Treasury securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additional Treasury securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued in a qualified reopening are part of the same issue as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original Treasury securities and have the same issue date as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original Treasury securities. The issue price of both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original Treasury securities and the additional Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> securities is the average price at which the original Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> securities were sold. This paragraph (d)(2) applies to qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reopenings that occur on or after March 25, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional Treasury securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additional Treasury securities are Treasury securities with terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are in all respects identical to the terms of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury securities and that are issued (without regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section) not more than 12 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the original Treasury securities were first issued to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

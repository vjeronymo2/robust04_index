			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (2): The miracle seems to have faded - After the economic reforms, growth has begun to slow down THE Mexican economic miracle is looking less miraculous of late. The government can claim success in the battle against inflation: it should fall to 8 per cent or less this year from around 12 per cent last year. It has also managed to reverse the worrying growth of the current account deficit - from Dollars 22.8bn in 1992 it should fall to around Dollars 20bn this year. But this has come against a background of slowing economic growth. After three years in which the economy expanded by more than 3 per cent, growth slowed to 2.6 per cent last year and to under 2 per cent this year, falling short of population growth for the first time since the election year of 1988. Next year, thanks in part to a modest fiscal stimulus, the government is forecasting growth of 3 per cent. But this forecast looks at risk if the North American Free Trade Agreement is not ratified. Without the treaty - and assuming no big devaluation - higher interest rates will almost certainly bog down the economy. Seven years of economic reform then have yielded some results: President Carlos Salinas this month emphasised that investment had increased in his administration - from 17 per cent of GDP in 1988 to 22 per cent in 1992 - and that labour productivity had gone up by 19 per cent in the last three years. But there has been no take-off in growth. Some economists suggest this is a matter of time. Growth has been slow, they suggest, because of the rate in which the old capital stock has been destroyed by the opening of the economy since 1985 to the world markets. 'The process of reform has been more profound than previously estimated. That means that the economy was more inefficient before than anybody imagined - including the private sector,' said Mr Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance. While some economists argue that the rapid exhaustion of the country's old productive base may suggest that the trade liberalisation was too rapid, others place more emphasis on what the government has not done rather than what it may have done too quickly. There remain, says this group, significant bottlenecks to growth. These include poor infrastructure and a deregulation process which has yet to reach the state and local government level. They also blame a rigid labour market, a corrupt and inefficient judicial system which does not allow the enforcement of contracts and, above all, the high cost of bank credit. One pro-reformofficial argues that fundamental reform of the state-run electricity sector and the railroads is needed in the next six-year administration. The social security system is 'a time bomb for the next six years.' He adds: 'If the labour market is not deregulated, social security and health is not dealt with and infrastructure is not improved, we will have problems.' Whatever the case, the weakness of the economy in the face of reasonably high levels of investment - at least until this year when uncertainty surrounding Nafta inhibited it - coupled with insufficient levels of domestic savings, means Mexico will continue to depend heavily on foreign capital for some time to come. That being so, the room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy in the next administration will not be large, since international investors can be expected quickly to react adversely to economic policy of which they disapprove. The growth slowdown has other causes, slow world growth being one. From this perspective, some officials argue that Mexico's private sector performance looks less weak. Non-oil exports growing at an annualised 15 per cent in the first half of the year compared with world export growth of 0.2 per cent. Meanwhile, imports grew at an annualised 7.4 per cent rate. This has helped to bring down the current account this year, although some officials say that, if next year's higher growth materialises, the current account may again widen. Lower inflation may also have had an impact on business. Inflation has fallen faster than many businesses expected. This has left companies paying higher salaries than justified by inflation and has increased the real rate of interest which they are paying for credit. This has squeezed profitability and led them to reduce production. 'This was the first time in many years in which it proved costly to many companies not to believe the government's forecasts,' says one government economist. The slowdown was worsened further by the behaviour of the banks. Not only did high real rates of interest curb borrowing, but at the end of March, says one monetary official, many banks in effect stopped lending to the private sector - so they could repair the damage caused by bad debt problems. Since the first quarter, interest rates have fallen faster than inflation, with interbank rates falling from 23 per cent in February to below 16 per cent. With interest rates falling and companies now accustomed to lower inflation, the government is expecting the economy to pick up in the fourth quarter of this year. This should be helped, officials say, by the modest fiscal stimulus agreed in the annual pact between the government, business and the trade unions. This year's pact has several novel features: it brings down the annual salary increase to 5 per cent for next year, but allows for settlements above that in cases where productivity justifies it. Minimum salaries will rise by the same amount, but a negative income tax will raise take-home pay by close to 17 per cent for those on the minimum wage. The fiscal stimulus will come with the government's plan to balance its budget next year. This year the fiscal surplus was forecast at 1.7 per cent, but is now likely, say officials, to turn out at around 1.1 per cent, with part of the difference accounted for by lower oil prices. 'Because of the surplus, we'll be able to stimulate the economy without having to worry about inflation,' says Mr Ortiz of the finance ministry. If fiscal policy has been conservative, monetary policy has - says the central bank - been neutral: with an exchange rate target, it can do little but accommodate the demand for money. Although growth in the monetary base has been a modest 4.8 per cent in the year to August, below inflation, the central bank says changes in the cheque clearing system at the end of March suggest the monetary base has effectively grown close to 10 per cent. However, to some observers, monetary policy looks tight and for good reason: the government is anxious to avoid the kind of speculative attack on the peso that will force its hand on the exchange rate. 'One way to kill speculation is to dry up liquidity,' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, of the economic consultancy Ecanal. The central bank has done this and has continued ensure that technically speculators cannot attack the peso by selling it short. Short selling implies the selling of a currency by those who do not own it. The exchange rate has been essentially stable since the start of the year within a band which widens daily. At the end of this year, the permitted fluctuation will be 9.1 per cent. The exchange rate, widely considered to be overvalued, is in many ways the Achilles heel of the government's steady-as-she-goes economic policy in an election year. It looks to some economists particularly vulnerable if Nafta is not passed. Officials say they are determined to avoid the financial crises in their last year of office that plagued the previous three administrations. And they say (as they obviously would) that they will not use a deliberate exchange rate depreciation to stimulate the economy. 'We'd rather have zero growth and no devaluation than 3 per cent growth and a devaluation,' says a senior government advisor. To help it withstand a speculative attack, the government also has foreign exchange reserves of record levels - Dollars 23.02bn at end-October - which exceed the monetary base. Officials also say that the maturity of the peso-denominated debt held by foreigners has lengthened in the past two years - implying greater capital losses for those who wish to sell assets to attack the peso. Officials point out that the current account deficit remains more than financed by capital inflows, as shown by rising foreign exchange reserves and falling market interest rates. If the financial markets are getting nervous about the failure of Nafta, there is as yet no obvious sign of it.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Recovery at Woolworth stalls RECOVERY at Woolworth, the US retail group, stalled in the first quarter of the current financial year, when the company recorded earnings of just Dollars 1m after tax on sales of Dollars 2.13bn. In the same three months last year, Woolworth reported a Dollars 17m after-tax profit, on sales slightly lower at Dollars 2.09bn. Woolworth - which takes in several specialty chains, such as Foot Locker, as well as the namesake stores in the US - said operating profits in the three months to May 1 reached Dollars 26m, compared with Dollars 59m in the same period a year ago. The first-quarter profit translates into earnings per share of 1 cent, down from 13 cents in the first quarter of 1992. On Wall Street, Woolworth shares were down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 29 - close to the 52-week low - at the close. Within the group total, Woolworth said that its foreign operations, which range from Australia to the Netherlands, had slumped to an Dollars 18m operating loss, compared with a Dollars 2m profit a year earlier. Domestic operating profits were down from Dollars 57m to Dollars 44m. Mr Harold Sells, chairman, admitted the results were 'disappointing', and blamed 'weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence in the principal markets in which we do business'. However, he suggested that the group's major store redeployment programme should still help in the longer term.</p>

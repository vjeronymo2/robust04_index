			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Merger wave to continue - The US THE US aerospace industry is in the throes of a wrenching contraction as it struggles with the twin problems of a downturn in the civil aviation business and a shrinking US military budget. The result has been tens of thousands of job losses across the sector and, on the military side of the industry, a merger wave which still has a considerable way to run. The civil aerospace business should eventually recover, as the US and world economies shrug off their current weakness, but the end of the Cold War means the military contractors face a long, one-way decline in demand. US government spending on all types of military supplies is estimated to have dropped from a peak of Dollars 206bn in 1987 to Dollars 161bn last year and analysts expect it to fall to around Dollars 130bn by 1997. In previous US downturns, contractors have been able to ameliorate their difficulties by building up overseas sales, but the growth potential far from matches the scale of domestic cutbacks. North American companies divide equally on whether military exports will increase or decrease over the next four years, according to a new survey, conducted by consultants Ernst &amp; Young, of global defence industry attitudes towards the challenges facing the sector. This backdrop poses tricky strategic decisions for military contractors, who are being pushed by market forces either to acquire their rivals, and thus gain a leading position in a particular sub-sector of the market, or to sell out to companies which can achieve this critical mass. Those which delay too long risk being left out in the cold, facing a gradual slide to insignificance. An article late last year in the Harvard Business Review by Mr Jerrold Lundquist, of management consultants McKinsey, argued that 'today a dozen defence companies compete in six or more market segments. Tomorrow they will compete in two or three. 'Several large companies and scores of small ones will fold altogether. In 1992 there are 13 companies in the space segment and 16 vie for a slice of the avionics pie. By 1997 there will be only five or six in each group.' The Ernst &amp; Young study found almost all North American companies expect significantly more consolidation, with some 60 per cent expecting a large number of sub-contractors to leave the defence business. The industry's most aggressive deal-maker so far has been General Dynamics, until recently the second largest defence contractor, which has just sold its tactical military aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.525bn. The main product of the General Dynamics division is the F-16 fighter, output of which is now well past its 1980s peak, but it and Lockheed were already partners (along with Boeing) in the development of the F-22, a new generation of radar-dodging fighters. The Lockheed deal was only the latest in a series of disposals by General Dynamics which also included Cessna, the light aircraft manufacturer (sold to Textron) and its missiles operations (which went to Hughes Aircraft). Nevertheless, the latest deal took analysts by surprise because Mr William Anders, the General Dynamics chairman, had repeatedly insisted that tactical military aircraft was a core business he wanted to hang on to. Yet he had also complained that his efforts to buy businesses had been frustrated by the reluctance of rival contractors to sell off sub-critical operations. The largest single defence deal to date was struck last November, when Martin Marietta - a leading manufacturer of space launch vehicles, such as the Titan family of rockets, as well as military electronics, information systems and missiles - acquired General Electric's aerospace business for Dollars 3.05bn. The GE business supplies radar, sonar avionics and armaments systems, missiles system components and commercial satellites. The deal positioned Martin Marietta to become the leading US aerospace electronics supplier. However, buying a rival is only the first stage in building a successful business. The two sides have to be smoothly integrated. Martin Marietta, for example, recently formed six new sectors to align similar businesses and warned that it expected lay-offs as it continued the consolidation process. McDonnell Douglas, the largest US defence contractor of all, faces big problems in civil aircraft, where it has lost its position as the second-largest manufacturer in the world to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and on the military side of its business. There is a large question mark hanging over the fate of the controversial C-17 transport it has been developing for the Pentagon and which is way behind schedule and far over budget. In a letter to the company in early May, the Pentagon warned that unless the company takes 'immediate and aggressive action' to improve its management of the programme, the jet might be cancelled. Some congressmen would like to see the programme scaled back to only half the 120 aircraft originally envisaged at a cost of up to Dollars 40bn, while others would be happy to kill it. Apart from the C-17 and a bitter dispute with the government over who should pay for the cancelled A-12 programme, McDonnell's large military aircraft business, which includes the F-15 and the F/A-18 fighters, is solidly profitable and last year won some important new contracts, including an order from Saudi Arabia for 72 F-15s. However, the commercial business faces an extremely uncertain future. It is modestly profitable, after big cuts in its workforce, but it has not won any big new orders in almost two years and its product range - the narrow-bodied MD-80 and the wide-bodied MD-11 - is more limited than that of rivals Boeing and Airbus. It plans to build a new super-jumbo jet, the MD-12, but is so financially stretched it cannot afford to do so alone. Last year it tried to get partners among Asian nations to invest equity in the commercial aircraft business in return for part of the MD-12 manufacturing operations. So far, these efforts have been unsuccessful and the project has been put on hold until conditions in the airline industry pick up. Yet without the MD-12, many analysts question its long-term ability to survive in the commercial business. Boeing is also suffering from the recession, which is forcing it to cut 28,000 jobs, or a fifth of its employees, between the start of this year and the middle of next, while production on all its jetliners is being cut by an average of 35 per cent by mid-1994. For all that, a battened-down Boeing, with a share of around 60 per cent of the commercial aircraft market and a firm backlog worth around Dollars 83bn, should be well placed to take advantage of the next cyclical market upturn.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS ASSAIL VETO BACKING ISRAEL  </P> <P> Radical Palestinians said Thursday that a U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Council  resolution deploring Israeli actions in the occupied territories will encourage  repressive measures against Arabs living there.  </P> <P> "The U.S. veto . . . clearly represents the flagrant U.S. bias to Israel. It  encourages Israel to continue its repressive measures against the Palestinian  people," the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement.  </P> <P> "The veto also reflects the U.S. Administration's disregard of world opinion,"  it added.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Washington cast the only negative vote, blocking a draft resolution  that also demanded the return of property confiscated from a village in the  occupied territories where Palestinians have refused to pay taxes.  </P></p>

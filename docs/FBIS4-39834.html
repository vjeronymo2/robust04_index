			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- The 14th Russian  Army press center made public a declaration stating that "on 4  June the television station of the Dniester Republic broadcast  the sensational news that the commander of the 14th Army's  Tiraspol garrison, Colonel Mikhail Bergman sent a confidential  letter to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. According to  the television station, which allegedly has a copy of the  letter, Bergman demanded Grachev's consent in `deposing the  Dniester Republic's leadership.' The 14th Army command calls the  `intentional misinformation' broadcast by the television station  as an attempt to involve the Russian top leadership in the  current dirty political intrigues. The press center notes that  they contacted the Russian defense ministry and that no letter  has been received from Colonel Bergman. The defense ministry  also said that if such a letter had been received, it would have  been sent to General Lebed to take 'proper measures against  instigators.' The 14th Army commander was compelled to send the  Russian defense ministry the entire text of the letter allegedly  written by Bergman." "The analysis of the letter shows the  complicity of certain structures of the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic in destabilizing the social-political situation and the  justification of the extension of the state of emergency,"  states the 14th Army press center.</p>

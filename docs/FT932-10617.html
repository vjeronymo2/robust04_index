			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (8): Focus switches to high value - Profile / MacMillan Bloedel WORKERS in a sawmill in the British Columbia town of Port Alberni take 500-year old hemlock logs harvested from coastal rainforests and painstakingly cut them into posts measuring 4 1/8 inches by 4 1/8 inches and are typically 13ft long. The 'baby squares,' as they are called, are too small for US homebuilders. The posts are specially cut for the Japanese market, where expensive, light wood is prized in new homes, and beams are exposed, rather than hidden behind the wall board. Ancient trees are best for this market, because they provide high-quality 'clear' wood, free of knots and with highly compressed age rings that produce a very fine grain. They also return a good value to the mill. The 'baby squares' command about Dollars 1,200 per thousand board feet, compared with about Dollars 335 for the same measure of standard grade 2x4s used in US homes. When the wood reaches Japan, it might be milled further, cut into strips of thin veneer to cover posts of the same dimension. The Port Alberni mill and several others like it are owned and operated by MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest integrated forest products company. Last year MacMillan abandoned the traditional business of sawyering  -making utility-grade lumber for the North American market - and has focused its wood business on high-value products such as baby squares, and trim, window casings and cedar-based patio products for sale in North America and Europe. The switch to specialty products has as much to do with natural resources as it does with the market. Although timber in British Columbia is viewed as a renewable resource, MacMillan Bloedel's supply of high value old-growth coastal timber - mostly cedar, fir and hemlock - is declining. The company's foresters estimate a 50-year supply of the old timber remains. However, MacMillan's rights to cut the remaining old trees have become entangled in controversy with environmental activists. and the company is at risk of losing chunks of its projected harvest. Other BC timber companies are facing similar conflicts. Last month the company saw its potential cut in the scenic Clayoquot Sound area of western Vancouver Island reduced to 600,000 cu m a year from 900,000 cu m in a controversial provincial decision. The potential impact to MacMillan's bottom line is CDollars 10m, according to Mr Robert Findlay, the company's president. The impending 'loss of fibre,' as the company refers to the situation, has prompted the company to do the most with what it has. 'There is less and less old growth timber,' says Mr Jim Chisholm, manager of MacMillan Bloedel's North American lumber marketing. 'We have to take what fibre we have and do more with it.' The solid wood business was MacMillan Bloedel's profitable side last year, with half of its Dollars 3bn in sales in lumber and building materials. MacMillan often sells wood to a remanufacturer and then sells the resulting product through its global distribution system. 'We sell the product twice, and we make more money,' Mr Chisholm says. The high value and remerch- andising strategy seems to be paying off. Where in 1970 the company averaged Dollars 100 in income per 1,000 board feet of lumber sold, it now averages over Dollars 1,000. However, as its own harvest narrows, MacMil- lan is engaging more and more in lumber merchandising, a lower margin business. The company is also looking beyond the coastal rainforest, and is aggressively pursuing 'engineered' wood that may eventually replace old timber for structural uses. In 1991 it entered a joint venture with a US firm to form Trus Joist MacMillan, which currently produces four different manufactured wood products in 14 plants across the US, and has global marketing reach. With only Dollars 300m in annual sales, the venture is far from outpacing MacMillan's more conven- tional operations. MacMillan Bloedel's Vancouver-based management got a new set of shareholders in February when Noranda Forest, which for 12 years had owned the controlling interest in 'MacBlo,' sold out in a public offering to investors in Canada and Europe. The sale allowed MacMillan to cut free of the financial uncertainties associated with Noranda, a subsidiary of the debt-plagued Hees-Edper corporate empire owned by Canada's Bronfman family. The 55.5m-share, CDollars 1bn offering was oversubscribed, despite the fact that MacMillan Bloedel, squeezed by declining pulp and paper prices and rising environmental costs, is coming out of two years of losses. Buyers took the stock in three-part instalment receipts, for the equivalent of Canadian Dollars 17.50. Analysts say the shares were popular because they are an indirect investment in the rocketing lumber market, and a gamble that newsprint prices may be near bottom. Mr John Johnson, a Vancouver-based lumber industry analyst for Richardson Greenshields, forecasts 1993 earnings at 70 cents per share, and 1994 earnings of Dollars 1.50 per share, a big improvement over the company's Dollars 48.8m or 42 cents per share loss in 1992. However, with the company's stock price now above Dollars 20 and lumber prices off their February peak, Mr Johnson has downgraded his recommendation on the stock to a 'hold', from a 'buy.' The company squeaked out an operating profit of about CDollars 7.3m in the first quarter, the first in nine quarters. Mr Findlay is realistic about the full-year outlook, saying it will mirror the first quarter. 'Up, but nothing spectacular,' he says, noting the company will benefit from better prices for lumber and cost controls in pulp and paper. The unprofitable pulp and newsprint business represents more than 50 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel's Dollars 3.5bn in assets. Mr Findlay says the company has made remarkable strides in becoming more competitive in those areas. However, the overburdened pulp market is beyond his control. 'It will come around in time. In this type of industry you have to weather the storm,' he says. In British Columbia's mountainous forests, MacMillan Bloedel is king, but it is dwarfed by other North American forest products companies such as Weyerhaeuser. It does not dominate any of its industries, and is subject to pressures from lower cost producers in most of its business segments. The company's pulp and paper revenues fell to Dollars 819m last year, for an operating loss of Dollars 8.6m. Since 1988 its newsprint production has dropped 34 per cent, and market pulp production is down 24 per cent. Just as pulp prices began to slump, Canada imposed strict clean water regulations on pulp mills, forcing a Dollars 350m effluent control programme on MacMillan Bloedel,which has diverted investment capital from other areas. 'That was a capital investment that did not generate income,' notes Mr Eric Lauritzen, MacMillan Bloedel vice president for pulp and paper marketing. But he says some of the environmental costs were offset by plant rationalisations and labour negotiations that reduced worker costs. He points to a modest rise in newsprint costs last quarter as an indicator that the pulp and paper recession may be moderating. With the pulp business heavily dependent on exports to Europe, he expects prices to improve only after capacity shake-outs and a European economic recovery. Both, he concedes, will take time. MacMillan Bloedel also has exposure to Europe through its 16 per cent ownership of one of the continent's largest paper companies, NV Koninklijke KNP, which last quarter merged with two other Netherlands companies to form KNP BT. MacMillan recorded a Dollars 5.7m loss on its KNP BT stake in the first quarter.</p>

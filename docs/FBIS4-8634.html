			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--In connection with the  NATO air strikes against Serb targets around Gorazde, Colonel  General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the general staff of the  Yugoslav Army, has stated that "such NATO air force action can  undeniably have unforeseeable consequences for peace in the  Balkans and Europe."    In an interview to be published in the POLITIKA daily  tomorrow, Gen. Perisic said that "in the case of further air  strikes against Serb territories, there is a danger of an  escalation of the war to an uncontrollable degree."    He said that "the NATO air strikes against Serb territories  around Gorazde complicated the military and political situation  in former Bosnia-Herzegovina", and that this action "encouraged  the supporters of the war option and worried those who carry  peace in their hearts."    "I particularly wish to stress that this is an act of  aggression against the Serb people, who have a legitimate and  natural right to self-defense guaranteed by the UN Charter."    The Yugoslav Army chief of staff stressed that "the Yugoslav  Army has continuously and attentively been following  developments after the NATO air strikes", and that it has been  taking "all necessary measures for the protection of the  territorial integrity of our country."    "In the case of a possible violation of the air space of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the army will take actions in  accordance with the rules of its combat operations," Gen.  Perisic said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 March (XINHUA) -- Recently, the  Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the  General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] have jointly issued the "Circular on Commending the Units  Advanced in the Army-Civilian Joint Activity of Building  Socialist Spiritual Civilization" and have called on all  localities and PLA units to launch the Army-civilian joint  activity of building civilized units in an even more profound  and realistic manner in a bid to provide spiritual motivation  and intellectual support for reform, opening up, and  modernization.    The "circular" states: Since the third plenary session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, advocated by Deng Xiaoping and  other veteran proletarian revolutionaries, the Army and the  civilians throughout the country have extensively launched the  Army-civilian joint activity of building socialist spiritual  civilization to meet the demand of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, thereby achieving fruitful results. In  his report to the 14th National CPC Congress, Comrade Jiang  Zemin demanded that "greater efforts should be made to launch  such mass activities as the Army-civilian joint activity and the  police-civilian joint activity of building civilized units in  order to implement the building of spiritual civilization down  to grass-roots organizations in both urban and rural areas." In  order to implement the series of instructions given by the CPC  Central Committee on strengthening the building of the socialist  spiritual civilization, to meet the demand that the PLA units  should march in the van of the society in building spiritual  civilization, and to continuously deepen the Army-civilian joint  building activity, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central  Committee and the General Political Department of the PLA have  decided to commend in October this year a number of units  advanced in launching the Army-civilian joint building activity.    The "circular" stresses: Those grass-roots units which have  scored remarkable achievements in the army-civilian joint  activity of building the socialist spiritual civilization should  be recommended for commendation. Major conditions are: The  units whose Army and local leaders have attached importance to  the activity, whose organizations are perfect, and which have  plans and specific measures for joint building activity; the  units that have launched the activity closely around the  principle of training a new generation of people who are  politically aware, morally sound, well educated, disciplined,  and that have effected an obvious improvement in the ideas,  morality, and cultural expertise of their soldiers and  civilians; the units that have adapted themselves to the new  situation of building the socialist market economic structure,  have continuously created and summarized new experiences, and  have played an exemplary role in building spiritual civilization  in their own areas; and the units where Army and local personnel  learn from and support each other and the relations between Army  and local personnel are harmonious.    The "circular" demands: All localities and all PLA units  should regard the process of recommending advanced units for  commendation as the process of profoundly and realistically  launching the Army-civilian joint building activity, should  conscientiously research and draw up plans and measures for  deepening this activity under the new situation, and should  further mobilize the initiative of the vast numbers of soldiers  and civilians in participating in this activity.</p>

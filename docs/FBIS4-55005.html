			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The UN resolution and the NATO ultimatum represent  only a dead letter on the paper and the flagrant deceit by the  international community that the civilian population of the free  territory of Gorazde will be protected. Nothing contained in  the decisions adopted by the Security Council and NATO has been  respected in the free territory of Gorazde. A real hell reigns  here. Is indeed a pity that reputable world press and  television agencies have not come here to film the suffering of  the unarmed people.    The attempts by the citizens from local communities and the  villages of Kopaci, Uvjeri, Vran Potok, Causevici, Kazlagici,  Zubcici, Zuzevo, Milanovici, Brijez, Pticino Polje, and other  areas in the 3 km zone to return to their houses have all been  in vain.    The evacuation of the seriously wounded children has not  been  going according to plan either. We do not know whose mistake it  was, but a three-year-old boy, Adnan Azovic, was not on the list  of those evacuated to a modern hospital. He is seriously ill.  Permission for his evacuation was obtained a year ago and yet  he is still in Gorazde. His parents have medicines, [name  indistinct] for only two more days. This medicine means life to  him. If he is not evacuated, his childhood will end forever.  Therefore, we again appeal to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and  all international medical organizations to secure the evacuation  of the seriously ill children from Gorazde.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Afrikaners make quiet U-turn to face future: Deep in the Orange Free State, Patti Waldmeir finds racist rhetoric but pragmatic action SINCE the Boer Republic of the Orange Free State was founded by Afrikaner pioneers in the 19th century, there has never been a shortage of racists in the land between the Orange and the Vaal rivers. Even today, as black and white South Africans join hands at national level over a new multi-racial constitution, the Free State can regularly be counted on to show that racism is alive and well in the new South Africa. Sit down at any bar in any dorp (town) in the Free State, and the racist rhetoric flows as liberally as the rum and Coke: defend the African National Congress, and you will be told the black man is not fit to govern; condemn apartheid and you will learn that it was the only policy which could prevent civil war; welcome the imminent abolition of segregated town councils, and provoke defiance. If you are a foreigner - or worse, a South African liberal - extra efforts will be made to outrage you: eventually, someone will tell a crude joke about a black and a dog, or a black and a monkey, with no prizes for guessing which comes out on top. So the Free State confronts the new South Africa with a swagger and a bellow, promising to launch a new Boer war against blacks - and to win it, this time. But behind this facade of racist bravado, even the most belligerent Free State farmer is quietly making his peace with the multi-racial future. In the bar of the Friesland Hotel, in the tiny dorp of Koppies, with its orderly, empty white streets and its vast dusty black township nearby, Mr Sakkie van der Schyff recounts with pride the story of the Koppies blockade. Earlier this month, hundreds of whites penned the black residents of Kwakwatsi inside their township, and shot anyone who tried to leave (wounding eight blacks). Mr van der Schyff, whose grandfather was a member of the pro-Nazi Ossewa-Brandwag during the second world war, commanded operations. Police did nothing to stop it. Mr van der Schyff is confident the blacks of Kwakwatsi deserved their fate: they had staged an almost total boycott of white shops for a fortnight (the fourth boycott this year, not to mention six work stayaways), they had burned down a warehouse at the local showgrounds, they were refusing to pay for the electricity, sewerage and water provided to Kwakwatsi - in short, they had exhausted the patience of white Koppies, which fell back on the old apartheid methods to suppress them. But the blockade of Koppies is far more likely to prove one of the last battles of the old war, not the beginning of a new racial conflagration  - and Mr van der Schyff knows it. As much as anyone, he has started to make his peace with the new reality. When squatters from Kwakwatsi stole the fencing from his farm, which borders directly on the township, and began to graze their cattle in his field of young sorghum, Farmer van der Schyff could simply have shot them, in the time-honoured tradition of the old South Africa. Instead, he used the tools of the new South Africa, negotiation and compromise, to strike a deal with his neighbours to allow them to graze their cattle in his winter fields (forfeiting thousands of rands he could have earned by selling the stubble as feed) in exchange for keeping their stock out of his fields during the summer growing season. He declares himself satisfied with the trade-off. Like many right-wing Afrikaners, 35-year-old Mr van der Schyff exhibits a confusing mixture of defiance and resignation. With the same breath that he promises never to give in, he avers that the political eclipse of the Afrikaner is the will of God. He would not consider leaving his farm to emigrate to the Afrikaner homeland demanded by right-wing political parties, and seems surprisingly relaxed about the advent of Nelson Mandela as president, so long as whites retain a share of power What Mr van der Schyff most fears is communism - and he listens carefully to me as I assure him that this is not the current agenda of the ANC. He would do better to listen to the remarkably moderate vice chairman of the local ANC branch, Mr Solly Mayekiso. Scarcely days after the violence of the blockade, this was his message to white Koppies: 'We understand the fears of these people (whites). But there is the table: let's sit down and talk and we might come up with a viable solution. . . Co-operation with the other side will be the key word in future.' Mr Mayekiso is grateful for the improvements in township life since the ANC was unbanned in 1990: blacks no longer need enter the post office by a separate door; they can use the library (though there are sometimes problems); theoretically, they can swim in the local pool, though right-wing threats have made this impossible in practice. And he cautions that the ANC must control the expectations of its people, arguing that developing Kwakwatsi will be a slow process even after blacks gain power. Over the next few months, the ANC's desire for reconciliation with whites - and the Afrikaners' pragmatism - will be put to the test as Pretoria forces the abolition of white local councils in towns like Koppies. They are to be replaced with multiracial councils (half white and half black) charged with jointly administering the black and white neighbourhoods of each town ahead of local government elections within 18 months. Whatever the progress at national level - where parties could soon reach agreement on a fairly liberal multi-racial constitution - the impending battle of the tax base between white towns and their black townships will loom largest in the minds of ordinary South Africans. Mr Charl van der Merwe, deputy mayor of Koppies, says the town's 1,000 whites will refuse to subsidise the 15,000 residents of Kwakwatsi, which has no paved roads, only communal water taps, corrugated iron shacks and bucket toilets in many areas. The township must be upgraded - but central government must pay. In the end, though, numbers will triumph, and blacks will gain control of the Koppies tax base. Mr van der Merwe knows that, Mr van der Schyff knows it, and Mr Mayekiso too: chances are they will find a way to live with that truth in peace. They have no choice.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / PowerGen to close two plants POWERGEN, the UK electricity generator, yesterday announced the closure of two power stations with the loss of 440 jobs. The company said the stations were 'inefficient and increasingly unprofitable'. The 33-year-old Ferrybridge B station in West Yorkshire and the 34-year-old Hams Hall C station in Warwickshire are due to be shut in November next year and their output taken on by new installations under construction. PowerGen has emphasised that replacing coal-fired power stations with gas-powered plants is a significant part of the company's efficiency drive. News of the closures follows PowerGen's announcement on Tuesday that it had awarded the contract for construction of its Pounds 290m gas-powered station in Hertfordshire to Siemens, the electronic and electrical equipment supplier. That plant is due to start up in 1994. In addition, the company's 900MW Killingholme gas-fired station is due to start up in October next year. PowerGen said staff levels at the two stations it is closing will start to be run down from April next year. Some workers will be offered jobs elsewhere in the company, and other jobs will be lost through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy. Mr Malcolm Edwards, commercial director of British Coal, warned against increasing the UK's energy bill by a rising reliance on imported fuel. Mr Edwards said that if the short-term view of power station fuel requirements persisted, it might result in a big rundown in the industry.' Only British Coal will sign a long contract for a large supply of fuel with prices in sterling and guaranteed to stay within the UK retail prices index.' Power workers vote on offer, Page 12</p>

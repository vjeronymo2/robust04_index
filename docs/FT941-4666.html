			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Book Review: Just a phase they went through A CONSERVATIVE REVOLUTION? THE THATCHER-REAGAN DECADE IN PERSPECTIVE Edited by Andrew Adonis and Tim Hames Manchester University Press 261 pages, Pounds 35/Pounds 12.99 'The United States and Britain have together been the greatest alliance in the defence of liberty and justice that the world has ever seen.' So said Margaret Thatcher in New York in August 1991, placing upon record a staggering example of her starry-eyed lack of deep analysis of such terms as 'liberty' and 'justice'. Since the Suez fiasco in 1956, there has been no mistaking the axiom of Britain's statecraft: in the end you have to do what the Americans want; so best find out in advance what it is, and make sure you do it. Parallelism between British and American policy was never clearer or closer than during the near contemporary regimes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, when it seemed also to reflect a personal sympathy. Certainly, without 'the American factor' it is hard to account for Britain's consent to submergence in a united Europe or for the direction of government policy towards a united Ireland at Ulster's expense. Since Mrs (now Baroness) Thatcher's departure, any personal factor has been removed. So a book 'to explore perspectives in Anglo-American conservatism in the Thatcher-Reagan decade', congealed out of a seminar at Nuffield College, Oxford, in late 1991, is timely, even though two-and-a-half years have elapsed. Parallelism there certainly was. In part this is attributable to that worldwide cross-infection of political thought and vocabulary which condemned both America and Britain to see evidence of national decline in the collapse of Keynesian orthodoxy and in the depressing global comparative statistics of productivity and balance of trade. But the search for hard evidence of 'the greatest alliance that the world has ever seen' proves on the whole abortive. The book suffers from the weakness of all symposia: the different voices seem to be saying their own thing without visibly taking account of one another. All the more impressive is the unanimity with which the contributors converge on essentially the same conclusion: circumstances were similar but the causes different in the two countries. It all has to do with the generational nature of politics - the electorate reacts to a continuously changing memory of the world through which it has lived. That emerges with startling clarity from what is the centrepiece of the book: a brilliant analysis by Andrew Adonis of the transformation of Britain's Conservative party in the 1980s in terms of class and self-perception. This 'brought to the fore a Tory elite more assured in its rapport with the electorate and more confident in its ability to sustain its support than any in the party's modern history'. It was that altered electorate, an electorate which no longer remembered the 1930s or the wartime years, which gave the Conservative party the conviction that it could reverse the consensual policies pursued by Macmillan and (after his celebrated U-turn) by Edward Heath, and the self-confidence to administer repeated doses of the same medicine. The corresponding American analysis of 'Republican elites under Reagan and Bush' by Professor John R Pitney inculcates the same generational message: 'A new generation' had 'grown up when the New Deal order seemed to be going senile . . . in their world view the 'liberal welfare state' was not a popular hope but a discredited relic'. By 1980 'the (Republican) party's establishment was in deep trouble, and the unravelling of the New Deal consensus which they represented during the 1960s confirmed their downfall'. 'Moderate Republicanism,' says Prof Pitney, 'had supported civil rights for blacks; but the racial violence of the mid-1960s destroyed the national consensus on civil rights and created a new electoral cleavage based on race. 'Moderate Republicanism represented anti-communist interventions overseas; but the Vietnam war and the domestic upheaval it brought in its wake fatally undermined the national consensus on foreign policy issues that had existed since the late 1940s. Finally, state interventionism in the economy and the maintenance of the welfare system were undermined by the advent of higher rates of inflation and the concomitant squeeze on middle-class incomes.' Does it not all sound familiar, like a description of the way in which the Conservative party in Britain had 'run downhill' between 1952 and 1974? An American electorate had arisen which did not know the immediate postwar years. These years 'were the high water mark not just for Big Government but Big Business and Big Labour as well. Vietnam, Watergate and other upheavals both deepened their dissatisfaction with existing institutions and highlighted alternatives to hack politics', adds Prof Pitney. It is no business of a symposium to arrive at any very profound conclusions; but the outcome of this study ought to be reassuring. One of the great laws of politics is that nations and societies may be relied upon to 'revert to type'; and here exposed is the mechanism by which that happens. Thatcher and Reagan were the beneficiaries of a generational conjuncture. This precession of the generations continues remorselessly: what was thinkable becomes unthinkable, and what was impracticable becomes practicable. We lived to see in Britain an electorate in the 1980s which was prepared calmly to jettison the political presumptions of the 1950s and 1960s. We could yet live to see an electorate in the US which will reject the facile assumptions of its country as world policeman. Generation by generation, the electorate turns upon its axis: be patient. The author was a member of Harold Macmillan's cabinet between 1960 and 1963</p>

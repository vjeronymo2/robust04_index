			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): UK funds hesitate to leap in the dark - The progress of quantitative management LONDON'S QUANT scene is hotting up. A number of new quantitative managers, such as Pareto Partners, Quorum and Barr Rosenberg European Management, have opened up, joining the slightly longer-established operators like PanAgora and GMO Woolley. Many of these have American connections. Domestic leaders include clearing bank subsidiaries like County NatWest Investment Management and Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management. These dominate the basic quant product area of index funds. And there are clear ambitions on the part of several houses to move into higher value added sectors, involving active, rather than passive, management, for which much higher fees can be charged. But British pension funds appear to be rather cautious. Quant managers seek to exploit electronic technology and statistical analysis to achieve enhanced investment performance. Index management is still in a growth phase. Its characteristic is that it involves large economies of scale so that, untypically of investment management in general, indexation has become concentrated amongst a few large players. The UK market leader is BZWIM, which has been putting on new business at the rate of Pounds 1bn or more annually for the past few years. It now runs almost Pounds 10bn in indexed portfolios tracking various equity and bond indices. It is estimated that about 15 per cent of the assets of UK pension funds are now indexed, formally or informally. There is still some way to go to reach the US indexed proportion of more like 25 per cent; the US penetration has changed little for five years, suggesting that it represents something of a natural ceiling, which may also eventually apply in the UK. Indexation is a cheap, low-risk option for pension fund trustees disappointed by traditional active managers. This is no strategy for trustees aiming to top the performance league tables, but it has obvious appeal for those fed up with featuring in the fourth quartile. For more ambitious clients, however, the quants have plenty of second-generation products. Some of these are bottom-up stockpicking systems, which aim to add several percentage points a year to investment performance without adding risk. There has also been a lot of emphasis recently on top-down models to control tactical asset allocation - basically, bond-equity switching  - and handle currency exposures for global portfolios. County NatWest has found UK pension fund clients for its Value-Based Investment Service, an asset allocation system. But generally its more advanced and weirdly-named products, like Dynamic Currency Hedging and Ratcheted Multi-Bond Option (call it Rambo for short), are only selling in Japan and the US. Japanese houses have become quite keen on quant. Nikko's London asset management arm, for instance, has this year launched a so-called Return Reversal Fund, aimed at exploiting stock rotation effects in the Tokyo market. But it has not been fortunate with its timing. Several of the US-owned houses in London are basically selling global products back into America. Pareto, which has only been running for about a year, but is backed by Mellon Bank, has already won over Dollars 2bn of currency overlay business, mainly from US pension funds. Mr Ronald Liesching, a director of Pareto, suggests that many US institutions may already have becoming disillusioned with 'black box' stockpicking products, some of which have had enough time to go wrong for American clients. 'Those approaches which have been devised to fit history are shortly doomed to join it,' he says. In the UK, he adds, quant is only making very slow progress. In fact, there are signs that continental European clients are more receptive, being ready to make the quantum leap from low-performing life assurance contracts or Swiss bank fiduciary accounts to state-of-the-art high technology investment products. In contrast, British pension funds have generally received excellent returns from traditional balanced managers in the 1980s, and have little reason to take a leap in the dark. Barr Rosenberg is nevertheless trying to sell to UK as well as continental funds, seeking to exploit the poor relative performance achieved by British managers in US and Japanese equities. Ms Jennie Paterson, the firm's marketing director in London, tends to play down the technological wizardry. She describes Barr Rosenberg's method as 'using an expert computer system to duplicate the thought processes of the typical investment manager'. British pension funds have been 'very receptive to the idea' but have yet to sign up. Certainly, active quant has had an uncertain reception in the UK. There was the example of Lazard Investors, which imported an American value-based system in the late 1980s just when growth stocks were beginning to take off and value stocks wilted. Lazard dumped the system at the end of 1990 in favour of a traditional style, with which apparently it has enjoyed considerable success. Nevertheless, some active quant products have begun to achieve a breakthrough. Hill Samuel Investment Management, for instance, a few weeks ago picked up a Pounds 50m account from the Cable and Wireless pension fund. It will run the UK equity portfolio, using its established quant product called Active Value Management. HSIM has now built up a five-year record for AVM, outperforming the All-Share Index return by some 4 per cent a year on average, albeit with some significant short-term fluctuations. AVM portfolios now total Pounds 360m. Mr Alan Greenhorn, HSIM's quant director, says: 'Many quantitative managers are single-factor strategists. With AVM, we do not expect any one strategy to be successful for ever.' Various tilts have been used in practice over the five years, starting with high asset value, then moving to high overseas earners, with a recent shift from high to medium market capitalisation. This restless search for new values and insights could be said to be true of quant management as a whole. And with computer brainpower and memory capacity becoming ever cheaper, no traditional manager can afford to ignore the trend.</p>

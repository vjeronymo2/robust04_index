			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Waiting This Fall"] </F>   [Text] This year's budget bill is a meager one. Despite  that, it is opening a new chapter in the economic debate. The  question from now on is not how we will overcome an economic  depression but how we will manage and take advantage of an  upswing.    Even Hans Tson Soderstrom, the most pessimistic of all  economists in 1993, stated on Monday [10 January] that he no  longer feared a self-reinforcing economic depression in Sweden.  "It is quite obvious that we are not following the Finnish  pattern."    The 1990 tax reform put money in people's hands, enabling  them to pay down their excessive debts from the 1980's  considerably faster than the Finns could. As a result, domestic  demand is now going to rise again at the same time that the  volume of exports is soaring.    How can the forces of inflation be kept in check until  1995-96 so that Sweden's economic recovery will last? That ought  to be the main question when this spring's economic judgments  and decisions are being made. Uncertainties should be removed to  the extent possible so that companies will venture to expand  their capacity in plenty of time. The main thing here is a quick  yes vote in the referendum on Swedish membership in the European  Union. The Riksdag and the government must also show that they  are able to get state finances under control. In that respect,  Minister of Finance Wibble's third budget is inadequate. It is  an election year budget, not because of what it proposes but  because of what it omits.    It is true that the state is expected to borrow less in the  coming fiscal year than it did in this one (220 billion kronor  compared to 270 billion). Bank subsidies, lagging payments to  the municipalities, and so on will disappear. But the national  debt will continue to climb at a terrifying rate. It passed 1  trillion kronor in the fall of 1993. It will pass 1.5 trillion  kronor in the fall of 1995, at which time it will equal 100  percent of our total gross national product.    Experience in the few Western countries that have gone even  higher than that -- Belgium, for example -- shows that the state  will lose all room to maneuver. If drastic steps are not taken,  fear of inflation will increase, and interest rates will rise  along with it. External borrowing by the state will increase the  money supply. Domestic borrowing will increase the competition  for loans with businesses that are investing again. So the  upswing will be brief, whereas what we need is lasting growth to  bring down unemployment.    The government is pleased overall with what it has already  done during this term of office. The additional savings being  proposed in the budget are marginal: slightly less unreasonable  child allowance levels for families with five or more children,  a maximum price of 25 kronor instead of 10 kronor for medicines  beyond the first one on a prescription, a few hundred kronor per  year in individual contributions to dental insurance, and a  slight restriction on home-language instruction.    The opposition is continuing to talk about incentives  instead  of savings, although Ingvar Carlsson has now hinted that a lower  VAT [value-added tax] and an end to inflation goals may not be  the right medicine as we approach an industrial boom.    It is true that employment must increase, for one thing just  to get public finances back in balance. But this does not apply  to tax-supported employment. According to the preliminary  national budget, the upswing in industrial production will have  a bigger indirect effect on private services dependent upon  industry than was previously thought. It is estimated that the  number of people gainfully employed in industry and private  services will increase by 105,000 during 1994 and 1995. A  continuation of that trend needs to be ensured at the same time  that the drop in construction is halted, employment obstacles  and beginning wages for young people are reduced, and new  supplementary means of financing social services are developed.  The amount of the ATP [general supplementary pension] cash  benefit needs to be reduced and the resulting margin used to  introduce long-term health care insurance.    But neither a hastily suggested government goal of 4-percent  economic growth nor vague opposition nonsense about jobs is any  help. The important thing is to get into a permanent pattern of  good cycles. This means that the probable boom from 1994 to 1996  must be taken advantage of to make active decisions for keeping  the national debt from increasing in relation to GNP.    Four government veterans -- from the Social Democratic,  Moderate, Liberal, and Center Parties -- recently told VECKANS  AFFARER the kinds of steps that need to be taken: reduce  illness, unemployment, and parents' benefits to 70 percent of  their present levels, abolish the allowance for the first child  (the state's cash subsidy to families with children has risen  steadily since 1985 from 19.8 billion to 48.7 billion kronor),  cut back on road and railroad investments, and reduce housing  subsidies. In addition, unemployment insurance, which still has  a deficit of 34 billion kronor, will have to paid for through  higher individual contributions, as will the pension system.    It is to be hoped that Anne Wibble and Goran Persson both  know what is waiting this fall. But by this spring, the  government will need to come up with at least a new long-range  estimate regarding a realistic course of action for restoring  public finances. That is something that is entirely lacking in  the unfinished budget.</p>

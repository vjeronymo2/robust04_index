Moreover,  he stressed that Japan and the United States should return their  economic relations to a stable foundation by overcoming a sense  of mutual distrust over such issues as an introduction of  objective criteria and by holding constructive discussions  within several weeks (prior to the Japanese-U.S. summit talks  scheduled to be held in February).    On overall Japan-U.S. relations, the ambassador explained  that both countries are focusing their attention only on  economic competition and that light is not being shed on  cooperation that both countries are carrying out in various  areas, including aid to Russia, the peace process in Cambodia,  and environmental issues. He said that tension exists between  the two countries because they are unable to maintain a balance  in their relations. He also pointed out that an important task  is how to create a balance in their "competitive and  cooperative" ties.    The ambassador then pointed out that a growing number of  people in the United States no longer "feel that Japan poses a  threat" and that they are becoming optimistic about Japan-U.S.  relations thanks to noticeable changes in which the "United  States regained confidence but Japan lost confidence" following  the U.S. economic recovery in the past six months under the  Clinton administration. He explained his belief that Japan-U.S.  relations have started to change.    Moreover, Ambassador Kuriyama said that Japan is also to  blame for the economic tension that exists between Japan and the  United States. He added that he has no choice but to admit that  Japan's insufficient structural reform during the time when the  yen was strong created a big gap between purchasing power parity  and the market exchange rate.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan oil deal back on track One of the biggest-ever oil deals, on which negotiations have been stalled for nearly a year, is back on the drawing board and a decision is expected in the next few months. Mr Heydar Aliev, president of Azerbaijan, has decreed that negotiations restart and a contract be signed with a seven-member western consortium for the exploitation of multi-billion dollar reserves in the Caspian Sea. Mr Aliev is in London this week for talks with Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, as well as with British Petroleum and other oil companies. The Azeri president earlier this month dramatically raised the status of the negotiations when he put the Azeri State Oil Company back in charge of the talks with the consortium and told it to conclude a deal as soon as possible. The heads of the companies' delegations have been summoned to talks in Baku, the Azeri capital, on Friday. Mr Aliev has also decreed explicitly that the western advisers, including leading law firms and accountancy companies, should again be retained to advise the Azeri government on the terms of the deal. The consortium sees this as the most promising move for some months, underlining the seriousness of the Azeri side and making more likely an agreement to which both sides could assent. After coming to power last year Mr Aliev slowed down negotiations and removed the Azeri company from direct responsibility, Now, however, a series of events are forcing his hand. The war with Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh within Azerbaijan has gone badly for the Azeris, with 20 per cent of their territory now in Armenian hands and over 1m refugees living in camps around Baku. Mr Aliev, speaking in the capital over the weekend, said that it was now taking 'an ever increasing part of our spending' to feed the people and keep the war going. A major platform in the Gneshli field, the main production field now in operation, collapsed recently and cannot be replaced because the cost is prohibitive. The amount of oil brought ashore by the Azeri State Oil Company is set to decline rapidly, because lack of maintenance has allowed a gas cap to build up. Added to this, separate negotiations between the Azeri government and Lukoil, the Russian state oil company, appear to have concluded - though Mr Aliev would not confirm this - that Lukoil will take a 10 per cent stake in the consortium - that 10 per cent coming out of the 25 per cent stake originally reserved for the Azeri company. Though there were fears that the entry of the Russians would complicate the issue, the western partners - which include, besides BP, Statoil, Penzoil, Amoco and Ramco - now believe that it will make the deal more stable. Russia, whose influence in Azerbaijan has grown, was in a position to exercise considerable pressure and could have blocked one possible pipeline route out of Azerbaijan.</p>

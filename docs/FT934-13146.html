			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heaviest trade in Rothmans THE spotlight in the market yesterday fell on Rothmans International 'B' stock, which recorded its most active ever trading session ahead of the company's restructuring into two separate groups that takes effect on Monday. A ruling by the Stock Exchange means that new shares issued by Rothmans and Vendome, following the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods empire, will not be included in the UK stock market indices. Several large blocks of shares were sold early in the session, with dealers pointing to index tracking funds, which have been sellers for most of this week, taking advantage of the strong market trend to exit the stock. However, most of the shares on offer were quickly mopped up by the income funds eager to take advantage of the big yield premium in the stock and it was that demand, accompanied by a buy recommendation from Smith New Court, which led to a squeeze around midday, sending the shares climbing 32 to a day's peak of 629p. Profit-taking during the afternoon saw the shares surrender some of the earlier gain to finish 24 ahead at 621p. Turnover rose to a hefty 19.1m, against the stock's daily average of around 500,000.</p>

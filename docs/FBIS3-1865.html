Sun Shangqing, a noted economist and director of an economic  research center directly under the State Council, said the  Chinese Government will transform some existing large and  medium-sized enterprises into joint-stock companies within three  to five years.    As for small state-owned enterprises, the management can be  contracted out, leased or auctioned, he said.    He said the current reform drive will push these enterprises  into the market to become more competitive and to grow into  independent legal entities which should have sole responsibility  for gains and losses.    He held that the country will maintain macro-control over  the  joint-stock companies and it can convert income from leasing and  selling into investment to launch new state-run enterprises.</p>

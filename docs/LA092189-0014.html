			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MELONES DAM BENEFITS  </P> <P> Maybe the expression "out of sight, out of mind" could be used to explain the  miscalculations and inaccuracies presented in The Times' editorial ("Savoring a  Dam Decision," Sept. 3) denouncing the value of the New Melones dam. But in all  fairness to your readers and the numerous beneficiaries of this project, I feel  those benefits bear repeating.  </P> <P> In your editorial you say that the New Melones dam, located on the Stanislaus  River, "provides very cheap power for a small number of Californians."  </P> <P> The fact is power generated by the dam goes into the Central Valley Project  power pool and is then sold to provide power for millions of Californians. New  Melones generates enough electrical power to meet the annual electrical needs  of approximately 72,000 households.  </P> <P> The New Melones dam also provides significant water releases to improve water  quality in the south delta; has saved millions of dollars in avoided flood  damage costs; offers numerous recreational and fishery opportunities, and  supplies necessary interim flows in the Stanislaus River for fish and wildlife.  </P> <P> All of these benefits, of course, are in addition to 180,000 acre-feet of water  supply available for municipal and agricultural uses.  </P> <P> It should also be noted that the New Melones project provided significant  assistance during the last three dry years, and is now being used as a water  source to replace declining ground water tables in surrounding counties, and in  some areas to fight sea water intrusion.  </P> <P> Let me remind the editor that in 1974 the voters of California had the  opportunity to pass an initiative thereby designating a stretch of the river  where the New Melones dam is located as wild and scenic. That initiative was  defeated.  </P> <P> Finally, your readers may be interested to know that New Melones dam merely  replaced a dam originally built in 1926 by two area irrigation districts.  </P> <P> As you can see, the existence of the New Melones dam, as well as many other dam  projects throughout the state can be easily justified.  </P> <P> JOHN P.

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Priorities for EC growth AT THEIR WEEKEND gathering in Belgium, most European Community finance ministers had two purposes uppermost in mind. The first was to show the Community is still somehow on track for economic and monetary union by the end of the decade, despite the emergency widening of currency fluctuation bands in August. The second was to develop a strategy for economic recovery, without which any plan for improved monetary co-ordination - let alone the much more ambitious target of irreversibly fixed exchange rates - will founder. The ministers are a long way from accomplishing either objective. But by apparently placing greater emphasis on the second aim rather than the first, they seem to be drawing sensible conclusions from the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. Ministers stressed the need to restore convergence of recession-hit EC economies, but rejected rigid targets for a return to greater exchange rate stability. This order of priorities is a necessary - but not sufficient - condition for eventual resumption of the annual 3 per cent growth rates needed to bring down unemployment. The ministers wisely put aside the earlier idea of reintroducing narrow ERM bands on January 1 1994. Instead, the system will continue indefinitely in its new flexible form. ERM members thus have more opportunity to tailor their monetary policies to their own needs rather than to Germany's. Countries which have not yet made use of their flexibility to make more aggressive cuts in short-term interest rates should be preparing to do so. The French government argues that, by not responding to the August widening of bands with greater monetary easing, it has sustained sufficient credibility to enable long-term French interest rates to fall to German levels. In spite of the strains of unification, yields on long-term German debt are now just below 6 per cent, for only the third time in 25 years. However, precisely because of France's achievement in reducing its inflation rate to well below Germany's, real long-term interest rates in France, as in most other EC countries, are still too high. An important pre-condition for the necessary further fall in capital market interest rates, in Germany and elsewhere, is that Germany itself reaches long-delayed convergence with most of its EC partners by reducing its inflation rate to the Bundesbank's 2 per cent target. To prepare the way for recovery, EC governments need to reassert fiscal control and to implement growth-generating measures. One welcome sign is the effort many EC countries are now making to cut rigidities in labour markets. As Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, stated at the weekend, a quick EC escape from recession is unlikely. But by re-establishing the primacy of economic reality over political vision, the Community is helping to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, will be sustainable.</p>

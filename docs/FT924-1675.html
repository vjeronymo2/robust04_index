			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / West split on using force in Bosnia THE US yesterday called for 'more aggressive measures' by the international community against the Bosnian Serbs, but other countries opposed military intervention in the Bosnian conflict. In Paris, a French junior foreign minister, Mr Georges Kiejman, said the US was proposing pre-emptive bombing of Serb targets in an effort to halt the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems, but France and Britain opposed such a move. They backed interception and, if necessary, destruction of Serb aircraft violating the UN Security Council's ban on flights over Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, did not deny such measures were being discussed at the UN and elsewhere, but stressed no agreement had yet been reached. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, said yesterday he backed the use of force if necessary but it was vital the EC and UN continued to act together. He told parliament: 'The French government does not rule out any solution to bring the massacres to an end.' Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of state in the outgoing US administration, addressing the 29-nation conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva, made no mention of a pre-emptive bombing proposal. But he specifically referred to the US and other governments' recommendation that the Security Council authorise enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia and re-examine the arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina. He said it was essentially the Serbs who had broken the promises made at last August's London conference on the former Yugoslavia, which included commitments to ensure unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, to lift the siege of cities, to halt all military flights over Bosnia, to place all heavy weapons under UN monitoring and to shut down all detention camps. 'It is clear the reckless leaders of Serbia, and of the Serbs inside Bosnia, have convinced themselves the international community will not stand up to them and will be forced eventually to recognise the fruits of their aggression.' Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, counselled caution on military measures to enforce the ban on flights and came out firmly against a lifting of the arms embargo in favour of the Bosnian Moslems.</p>

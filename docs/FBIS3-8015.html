			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We have learned from well-informed circles that  President of the Republic Michal Kovac has accepted the  resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. Although TA  SR [News Agency of the Slovak Republic] has not issued this  report yet, the secretariat of Roman Kovac confirmed it.  Ludmila Bulakova interviews Roman Kovac:    [Bulakova] If someone is leaving office, it is appropriate  to  clear the desk. You can attempt symbolically to do something  similar by clarifying some questions connected with your post as  deputy prime minister. Many have been surprised by your  rebelliousness--you have always been considered in general as a  soft person who has been brought into the world of big politics  by Vladimir Meciar. That is why some hold it against you that  you publicly stood up against his line. Such practice is  foreign to advanced democracies. [passage omitted] What was the  famous last straw that broke the camel's back?    [Kovac] I think it was the meeting with the deputies (in  Plachtincie) where it was quite clear that we had slowly lost  the ability to persuade people about the strengths of our  policy. [passage indistinct]    [Bulakova] I will revert to your open stand against the  official line of the prime minister because your former party  colleague and former ambassador to Austria, Rudolf Filkus, also  began by criticizing the government policy as an official party  representative. That met, at that time, with a controversial  assessment, not only in the camp of the commentators but also  among politicians. It is not a habit in the European countries,  which we would like to join, for an official representative of  the government to criticize its policy. Resignation first and  then criticism is considered a better way. You, despite the  aforementioned experience with Rudolf Filkus, chose the opposite  direction. Why?    [Kovac] I should like to correct this. My stand did not  result in any fundamental criticism of the work of the  government. I criticized the political situation into which the  government had gotten--that is the crisis in parliament or  simply the will of the parliament to pass important bills--that  is the cooperation of the parties, or possible cooperation of  political entities proved untenable. And, together with the  deputies, we proposed a certain solution that, I admit, was a  very untraditional solution but could have calmed the political  situation temporarily. I indeed thought it would create a  government of experts, which would have bridged a certain period  up to the early elections. The early elections would have  cleared the political scene. This proposal could have been  reasonable from Slovakia's point of view, not from the viewpoint  of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], not from the  point of view of the existing government, but from the point of  view of Slovakia.    [Bulakova] The prime minister says about you that you have  betrayed not only him but also the movement by having  discussions behind his back not only with the opposition  political parties but also with the president. There even was a  rumor that you were a candidate for the future prime minister of  the temporary government.    [Kovac] I have stressed many times that the proposal we came  up with was not a traditional one, and, naturally, it had to be  discussed. In fact, we discussed it within the official  boundaries of the parliamentary deputy group. If you speak  about the possibility of treason and the possibility of the  deputies who were or are dissatisfied with the situation in our  country, even the deputies who are in the movement, one has to  stress two points: One point is when the deputy deviates from  his election program, and the second is when the election  program is not fulfilled. [passage omitted]    A new political entity should bring new principles into  political work and be open-ended, which means that its fate  depends on further talks, which appear very promising indeed,  with other political entities, and the aim should be setting up  a strong center bloc because I think that, in this transitory  stage, center politics could lead towards success.

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel prices crash to 6-year lows as stocks rise NICKEL PRICES crashed to fresh six-year lows on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as stocks reached a record. Metal for delivery in three months fell through the Dollars 5,000-a-tonne level to close down Dollars 109 at Dollars 4,913.50 a tonne, equivalent to Dollars 2.23 a lb. Stocks in LME warehouses rose by 1,322 tonnes to 97,104 tonnes. Mr Angus MacMillan, of Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said that the fall reflected 'a combination of ever-worsening fundamentals'. The first half had seen strong consumption of nickel by the stainless steel industry, tight supplies of stainless steel scrap and less metal exported from the CIS. This led to a draw-down of LME stocks in June, which fell from 96,000 tonnes to 85,476 tonne at the beginning of this month. But exports from the CIS had resumed just as stainless steel scrap was becoming readily available, said Mr MacMillan. 'The downward pressure will be maintained,' he predicted. 'We are heading for 100,000 tonnes of stocks this autumn.' Mr William Adams, analyst with Rudolf Wolff, said the market had been looking to trade down. 'There's not an awful lot of optimism around at the moment,' he said, putting support at Dollars 4,800 a tonne for three-month metal. Lead prices held steady after overnight news that Doe Run's lead smelter at Herculaneum, Missouri had ceased production over the weekend because of the flooding of the Mississippi river. Analysts told the Reuter news agency that other lead mining and refining facilities in the area might be threatened by the floods, although they are not as near to the river as the Herculaneum smelter.  ------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium         +1,500   to   1,922,100 Copper              -100   to     456,725 Lead              +1,625   to     265,550 Nickel            +1,332   to      97,104 Zinc                +400   to     706,500 Tin                  -10   to      20,415  -------------------------------------------</p>

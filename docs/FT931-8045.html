			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Renault-Daf project switches to France THE planned Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m Excel van project between Renault of France and the collapsed commercial vehicle maker Leyland Daf is to be taken over by Renault. Production of the vehicles, intended to replace Leyland Daf's 200/400 models and Renault's Trafic range by 1995, will be moved from Birmingham to France before the year's end. Final negotiations on the transfer are under way between Renault and Leyland Daf administrative receivers. A formal agreement is expected early next week. The remaining 190 Leyland Daf employees working on the project - 80 were made redundant on Tuesday - have been offered continuing employment until the move to France. It is unclear whether the French vehicle maker, one of Europe's largest, will seek another partner for the project. Renault and Daf NV signed an agreement to develop the Excel range in 1989. The plan was for Leyland Daf to build its version at Birmingham's Washwood Heath vans plant, with Renault producing its vehicles at Batilly, eastern France. Each side had spent about Pounds 45m up to the time of Daf's collapse. Management at the vans plant, led by managing director Allan Amey, are continuing efforts to assemble a management buy-out of the mainstream vans operation, with the advice of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Job losses will mount across France in the first half of this year as industry continues to cut costs and prune investment, according to the latest business survey by Insee, the state statistics institute, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris. The rise in unemployment, after last year's 5 per cent increase to 2.98m people, will keep consumer confidence and spending depressed, the survey says. There is also little hope of a recovery in industrial expenditure. The 2,000 companies questioned expected an overall cut of 4 per cent in industrial investment this year. Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy tone of the Bank of France's business survey published on Monday and follows Thursday's news that the Insee industrial production index fell in December to its lowest level for four years.</p>

A well informed source in the  Azerbaijani president's staff told Interfax that Moscow would  like to help Baku protect the Azerbaijani section of the CIS  borders.    The same source noted, however, that the inviolability of  the  Azerbaijani border with Armenia was the most important issue at  the moment. "We demand the territorial integrity and  inviolability of our borders," Geydar Aliyev stated during the  talks. "Azerbaijan will work to ensure this," he added.    Aliyev also demonstrated Azerbaijan's readiness for  constructive cooperation with Russia in the protection of  Azerbaijan's external borders.    Both Aliyev and Nikolayev stated that their countries  advocated peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict.</p>

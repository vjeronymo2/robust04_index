The amount of funding actually available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including both direct and indirect costs). Grant applications that exceed the $300,000 per year cap will be returned to the investigator as non-responsive. Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both direct and indirect costs). New awards are expected to begin on or about September 1, 1995. Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated by investigators at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected in the continuation application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, continuation awards will be eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs depending upon the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purposes of this program are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.

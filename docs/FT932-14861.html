			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: GEC is also on British Rail's track Sir, In his letter, 'BR should use leasing finance to buy British' (April 13), Mr Hugh Bayley MP says that ABB is the only British company that has the ability to produce modern aluminium bodied railway carriages. This is incorrect. GEC Alsthom is currently building aluminium bodied trains for British Rail. These trains are being supplied to Network SouthEast where priority is being given to replacing old rolling stock. GEC Alsthom does not itself manufacture aluminium body shells, which represent only about 10 per cent of the cost of the trains, preferring to source these from outside suppliers, including ABB's factory located in Mr Bayley's York constituency. If GEC Alsthom secures orders for either InterCity or Network SouthEast trains, ABB will be given the opportunity to compete for the supply of body shells and other equipment. On the other hand, if British Rail asks ABB to supply new trains, GEC Alsthom will offer to supply traction drives and power supplies which ABB does not manufacture in the UK. Like Mr Bayley, I am hopeful that British Rail will soon be allowed to acquire new rolling stock to help underpin the future of the British Rail transportation manufacturing industry. Douglas Gadd, GEC Alsthom, PO Box 70, Mill Road, Rugby, Warwickshire</p>

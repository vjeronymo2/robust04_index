			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Beijing switches track on HK CHINA said yesterday it hoped Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport could be built before 1997 and held out the possibility of future Sino-British co-operation over the transfer of the colony. In a marked change in rhetoric, Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, was reported in the pro-Beijing New Evening Post yesterday as saying China and Britain had many issues to resolve on the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. He said they should be dealt with by the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the Anglo-Chinese forum set up to deal with the details of Britain's withdrawal from Hong Kong. JLG talks have been stalled since October last year when Governor Chris Patten made public his proposals for a more democratic Hong Kong. Mr Lu also said that he still hoped the colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15.8bn) airport could be finished before British administration ceased in 1997. He said that Britain had to adhere to the memorandum of understanding, signed by the British and Chinese prime ministers in September 1991 - something the Hong Kong government has said it has done all along. Over the past week, senior Chinese officials have sought to moderate the somewhat emotional response which has characterised China's reaction to Mr Patten's publication two weeks ago of legislation for more democracy in Hong Kong. In a further move to draw back from the brink, China's top central banker, Mr Li Guixian, said in Beijing yesterday that China welcomed British investment in China from companies which were 'co-operative'. A week ago China said British interests in, and trade with, China could be put at risk by Mr Patten's actions. Mr Patten has yet to set a date for the beginning of the legislative process to ratify, or modify, his plans for political development.</p>

Representatives from the seven coalition parties held tough  negotiations throughout the day.    A compromise emerged during the talks that revenues from the  "national welfare tax" proposed by Hosokawa be solely spent to  finance welfare-related expenditures and the rate for the new  tax be discussed by parties at a consultative body, coalition  sources said.    However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], which  threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet unless  its demands for amendments to the new tax are met, urged that  discussions on the issue last two years, while the government  insisted on one year, the sources said.    The Finance Ministry stuck to its demand that the rate for  the tax be specified in a tax bill, they said.    Hosokawa announced early Thursday morning the creation of  the  7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services, to be  introduced in April 1997, to finance 6 trillion yen in proposed  tax cuts in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax.</p>

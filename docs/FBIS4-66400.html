This makes it  possible for all nine utility companies throughout Japan, with  the exception of Okinawa, to participate in a local  telecommunications system. The circuits among these companies if  connected into what has been described as a "utilities-based  Shindenden," it could become a "Second-Tier NTT." The "utility  company threat" is taken seriously by the telecommunications and  broadcasting industries, now combining their own efforts, if  only because the utility companies already are well supplied  with equipment, such as regular power lines to expand  communication circuits.    During a recent "incident," the communications industry,  including NTT, charged the utility companies with taking the  first steps toward creation of a "utilities-based Shindenden"  with the intention of dominating the national market. The Tokyo  Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) based Shindenden, Tokyo  Telecommunications Network (TTNet), in February 1994, requested  permission to link up with its adjacent "utilities-based  Shindenden" at a meeting of an advisory study group labeled "The  Study of the Status of Link-up for More Versatile Services." The  study group is under the Director of the Telecommunications  Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT).    TTNet has been operating the business and household  telephone  services, but their area of operation has been limited to  customers in the region TEPCO serves with their electricity. For  example, in Shizuoka Prefecture, which includes territory west  of the Fuji River, Fuji City, which is located east of the Fuji  River, cannot be directly connected with Shizuoka City which is  located west of the river. Neither can TTNet be connected with  Fukushima and Niigata Prefectures where TEPCO's nuclear power  plants are located. In order to work around such inconveniences,  TTNet requested approval of link-up with adjacent operators.    Each utility-based Shindenden is at present operating mainly  business lines, exclusively used for communications within their  own company. However, if all of the utilities-based Shindenden  were linked with an expanded telephone service network, they  would establish a nationwide network comparable to a "Second  NTT."    NTT President Masashi Kojima indicated the possibility of  the  utility group becoming a major counterpart to NTT at a press  interview by stating, "The utilities-based Shindenden will  eventually link up among themselves. So the future  telecommunications market will be divided into NTT and its  counterpart group."  <H5>  Advantages Over "Optical Fibers" </H5>   In response to the "utility companies threat" theory now  circulating, utility companies are busy describing the charge as  "exaggeration." "Utilities-based Shindenden are simply  small-scale communications companies and not utility companies.  They cannot be anywhere near big enough to be rivals."    The communications business can be divided into two major  areas. One is general purpose telephone service and the other is  exclusive business lines which connect company headquarters and  their branch offices. The telephone market is estimated to reach  &yen;5 trillion and the business lines are a &yen;500 billion  market.    However, in reality, a majority of the operation of even  TTNet, which was established early on, is aimed at exclusive  lines, a business whose market share is rather frugal. Only  10,000 telephone lines were subscribed, only 0.05 percent of the  approximately 20 million line capacity of the TEPCO jurisdiction.    TTNet's FY92 pretax profit reached &yen;4.4 billion, a  cumulative deficit of &yen;14.1 billion. Sources close to MPT  commented coolly, "Business is tough even in the metropolitan  area. Local utility companies are simply entering the  communications business under pressure to please local  businessmen and officials."    While such a situation exists, utility-based communications  companies still seem to be pushing for business as they have  high hopes for the advantages of optical fibers. For example, a  single optical fiber 0.1mm in diameter can handle 23,000  telephone lines.    Nowadays, many offices are being equipped with computers.  Demand for high quality imagery and high speed digital  transmission keep increasing. Potential applications of optical  fibers, including company TV conferences and imagery supervision  systems for medical facilities are enormous. The uses of optical  fibers for individual homes will include telephones, and also  make it possible to transmit high quality imagery and sound  through CATVs and HDTVS.    Utility group communication companies which originally began  in business using mostly optical fibers can in this regard  actually compete with NTT.    The utility industry assumes a humble posture, insisting  that  the potential of their communications business has been  "overestimated." However, they have not discarded their hopes of  penetrating the field for household customers as they ride with  the current tide of new media and multimedia.  <H5>  Rivalry Between MITI and MPT Also Seen Behind the "Threat </H5> Theory"    In the background of this Shindenden threat theory, rivalry  between the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which  is the supervising agency for the utility industry, and MPT  which controls information communications policy, is seen. Some  MITI officials have complained about MPT not approving link up  of the utility group Shindenden saying, "MPT is aiming at  dividing NTT at the local level. If MPT approved the link-up of  the utilities-based Shindenden, it will be hard for them to  divide NTT."    On the other hand, MPT officials made conservative  statements  about the future of a utilities-based Shindenden by saying. "It  is hard for a utility-based Shindenden to obtain private  telephone customers to improve business. It will have to be  limited to a special area including exclusive business lines and  portable hand-held phones (PHP)." Others said, "The  utilities-based Shindenden will be able to provide channels for  CATVs and build up the strength to eventually compete with NTT."  MPT wants to encourage local group-based communications  companies to be competitive in order to avoid NTT's monopoly,  but at the same time they fear that MITI's domination over the  local utilities group-based communications companies might end  up becoming too great if they become prosperous.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Liberian children 'facing starvation' THE lives of 7,000 malnourished Liberian children are in jeopardy unless access for relief supplies from neighbouring Ivory Coast is reinstated, the London-based charity Save the Children warned yesterday. The country's peace plan, which calls for supervision of road traffic to prevent gun-running to civil war factions, is blocking relief supplies to areas where people are starving. The United Nations has told Ivory Coast authorities shipments of food and medicine to rebel territory must wait - apparently until UN inspectors arrive to monitor traffic and prevent shipments of arms to the rival factions. Mr Nicholas Hinton, director general of Save the Children, called on the UN 'to act immediately to put observers in place on the border. . . It seems utterly bizarre, and is a matter for deep concern, that children's lives should be threatened at the very time when they were hoping for the benefits of peace.' Aid agencies, including the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, were told by Ivory Coast last weekend they could not cross the border into parts of Liberia held by rebel leader Charles Taylor. UN agencies and private relief organisations say at least 250,000 people are in danger of starvation in central and northern Liberia. The International Red Cross estimates hundreds of children are dying every week in areas controlled by Mr Taylor. Under an agreement signed on July 25 to end Liberia's 3 1/2 -year-old civil war, all factions are to be disarmed and confined to rehabilitation camps by an expanded Ecomog West African military force, under the supervision of a UN observer mission.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions THE RECENT Ministry of Defence decision not to award the Trident re-fit program to Rosyth Dockyard has not dampened Lord King's enthusiasm for shares in Babcock International, which had hoped to manage the project. His recent purchase of 300,000 brings his total holding to more than 1m. Earlier this year, Allan Smith and Sir Frank Gibbs (a non-executive director) also bought more than 57,000 at around 34p. Taunton Cider came to the market just over a year ago and has performed steadily. Five directors, including the chief executive and finance director, have sold a total of 1,630,800 shares at 197p. These transactions were the board's first sales since coming to the market. Shares in Menvier-Swain Group have performed steadily over the past two years. Dominique Martinie, an executive director, has almost halved his holding from over 260,000 to just over 130,000 since March this year. The most recent sale of 110,000 was at 600p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                No of Company                     Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Brown (N)                   Stor       200,000      752            1 Capital Gearing             n/a          3,266       13            1 Densitron                   Elns        50,000       19            1 Ellis &amp; Everard             Chem        45,622       95            1* Gardiner Group              BuSe       350,000       89            1 Halma                       EngG       109,600      285            2* Hill &amp; Smith                EngG         9,500       15            1 Hunting                     EngA        10,000       25            1 Johnson Matthey             Metl        71,500      327            1* London Merchant             Prop        14,000       14            1 McKechnie                   OthI        20,000       85            1* Menvier Swain               Elcs       110,000      660            1 Rights &amp; Issues Cap         InTr         3,250       12            1 St Ives                     Pack        26,200       75            3* Taunton Cider               Brew     1,630,800    3,213            5 Tinsley (Eliza)             Metl        65,000       61            1* Vodafone                    Tele        71,000      314            1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argyll                      FdRe         5,000       15            1 Babcock Intl                EngG       300,000      109            1 Dudley Jenkins              Misc        55,000       35            3 Mercury Asset Mngmt         OthF        10,000       57            1 Reliance Security           BuSe        10,000       12            1 St James Place              OthF        60,000       82            2 Witan Inv Trust             InTr        60,000      120            3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

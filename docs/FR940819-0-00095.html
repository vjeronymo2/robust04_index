			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision for augmented cabin crews is designed to reduce fatigue by decreasing flight attendant work load on a flight and by providing an extended rest period following a long duty day. Although the FAA recognizes that the provision will not require flight attendant crews to be augmented proportionally for each aircraft type, it provides the least complicated method for reducing fatigue and accommodating certain operational requirements. Therefore, in this final rule, the FAA adopts the provision for augmenting cabin crews on a flight or flights with a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours but not more than 18 hours, and scheduled duty periods that do not exceed 20 hours for duty periods that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments from AMR Combs, Delta Airlines, and RAA, this final rule contains no provision to except an operator from meeting minimum augmented cabin crew requirements when a flight attendant duty period is scheduled for more than 14 hours in operations that require a flight attendant. This includes instances in which a required crewmember is not available following a layover, e.g., due to illness or injury. Additionally, the use of an approved passenger seat is required for operators that schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours on aircraft that are not configured with a flight attendant jumpseat for the additional flight attendant(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to AMR Combs' comment regarding the use of flight attendants in Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft, this final rule applies to operations that require a flight attendant. Typically, Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft are not configured with more than 19 passenger seats and a flight attendant is not required to be on board. Therefore, flight attendants assigned to such operations are not subject to the duty period limitations and rest requirements in this final rule. In addition, operators have the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Deadhead Transportation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466(m) and 135.273(m) described deadhead transportation as time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a certificate holder requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home base. Under the proposal, time spent in deadhead transportation is not rest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA requested that the final rule provide scheduling flexibility for flight attendants in deadhead transportation. ATA requested that the FAA permit: (1) Operators to schedule 2 hours of deadhead transportation to a domicile that is not counted within duty time limitations; (2) flight attendants to waive all duty time limitations when returning to a domicile and count the time as rest; and (3) flight attendants to delay the weekly rest requirement to return to the flight attendant's home base. Delta Air Lines stated that the FAA should permit a flight attendant to alter schedules to exceed the scheduled maximum duty time after the last flight segment to return to the flight attendant's home base. Delta also recommended that an operator be permitted to deadhead a flight attendant for up to 20 hours regardless of the number of assigned flight attendants. NACA suggested that the final rule clarify that the time a flight attendant spends deadheading is not limited by duty periods or the requirement to augment the flight attendant crew because no inflight duties are involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA and NACA stated that the final rule should clarify that a deadheading flight attendant is not a working member of the cabin crew for the purpose of determining if staffing requirements must be augmented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and NACA agreed with the NPRM that the time a flight attendant spends in deadhead transportation is not rest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Deadhead transportation as adopted in &sect;&sect;121.467(b)(12) and 135.273(b)(12) of this final rule is not considered part of a rest period. This use of deadhead transportation in relation to flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements is consistent with the application of flight crewmember flight time limitations and rest requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a flight attendant scheduled for deadhead transportation is not assigned to duty in an aircraft and is not considered a working crewmember. Therefore, for the purpose of determining duty period limitations and rest requirements, deadhead transportation is not considered an assignment involving flight time and is not part of a duty period. In response to the comments submitted, the FAA reiterates that an operator is not required to augment flight attendant crews for flights when a flight attendant is assigned to deadhead transportation because the time spent in deadhead transportation is not part of a duty period. For example, an operator may schedule a flight attendant crew for a flight to Europe with a duty period of 14 hours. Immediately following the flight and before beginning a 9-hour rest period, the operator requires the flight attendant crew to deadhead for 2 hours to position the crew for the next duty period assignment. In this example, the operator is not required to augment the flight attendant crew because the deadheading portion of the assignment is not considered part of the duty period. However, the 2 hours spent positioning the crew for the next assignment are not considered part of the 9-hour rest period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Flight Attendant Responsibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466 and 135.273 state that a flight attendant may not accept a work assignment that does not meet the duty time limitations and rest requirements. Six commenters responded to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA, APA, Delta Air Lines, and RAA opposed this provision. The commenters stated that, if the provision were adopted, flight attendants would be subject to FAA civil penalties. The commenters also expressed concern that the provision would interfere with labor-management relations. APA noted that a flight attendant could be permitted to complete a flight assignment that the flight attendant believes to be improper and to inform the FAA at the next opportunity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

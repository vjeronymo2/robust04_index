			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arye Qizal] </F>   [Text] A little more than two weeks remain before the start  of the withdrawal from Gaza, but preparations on the ground this  week went almost unfelt. PLO security men arrived by grace of  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], closely examined military  installations, conferred, took notes and marked their maps. But  aside from the first reserve duty orders going out to transport  and logistical units, and construction started on a fence by the  Erez checkpoint at the northern entrance to the strip, real  movement has yet to be seen. The trucks stand idle. Even the  kitchens are not being disassembled, nor are the men packing up  the stores of office equipment at field command posts. Israel is  signaling the PLO that nothing will move until the end of the  negotiations in Cairo and other secret channels.    The detailed plan drawn up by the general staff's planning  and quartermaster branches calls for transferring bases, posts,  observation points and units from the heart of Arab settlements  in the strip, particularly in Gaza city, Dir al-Balah, Rafiah  and Han-Yunis, to locations close to the strip's Jewish  settlements.    The reserve units that received call-up orders this week  will  start to "fold up" everything they can at the end of  December--transport and communications units, operations  offices, medical units and storerooms. The first to break camp  will be the logistical units; the combat echelon will go only at  the end of the process. The military courts and advocate general  units will also be "folded up."    A number of IDF outposts and lookout points within the  refugee camps will be evacuated last. The picture is already  clear: Israeli soldiers leaving and young Palestinians  overrunning the turrets with the Palestinian flag in their hands.   <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-001C-21A>           Map </FIG>          The IDF forces will redeploy in a coordinated operation,  whose timetable has recently been fixed, in three enclaves close  to the strip's Jewish settlements. It is scheduled to take place  in April, 1994. For deploying forces outside the strip, the IDF  has been equipped with mobile housing units that will be set up  in a number of places yet to be finally decided.    From the north, the IDF will guard the Erez checkpoint and  the Nativ-Ha'ashara-Nisanit bloc of settlements and control a  coastal observation post in the region. There, as in the other  enclaves, the army will put up new outposts, observation points  over the roads and intelligence stations.    Near Netzerim, deep in Gaza, the IDF will station a  reinforced contingent whose sole purpose will be protection of  the settlement. The same arrangement will be made at Kafr-Drom,  a sensitive point in the southern part of the strip.    IDF command posts will be transferred to a central HQ in the  Gush Qatif region, the site of the greatest concentration of  Jewish settlements. The bloc will be protected by a series of  outposts and lookout stations, some of which will form a barrier  between it and neighboring Han-Yunis to prevent infiltration of  the bloc from the refugee camp.    Eytan Hadari, security coordinator for Ganei Tal, says, "We  worked with a senior field commander this week on marking out  the places where army camps and lookout posts will go between  Han-Yunis and Gush Qatif. Some of the positions in Ganei Tal and  Netzer-Hazani have already started to be built."    The redeployment of the IDF, explains a senior army  official,  is based on the following principles: providing maximal security  to Jewish residents using bypass routes, traffic "as minimal as  possible" on the strip's main roads, and maximum control of the  coastal border through shore observation points and regular  naval patrols to prevent infiltration by terrorists and  smuggling.    The plan devised in the Planning and Quartermaster branches  calls for large forces around the Jewish settlements and  reinforced units on the roads. The presence of massive army  forces around the settlements will be felt at night. Netzer and  Kafr Drom will look like closed camps surrounded by heavy  military traffic.    IDF teams are now busy drawing up new operational techniques  for the "Samson" unit, which operates in the strip. The IDF is  very worried by the possible conversion of the autonomy areas  into havens for terrorists. Senior defense officials had no  unequivocal answers to that this week. "That worries us more  than those fringe elements who are making a fuss over the  call-up orders we sent out this week. Our main problem is how to  catch a terrorist who carries out an attack and flees into  Palestinian territory."    The IDF agreed this week to make additional concessions to  the Palestinians. A document setting forth Israeli security  views stated that Israel does not see any role for UN forces or  observers in Gaza and that no need exists for a foreign or  international presence on matters affecting relations between  Israelis and Palestinians. In the Cairo talks, however, the  sides agreed that an international observer force might be  introduced into Gaza. Its composition and location are still not  clear.    The Israeli demand for scattered security zones, in which  entry by Palestinians for construction and farm work would be  prohibited, also has softened. Palestinians will be able to stay  in some of these areas on a limited basis. Israel has also  promised a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners and  detainees. Further, the IDF has agreed to hand over Gaza's  central prison to the Palestinians, who will take control of the  300 criminals now incarcerated there.    Dozens of television crews will arrive in the coming weeks  to  record the withdrawal from Gaza for posterity. Every truck  driving out on its way to Israel will be accompanied by hoots  from the locals and sighs of relief from the soldiers.    The IDF estimates that the cost of redeployment will be half  a billion dollars. Most of the investment will be in improving  the fence system and isolating the strip, rebuilding bypass  routes and shifting command posts. Some structures will be  handed over to the Palestinian police. There is no intention to  leave scorched earth.    The defense establishment this week was even considering  selling arms to the PLO to provide the Palestinian police an  initial base for operations. The settlers are very touchy about  that, but a senior source in Southern Command said this week,  "I'm even for giving them some armored cars so they can quickly  get a strong grip on the territory."</p>

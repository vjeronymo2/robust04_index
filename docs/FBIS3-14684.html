			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--American and Jordanian officials are  scheduled to meet in Washington Thursday [31 March] to discuss  Jordan's demand for a solution to the negative impact on its  economy of the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah imposed by the  enforcers of the 44-month-old international sanctions against  Iraq, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday.    Addressing a press conference after a regular Council of  Ministers meeting, Dr. al-'Anani called on the U.S. to seek a  speedy solution to the problem so that Jordan could go back to  the 28-month-old American-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.    The government has been informed by the Jordanian embassy in  Washington that a meeting has been scheduled for Thursday among  Jordanian officials and representatives of all concerned U.S.  government departments and agencies to discuss the issue, Dr.  al-'Anani said.    "The Jordanian government urges concerned authorities in the  U.S. and also the United Nations to speed up the proposal to  replace offshore inspections by onshore inspections by a third  neutral party," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted]    Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan did not share the view that the  Arab-Israeli peace process and the effects of the international  sanctions imposed against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait  in August 1990 were two separate issues.    "We believe that the issue of al-'Aqabah cannot be fully  disassociated from the peace process," he said. "After all, the  whole peace process was basically generated after the Gulf war.  Therefore, to say that there is no link is not a view that is  necessarily shared by Jordan."    Dr. al-'Anani said a recent escalation of the interceptions  and inspection procedures adopted by the American-led warships  patrolling the Red Sea could not but be seen as a form of  indirect pressure on Jordan to accept an Israeli demand that the  Kingdom sign a peace agreement and then negotiate the terms of  the accord.    "Jordan is not going to succumb to pressures of this kind,"  the minister said. "We want the peace process to pursure a  rational path. Jordan does not need to give any further  evidence to its positive attitude and its important and key role  in the peace process itself." [passage omitted]    Dr. al-'Anani, who estimated that Jordan lost up to $1.3  billion in extra freight costs alone as a result of higher  charges levied by shipowners sending their vessels to and from  al-'Aqabah since the sanctions against Iraq were imposed in  August 1990, noted that inspectors have not been able to find a  single violation of the sanctions after checking more than 1,700  vessels.    Despite such a record, he said, Jordan continued to suffer  from the modalities of the inspections. The minister said the  Kingdom reserved the right to demand compensation for the losses  it incurred.    "The final effect of the method of inspections on  Jordan-bound ships is not justified by the method of application  of sanctions against Iraq," Dr. al-'Anani said. "Alternatives  were offered and we think they should have been studied but that  should not have taken so much to be finalised and approved.    "Therefore, when the number of ships that were intercepted  escalated in the last month while there was a constructive  proposal that has been discussed but not ratified, we had to  draw a conclusion that Jordan is targeted economically and  politically...," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted]    The information Minister welcomed a statement by U.S. State  Department spokesman Michael McCurry that the Jordanian proposal  was under study and said Jordan hoped that "this matter will be  very very soon resolved."    "If that happens, then we think it would iron out a major  problem which is not only affecting the Jordanian economy but  also inflaming popular response to the whole situation," Dr.  al-'Anani said.    The minister was referring to a call issued by Parliament  last week for the goverment to refuse to return to peace talks  with Israel until the siege of al-'Aqabah is lifted and the  lifting is formally announced at the Security Council.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Jordanian call for an end to the  "modus operandi" of inspecting Aqaba-bound vessels was not  linked to the overall sanctions against Iraq although Jordan  strongly felt that the situation of the Iraqi people was  worsening due to lack of enough food and medicine.    Dr. al-'Anani also reiterated that Jordan would not accept  the stationing of international forces in its territory since  such a move... will be in violation of Jordan's sovereignty and  territorial integrity." [punctuation as published]    Asked whether Jordan would attend an April 7 round of  multilateral talks on the environment, which is part of the  Middle East process, Dr. al-'Anani said: "We hope that the  concerned parties will arrive at a speedy decision to solve the  problem" of the siege of Aqaba.</p>

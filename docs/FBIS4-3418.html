			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Water-control  projects on the Huaihe River are making good progress, according  to sources at the Ministry of Water Resources.    The river flows through Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu  Provinces in the eastern part of China.    With close co-operation between the four provinces, a large  number of water-conservancy facilities have been built along the  river.    They have widened and dredged over 1,000 km of river  courses,  consolidated over 2,000 km of embankments and removed 350  million cu m [cubic meters] of earth.    Five reservoirs have been repaired on the river.    According to the ministry, 18 major projects are planned to  be completed by the year 2000; construction has already started  on 13 of them.    The river system passes through 13.1 million ha [hectare] of  land populated by 140 million people, amounting respectively to  about one-eighth of China's total and land population.    Throughout history the area has suffered from severe floods  and droughts.</p>

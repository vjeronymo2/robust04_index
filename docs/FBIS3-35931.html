			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This is a statement by Sandro Kavsadze, personal and  plenipotentiary representative of the Georgian head of state,  parliament chairman in the sphere of conflict settlement, and  state committee chairman for human rights and interethnic  relations.    On 28 January 1994, under the mediation of Russia and with  the participation of representatives of the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees, talks were held at the Russian Foreign Ministry  between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides.    The talks lasted from 0900 till midnight but, unfortunately,  ended without result. The four-party agreement on the voluntary  repatriation of refugees and displaced persons was not  implemented.    Many hours of exhausting work and searching for agreement  and  compromise produced a document. However, the Abkhaz side  demanded from participants in the talks that persons wishing to  return to permanent places of residence who had taken part in  combat operations should not be covered by security guarantees.  The Georgian side categorically refuses to discriminate between  refugees on the grounds of their participation or  non-participation in hostilities. Almost all the population,  including Georgians, Abkhazians, and other nationalities living  in Abkhazia, was involved in the conflict.    To punish people who took up arms to defend themselves and  their relatives is a serious violation of human rights and an  infringement of presumption of innocence. By blaming only the  Georgian population, Gudauta makes another attempt to legitimize  ethnic cleansing and disguise its desire to prevent a peaceful  settlement.</p>

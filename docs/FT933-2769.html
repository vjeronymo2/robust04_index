			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Italian exports to China set to double ITALIAN exports to China this year are expected to nearly double and top L4,000bn (Pounds 1.7bn), according to Mr Paolo Baratta, Italian trade minister. Seven contracts totalling Dollars 470m (Pounds 303m) were signed yesterday with Italian companies. The contracts were signed in the presence of Ms Wu Yi, Chinese foreign trade minister, at the end of a visit to Italy. The contracts ranged from Snamprogetti building a fertiliser plant at Donfang in Haiwan province to Danieli constructing a specialised steel plant for Laiwn Iron and Steel in Shandong province, financed by the Asian Development Bank. In the first seven months of this year, Italian exports to China reached L1,238bn, compared to L1,842bn for the whole of 1992. Italy is now the second largest European exporter to China after Germany. Mr Baratta said Italy's share of Chinese exports was set to rise this year from 2.1 per cent to nearly 3 per cent. Much of the Italian export drive is concentrated in the machine tools and engineering goods sector, especially textiles machinery.</p>

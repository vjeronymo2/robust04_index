			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: PASTA PARTY AND TRIP TO NCAA FOR UCSD  </P> <P> The pasta party at Shannon Quigley's apartment broke up around 8:30 Sunday  night.  </P> <P> Quigley and guests are UC San Diego track and field athletes. They were  scheduled to leave for the NCAA Division III national meet in Naperville, Ill.,  early Monday morning.  </P> <P> Quigley is the veteran of the group -- having been to the nationals the past  two years. She won the shot put and the discus last year, and has a good shot  to do so again this year.  </P> <P> But for most of the other athletes, this will be their first national meet. Two  years ago, Quigley was the only Triton in the nationals. Last year, she was  accompanied by three others.  </P> <P> This year, UCSD is sending an all-time high 13 athletes (10 women, 3 men).  </P> <P> The party at Quigley's was a traditional, team-bonding thing. But it was also a  chance for Quigley to share her national meet experiences and her thoughts  about what the others could expect.  </P> <P> After all, right up there with competitive throwing, sharing words is what  Quigley does best.  </P> <P> She's a self-described free spirit, who's known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts and  drive a 1968 Volkswagen van with bumper stickers about peace and love making do  as a paint job.  </P> <P> "I'm a '90s hippie," she said.  </P> <P> The van's as old as her and has 205,000 miles on it. The odometer just clicked  over for the second time, and now reads 5,000. "It's sort of like having a new  car," she joked.  </P> <P> "Actually right now it's broken down. But my brother has a van that I use. It  doesn't have a roof, though. It's a giraffe carrier."  </P> <P> Quigley is a literature writing major. She wants to be a writer, but not a  sportswriter.  </P> <P> "It's too dense," she said. "I'm much more descriptive."  </P> <P> What does all this have to do with track and field? Well, nothing and  everything according to Quigley.  </P> <P> She believes that because of the individuality of the sport, the individual  must come out in a person for them to perform at an optimum level.  </P> <P> She is living proof.  </P> <P> Add Quigley: Shortly after a feature story on Quigley ran in The Times around  this time last year, she got a rather unusual fan letter.  </P> <P> It was from a local inmate who had read the story and took a liking to Quigley.  He said he didn't have much to read in prison, and would she mind writing him  back?  </P> <P> "He sounded like a really nice, lonely guy," Quigley said. "I think he was in  for embezzlement. I wrote him back a couple of times."  </P> <P> Last add Quigley: UCSD has two other shot putters who figure to push Quigley in  the national meet -- Shelly Squibb and Rachel Beerman.  </P> <P> Beerman's brother is also on the team, and he is often referred to as Beerboy.  When their parents come to town, they are Beermom and Beerdad.  </P> <P> California Community College champions: Grossmont College won the women's  tennis state title for the second time with a 5-1 victory over Chabot over the  weekend.  </P> <P> In track and field, Steve Kellogg of Mesa College won the hammer throw at the  state meet Saturday at Santa Barbara. His throw of 184-feet-6 was 15-10 farther  than the next best.  </P> <P> Brian Chase of Grossmont won the pole vault at 15-8.  </P> <P> Tracy Crawford of Southwestern was second in both the shot put and discus, and  Lafrania West of Grossmont was second and fifth in the triple jump and high  jump.  </P> <P> No small feat: In a recent 3-1 victory over the University of San Diego, San  Diego State's Rick Navarro pitched a three-hitter. Lou Skertich, who pitched  seven innings, and Tom Cheek allowed seven hits.  </P> <P> Navarro is 5-feet-9. Both Skertich and Cheek are 5-8. Who says pitchers have to  be tall to make it in college ball?  </P> <P> "I'd say the little guys did a big job tonight," Cheek said.  </P> <P> As they have all season. Navarro is 9-3 with a 2.64 earned run average.  Skertich (6-7) led USD with a 3.84 ERA, and Cheek led the West Coast Conference  with seven saves and a 2.53 ERA in conference games.  </P></p>

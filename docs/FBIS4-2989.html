			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan has suspended  screening entry applications by Mainland Chinese citizens to  protest what it said was Beijing's callous handling of the boat  fire that killed 4 Taiwan tourists at the end of last month.    However, Liu Peng-chun, commissioner of the Bureau of Entry  &amp;  Exit, told the press Thursday [14 April] that the government has  not restricted local people from visiting their relatives on the  mainland.    "Visits to the mainland are handled in accordance with the  statute on relations between people on Taiwan and the mainland,"  Liu said. "All that visitors are required to do is report to  the government prior to their departure for the mainland."    Nevertheless, he pointed out, plans by government agencies,  including the ministries of education and interior, to invite  700 mainland professionals here have been halted.    The Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao Lake disaster were  found dead along with two mainland guides and six crew members  aboard a burned pleasure boat that had been taking them across  the lake, which is in the eastern mainland Province of Zhejiang,  on March 31. Relatives of the victims and Taiwan media have  speculated that the tourists were robbed and murdered before the  boat was set afire.    The incident strained relations between the two sides after  Beijing refused to allow the relatives of the victims to return  their bodies to Taiwan and limited their movement on the  mainland earlier this week.    Also on Thursday, Premier Lien Chan again ordered relevant  government agencies to help the victims' relatives seek  compensation from Beijing.</p>

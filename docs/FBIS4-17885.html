			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly </F> Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia is interested in the development of "good  relations" with Israel. In this aspect the visit to Moscow of  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was "fruitful," Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolokolov told Interfax on  Wednesday.    In his opinion, the time wasted as a result of the break-off  of diplomatic relations "did not give Moscow more opportunities  to promote a peaceful solution in the Middle East."    Kolokolov expressed satisfaction with the content of  "detailed" talks between Rabin and Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on the problems of the Middle East settlement.  They discussed the fate of Palestinian territories (Gaza and  Jericho) which are now being liberated. "The main problem is  how to organize the transitional period better so that by its  end in two to three years normal Palestinian self-government  structures can be formed there. We are satisfied with the  discussion of this problem with the Israeli leader," Kolokolov  said.    He noted that Rabin expressed interest in continuation of  Israel's talks on the Syrian, Jordan and Lebanese questions.    Speaking about the prospect for calling a peace conference  Madrid-2 at Russia's initiative, Kolokolov said that during  talks in Moscow, the Israeli premier "did not deny such a  possibility in principle." "At the same time, Russia and Israel  understand that it is unrealistic to call Madrid-2 tomorrow or  the day after tomorrow. It should be thoroughly prepared. The  purpose of this conference is to summarize the results of the  latest stage and to consider the possibility of intensifying  activities in various directions. By the way, problems  occurring at the bilateral talks could be a subject of  discussions at Madrid-2," Kolokolov said.    Speaking about the supplies of Russian arms to Syria which  concern Israel, Kolokolov referred just to spare parts for  weapons which were supplied earlier. "I understand the concerns  of the Israeli side, but Syrians are also worried about supplies  of new Western arms to Israel. Besides, Russia is not supplying  offensive arms to anybody. We can talk just about supplies of  spare parts and "defense weapons" to Syria. And if we do not  sell military equipment to Syrians, other countries can do  that," the diplomat said.    He noted that Russia will do all it can to help Tel-Aviv  find  prisoners and missing Israeli soldiers. "We promised to get  involved in that and to ask corresponding Arabic countries,  where these people can be, in the first place Syria. Russian  first vice-premier Oleg Soskovets now visiting Damascus has  already been instructed duly," Kolokolov said.    Speaking about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza  and  Jericho, he noted that "Tel-Aviv promised to do that in the near  future." "The delay in the withdrawal can be explained by  technical reasons. Preliminarily, it is necessary to prepare  the Palestinian police and that needs time and money. Israel  has already urged a number of Western countries to ask for a  certain sum for the formation of the Palestinian police,"  Kolokolov said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear Listeners: General Saw Bo Mya, chairman of  the Democratic Alliance of Burma, DAB, in his letter to Thai  Prime Minister Chaun Likphai noted that the State Law and Order  Restoration Council [SLORC] military regime should not be  invited to attend the forthcoming annual ASEAN ministerial  meeting.    In the DAB declaration, dated 4 March, Gen. Saw Bo Mya cited  SLORC's inability to implement basic human rights and democracy  in Burma and looking at SLORC's present activities it clearly  indicates their intention to cling on to power through the use  of military force. At present, SLORC does not deserve to be  invited to the annual ASEAN ministerial meeting.    The letter also noted ASEAN need to wait-and-see the  improvements in SLORC's records before considering such an  invitation.    It has been learned that Gen. Saw Bo Mya sent similar  letters  to other ASEAN members. The annual ASEAN ministerial meeting  will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in July. The Thai Government  intends to invite the SLORC military regime as guest to the  meeting.</p>

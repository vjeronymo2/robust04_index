			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: Continent applauds Major's great victory SORRY about this, but I have to report that the last stages of the parliamentary progress of the bill designed to secure British adhesion to a Treaty on European Union aroused so much interest on the continent that I feel the need to return to it. Last Saturday, some seemed to miss the point. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung's headline ran: 'Major's victory in lower house: Approval for ratifying the Maastricht Treaty.' That made me feel a bit like a citizen of Stalingrad crawling from the rubble some 50 winters ago, picking up a copy of Pravda and reading the headline: 'Red Army wins battle for city.' True enough, but . . . . Coincidentally, inside, a propos nothing, was an interview with the paper's London economic correspondent from 1926 to 1974, Hans Egli, who still lives in London. It was decked out with a picture of Spitfires of the kind that anti-Maastricht campaigners made so much use of in their campaign to maintain the full independence of those wonderful institutions that have brought Britain to the enviable position it enjoys today. The denouement of the Maastricht drama in parliament attracted more coverage of a British story than anything since the last election, more even than the equally unappetising events that have struck the House of Windsor. But the arguments that were deployed in the course of the various debates that led to John Major's threat to call an election occasioned no interest whatsoever. The 'Eurosceptics', especially Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, appeared frequently but their opinions did not. Of the papers I saw only the humble Mannheimer-Morgen referred to the British debate over the Social Chapter, or whatever it is now called. The paper dismissed the arguments curtly: 'An EC-internal market without a social charter would be a market economy without a social safety net.' The trouble is that the views of the British, particularly of those opposed to the treaty, are not handled seriously. British hostility to most aspects of the Community is viewed elsewhere in the EC as axiomatic - the Brits always say 'No.' One French commentator noted that in both Britain and France there was a respectable patriotic reflex vis-a-vis Maastricht. But in the case of the British there was, 'for this concrete and pragmatic people, a sort of genetic inability to imagine the abstract, the intangible, to associate with a project that originated elsewhere, one that was unprecedented, without reference to history . . .' The prevalence of this attitude is damaging, for it is impossible for scepticism about many elements of the Maastricht Treaty to be taken seriously so long as that scepticism is couched in terms that reflect British attitudes. There is a widespread view in Denmark that the 'Yes' majority in the second referendum there was assured by the 'Eurosceptical' British politicians who were imported to help the 'No' campaign. So the anti-Maastricht campaign in Britain, most notably in last Saturday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, was portrayed as the creature of those whose political careers had come to an end. The Tory rebels will not worry about that because they care little for European opinion and had no interest in winning a wider public to a position of non-nationalistic scepticism about what is termed the European process. Mainstream French anti-Maastricht campaigners, who performed so well in the face of a huge government-backed referendum campaign last year, made no such mistake. They inserted advertisements in the newspapers of other countries stating that their position on the treaty did not reflect any hostility towards their friends and neighbours. They also had the ability to make themselves understood in other languages. But British Eurosceptics appear as rancorous repositories of an embittered nationalism. One reason is what happens when one translates their statements into other languages. The familiar '1,000-years-of-history' rhetoric sounds mad or menacing in Spanish or German, and is therefore disqualified from serious consideration. The other problem is the easy British assumption that the British possess a higher kind of patriotism, that the sense of nationhood of other lands is somehow diminished or of a lesser nature. Yet all over Europe there are people who eschew a policy of nationalist rejection yet feel uncomfortable in face of the perceived implications of the treaty, especially in the light of this week's events. The British possess the most vocal group prepared to articulate their concerns; it is the manner in which those concerns are articulated that discredits the case.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Expo '96 Commissioner Etelka Pataky Barsi by </F> Gyorgy Dioszegi; place and date not given]    [Text] Two years before the opening of Expo '96, the  public learns more and more frequently about various events  connected with the preparations. Because of the increasing  frequency of Expo events, we requested an interview with  Honorary State Secretary Etelka Pataky Barsi, Expo  commissioner.    [Dioszegi] How far are the preparations advanced at the site  of the expo?    [Barsi] The construction of the underground infrastructure  is  nearing completion. One of the big buildings which will remain  after the Expo is already under construction. The evaluation  committee of experts made a decision a few days ago about  awarding a contract to build the Hungarian pavilion, work on  which will begin in July. The planning of the Austrian pavilion  will also be finished soon; it will be planned and built by the  Austrians, but after the Expo closes, that building will also  become part of the university campus. The construction of the  Lagymanyos bridge is going ahead at full speed. Within a few  weeks preparations will begin for the construction of the  footbridge as well. The plans for the sports and cultural center  are also completed; it will house, among other things, a  large-scale sports facility and a theater which can accommodate  an audience of several hundred. These are only the larger  projects; I will not even mention the smaller ones. Furthermore,  the coordination of cultural programs is under way, because  every day of the Expo will have one or more important cultural  events. Every country will have a national day when it will be  able to present the values of its own culture.    [Dioszegi] While traveling in the countryside, one hears  more  and more often that people are preparing for the Expo.    [Barsi] We invited bids for events before, after, and during  the Expo, and more than 1,000 ideas and suggestions were  submitted. The suggestions include an international meeting of  cavalrymen, a scientific conference on great lakes, a festival  of the Hungarian chess players worldwide, a jewelry world fair,  a world fair of inventions, and a folklore show by seven small  villages.    [Dioszegi] How do foreigners react to our efforts?    [Barsi] We held the first international meeting on our world  fair in March. We found with considerable pride that in the  entire history of world fairs this was the first time that two  years before the opening of the exhibition, at the meeting of  the organizing country, representatives of the foreign countries  could receive an answer to every question, and they would be  able to see how much progress was made. As a result of our  preparatory work, 59 countries replied to our invitation. Only  seven of them gave a negative answer. Positive replies came from  29 countries. Austria, Holland, Germany, and the Vatican have  already appointed their commissioners. Some countries, such as  Switzerland or Finland, have already reserved their exhibition  areas. Approximately 23 countries consider it important to  introduce themselves; they are looking at their possibilities  and are working on their budgets.    [Dioszegi] The question is unavoidable: Will the Expo be  profitable? Will it be worth it?    [Barsi] The budget of the Expo at 1993 prices is $1 billion.  Of this amount, 31 percent will come from budgetary support as  defined by law, 24 percent from direct income, 26 percent from  state bonds, and another 19 percent from the lottery,  privatization income, and the sale of real estate. Furthermore,  I can assert that we are not building a "disposable" Expo. The  use of everything is predetermined. By this I mean that the  universities would have needed the buildings two decades ago  already. The footbridge will be transferred to a Hungarian town.  The portion of the M0 highway loop which is under construction  now will relieve the crowded capital this year already, and the  updated railroad between Budapest and Vienna will also continue  to operate. These are only a few random examples. But if I add  to this that at least 10 million visitors will come to the Expo  and that they will stay here, use transportation, and eat, then  taxes on the additional income from services and catering  establishments can also be regarded--indirectly--as income from  the Expo. In this way, it can hardly be a question whether it  will be worth it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reynold Georges, leader of the Alliance for the  Liberation and Advancement of Haiti, ALAH, reproaches the  members of the congress for their sectarianism and for their  procedure he deems arbitrary. Georges favors the national  conference of the Committee of Action for National  Reconciliation, to be held 6-7 February, and also a government  of concord.    [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] Despite all the  positions we took and the talks we held with those gentlemen  [from the national congress] in order to make them understand  what is right, they are not listening. We want then to know  that: First, ALAH has some legislators within the parliament,  whom we hope they will not attack; second, nor any other  legislators; third, we heard that they formed a government in  which they assert that the North represents Artibonite and the  West. We are asking that the other six departments be  represented, particularly the department of the Center, where we  are a representative.    We accept dictates from no one and we are formally asking  the  Haitian Army and the police to fulfill their responsibilities to  stop those power-hungry gentlemen. In the event of failure to do  so, we will take the necessary measures to deal with them  through our own means. We are issuing a watchword to all ALAH  members throughout the nine geographical departments. We are  asking them to mobilize, to get in touch with the party's office  immediately tomorrow morning. We will take measures to protect  our members on the one hand and to protect the national  sovereignty on the other hand, so that no small groups of petty  persons endanger the country's durability. I am accusing them of  sectarianism and of pettiness. A small group of people cannot  pretend to national sovereignty. [end recording]</p>

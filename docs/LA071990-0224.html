			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 3 ARRESTED IN SWAP MEET KILLING  </P> <P> Three suspects in the fatal shooting of a security guard at the San Fernando  Swap Meet last month were charged with murder and robbery, authorities said  this morning.  </P> <P> Ricardo Roldan, 19, of Pacoima, Richard Zorns, 22, of Arleta, and a 17-year-old  Pacoima boy were charged with the June 3 death of Roland (Lucky) Teal, 61, of  Pacoima.  </P> <P> Teal, a father of nine and a guard at the swap meet on Glenoaks Boulevard for  nearly 20 years, was gunned down shortly after three men took $12,000 from the  manager at gunpoint.  </P> <P> After the robbery, several bystanders chased the suspects. Police said Teal  grabbed the unarmed juvenile and was holding him when Roldan allegedly came up  from behind and shot the guard in the back, killing him.  </P> <P> Lt. Rico Castro said today that detectives reviewed other robberies of area  swap meets and found similarities between the June 3 case and one in 1988 in  Sunland. Roldan had been arrested in the 1988 case and was on trial at the time  of the June robbery, but he was free on bail during the trial.  </P> <P> Detectives gathered evidence linking him and his two friends to the June  robbery and shooting, and they were arrested this week. All three were  described by police as associates of local gangs.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said he will seek the death penalty against  Roldan because he is suspected of firing the shot that killed Teal.  </P></p>

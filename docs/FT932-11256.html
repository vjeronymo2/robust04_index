			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BAe/Matra There is a traditional military logic in a merger between the missile businesses of British Aerospace and Matra. The two companies have roughly complementary weapons systems and sell into different geographical markets. Where they do overlap, they can stop competing aggressively and cutting each other's margins, where they do not, they will have a chance to cross-sell systems. As is the way with such military deals, the rationale contains little about saving money. Joint marketing may save some cash, but manufacturing capacity will probably have to be maintained. If a merger would not provide any of the financial benefits normally associated with rationalisation, it is at least a sensible response to shrinking European defence spending. The combined missile business would be better able to challenge DASA, Hughes and Raytheon for what business is going. Presumably, both parties have also ensured that Aerospatiale would not be able to pressure the French government into an all-French ordering policy. And the mooted deal confirms the new BAe management's reputation for hitting the target. What remains unclear, though, is whether either party is using the merger talks as a way to sidle out of the missile business. That still looks unlikely, but such joint ventures do provide the ideal cover.</p>

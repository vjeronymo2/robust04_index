			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Hurd refuses to give pledge over Pergau Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday refused to give a firm commitment that future donations for Malaysia's Pergau dam project would not come from the UK's aid budget. Following a court judgment last week that payments on the Pergau project had been illegal, opposition MPs asked Mr Hurd to give an assurance that UK spending on the Pergau project would no longer be made by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA). Amid growing controversy about Britain's aid programme they also sought an assurance from Mr Hurd that previous spending on the dam from the ODA's aid and trade provision would be given back. However, in the Queen's Speech debate on foreign affairs Mr Hurd said that he had not yet received the High Court's full written judgment on the issue, that he had not yet decided whether to appeal and that no final decision could be taken until then. Mr Hurd told the Commons: 'There have been no decisions on any of these points, either on past or future spending. We will have to take that decision. If I decide not to appeal, and as soon as that decision is taken, the House will be informed.' Mr Hurd confirmed that the next payment to the Malaysian government to help build the dam would be made by the end of the year. Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, said he would add Baroness Thatcher's name to the 'charge sheet' on Pergau, but added that Mr Hurd could not escape 'his own personal responsibility for having got it wrong'. He said the episode had been 'an alarming glimpse into the private arrogance of this government, that has been there so long it no longer even asks whether there are any limits to its personal authority'.</p>

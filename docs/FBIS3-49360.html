			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 6 (CTK) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton's third foreign visit since taking office, due to take  place in the next few days, testifies to the place Central  Europe and the whole European continent occupies in U.S. foreign  policy, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told a press  conference today.    In connection with the death of Clinton's mother today,  Zieleniec expressed hope that the programme of Clinton's stay in  the Czech Republic would turn out well, although minor and even  basic changes could be expected.    Regarding Polish and Hungarian criticism of the arrangement  whereby the meetings between Clinton and leaders of the Visegrad  countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) would  be bilateral rather than taking the form of a Visegrad Four  meeting, Zieleniec said that the programme had been made  according to the American side's wish to hold a regional meeting  in Prague. He said the programme was being intensively  discussed with all the participants. It is natural as the  meeting is being held in Prague that Clinton's talks will have  both bilateral and multilateral aspects, Zieleniec said.    It is not expected that Clinton will deliver an extensive  speech on the occasion -- the debate would rather concentrate on  particular problems, Zieleniec said. Nor is it expected that a  joint document will be signed. The visit and the discussions  will be extremely important not only for the security of the  Central European region but for the whole of Europe and the  world, Zieleniec said.    He said Central Europe was also participating in the search  for a new face for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  which had lost the form it originally had in a bipolar world.  For the Czech Republic, membership in NATO as in other  integrated groups was a question of historic, civilisation and  cultural identity rather than a question of resolving concrete  problems, Zieleniec said. He said the Czech Republic's efforts  to obtain NATO membership were not in competition with other  countries.    The U.S. Partnership for Peace project was important because  it opens up space for initiative rather than defining particular  form of relations. Although the Czech Republic welcomes it,  this does not mean that it considers it an ideal solution,  Zieleniec said. The openness of this project would enable each  country to individually develop relevant activity according to  its possibilities and needs. "It is a project which fits the  general philosophy of our approach towards the transformation of  our state," Zieleniec said.    He said that the project's political dimention should be  more  clearly defined so that it was not merely confined to joint  military exercises, exchanges of military experts and so forth  but also included political criteria. NATO faces the task of  gradual transformation into an alliance concentrating on certain  civilised values, which requires extremely intensive political  activity within nato as well as activity aimed at its expansion,  Zieleniec said.</p>

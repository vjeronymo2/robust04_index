			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chang Myong-su, secretary general of the </F> Council for Studying Ways To Cope With the Return of Repatriates  from the Republic (North Korea), by U Chong-chang; in Niigata,  Japan, date not given--first two paragraphs are CHUGAN CHOSON  introduction]    [Text] Mr. Chang Myong-su, 60, secretary general of "the  Council for Studying Ways To Cope With the Return of Repatriates  From the Republic," has been unable to set foot on his native  land (North Kyongsang Province) for 50 years. This is because  he once served as a Chongnyon [General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan] cadre. His parents and siblings have  embarked on the repatriation ship, and he himself has also  visited North Korea. Mr. Chang had been vice chairman of the  Chongnyon headquarters in the Niigata region, famous for the  base of repatriation ships. He left Chongnyon in 1989, and is  now in the forefront of the anti-Chongnyon movement.    This is because he is conscience-stricken for having sent  innocent compatriots to North Korea, a land of hell. His father  and eldest brother died there after going through hardships.  His second eldest brother has been missing since Mr. Chang  began the anti-Chongnyon movement. I met with Mr. Chang at his  apartment. He is waging an unaided struggle in Niigata.    [U Chong-chang] I hear that Chongnyon members are wavering.    [Chang Myong-su] In 1991, an event happened in Niigata.  Cadres from North Korea called in the families of repatriates  to the ship Mangyongbong-ho, threateningly, telling them to  shell out donations. Then, giving 20 million yen, a businessman  whose elder brother is in North Korea shouted "this money is not  yours, but our family's." It had been unimaginable in the past  for people of Chongnyon to stand against cadres from North  Korea. This is a sign of wavering.    [U] Has your safety not been in danger while you have been  engaged in the anti-Chongnyon movement?    [Chang] In October 1989, when I was about to contribute an  article on the human rights abuse of repatriates to a Japanese  monthly magazine for the first time, a Chongnyon cadre was  dissuading me from writing such an article, saying that he would  make arrangements for me to meet with Chairman Han Tok-su. I  said that I would be willing to meet him if Chongnyon admitted  that sending compatriots to North Korea is a national crime.  After that, I had never heard from them. Since I founded the  council in April 1990, I have been threatened and shadowed.  They have even been spreading a rumor that I am a cat's paw of  the ROK Government.    [U] In what direction have you decided to move your  activities?    [Chang] A considerable number of the repatriates are  missing.  I understand that the Chongnyon Central Committee is in agony  over this issue. Because Chongnyon has played a leading role in  sending compatriots to North Korea, that organization should  also resolve the issue of the return of the repatriates. I am  determined to endlessly urge that Chongnyon resolve this issue.    [U] What is the response in Japan?    [Chang] Japanese broadcasting stations, which had been  silent  over Chongnyon's sending Korean residents to North Korea, dealt  with the issue of repatriates in a series of three installments  two years ago. I understand that Chongnyon's influence over  Japanese journalism is enormous. But, the Japanese journalists  are now paying attention to this issue.</p>

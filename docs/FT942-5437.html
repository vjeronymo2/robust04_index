			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee down as grain prices soar Commodity markets enjoyed another rollercoaster ride this week with Chicago's grain markets taking over the impetus from coffee on the softs side. Heavy fund selling of coffee and copper pushed prices down mid-week but both staged a partial recovery later. The bank holiday in the US and UK on Monday gave traders time to worry about weather prospects for the main US grain growing areas. Their fears sent corn and soyabean prices at the Chicago Board of Trade soaring to daily limits at the open of Tuesday trading. Chicago traders are worried that a lack of rainfall at key growing stages will damage the prospects for this year's crops leading to large shortfalls in grain stocks. Stocks are already depleted after flooding depressed last year's harvest. On Tuesday July soyabean futures hit their daily limit of a 30-cent increase to Dollars 6.73 1/4 per bushel. Although prices dipped again on Wednesday, the market remains buoyed by unseasonably dry weather in the Midwest. Soyabean prices were pushing the Dollars 7-a-bushel mark towards the end of the week. Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday as markets responded positively to data which confirmed continuing strong demand in the US for petrol. Strong economic growth in the US has pushed up petrol demand by 3 per cent over the same period last year. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for July reached Dollars 16.72 a barrel on Thursday, but later slipped below Dollars 16.50. In spite of seeing a strong start to the week, the coffee market was nervous with speculators and hedge funds eager to take profits from the market's dramatic rise over the past few months. The sell-off materialised on Wednesday when the London Commodity Exchange's robusta futures contract for delivery in September slid by Dollars 56 a tonne to Dollars 2,035 a tonne. Similarly, copper suffered from a bail-out by hedge funds and lost Dollars 39.50 a tonne at the London Metal Exchange to Dollars 2,227.50 a tonne on the same day. However, traders are confident that coffee prices will remain buoyed by tight supplies. Analysts expect supply to be constrained until the new Brazilian crop comes to market in August. By the end of the week, coffee had made up some of its earlier losses and was trading around Dollars 2,100 a tonne. Copper had also staged a partial recovery with LME stocks showing another drawdown and prices rising Dollars 29 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 2,232 a tonne. Nickel prices tumbled on the LME following the weekend agreement about a new contract between Inco, the world's second-largest nickel producer, and labour leaders at its Sudbury, Ontario, metals complex. Sudbury produces about 110,000 tonnes of nickel a year and, although some weeks ago a ballot gave union leaders a mandate to call a strike, the market did not expect there would be industrial action. Nevertheless, confirmation that employees had accepted terms for a new contract just before the old one ended on May 31, resulted in prices falling quite sharply. Analysts suggest the outlook for nickel is not wildly bullish. For example, the CRU International consultancy group sees western world nickel production rising by 40,000 tonnes to 576,400 tonnes this year and consumption rising by 4 per cent to 695,400. But it also predicts a 6,000-tonne rise in Russian nickel exports to the west to 123,700 tonnes which would give a supply surplus of about 10,400 tonnes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium         -4,400 to 2,592,075 Aluminium alloy   -1,140 to    41,060 Copper            -4,250 to   487,350 Lead              +2,550 to   338,125 Nickel              +798 to   137,256 Zinc              +9,500 to 1,142,075 Tin                 +260 to    25,680  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

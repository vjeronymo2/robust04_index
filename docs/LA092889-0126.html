			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS NEWS DENIES N.Y. POST ALLEGATION ITS AFGHAN WAR COVERAGE WAS FAKED  </P> <P> CBS News said Wednesday that it was standing by the accuracy of its coverage of  the war in Afghanistan in the wake of a newspaper report that said it had aired  faked battle footage and false news accounts in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> The allegation was contained in a front-page story Wednesday in the New York  Post. Most of the questioned footage was shot by free-lance cameraman Mike  Hoover, who reportedly was on his way back to the United States from New  Zealand Wednesday and not available to comment.  </P> <P> "It is the goal of CBS News in every instance to gather and report the news  accurately, fairly and with integrity," said David Burke, president of CBS  News. "In the case of the Afghan war, we believe we have done so."  </P> <P> Neither Dan Rather, anchor and managing editor of the "CBS Evening News," nor  executive producer Tom Bettag was available for immediate comment on the  report, which questioned the authenticity of some of the footage that it said  was included on the "CBS Evening News" in 1984 and in a 1987 "CBS Reports"  documentary.  </P> <P> In July, 1987, Rather anchored a documentary, "The Battle for Afghanistan,"  that included footage shot by Hoover that previously had aired on "CBS Evening  News." At the time, CBS said that the footage in the documentary represented 18  trips that Hoover and his crew had made into Afghanistan over three years.  </P> <P> CBS News sources said Wednesday that Rather was very concerned about the  staging allegation. "He would never stand for that," said one source. Others at  the network questioned why the report was surfacing now, more than two years  after the "CBS Reports" aired.  </P> <P> The New York Post story, quoting sources that it said included an Afghan rebel  who served as Hoover's translator and an Afghan-British journalist who was  Hoover's second cameraman on a second project in Afghanistan, alleged that  Hoover staged scenes of guerilla sabotage and edited in video footage of a  Pakistani plane to make it appear to be a Soviet jet bombing Afghan villages.  </P> <P> Hoover, who has covered Afghanistan as a regular freelancer for CBS News for  several years, has been well-regarded by the network, according to CBS News  sources. In a 1987 interview with The Times, Hoover said that Rather was  "really the muscle" behind his CBS assignment to cover the war.  </P> <P> In The Times interview, Hoover, an Academy Award-winning documentary film  maker, said that he didn't consider himself a news cameraman in the traditional  sense. "I'm really kind of a film maker," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: Essential safeguards before giving central bank independence Sir, The suggested provisions for democratic accountability of an independent central bank which Samuel Brittan set out (Economic Viewpoint, June 17) omit two safeguards essential to a new, more liberal order. First, its policymaking committee should operate under a well-specified freedom of information code, which would be fully enforceable in law. Under the code, both parliamentarians and the general public should have full access to all background papers to policy decisions, and comprehensive minutes should be published of policymaking meetings with minimal delay - including a record of which way individual members voted. Second, top-level appointments in the central bank must be subject to approval of a parliamentary committee where members vote without interference by party whips. Analogous to Senate ratification of Federal Reserve appointments, members of the committee would cross-examine candidates towards assessing their competence. Questions could be raised, for example, as to the candidate's role in the Pounds 5bn estimated loss on Black Wednesday, and his or her attitude towards previous monetary decisions. Independence should not take effect until all positions on the top policymaking committee, including present officials, have been ratified accordingly.

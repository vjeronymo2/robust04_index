			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Kuwait City, Dec 25 (AFP)--The Kuwaiti state  security court on Saturday postponed indefinitely its verdict in  the trial of 11 Iraqis and three Kuwaitis accused of plotting to  kill former U.S. president George Bush during a visit he paid to  the emirate in April.    Presiding judge Salah al-Fahd said the court decided to  recall the chief prosecution witness, Kuwaiti intelligence  officer 'Abd-'al Samad al-Shatti, at a session set for February  5.    Al-Shatti would be called on to "clarify the roles of the  accused," al-Fahd said.    The verdict in the trial, which opened on June 5, was  originally due to be issued on Saturday, having already been  postponed from the end of October.    In June prosecutor general Badr Mas'ad demanded the death  penalty for all 11 Iraqis and one of the Kuwaitis, and 10-year  prison terms for the other two Kuwaitis.    Of the 14 defendants only two Iraqis -- Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir  al-Asadi and Wali 'Abd-al Hadi al-Ghazali -- have acknowledged  links with the Iraqi intelligence service.    Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives  into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot  to assassinate Bush.    All the rest denied any involvement in the plot or links  with  Iraq. [passage omitted]</p>

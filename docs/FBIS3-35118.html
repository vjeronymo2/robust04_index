			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Palestine" program] </F>   [Text] Arab and non-Arab observers wonder what is left for  the PLO negotiator to the Taba talks to accept or reject. The  fact of the matter is that it is Israel that decides and  dictates agreements between the two parties. If the Palestinian  negotiator ever defies what is being dictated on him, the matter  is referred to Yasir 'Arafat, Yitzhaq Rabin, or Shim'on Peres.  'Arafat will then announce his approval of the arrangements  Israel wants.    Thus, political and media observers began to see, day in and  day out, further concessions made by the PLO delegation. They  have now reached the conclusion that Israel has taken  everything. But, despite this, Israel is exercising further  extortion just for the sake of it.    Israel stuck to its position over passages; settlements and  the lands around them; main roads; control over the land, sea,  and air border points; the right to enter the self-rule area to  arrest wanted Palestinians; and all the other conditions of  colonialism, hegemony, and tutelage. So what remains to be  negotiated in Taba? This is the question being asked by  political observers and world journalists. It is also the  question which the Palestinian Arab masses are asking.</p>

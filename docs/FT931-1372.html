			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US-Tokyo deadlock on chip trade THE US and Japan are deadlocked over the issue of setting new market share targets for semiconductor trade. Tokyo is refusing to agree to the use of any quantitative measure for foreign access to its Dollars 20bn market. Trade officials from both countries meeting in Hawaii ended their talks on Tuesday without resolving the dispute. The US has been pressing for a new market share target of a 20 per cent average this year. The semiconductor dispute has taken on a broader significance in the light of comments by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that he may take a similar approach, setting 'temporary quantitative indicators' in other sectors where the US believes the Japanese market is not open to its companies. US trade officials returned to Washington yesterday and the semiconductor issue will now be taken up at a senior administration level, in advance of a visit next month by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's premier. The US could seek an amendment to the 1991 bilateral semiconductor trade pact, including new market share targets. Alternatively, an informal agreement could be sought with the Japanese. Most likely, however, Washington will take a unilateral position, declaring its new market share target and using it as the primary measure of Japan's compliance with its promise to ensure greater market access for foreign microchip suppliers. Japan is determined to avoid any use of market share targets in future trade pacts, and is taking a stand on the issue in the semiconductor talks. Last week, the US and Japan announced that a 20 per cent foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market had been achieved in the fourth quarter of 1992. Achievement of that target, set in the 1991 pact, has been hailed by the US as evidence that market share targets are an effective means of prying open Japanese markets. Japan maintains, however, that the semiconductor agreement has been misinterpreted all along by the US, and that no formal commitment to 20 per cent was ever made. The semiconductor trade dispute, which has fuelled trade tensions between the US and Japan for the past decade, now appears set to become a central issue in the Clinton administration's efforts to reduce Japan's Dollars 50bn trade surplus with the US.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Economics and energy prices ANYONE UNDER the illusion that the furore over the future of the British coal is capable of simple resolution would do well to read the report published yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of the Office of Electricity Regulation. Its complex tabulations and reasoning about the wisdom of the electricity industry's so-called 'dash for gas' serve to illustrate how difficult it is to be confident about judgments which by definition involve guesswork about the likely course of fuel prices over very long periods. Prof Littlechild's view is that in signing up for substantial quantities of gas-fired electric power, Britain's regional electricity companies did the right thing. He argues that the price they will pay for their gas is lower than the price they could have obtained in seeking more coal-fired capacity via the two big national generators, National Power and PowerGen. Prof Littlechild is also sympathetic to the argument of the regional companies that, faced with the National Power-PowerGen duopoly, it is in their interest to open up additional sources of generation. Offer's calculations were instantly challenged yesterday by National Power and others, but those who lack the specialist knowledge to do their own arithmetic are likely to conclude that Offer's figures are the least partisan and most trustworthy available. Offer's critics maintain that the regulator also has a vested interest in diversifying ownership in electric power generation and hence in backing the dash for gas. Indispensable tool The immediate point for the government, as it approaches the end of its review of the October decision to close 31 coal mines, is that it should now discount the gas issue in its reassessment of coal's future. Unless government can be satisfied that Prof Littlechild has got his numbers wrong, the option of mothballing or delaying completion of gas-fired capacity is out. The underlying point is that, whatever the difficulties, economic analysis of the kind published yesterday by Prof Littlechild is an indispensable tool of energy policymaking. It is one of the more disgraceful aspects of British energy policy over the years that it has seldom, if ever, been based upon rigorous work of this sort. Uncompetitive prices Instead, politicians have preferred to lurch from project to project, arguing pointlessly about whether energy policy needs to exist at all (yes, says the Labour party; no, said the Thatcherites.) The danger with the first view is that it quickly turns into a command economy, with politicians responding to short-term pressures and making bad decisions which result in uncompetitive energy prices. This was British energy policy from 1945 to 1979. The legacy of the latter (British energy policy 1979-1992) is a series of major decisions on privatisation, new pits and power station projects taken without any attempt to understand and allow for the economic links between them. In energy, a decision about electricity is also inescapably a decision about coal, nuclear, gas and oil. If Britain is to retain, as it must in the interests of a competitive economy, its momentum towards regulated markets in energy, it is essential that transparent data about prices are available both to the market, the regulator and to the politicians who will still be required to take some decisions, whether for social, environmental or security reasons. It may well be that in response to the rebellion on its back benches the government will decide that it wishes to maintain or even increase the level of subsidy to the coal industry in order to save miners' jobs. If so, ministers should ensure that at the very least the price of this transaction is visible: either as direct subsidy from general taxation or a quantified levy on electricity consumers. There will be powerful instincts to the contrary. Transparent subsidies attract the attention of the European Commission, and electricity consumers have proved to be obligingly supine in accepting the existing toll to pay for uneconomic nuclear power. But when it comes to energy policy, the oldest advice is the best: let there be light.</p>

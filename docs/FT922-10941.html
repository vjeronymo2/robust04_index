			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: GM share issue to be made with cut-price fees GENERAL Motors' proposed Dollars 2bn share sale, the largest non-privatisation offering of shares launched internationally, will be carried out for cut-price fees - although the company is still expected to pay more than Dollars 50m to bankers around the world. Although the fee arrangements have yet to be formally agreed, Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank leading the transaction, is understood to have indicated to other banks that they can expect to receive 2.5 per cent of the proceeds for their involvement. The indicated fee level falls below the 3 per cent level which banks generally regard as rock-bottom for such deals. The extra discount reflects the size of the transaction, and a belief that banks involved in underwriting the sale around the world will be motivated more by the amount of fees they will receive than the actual percentage. Further details also emerged yesterday of the international portion of the share sale, which is the first to be structured from the US as a series of separate tranches tied to different regions around the world. Morgan Stanley will co-ordinate the 50m-share sale, and will also take a leading role in each separate tranche. It will be joined in the US, where 35m shares have been earmarked for sale, by First Boston, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. Daiwa and Nomura will jointly lead the sale of 4.5m shares in the Far East, with Cazenove and Warburg responsible for a similar tranche in the UK. Co-leaders on the final instalment of 6m shares, to be sold in continental Europe, Canada and elsewhere around the world, will be Deutsche Bank and UBS Philips &amp; Drew. The 30 per cent of shares earmarked for sale internationally exceeds the typical 10-20 per cent international tranche on US share issues. The larger international portion, and the decision to split it into separate tranches, reflects GM's desire to focus more on non-US investors. An international roadshow, beginning in the Far East late next week and moving to Europe the week after, will take its senior management around the world in the build-up to the sale, expected to be complet-ed around the middle of May. The size of international tranches seldom reflects the final outcome of share issues, though. To generate a higher profile for their deals internationally and to raise their profile in league tables, US investment banks are known in the past to have announced large international tranches to share offers which have subsequently been sold almost entirely in the US. GM's share sale is far more internationally targeted than equity and equity-linked issues recently from the two other large Detroit car makers, Ford and Chrysler. Last autumn, Ford targeted 10 per cent of a Dollars 750m convertible preference issue (later raised to Dollars 2bn) at international investors, while Chrysler sold only 5m shares in its 35m-share, Dollars 350m issue to foreign investors. GM's shares lost ground yesterday, trading at Dollars 38 3/4 , down around Dollars 1 from Friday and Dollars 3 3/4 below the price before the issue was announced. GM, which is expected to produce its first quarter earnings today, yesterday released the results for its three non-automotive subsidiaries. GM Hughes Electronics earned Dollars 181.4m in the quarter, up from Dollars 151.2m a year ago, but was helped by a Dollars 22m gain on the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Electronic Data Systems, the information technology business, made Dollars 133.1m, up from a restated Dollars 106.3m in 1991. General Motors Acceptance, the group's financing arm, reported net income of Dollars 354m, up Dollars 48m, after excluding a non-recurring 1991 adjust-ment. Wall Street is expecting the group as a whole to make a loss, although the company has been signalling to analysts that the figures will be much better than the Dollars 1.1bn of red ink recorded in the first quarter of last year.</p>

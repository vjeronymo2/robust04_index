			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Lebanon turns to Syria in PM row Mr Rafik Hariri, who has offered his resignation as Lebanon's prime minister, and his chief antagonist, Mr Nabih Berri, speaker of the parliament, took their bitter row to Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders yesterday. Mr Hariri continued to insist before the talks that he could 'no longer govern' the country. Some officials from the Hariri camp denied his resignation offer was a political gambit. The resignation was 'irrevocable' and his differences with Mr Berri, the former Shi'ite warlord, 'irreconcilable'. However, others close to Mr Hariri suggested before the talks that the businessman-turned-premier might be persuaded to stay on if Syria could broker a cabinet reshuffle which removed individuals seen as blocking Mr Hariri's plans. Mr Hariri has proved unable alone to command full cabinet discipline behind his ambitious rebuilding projects, and had offered his resignation in May after an earlier bout of cabinet infighting. Mr Hariri stormed out of a Thursday night cabinet meeting saying he had resigned because his ambitious Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6.7bn) rebuilding plans for Lebanon were being impeded by several ministers and by Mr Berri in particular. The resignation capped one of the sourest weeks of Mr Hariri's two-year tenure, marked by allegations of scandal and corruption directed by two parliamentarians at both the son of President Elias Hrawi and Solidere, the company designed by Mr Hariri to redevelop central Beirut. Mr Hrawi, who with Mr Hariri and Mr Berri is the third member of the country's ruling troika, has firmly backed the prime minister he appointed in 1992, saying he would 'tear up' Mr Hariri's resignation. The central bank at the weekend announced it had raised overnight rates to 50 per cent to back the Lebanese pound.</p>

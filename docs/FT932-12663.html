			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Wharf bids for hotel subsidiary's minorities WHARF, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate, is to bid HKDollars 1.22bn (USDollars 158m) for the minorities in Harbour Centre Development, its listed hotels subsidiary which operates the Omni chain of hotels. Wharf already owns 56 per cent of Harbour Centre, with the Kadoorie family owning 10.7 per cent through Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels and the remaining 33.3 per cent in the hands of the public. Wharf will bid HKDollars 9 a share cash. This represents a 15 per cent premium on Harbour Centre's pre-bid price of HKDollars 7.87, but a substantial discount on the company's net asset value. This is reckoned to be HKDollars 12.83 a share by Baring Securities and HKDollars 11.90 a share by Wardley James Capel. A simple average of the two valuations - HKDollars 12.36 - means Wharf's offer is at a discount of 27 per cent. Wharf has funded the offer by placing 65m shares at HKDollars 19.50 each with institutions. This raised HKDollars 1.27bn. Harbour City has embarked on a recent series of acquisitions in the US and Wharf said yesterday that it considered funding for these projects would be substantially enhanced if Harbour City were to become wholly-owned.</p>

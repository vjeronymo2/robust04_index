			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Sanctions may raise Milosevic support INTERNATIONAL sanctions against Serbia could increase popular support for President Slobodan Milosevic by providing a scapegoat for the collapse of the economy, according to diplomats in the Serbian capital. In addition, sanctions may not stop the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, at least in the short term, because Serbia, under President Milosevic, has financed the army by printing dinars. An oil embargo would compound already acute fuel shortages in the civilian economy, but limited domestic production is probably sufficient to meet the army's current needs. An arms embargo has been in effect since last May. It has affected a once-thriving arms industry, but the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Federal Army does not appear to be suffering any major shortages of weapons or ammunition. Diplomats say sanctions would have a mixed effect on Serbia's 9.8m people. Exports to the European Community in the first quarter totalled some Dollars 700m (Pounds 395m), which represents a 35 per cent decline compared to the same period in 1991. One diplomat said: 'It would obviously hurt Serbia to cut off this source of hard currency. But it is basically self-sufficient in terms of food and electricity production' because of abundant hydro-power. However, sanctions would exacerbate the slump in Serbian industrial production. Industrial output in the first quarter of the year fell by about 20 per cent compared with the same period last year. Mr Dimitrije Boarov, a journalist of Vreme, a Belgrade weekly, says the metal industry has already been hit hard by a shortage of spare parts and raw materials. The export of electricity would also be hit by a blockade. Comprehensive sanctions would also be aimed at Serbia's overseas assets. Diplomats estimate that the National Bank of Yugoslavia has Dollars 1.8bn-Dollars 2.2bn in overseas assets, while Dollars 3.3bn-Dollars 5bn in private assets are held in various offshore banking centres. But as one diplomat noted yesterday: 'By the time they freeze the assets, the assets would have fled.' An oil embargo would require a decision from the United Nations. Serbia imports some 4m tonnes of oil, mostly from Iran and China, and produces 1.05m tonnes per year. Mr Boarov yesterday dismissed Serbian claims that it receives 22 per cent of its oil needs from Russia. Despite petrol queues, Mr Boarov said the government had not introduced rationing.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / From hot commodity to consumer durable: Low inflation will stop homeowners making large speculative gains in the 1990s The economic conditions which gave rise to large house-price rises in the 1970s and 1980s are unlikely to be repeated even when the recession ends, say an increasing number of mortgage lenders, estate agents and housebuilders. They say the low inflation environment of the 1990s will prevent people making large speculative gains simply from owning their own homes. High real interest rates, tougher lending criteria by banks and building societies and the experiences of purchasers who lost money buying homes in the late 1980s have conspired to change radically the climate in which the housing market operates. Mr Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman and chairman of the National House-Building Council, warned buyers this week that homes should not be considered as 'a commodity for speculation' but as consumer products, to be lived in and used. Yet the initial cost of monthly mortgage repayments in relation to average earnings fell this week to the lowest level for 15 years. The basic mortgage interest rate - after the latest cuts by building societies and banks - is the lowest since 1968. Simple sums by Halifax building society and Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, show how much the market has changed since then. A family buying an average priced home for Pounds 4,650 in 1968 would today own a property worth about Pounds 65,000, even after recent price falls. Interest and capital repayments on a 100 per cent mortgage would have been Pounds 13,670 over the 25 years. In today's money these repayments would still be only Pounds 39,568. The resulting profit of more than Pounds 25,000 compares well with other forms of investment. If the monthly repayments had been invested at 10 per cent the family would have earned only Pounds 49,000 - and would still have had to pay for a roof over its head. Similar calculations on a house bought for Pounds 16,300 in 1978 show that the family would have repaid Pounds 56,200 in present day values over 15 years. This still leaves a profit of almost Pounds 9,000 on a property now worth Pounds 65,000. One reason why buying a house was more attractive in the 1970s than in 1980s was that annual wage growth outstripped average mortgage rates in all but two years between 1968 and 1981. Since 1981 mortgage interest rates have consistently remained higher than annual wage increases. But this did not deter house buyers, since the cost of borrowing was more than compensated for by the annual rise in house prices. This was encouraged by de-regulation early in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's term, which set banks free to compete with building societies. Housing loans doubled between 1980 and 1982 and doubled again by 1987. The weight of money drove up house prices. Since 1981 the average price of a house has risen by 162 per cent compared with a 112 per cent rise in the retail price index and a 143 per cent increase in average earnings. House price falls since 1989 have left an estimated 1.3m people with properties that are worth less than the money borrowed to buy them. Homeowners in southern England or East Anglia who have seen the value of their properties fall by 30 per cent since buying would have to wait until 2001 to get their money back - assuming that prices rise by 5 per cent a year between now and 2000. In real terms - if inflation is taken into account - it is unlikely they will ever recover their money. Mr Wriglesworth said: 'It is estimated that another 1.5m people will have difficulty in moving because house price falls mean they cannot recover enough cash to provide an acceptable deposit for a mortgage. Experiences like these will continue to scar the market even if conditions improve. 'Nonetheless it is still worth buying a home while renting costs about the same as mortgage repayments.' The implication for the market is that those who need to move will continue to buy. Those with less pressing reasons may be put off. Prices are likely to rise more slowly in this climate while annual transactions, which have fallen sharply during the recession, are unlikely to recover to previous levels when the market picks up.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          HOUSE PRICES AND EARNINGS: HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Average   Average    Annual    Annual     Avg basic           house    annual    change    change   in mortgage           price   earnings  in price   earnings     rate       RPI          Pounds    Pounds   percent    percent    percent     percent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1968      4,650    1,326     +8.9%      +7.8%      +7.46%      4.7% 1969      4.850    1,430     +4.3%      +7.8%      +8.08%      5.4% 1970      5,190    1,595       +7%     +11.5%      +8.58%      6.4% 1971      6,130    1,752    +18.1%      +9.8%      +8.59%      9.4% 1972      8,420    1,964    +37.4%     +12.1%       +8.26%     7.1% 1973     11,120    2,249    +32.1%     +14.5%       +9.59%     9.2% 1974     11,300    2,659     +1.6%     +18.2%     +11.05%     16.1% 1975     12,119    3,320     +7.2%     +24.9%     +11.08%     24.2% 1976     12,999    3,823     +7.3%     +15.2%     +11.06%     16.5% 1977     13,922    4,170     +7.1%      +9.1%     +11.05%     15.8% 1978     16,297    4,749    +17.1%     +13.9%      +9.55%      8.2% 1979     21,047    5,503    +29.1%     +15.9%     +11.94%     13.4% 1980     24,307    6,725    +15.5%     +22.2%     +14,92%     18.0 1981     24,810    7,497     +2.1%     +11.5%     +14.01%     11.9% 1982     25,553    8,165       +3%      +8.9%      +13.3%      8.6% 1983     28,593    8,693    +11.9%      +6.5%     +11.03%      4.6% 1984     30,812    9,447     +7.8%      +8.7%     +11.84%      4.9% 1985     33,188   10,069     +7.7%      +6.6%     +13.21%      6.1% 1986     38,121   10,790    +14.9%      +7.2%     +11.83%      3.4% 1987     44,220   11,648      +16%      +7.9%     +11.54%      4.1% 1988     54,280   12,782    +22.7%      +9.7%     +10.97%      4.9% 1989     62,135   14,014    +14.5%      +9.6%     +13.65%      7.0% 1990     66,695   15,371     +7.3%      +9.7%     +15.12%      9.5% 1991     65,593   16,817     -1.7%      +9.4%     +12.93%      5.9% 1992     63,425   17,907     -3.3%      +6.5%     +10.64%      3.7% 1993     64,700*  18,400*      +2%*     +3.0%*        na      1.5%*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *estimate  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Building Societies Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

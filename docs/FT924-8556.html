			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (1): A torrent of legislation - Growing acceptance of the need for environmental policies has lowered the tensions between 'green' campaigners and industry. Public attention now focuses more on compliance with new regulations PRESSURE on industry to improve its environmental performance is entering a new phase. In the past two decades, in response to growing public interest in 'green' issues, the US and the European Community have passed at an unprecedented rate a raft of new regulations ordering businesses to clean up the environment. The broad acceptance of the need for environmental policy by governments and businesses has taken some of the heat out of the traditional confrontations between 'green' pressure groups and industry, and public attention is now focusing more on compliance with the new rules. For their part, businesses are increasingly investigating whether environmental improvements could prove to be a commercial opportunity as well as a cost. The scope of environmental regulation now in place or shortly to be passed, ranging from local to international, is now considerable and is the main factor causing companies to pay more attention to the environment, according to consultants' surveys. The number of international agreements has risen sharply: between 1948 and 1970, governments signed only nine international treaties, mainly on oil pollution, but since 1970 there have been 32 international treaties and 13 European Conventions, according to consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. The definitions of who is liable for the costs of cleaning up are also widening. Under the 'polluter pays' principle accepted internationally at the Rio Earth Summit in June, many environmental costs are now being passed back to companies. The EC is currently discussing new rules on civil liability for waste which could be as wideranging as some US legislation, imposing strict liability - regardless of fault or negligence - and joint and several liability, meaning that the 'deepest pockets' could shoulder most of the costs. Like the UK's proposed contaminated land register these rules could act retrospectively, saddling companies with costs for environmental damage committed many years in the past, even if the present owners or management were not responsible. There is a growing emphasis on improving levels of compliance with regulation - the European Commission has acknowledged that its failure to enforce its 200-odd directives equally across member countries could hinder the operation of the single market, and EC countries last week agreed to set up a European network of inspectors. Penalties for infringement are also becoming harsher. The UK's 1990 Environmental Protection Act holds the producer of waste legally responsible for its safe handling and disposal, and breach of the rules can result in criminal charges against the senior management. The scope of this regulation, and the competitive changes it is provoking in many industries, means that more companies are beginning to make environmental management part of their overall management strategy. To avoid penalties - and the accompanying risk of damaging publicity - and to avoid being left behind by competitors, companies may need to scrutinise their production from 'cradle to grave': the source of raw materials, the impact of the factory on its surroundings, the amount and type of energy consumed, the effluents poured down pipes or on to the ground, emissions through the chimneys and the final disposal of waste. That is before considering whether the product itself is 'green' enough or whether customers will demand changes. To encourage companies to look at environmental management systematically, the EC is discussing plans for ecoauditing - full, published, standardised figures on a company's impact on the environment - and the UK has begun trials of the new BS7750 standard of environmental management. However, while many companies' intentions are good, in practice environmental management can be patchy. KPMG Management Consulting, an arm of the international accountancy firm, which recently conducted a survey of environmental management in the top 100 companies in the UK, US and Canada, concluded that 'most comments (in annual reports) were token efforts demonstrating that the company was aware of the environment as an issue and (gave) some broad promises of future actions'. It added that 'in all three countries very few companies had used external consultants to conduct an independent environmental audit'. Unsurprisingly, formal environmental policies are most common in industries such as national utilities, oil and gas and chemicals which have been environmentally regulated for longest, while tourism and motor companies are only just beginning to publish plans, and financial services companies rarely mention the issues, according to a June 1991 survey by Touche Ross, the accountancy and consultancy firm. For some companies, environmental management can bring commercial opportunities, as well as safety from penalties. The Confederation of British Industry, in its response to the Rio Earth Summit in June, has been adamant that there are 'real benefits to the business of sound environmental performance'. Investment in 'green technology' ahead of competitors can bring a competitive advantage, as seen in the race between US oil companies to reformulate petrol and diesel to meet the US Clean Air Act deadlines of 1994-98, and the research spending of motor companies on catalytic converters and 'lean-burn' engines to reduce emissions. Other companies find that the best way of reducing the level of waste, emissions and discharges is to use raw materials and energy more efficiently in production, leading to lower costs. A booming waste management industry has also grown up to take advantage of the rising costs of getting rid of waste, as it becomes harder to get regulatory permission for emissions or discharges from factories, or to open new landfills and incinerators. But although some of the army of consultants and advisers appear to regard it as axiomatic that investment in environmental management leads to a competitive advantage, that is not true in all cases. In the UK water industry, EC directives have resulted in at least Pounds 15bn of the decade-long capital spending programme of some Pounds 45bn, but as the companies are regional companies it is hard to argue they have gained revenue. The CBI has also suggested that some environmental legislation has been 'unrealistic' and a handicap to businesses, not an opportunity. Mr Paul Beatley, a Paris-based consultant with Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says that it is right at least to ask whether environmental programmes really benefit companies in the long run, despite the costs, although adding that in his experience they do. However, the question of the benefits of environmental spending is one that is asked increasingly frequently - as the full costs of cleaning up the environment have started to become clear. The European Commission estimates that complying with directives - excluding the considerable costs of the nuclear power industry and water supply - costs member countries between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of GDP a year. In its June 1991 study Touche Ross said that on the basis of 150 environmental audits, European companies were spending around 4 per cent of turnover on environmental measures. This appeared to be nearly double US figures, although it emphasised that comparison is hard. There are signs that growing awareness of the costs is slowing the pace of new legislation - the US currently has a moratorium on new environmental legislation, and EC countries are stressing the need for more realism about the economic impact of proposals. Governments are also favouring 'financial instruments' such as taxes or permits for industrial emissions instead of more regulation for dealing with environmental problems. At the Rio Earth Summit in June, the main solution proposed to the threat of global warming from the emission of 'greenhouse gases' such as carbon dioxide was energy or carbon taxes, possibly combined with taxes on vehicles. The costs of a carbon tax would undeniably be great, even if it was made fiscally neutral by lowering other taxes - the European Commission estimates that it could cut 0.07 per cent off EC real GDP growth in the first 13 years after introduction. But the advantages of financial instruments - both for governments and for businesses - are that the costs are more readily foreseen and their investment can be better planned. The new mood of realism about the costs and limitations of environmental regulation may well benefit the environment, as standards of industrial compliance rise. It may also help environmental management progress further from present standards, as businesses become better able to judge the impact of environmental regulation on their markets and to spot opportunities and shape their strategies accordingly.</p>

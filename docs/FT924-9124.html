			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: US move unsettles German coalition WASHINGTON'S decision to impose selected trade sanctions on the European Community yesterday sharpened the divisions in Germany's ruling coalition. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who has been critical of France's obstruction to a trade agreement with the US, said Germany would still try to push through the final offer made by Washington last Thursday. 'We must come together now. We are in the situation that unless there are new impulses for the economy, we will enter a global recession,' he told German radio. Mr Claus Hommer, the minister's spokesman, said Mr Mollemann would not rule out a majority decision in the EC's council of ministers, even if that means excluding France's participation. However, a senior agricultural official in Bonn said it was unfair to single out France as the sole culprit for the breakdown of the trade talks. In a reflection of the clear split between the industrial and the agricultural lobby on the one hand, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for French President Francois Mitterrand on the other, the official said any agreement forged between the US and the EC at Chicago would have been impossible to implement. He said the US had in fact taken a 'step backwards' in the sense that it had insisted on placing a maximum tonnage on the amount of oil seeds French farmers could produce, while the Community's reforms were based on setting aside acreage. Mr Kohl's office issued a statement expressing regret for Washington's decision, adding that it would make the negotiations more difficult. But the chancellor's critics, most notably Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the liberal Free Democrats and a former economics minister, said Mr Kohl had failed to use his influence to urge the French government to accept the terms negotiated by the US. Mr Mollemann's criticism of France, and his call for pressing ahead with an agreement, received backing from the Federation of German Industries (BDI), the country's influential industrial lobby. 'The interests of the Commission should not represent any one country, but that it should represent the economic interests of all its member states,' said Mr Bernhard Welschke, a senior official in the BDI's foreign trade policy department, in a veiled attack on France.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The Serb population of  Tuzla, Moslem-controlled industrial town in northeast Bosnia,  has recently become, along with the persecution initiated long  ago, the subject of unprecedented trade, TANJUG learned on  Wednesday from Vojislav Djurkovic, the representatives of a  State Commission for the Exchange of the Population. Djurkovic  said that Serbs who want to leave the Tuzla area have to pay  between 1,000-1,500 German marks per person. The Tuzla area is  a specific prison for the Serbs, Djurkovic said and added that  it is believed that 20,000 Serbs still remain in the region.    Both the world public and the humanitarian institutions have  shown insufficient interest in the destiny and salvation of the  Tuzla Serbs, although the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  Commander for Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, had promised to  enable them to leave for the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS),  Djurkovic recalled. The issue of the Tuzla Serbs remains open,  but the opening of the Tuzla airport, allegedly solely for  humanitarian purposes, remains in the focus of interest of many  in the world, he said.    About 7,000 Serbs and other nationals have so far left Tuzla  through official exchanges with RS and Yugoslavia, while another  3,000 civilians have fled mainly individually via the front  lines, Djurkovic said. Quoting eye-witness reports, Djurkovic  said that numerous Serbs had been liquidated such as in cases  when they were forced to cross mine fields when leaving  Moslem-controlled territories for RS.    The Tuzla refugees, who also include Croats, claim that the  Serbs have been stripped of all their rights in this town. Many  were killed, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated with the tacit  agreement of the Moslem local and regional authorities,  Djurkovic said. He said that many Tuzla Serbs are literally  living in the streets since the authorities have evicted them  out of their homes so that now they roam the town without food  and clothing.    The months-long persistent attempts by the Serb side to  convince the Tuzla authorities to agree to an exchange of the  population, remain futile. The Serb side, primarily motivated  by humanitarian reasons, decided to unilaterally organize the  reunification of separated families, i.e. to enable the arrival  in Tuzla not only of Moslems living in Semberija, where they  live in freedom and safety, but also of those from the territory  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who wish to leave,  Djurkovic said.    The exchange is in preparation and should be attended by the  representatives of international humanitarian organizations, he  said.</p>

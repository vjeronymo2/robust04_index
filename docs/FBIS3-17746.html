The elections held last Sunday have been found valid in all  the 450 one-seat districts, although in the run-up to the  elections, many politicians, including President Kravchuk, have  not been sure of sufficient voter turnout.    Some 75 per cent of voters on an everage have cast their  ballots, according to preliminary returns. Voter turnout in  Kiev was considerably less, approximately 56 per cent of the  eligible voters. There was the highest voter turnout in Western  regions, where, as expected, candidates from nationalist forces  won.    There is a different picture in eastern Ukraine. In the  Donetsk and the Lugansk regions, out of the 14 deputies who won  in the first round, eleven will represent the Communist Party of  Ukraine in the Supreme Soviet. First secretary of the Centarl  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Petr Simonenko was  also elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet.    Only a small part of the future deputies corps, some 70  people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet on the first  round, according to preliminary results. The date for the  second round has not yet been fixed. Informed sources say,  however, that it will be held not later than 10 April.    Most of those who have been elected to parliament in the  first round are prominent politicians. Former premier Leonid  Kutchma who favours stronger ties with Russia earned the biggest  number of votes. Ninety-one per cent of voters in the district  where he ran cast their ballots for him. The voter turnout in  the Novgorod- Severskiy district where he ran was 96 per cent.  Among those who have been elected to parlaiment are the present  parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch, former deputy prime  minister Viktor Pizenik, leader of extreme nationalists Stepan  Khmara and other politicians prominent in Ukraine.    Foreign observers who monitored the election believe there  have been no serious violations of democratic procedure.</p>

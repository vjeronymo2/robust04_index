			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> TEST OF DRUNK-DRIVER CHECKPOINT PLANNED  </P> <P> In a dress rehearsal for the holiday season, the La Habra Police Department  will establish its first-ever drunk-driver checkpoint somewhere in the city  Saturday.  </P> <P> "We want to get the kinks out before we run it big-time," Police Capt. John  Rees explained.  </P> <P> About 10 officers will set up a checkpoint that they hope will snare drunk  drivers and, by publicity and its visibility, deter other drivers from driving  while intoxicated during the holiday season, Rees said.  </P> <P> He would not say where or when the checkpoint will be set up on Saturday, only  that it is expected to stay in operation for about seven or eight hours.  </P> <P> He predicted that if the initial outing is successful, "we'll probably be  seeing more of them in the future."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Opinions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. This paragraph contains several options depending upon whether the Mortgagor's organizational documents were prepared by counsel rendering the opinion and the type of mortgagor entity. Care should be taken to ensure that the correct option is selected and that the requisite information is inserted correctly. It is intended that, where the mortgagor entity or general partner of the mortgagor entity is established by counsel to the Mortgagor, no reliance on other sources is permitted and counsel must opine as to the due organization of the Mortgagor. If a Certificate of Good Standing is not available in the State, but an equivalent document is (i.e., Certificate of Existence), then the bracketed language must be revised to reflect the name/title of the equivalent document so obtained. Any Certificate of Good Standing or equivalent document issued by the applicable governmental authority must be dated no more than 30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Mortgagor's counsel. If a Certificate of Good Standing or equivalent document cannot be obtained from the applicable governmental authority (e.g., for general partnerships, then the Mortgagor's attorney will be required to do the due diligence necessary to give the opinion or may engage other counsel to render such opinion). If the Property jurisdiction is not the State of formation for the mortgagor entity, counsel must also opine that the Mortgagor is qualified to transact business in the Property jurisdiction. Such opinion may be made solely on the basis of a certificate from the applicable governmental authorities of the Property jurisdiction, and if counsel is relying on such certificate(s), then the opinion must expressly identify those certificate(s) and they must be attached to the opinion as an exhibit. If the Mortgagor is an individual, paragraph one should be deleted from the opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If any UCC Financing Statements have been filed on the Personalty in conjunction with any transaction other than the Loan, they must be identified to the HUD field counsel as well as details with respect to how such Financing Statements will be terminated at the time of closings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. If the Mortgagor or any principal of the Mortgagor is involved in any litigation, all such litigation matter(s) must be disclosed in writing to HUD field counsel in order that the Department can determine whether the endorsement of the loan is possible. If the litigation involves HUD's compliance with civil rights requirements, it must immediately be brought to the attention of appropriate Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity personnel. As an example, it is not uncommon for neighbors of a proposed site for a group home for persons with disabilities to harbor discriminatory attitudes toward persons with disabilities and to sue to attempt to block the establishment or operation of a group home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. If the property is an elderly housing project or a health care facility or if the loan otherwise is to be secured by significant amounts of personal property, the matter should be discussed with field counsel. In the event further discussion is necessary, field counsel should contact the Assistant General Counsel, Multifamily Mortgage Division. For projects in which the personalty is mostly household appliances (e.g., refrigerators) or a limited quantity of smaller equipment, the opinion will be limited as shown. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One or more UCC searches performed not more than 30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Mortgagor's counsel must be made and retained by the field counsel in the loan file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. If the Mortgagor is a trust (other than a land trust), then Paragraph 15 must be included in the opinion letter. The second sentence need only be included if the trust was formed in a jurisdiction other than the Property jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Acceptability of Counsel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Mortgagor's counsel must opine as to the law of the Property jurisdiction and the state of Mortgagor's organization, if different from the Property jurisdiction. HUD requires that Mortgagor's counsel be admitted to practice law in each jurisdiction in which such admission is required by the laws or ethical considerations of the bar to be able to give the opinion. If multiple jurisdictions are involved, two opinions may be required: one with respect to the organization of the Mortgagor and another with respect to the real property and loan issues. A combination of the Mortgagor's regular counsel and special local counsel may be required to satisfy this requirement. If counsel's satisfaction of these requirements is not evident from the letterhead of the firm, the field counsel should include a written explanation in the Washington docket. In all events, each provision in the Guide must be addressed whether one or more opinions is required to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Signatures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The opinion may be signed by an authorized person of the law firm, in that person's name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Mortgagor's Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A form of Mortgagor's Certification is attached. The form represents the minimum amount of information that should be obtained from the Mortgagor (but additions, revisions and rephrasings are acceptable so long as the Mortgagor is certifying as to factual matters and not legal conclusions). The Mortgagor's Certification must be dated the same date as the Loan Documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

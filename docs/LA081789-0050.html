			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> It's official. Home Box Office will take over the management of Movietime, the  basic cable channel that promotes and covers the Hollywood film industry,  Movietime's board of directors announced this week. Sources at Movietime say  that HBO intends to turn the 24-hour a day channel into "the CNN of the  entertainment world." HBO will now oversee all sales, marketing and programming  operations at Movietime, which is owned jointly by several large entertainment  conglomerates and cable operators. HBO, which owns about 10% of the company,  also plans to break into the world of basic cable with an all-comedy channel  later this year. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Saks document shows after-tax loss of Dollars 398m SAKS Fifth Avenue, the upmarket US retailer, incurred after-tax losses of Dollars 398m in the 19 months to January 31 1992, AP-DJ reported yesterday. It said the figure was disclosed in 'a confidential Saks document' obtained by Dow Jones. Yesterday, Mr Arthur Martinez, Saks' vice-chairman, declined to comment on any specific figures. However, he stressed that the retailer faced no liquidity problems and had breached no banking covenants. Saks was acquired from Britain's BAT Industries in 1990 by Investcorp, an investment company backed by Middle Eastern funds. Earlier this year, Saks announced that Investcorp was injecting another Dollars 300m of equity into the retailer - a move which came amid rumours of poor operating performance and late payments to suppliers. The latter was emphatically denied, although Saks said trading was 'clearly very difficult'. Yesterday, Mr Martinez said again that this move was unconnected to trading results, and designed to continue the 'deleveraging' of the company.</p>

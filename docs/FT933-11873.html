			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (4): Tough budget to curb excesses LITTLE did Ghana's electorate know, as they voted in last December's parliamentary elections, what surprises President Rawlings and senior cabinet ministers had planned for the first few months of the new civilian administration. Within hours of Mr Rawlings's inauguration, Kwesi Botchwey, finance minister, announced a frighteningly tough 1993 budget package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to restore order to Ghana's deteriorating public finances after the excesses of the election year. The need for decisive action is readily apparent from the large gaps between last year's targets and the actual budget outcomes for 1992. The government began the year expecting to achieve a small budget surplus of 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product. But the combination of poor revenue collection and a 45 per cent increase in the civil service salary bill meant that, by December, this surplus had turned into a deficit of 4.8 per cent of GDP - 5.9 per cent excluding foreign grants. This year's ambitious budget package is designed to restore the budget to surplus in one year - the government's declared strategy is to close the budget gap quickly, to prevent inflationary expectations becoming entrenched. The centrepiece is a 60 per cent increase in the price of premium petrol - C1000 to C1600 a gallon (Dollars 2.50 at current exchange rates). Speed and administrative efficiency meant that this was preferred to an early introduction of the government's planned value-added tax. It will account for almost two thirds of budget balance improvement. The remaining tightening is expected to come from improved cocoa revenues, better tax collection and proceeds from privatisation. The government expects to raise cedi 60bn - 1.5 percentage points of GDP - from divestiture. Thirty companies are up for sale, but the government can meet its targets in one stroke if the partial sale of its stake in Ashanti goldfields proceeds. Opposition reaction to the budget was rapid. The NPPaccused the government of 'aggravating the economic hardship of a people already burdened by a decade of austerity measures' and called on the parliament to use its powers to reverse the petrol price increase. It argued that this was both regressive and unlikely to yield the government's revenue targets and suggested an alternative package of luxury import duty levies, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and expenditure cuts. Western observers in Ghana say the petrol price increase should be progressive. The volume of petrol sales dropped 10 per cent in the first four quarters of this year but projected petrol tax revenues appear to be on target. Even so, the government budget plans look highly optimistic. Unless corporate and import tax revenues recover markedly and divestiture occurs as planned, this year's petrol price increase will not meet the government's ambitious revenue target of 17.5 per cent of GDP this year, up from 11.1 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the spending targets assume that the government succeeds in freezing civil service salaries in a year in which consumer price inflation is expected to average 20 per cent. If spending does accelerate, or if revenue collection proves disappointing, a further rise in petrol prices cannot be ruled out.  ---------------------------------------------------------------          GOVERNMENT BUDGET - NARROW COVERAGE* (% OF GDP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                         1990    1991    Prog.'92   1992   1993**  --------------------------------------------------------------- REVENUE &amp; GRANTS        13.2    15.2      16.1     12.2   18.8 of which revenue        11.8    13.8      14.9     11.1   17.5 EXPENDITURE             13      13.7      14.3     17.0   18.5 of which current         9.7    10.2      10.6     12.4   13.9 FISCAL BALANCE           0.2     1.5       1.8     -4.8    0.3 Domestic financing      -1.7    -2.0      -2.7      4.8   -2.2  --------------------------------------------------------------- * Excludes project-related grants and capital outlays ** IMF projections  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance, IMF  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Veba buys large stake in Swedish power generator VEBA, the German conglom- erate, is to become the largest shareholder in Sydkraft, one of Sweden's leading power generation companies, in the biggest privatisation yet in Sweden. Preussen Elektra, a Veba subsidiary, is to pay SKr1.07bn (Dollars 197m) for part of the voting and non-voting shares owned by the council for Helsingborg, a large town on the south-west coast of Sweden. Veba's expansion is one of the first examples of the increasing likelihood of higher levels of foreign ownership in Swedish industry. The removal of the final legal restrictions to foreign ownership of any part of a Swedish company, which was in place for over 50 years, took place earlier this year. Last year, the German company purchased 10.5 per cent of the equity but only 1.7 per cent of the voting shares in the Swedish power company. Under the proposed deal, Helsingborg council is issuing a bond to Preussen Electra which gives the company the right to take over its stake in Sydkraft on January 1 1995 when the existing consortium agreement of southern Swedish local authorities in Sydkraft comes to an end. As a result of the agreement, the German company will acquire Helsingborg council's 6.2 per cent equity and 9.9 per cent voting rights in Sydkraft. This will make Preussen Elektra the largest shareholder in the company and the second-biggest owner of voting rights in Sydkraft after Malmo city council. The Helsingborg council said that the deal would provide it with a profit of about SKr1bn. 'Both from an ideological and economic point of view the deal is a very great success', said Mr Jerker Swanstein, head of the council. 'A local authority should not own assets which can be owned by the private sector. The need for direct ownership is less important in a liberalised electricity market.' This is the first example of a local authority in Sweden privatising its stake in a utility. But over the next few years other local authorities are expected to follow the latest move in order to raise resources at a time of financial stringency. The deal with Veba shows that the privatisation programme in Sweden has not lost momentum, in spite of the moratorium agreed two weeks ago at national level between the Swedish government and the Social Democratic opposition on the sale of Sweden's state-owned enterprises. As a result of the sale Helsingborgs will cut its current loan debts, said Mr Swanstein. At present, Helsingborg council is controlled by a coalition of non-Socialist parties, but in a statement it said that the Social Demo-cratic opposition also supported the deal with Preussen Elektra. Mr Goran Ahlstrom, chief executive of Sydkraft, said he knew nothing about the deal. While the news agencies had been informed, he had not.</p>

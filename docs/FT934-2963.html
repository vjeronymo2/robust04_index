			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: French group issues first warrants on SBF 120 stock index Societe Generale Equities &amp; Derivatives has issued the first warrants on France's new SBF 120 stock index, launched on Wednesday. The SBF 120 includes medium-sized as well as large companies, representing more than 80 per cent of the capitalisation of the Paris stock exchange, compared with 56 per cent for the CAC-40 index. 'The SBF 120 is more sensitive to an economic upturn than the CAC-40, with a higher representation of sectors which should benefit earlier from the recovery,' according to Mr Frederic Redel, French strategist at SGED. Sectors with greater representation in the SBF 120 include construction, durable goods and retail. The issue consists of 1m call and 1m put warrants, exercisable from December 30 1993 to December 30 1994. There are four tranches of call warrants, with strike prices of 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700 and four tranches of put warrants with strike prices of 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 and 1,600. The index, compiled by the Societe Francaise des Bourses, is computed only at the market's opening and closing, but will become continuous in March. Barclays de Zoete Wedd has launched two issues of call warrants on the three-year Italian swap rate denominated in Swiss francs. The warrants are aimed at Swiss investors who wish to position themselves for declines in Italian interest rates. The issue consists of 20,000 six-month call warrants on the three-year swap rate with a strike price of 7.96 per cent and 30,000 one-year call warrants with a strike price of 8.23 per cent. Both issues are European-style warrants.</p>

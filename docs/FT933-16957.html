			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (7): Need to respond faster - Insurance is learning to live with EC directives THE implementation of the EC third directives on life and non-life insurance in July 1994 will represent a watershed for the German insurance industry. Since the 19th century the authorities have regulated the market by detailed supervision of policy terms and premium rates rather than the monitoring of insurers' financial condition. 'As Brussels has opted for another market model, much closer to that of the UK, we believe that we have to live with the consequences,' says Dr Bernd Michaels, chairman of the German Insurers' Association (GDV). 'The task is now to ensure that the directives are transformed into German law in such a way that its insurers have a fair chance to compete,' he adds. All leading German insurers share the view that big changes will ensue, particularly in personal lines business. 'We are talking about a different game,' says Dr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of market leader Allianz. Companies will be forced to pay much more attention to policy development, particularly in life insurance, and respond more rapidly to innovation as both they and new market entrants are freed from the tight restriction of the supervisory office in Berlin. 'For the first time in German insurance history underwriting of private customer business will have to be creative,' says Mr Claas Kleyboldt, chairman of Colonia Konzem, holding company of the Colonia and Nordstern insurance groups. At the same time, customers will be faced with more choice and more difficult decisions. Both Dr Schulte-Noelle and Mr Kleyboldt see an increased role for the insurance companies' agents, who dominate distribution in Germany. The industry recognises that the agents' new role is something more than simply a sales function and will require more training, but it is determined to maintain control over this itself. Germany currently has almost no control over the insurance sales process, relying on close regulation of the insurers and on their own image-consciousness. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been increasing concern over dubious practices, particularly by some of the growing number of independent sales companies and in the new states in eastern Germany. An increase in price competition is also regarded as inevitable, with equally far-reaching implications. Dr Knut Hohlfeld, president of the Insurance Supervisory Office, acknowledged in an interview in February that German insurers had been cross-subsidising low commercial insurance rates with profits from private customer business, an allegation which the industry itself consistently denies. Nevertheless, with a view to the future after 1994, Mr Kleyboldt comments: 'I personally think that the best thing that could have happened was the disaster in comprehensive motor insurance this year and last.' Increasing car thefts - many for export to eastern Europe - together with losses from eastern Germany, have led to heavy losses on motor insurance. In response, insurers have set restrictions on the cover offered. They have also pressed for rate increases, requesting between 10 per cent and 20 per cent this year. Companies are also seeking the right to increase premium rates during the life of the policy - which is generally long by European standards. Mutual insurers already have the ability to increase premiums at any time, by membership vote. Fewer changes are predicted in industrial lines. These are already open to the single market, but with little effect on the traditional links between German industry and German insurers. Part of the reason, according to Dr Michaels, is that policies were already of international standard and prices had become so low that few outsiders were interested in competing for business. Industrial, fire, and loss of profit lines have suffered heavy losses. Since 1991 German insurers have finally begun to demand premium increases, which have risen by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. In the past, big industrial conglomerates have been able to demand cheap cover and very small deductibles, while using so-called in-house insurance brokers to earn a profitable commission. Insurers are now demanding increases at time when their clients are under severe financial pressures of other kinds. As a result, in the longer term there may be important changes in how German companies insure. Already some are trading off increased deductibles against a smaller increase in premium rates. German industry has also been relatively insulated from the increasing use of captive insurers and other self-funding mechanisms. In the UK, the US and Sweden, half of all cover for big industry is carried out like this this The Customs House Dock financial services centre in Dublin has been a particular beneficiary of the increase in German-owned captives, and the trend can be expected to continue. Another effect of these changes is increased attention to reducing administrative expenses, partly to counterbalance rising claims costs. Dr Schulte-Noelle also draws an explicit connection with increasing price competition for personal customer business, as well as the pressure exerted on cost ratios by the development of new business and, especially, supporting the new market in eastern Germany. Attempts to win market share from Allianz's local subsidiary, Deutsche Versicherungs, the successor to the former state monopoly insurer, has generated heavy losses for some insurers which marketed policies at a heavy discount. Germany has successfully demanded from the EC special dispensations to maintain its traditional insurance accounting procedures. The lowest value principle (which enables German insurers and reinsurers to build up large hidden capital reserves in addition to the compulsory but tax-efficient special reserves against fluctuations in underwriting results) will be maintained. So will the ban on discounting loss reserves. Together these 'have led to the high safety margin we have had in Germany for decades,' Dr Michaels says. The insurance accounting directive will force German insurers to disclose the market value of their assets, but is expected to delay implementation of this directive for as long as possible - probably to the end of the decade. Such disclosure could lead to a kind of rating or competition between insurers over the level of hidden reserves. Dr Michaels thinks that this would be to the industry's disadvantage.

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / 40% error rate in CSA awards A report into the operations of the Child Support Agency has revealed considerable errors in the calculation and allocation of maintenance assessments, in spite of attempts to improve the organisation's operations over the past year. As ministers consider whether to introduce fresh reforms of the CSA, Mr Ernie Hazlewood, the chief child support officer, issued a report yesterday showing that nearly 40 per cent of the maintenance assessments made over the past year had been incorrect. Mr Hazlewood, whose department is part of the government's Central Adjudication Service, also found that proper procedures for calculating maintenance had been followed in only one in seven cases. In his report, he acknowledged that the CSA's managers had recognised the need for action to improve standards and had undertaken a wide-ranging study to improve services. Mr Alistair Burt, the minister responsible for the CSA's operations, admitted that the findings were 'disappointing'. The report was based on a random investigation of 1,380 cases in which child maintenance had been made. Mr Hazlewood reported that, in this sample, the maintenance assessment was incorrect in 545 cases (39.5 per cent) and that adjudication comments were raised by recipients on another 486 occasions. There was also concern about the way earnings were calculated. Assessments did not follow legislative requirements in 25 per cent of cases and were 'doubtful' in a further 13 per cent. The Commons social security committee is looking at how the CSA can be reformed. The committee will consider whether clean-break settlements between couples should be taken into account in the assessment of maintenance. Social security department officials have said they will wait for the publication of the report before deciding whether to introduce legislation to change the CSA next year.</p>

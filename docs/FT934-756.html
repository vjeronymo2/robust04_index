			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Surprise ruling on pensions bias UK company pension schemes can continue to use life expectancy tables which distinguish between men and women for the purpose of calculating benefits after an unexpected decision by the European Court of Justice yesterday. The Luxembourg Court's ruling that European equal-pay rules do not extend to non-pension benefits, such as tax-free lump sums on retirement and transfer payments, means UK employers will be able to quantify the main cost implications of the court's 1990 Barber judgment. In the Barber case the court ruled that pension benefits of men and women had to be equalised as they constituted pay for the purposes of the Treaty of Rome equal-pay rules. Yesterday's decision was a disappointment for Mr David Neath, whose claim against his former employer Hugh Steeper, the Leeds artificial-limb manufacturer, was backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the MSF white-collar union. Mr Neath was made redundant in 1990 at the age of 54 and was offered the alternative of a deferred pension or a transfer payment. He said the company pension scheme discriminated against men by calculating pensions on the basis that they would be paid at 65, as against 60 for women, and by using different actuarial assumptions in calculating transfer payments. The scheme offered him a pension payable from 65 or a transfer payment of Pounds 30,672. But if the transfer payment had been calculated by reference to a retirement age of 60 it would been Pounds 39,934. If female actuarial factors were also used it would have increased to Pounds 41,486. The court ruled that these issues were all determined by the funding arrangements for the pension scheme chosen by the employer and were not therefore covered by the equal-pay rules. Mr Robert West, of Hugh Steeper's solicitors Baker &amp; McKenzie, said the decision resolved one of the few outstanding issues on sex discrimination in pension schemes and would be welcomed by employers which, contrary to expectations, would not have to use non-discriminatory life expectancy tables in future. The Confederation of British Industry said: 'The possibility of unisex factors in occupational pensions was causing concern to employers because they would not reflect the reality of different life expectancies between the sexes.'</p>

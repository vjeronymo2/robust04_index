Pakistan's nuclear program has been suspended since July 1990;  however, as to the question of it being rolled back, Pakistan  will not do so unilaterally. We have told our American friends  not to punish us under the Pressler Amendment, because this will  not help limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This issue  cannot be resolved when India learns that only Pakistan will be  punished, and that it will not. The United States should  understand that the present attitude toward Pakistan is extreme  in nature, that it must be changed, and that it is not meeting  its goal of stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons this  way.    Our differences with the United States over Pakistan's  nuclear program are very old. During Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's  time, the United States had opposed when Pakistan had signed an  agreement with France to purchase a nuclear reprocessing plant.  Then U. S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger threatened  Pakistan that if it did not abandon its nuclear program, "it  would be punished in such a way that it would be a lesson to all  other countries." Mr. Bhutto's supporters say that he took a  great risk and continued the program, and that he was dismissed  and later hanged as punishment. General Ziaul Haq continued this  program; however, because of the Afghanistan situation, the  United States did not object. When the Afghanistan war was over,  the United States intensified its objections again, and,  finally, in October 1990 it stopped all military and economic  aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. At present,  Pakistan is trying to explain to the United States of America  that the unilateral implementation of the Pressler Amendment is  not helping it achieve its goal of stopping the proliferation of  nuclear weapons in South Asia, and that it should review this  legislation again. Many informed American experts have also  admitted that the Pressler Amendment has not helped in the  attainment of the goals it was supposed to reach, and that there  is no use in retaining it. However, the U. S. government has not  agreed to review this legislation.    Since the establishment of Benazir Bhutto's government, she  has tried to convince the United States that its policy on  nuclear weapons in South Asia is incorrect. Ms. Robin Raphael,  assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, has also been  informed of Pakistan's position on it. Madam Bhutto has  explained Pakistan's stand again. As the prime minister has  said, Pakistan has proposed different strategies to limit the  spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia. Because of a lack of  cooperation from India, however, none of these could be  implemented. If the United States really wants to stop the  proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, then, instead of  putting pressure on Pakistan only, it should pressure both  countries equally. Its present policy is resulting in an  increased nuclear race in this region. It should realize the  importance of Pakistan's positive and proper stand, and should  be willing to review its decision to stop aid to Pakistan.    Mian Nawaz Sharif, leader of the opposition, has said that  Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear program in July 1990, and has  admitted that it was frozen during her administration. Thus, she  had proven herself to be an enemy of her own country. The  inference that Mr. Sharif has made from Madam Bhutto's statement  is a very strong and unreasonable one. However, Madam Bhutto  should also clarify her statement; if the program was frozen in  July 1990, then who ordered it? Was this decision made with her  knowledge, while she was the prime minister? Similarly, Mr.  Sharif should also make it clear why, during his 30-month prime  ministership, he did not try to correct this decision, and why  he did not reactivate that program. It is said that, during Mr.  Sharif's rule, the Senate chairman, during his trip to the  United States of America, assured the American authorities that  Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen and had been stopped where  it was. If this information is correct, then it should also be  explained. We request that both leaders, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto and opposition leader Mr. Sharif, to stop issuing  statements about Pakistan's nuclear program just to hurt each  other's position. It would be wise not to make this issue a  political football. This program is related to our national  defense, and political motives should not be given priority over  our national interests.</p>

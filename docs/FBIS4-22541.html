			<p>Demonopolization   <F P=102>   944E0649A Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 22 Mar 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> 944E0649A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Radmir Kilmatov: "Oleg Soskovets Will Be Working </F> on Competition Policy"]    [Text] The Council of Ministers has supported the  State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New  Economic Structures. A decision signed by the prime minister  approving the State Program of Demonopolization of the Economy  and the Development of Competition on Russia's Markets was put  on the official distribution list yesterday.    The program had been formally approved back on 9 December  last year. A significant part here had been played by the  president of Russia, who in November had signed an edict  strengthening the organizational base of the Antimonoply  Committee. And the cabinet, which has in fact complied with the  edict, has once again demonstrated that it is not independent in  the formation of its economic policy.    The main direction of the new program is the creation of a  new antimonopoly legal base. Last week Leonid Bochin, chairman  of the committee, declared that some of the provisions of the  Competition and the Limitation of Activity on the Commodity  Markets Act were today out of date. The first prescriptive  enactment that will be presented by the Antimonopoly Committee  for consideration by the government within the framework of the  program will be the Natural Monopolies bill. Specialists are  drawing up the legal base for a broadening of the committee's  sphere of competence--regulation of the activity of the banks  and control of the securities market could be transferred to its  jurisdiction.    In addition, the committee is currently drawing up documents  that are not formally within its jurisdiction: a bill on  advertising (which regulates the sanctions on organizations  conducting increased-risk transactions with the citizens'  deposits) and on commodity exchanges. In Leonid Bochin's  opinion, granting them privileges is impermissible since the  exchanges have not justified the commitments they assumed and,  "with the departure of the superprofits," have virtually  disbanded of their own accord. It is becoming obvious that the  committee, which affords no reason for it to be suspected of  lobbying activity, will be used by the government as a lightning  rod when projects evoking the harshest criticism are being  pushed through.    Coordination of the actions of the ministries and  departments  in realization of this program has been entrusted to the  Interdepartmental Commission for Competition Policy, which is  headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. The nature  of the work of the first deputy prime minister is reason to  suppose that the range of projects proposed by the committee and  accepted for execution will be extremely limited. The  touchstone, according to the information of KOMMERSANT, will be  discussion of the actions of the Russian oil companies, which,  in Leonid Bochin's opinion, "have shared out the domestic market  and eliminated competitive struggle." The committee is proposing  that the government examine this question from the standpoint of  legislation.    It is possible that the realization of the provisions of  this  program will breathe new life into the competition of Russia's  manufacturers, which is fading before our eyes. But even a  cursory analysis of the program leads to the conclusion  concerning its exclusively abstract nature. Yet the deep roots  of Russian monopolism require not so much narrow-departmental  antitrust programs as a reform of the entire structure of the  Russian economy and also the operational actions of the  appropriate power departments. Without this, Russian business  will not sense an improvement in its environment, and the  competitive space, in whose formation it has an interest, will  not be created.

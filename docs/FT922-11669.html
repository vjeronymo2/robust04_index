			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: SeaCon chief undecided on new IoM bid MR JAMES Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry company, paid a surprise visit to the Isle of Man yesterday to attend the 162nd annual meeting of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. Sea Containers holds a 41 per cent stake in the company after making a hostile bid in 1990. The bid was later withdrawn, but, under Stock Exchange rules, Mr Sherwood is now free to bid again. Speculation was rife among Steam Packet shareholders that his presence at yesterday's meeting heralded an announcement of such a move. However, Mr Sherwood said Sea Containers had not decided at the moment to renew the bid. Steam Packet achieved record results for 1991 with a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.1m. Mr Norman Corlett, Steam Packet chairman, told the meeting: 'Once again I have to express regret that so much time and money has been spent on ownership matters. The Manx directors fervently hope that the future of the Sea Containers shareholding will be resolved this year.' Mr Corlett reported that for the first quarter of this year, passenger and car carrying were up 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.</p>

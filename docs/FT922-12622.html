			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American announces Pounds 280m gold mine project THE SOUTH African gold mining industry yesterday received a welcome fillip with the announcement that the Anglo American Corporation is to develop a R1.7bn (Pounds 280m) mine near Orkney in the Western Transvaal. The announcement comes against the background of an industry whose profit margins have been slashed in recent years by the combination of continuing double digit cost inflation and stagnant gold revenues in rand terms. In addition the March quarterly results indicate that the closure of two mines  -West Rand Consolidated and Loraine - is likely in the near future. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division captured the mood when he commented: 'We would like to provide some good news. We hope this will be the turning point in the South African economy'. The new mine is not a stand-alone project, but an extension to the Vaal Reefs mine. The development of the Moab lease area - south-east of the existing south lease area - will become the No. 11 shaft at Vaal Reefs. A new company, Eastvaal Gold Holdings, will be formed to develop the mine and will ultimately be listed. Vaal Reefs, with a market capitalisation of about R3.6bn, is South Africa's second richest mine. It is the first new development of a listed gold mine by Anglo since it opened Elandsrand in the mid-1970s. It has subsequently opened some very large new shafts, such as Freddies No. 1 last year and the No. 10 shaft at Vaal Reefs, but none have involved opening up new lease areas. The last new gold mines to be opened in South Africa were Joel and Oryx, both of which have had slightly chequered careers. Gold production will begin in 1997 and at full production the mine should produce about 13 tonnes of gold per annum, making it a medium-sized operation by South African standards. Over the 25-year life-span of the project available reserves from the Moab area will provide some 26m tonnes of ore for milling at an estimated recovery grade of 11 grams a tonne. Although this makes it a high grade mine, Mr Sunter describes it as a 'tricky deposit', with parts of the ore body highly faulted. It is also extremely deep: a main shaft will descend to about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) underground, while two sub-shafts will go to 3.7 km. Mr Sunter said the new project had been approached with 'Japanese logic': instead of working out the capital expenditure of the project and then having the rate of return determined by the level of the gold price, the company had started with the current gold price, established a desired rate of return, and then worked out what capital expenditure could be afforded. He said that mine management had come up with lot of creative effort, which had allowed the original capital cost to nearly be halved. Mr Sunter added: 'It is a decent project at the current gold price, and we actually feel we're at the bottom of the market'. He is predicting that an upturn in world economies will be accompanied by an increase in gold jewellery offtake and hence a tightening in demand and a rise in price.</p>

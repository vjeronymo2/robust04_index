			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Anglo-Eastern lower Lower prices realised for its crops and an increase in overheads meant pre-tax profits at Anglo-Eastern Plantations crashed from Pounds 911,000 to Pounds 235,000 in 1990. On top of that, the tax charge did not fall in line with profits because of withholding tax on fixed loan interest payments, Mr HJ Renton, chairman, explained. Earnings per share, therefore, dropped from 2p to 0.4p and the dividend is omitted. Last time there was an interim and final of 1p each. The group harvests rubber, oil palms and cocoa from estates in Indonesia. Rubber and palm oil prices were the lowest since 1986 and cocoa the lowest for ten years. In addition, as the Tasik estate neared maturity, the proportion of overheads chargeable against revenue was increasing. Volume at Tasik was moving ahead and, if the rise in the palm oil price was maintained, the results were expected to show a 'good improvement'.</p>

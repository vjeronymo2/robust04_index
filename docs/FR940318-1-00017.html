The ball valve and cap valve leak checks must be performed with a minimum of 3 pounds per square inch differential pressure (PSID) applied across each valve. If the cap valve has an inner door with a second positive seal, only the inner door must be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Visually inspect the seal on the outer door for wear or damage that may cause leakage. Any worn or damaged seal must be replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher dash number) or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher dash number): Within 1,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the dump valve and drain valve.

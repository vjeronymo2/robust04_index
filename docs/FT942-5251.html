			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (6): Trying to do more with less - Foreign Policy Foreign policy, traditionally an area of little public interest in Canada, is quietly returning to the national agenda. For the first time since the 1970s, Ottawa is embarking on a major review of its international relations. The challenge is to determine priorities abroad and ensure the means to meet them at home. The end of the cold war, the rise of Asia, and the advent of North American free trade have dramatically changed the assumptions which have governed Canada's defence and foreign policy since 1945. Uncertain of which direction to take, the Liberal government has begun seeking advice. Since last October's election, the House of Commons has held debates on the North American Free Trade Agreement, US cruise missile tests over Canada, and the future of Canadian peacekeeping omissions. Two parliamentary committees are studying defence and foreign issues. A public forum, organised by the government, has convened leading experts in Ottawa. In the old bipolar world, Canada's international activism gave rise to many labels: for instance, helpful fixer, honest broker and middle power. They generally reflected the activist but conciliatory role which Canada has sought to play in the post-war era. As a warrior, Canada fought early and often in both world wars, Korea and the Gulf. As a peacekeeper, it has participated in every mission undertaken by the United Nations. As a trader, earning one quarter of its income from commerce, Canada has supported global free trade. As a donor, Canada has run one of the world's most generous aid programmes. As a diplomat, Canada helped create the architecture of the new world order, joining all the major international organisations including the Group of Seven, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie (the organisation of French-speaking countries) and the Organisation of American States. Whatever the government's review concludes, Canada is unlikely to embrace a new isolationism or protectionism. While the traditional consensus on federalism and social welfare is fraying at home, Canada remains committed to the liberal internationalism of Lester Pearson, the former prime minister. Still, money is a constraint. With the federal government running an annual budget deficit of Dollars 40bn, many foreign policy experts question whether Canada can still afford to do all that it has in the past. For a decade or more, for example, Canada has been reducing military spending by cutting the size of the armed forces. Yet it still maintains too many bases and carries out too many functions. Meanwhile, the demand for peacekeepers has soared. Canada has always agreed to serve; it once comprised 10 per cent of the world's peacekeepers. But the former Conservative government withdrew Canadian troops from Cyprus after 28 years and asked other countries to share more of the burden. Canada is still the world's seventh largest aid donor. But aid as a percentage of gross domestic product has now fallen to around 0.45 per cent, and the Canadian International Development Agency has been called wasteful and inefficient. The government is under pressure in all areas to find new ways to do more with less. In defence, for example, some suggest turning the military into a peacekeeping army. The argument is that Canada no longer needs a traditional force equipped for high-intensity warfare and should prepare its forces for more limited needs, such as civil order and surveillance. 'Our defence policy is  .. rational no longer,' says a recent report by a group of prominent Canadians. 'Unless the policy is changed quite radically, the result will be that Canada will have a miniature model of a general purpose force - one with just a little bit of everything but not enough of anything to be effective.' One proposal is to abandon high-intensity combat. This would mean slashing Canada's fighter aircraft fleet by two-thirds, closing bases and dropping armoured formations, heavy artillery and ground-to-air support. To modernise its aid programme, critics propose that the government redirect aid to only the poorest countries, abandoning those which no longer need it. Ottawa has also been urged to stop supporting costly megaprojects, and concentrate more on developing human resources through micro-business loans and education. In reviewing foreign policy, the government will have to consider a host of other questions: whether to remain in Nato, even after withdrawing forces from Europe; whether to take a softer line on human rights in the third world and concentrate more on trade and investment; whether to remain a member of so many international organisations; whether to try again, as Canada did in the 1970s, to diversify trade beyond the US, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of Canada's exports. For all the discussion, though, Canada's objectives in the 1990s remain similar to those of the 1950s. If opinion polls are correct, Canadians want to do more in the world, not less. But that does not mean the government will embark on bold initiatives. Foreign policy is not a priority for Mr Jean Chretien or his government, and the expectation is that it will be cautious in cutting defence spending and reallocating aid. What is more, if the secessionist Parti Quebecois is elected in the province of Quebec later this year, the federal government will have its hands full with the national unity issue, leaving little time for the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Voters reduce Korean president's dream to ashes: Winners and losers after Tuesday's parliamentary elections PRESIDENT Roh Tae Woo can probably say good-bye to his dreams of transforming his Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) into a Korean version of Japan's liberal democrats - one, strong party that would dominate the political landscape and guarantee stable democratic rule. Four months after President Roh was elected in 1988, the opposition won a majority in the national assembly. In 1990, Mr Roh persuaded a fragmented opposition to join his Democratic Justice Party to form the DLP. Two of the three opposition parties joined Mr Roh, giving him control with a two-thirds majority. Now the DLP is in danger of disintegrating. He is virtually back to square one. Mr Roh might have tried, had he retained his majority in parliament, to push through constitutional amendments that would change the political system into a parliamentary one with the legislature appointing the cabinet. This way, Mr Roh would have secured control over both the cabinet and parliament. South Korea now operates under a constitutional structure similar to the US, with a separation of the executive and legislative branches. 'The Korean people voted for a balance of power,' said one Korean journalist yesterday in assessing the results. Parliamentary control has slipped out of Mr Roh's hands for the second time in four years following the narrow defeat of the DLP in Tuesday's elections. President Roh may still be able to salvage the situation. The DLP fell only one seat short of obtaining a majority in the 299-member unicameral parliament. That obstacle could be overcome if the president persuades some of the 21 independent representatives, most of them former DLP members who lost their party nominations, to support the government. Tuesday's outcome, nevertheless, remains an unexpected and humiliating defeat for President Roh. Even if he is able to obtain a majority, Mr Roh's party may still break up. Opposition leader Kim Young Sam took his party into the DLP in 1990. He had hoped that in return, he would receive the party's nomination in the presidential election scheduled to take place in December. But the party's election defeat may cost Mr Kim, who ran the DLP campaign, the nomination and it could lead to the departure of his faction from the DLP. Meanwhile, Mr Kim Jong Pil, the other opposition leader who joined the DLP in 1990, offered his resignation as one of the party's co-chairmen after his faction scored poorly. The election vote reflected dissatisfaction over the economy, with the inflation rate predicted to reach 14 per cent this year. Allegations of a state smear campaign against an opposition candidate in Seoul and charges of vote rigging by the military may have reminded voters of the DLP's connections with the country's former military dictatorship. While the DLP'S fortunes are waning, those for Kim Dae Jung, leader of the Democratic Party, the main opposition group, are on the rise. The impressive performance of the Democrats, who increased their parliamentary representation from one fifth to one-third with 97 seats, is likely to dampen talk that Mr Kim was becoming too radical for Korean voters. The Democrats not only scored well in their stronghold of Cholla, the poor agrarian south-western region, but outpolled the DLP in Seoul, the most important electoral area in the country with a quarter of the national population. This should make Mr Kim a formidable presidential candidate in the December elections. Perhaps the most surprising result of Tuesday's elections was the strong emergence of the Unification National Party (UNP). The party, established recently by Mr Chung Ju Yung, founder of the Korean conglomerate Hyundai, won 31 seats and an influential role in the assembly. The UNP obtained 17.3 per cent of the vote against 38.5 per cent for the DLP and 29.2 per cent for the Democrats, with the rest distributed among independent candidates. The other big Korean conglomerates - Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar - are cautiously assessing the new political clout of Mr Chung and, by extension, Hyundai, the second largest business group, or chaebol, in Korea. Mr Chung is campaigning for less government interference in business at a time when the state is trying to reduce the power of the chaebol by forcing them to shed some of their subsidiaries and to reduce the strong hold the founding families have in particular industrial sectors. Although the chaebol formerly benefited from government largesse, including cheap credit, officials now argue that the chaebol dominate the Korean economy too much, preventing competitive economic forces from operating efficiently. The government may now be forced to drop or scale down its chaebol reform programme. Mr Chung might even be wooed by the Democrats to form a broad opposition front against the government. The two might be prepared to set aside their difference to form such an alliance. Democrats are strong supporters of trade union rights, while Mr Chung's Hyundai has had a reputation for acrimonious labour relations. Mr Chung, who may also run for the presidency in December, said he was willing to co-operate with both the DLP and Democrats on individual issues.</p>

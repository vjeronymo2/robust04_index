			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International call traffic up by 13% INTERNATIONAL telephone traffic grew by 13 per cent last year, according to a report to be published next week by the London-based International Institute of Communications. Falling international telephone charges and a rise in the volume of non-business calling across frontiers helped partially to counteract the effect of recession. About 35bn minutes of international telephone calls were made during 1991. The market shares of leading telephone companies grew at widely different rates, reflecting the impact of competition unleashed in some countries in the 1980s. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier, handled 6.6bn minutes of outgoing traffic - up 7.8 per cent compared with 1990. By contrast, traffic handled by its main rivals, MCI and Sprint, grew 35.1 per cent to 1.6bn minutes, and 25.3 per cent to 723m minutes, respectively. International traffic via British Telecom grew by only 1.9 per cent to 2.2bn minutes. The traffic base of Cable and Wireless, whose Mercury Communications subsidiary is BT's main competitor, grew 28.6 per cent to 1.7bn minutes. The report provides a measure of the extent of integration among the European Community's economies. Of all international calls made in the EC in 1991, 55 per cent went to other EC countries and 11 per cent to the rest of Europe. The US deficit on international traffic, which has provoked a number of trade disputes in recent years, grew by a further 18 per cent last year to 3.2bn minutes.

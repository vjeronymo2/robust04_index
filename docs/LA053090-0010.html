			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: 10 MORE BEDS OKD FOR JUVENILE CENTER  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved the addition of 10  beds for females and new administrative offices at the Colston Youth Center, a  juvenile detention center at 375 N. Hillmont Ave., Ventura.  </P> <P> Most of the expansion, which is expected to cost about $635,000, will be paid  for by Proposition 52, a state bond act approved in 1986.  </P> <P> Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative officer, said the state  will pay $411,000 of the cost and the county will make up the rest.  </P> <P> The expansion will ease crowding in the Clifton Tatum Center by allowing  juveniles now housed there to be moved to the new facility, Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> "This is a precursor of what we're going to have to do in dealing with  overcrowding in the adult jail system," he said.  </P> <P> Construction of the expanded facility is due to begin in October, with  completion scheduled for April, 1991.

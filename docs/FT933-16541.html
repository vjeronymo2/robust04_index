			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hillsdown ahead In a perky food manufacturing sector, Hillsdown Holdings led the way forward as the group said trading was in line with market expectations and that interim operating profits to June would be at least Pounds 80m against Pounds 81.8m last year. Dealers said there was a considerable relief factor that Hillsdown had made a good recovery from its problems. Last year's profits were dented by oversupply in the chicken market. Hillsdown shares added 7 to 144p on hefty turnover of 13m. A rumoured review of the food manufacturing stocks, said to be by UBS, added spice to the sector which has languished in the doldrums in recent sessions. Associated British Food gained 5 to 489p, Booker 6 to 393p, and Cadbury-Schweppes 3 to 467p. Devro International's second day in the market brought further rewards, the shares adding 6 to 199p. They came to the market at 170p on Wednesday.</p>

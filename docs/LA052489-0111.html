			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A blind man beaten by Hayward police officers who thought his folding white  cane was a martial arts weapon has filed a $200,000 claim against the city.  Harry Bruno, city risk manager, said the city will probably reject the claim  filed by David St. John. "I couldn't see the city agreeing to pay those  amounts," he said. St. John, 37, seeks half of the money for himself and the  rest for an organization that helps the blind. "A lot of blind people are upset  over what happened," he said. "I'm hoping that something good can come out of  this." Under the law, St. John's claim must be rejected before he can sue. He  was beaten with a baton after he resisted demands from officers to surrender  his cane. He said the officers did not identify themselves, and he thought he  was being mugged.  </P></p>

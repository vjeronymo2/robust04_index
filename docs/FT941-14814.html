			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Viacom raises bid for Paramount Viacom, the cable television company, yesterday kept alive its hopes of winning the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for film group Paramount Communications by slightly raising the cash in its bid and significantly improving the package of securities offered to shareholders. Analysts said Viacom appeared to have raised its offer to roughly the same level as rival bidder QVC Network, paving the way for a further burst of bidding later in the month, before the February 1 deadline set by Paramount for final offers. The new terms came four days before the close of the current tender offers from the two bidders. If Viacom had not raised its bid it would have risked QVC gaining over 50 per cent of Paramount's shares in the tender offer as until yesterday morning analysts valued QVC's bid at Dollars 10.1bn and Viacom's at Dollars 9.3bn. Viacom claimed its new bid was worth Dollars 10.5bn and said the offer was 'at the highest level that it believes would be in the interests' of its shareholders and those of Paramount or Blockbuster Entertainment. Blockbuster agreed earlier this month to merge with Viacom. Analysts valued it at anywhere from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 10.3bn, or Dollars 82 to Dollars 87 a share, compared with a QVC offer worth Dollars 84 to Dollars 85 a share. 'This clearly makes the Viacom bid competitive with QVC, if not downright better,' said Mr Frederick Moran of Salomon Brothers. The board of Paramount, which has been recommending QVC's bid to shareholders, said it would meet this week to consider the new offer. Viacom has increased from Dollars 105 a share to Dollars 107 the amount it is offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock. That compares with Dollars 92 a share from QVC. It also improved the package of securities on offer for the remaining 49.9 per cent. The main elements of the offer are unchanged: 0.93065 of a share of Viacom's non-voting class B stock, which has fallen sharply in market value during the bid and closed yesterday at Dollars 37 3/4 , down Dollars 1 3/8 , and 0.30408 of a share of preferred stock for each Paramount share. However, Viacom has added warrants to buy its shares to the package and also placed a floor of Dollars 48 a share under its B shares by offering Paramount stockholders so-called contingent value rights. These would give investors the right to receive, on the first anniversary of a Paramount-Viacom merger, the amount of cash - up to Dollars 10 a share - by which the B shares traded below Dollars 48.

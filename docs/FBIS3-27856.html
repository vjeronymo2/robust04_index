			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa will fashion a new medium-term program to overhaul the  Japanese economy and make living conditions better, superseding  the five-year program compiled under the previous  administration, government sources said Sunday. The new program  will be an expanded version of the program put forth in 1992 by  the administration of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to  make Japan a "lifestyle superpower," the sources said.    Hosokawa's new plan will include an increase to the 430  trillion yen in public works spending over ten years promised by  Tokyo in 1990 to the United States during the bilateral  structural impediments initiative (SII) talks.    The new scheme will also contain an actual spending list for  enhancing the infrastructure, such as housing, parks, and  telecommunications, they said.    Hosokawa will seek advice on the program from the economic  council for compilation by the end of the year, they said.    By telling President Bill Clinton about the new plan in  their  summit meeting on February 11, Hosokawa hopes to induce an  expression of appreciation from the U.S. on Japan's efforts to  boost its domestic demand and thereby slash its mammoth trade  surplus. Hosokawa is also expected to present to Clinton the  government's new economic stimulus package that will include 5  to 6 trillion yen worth of income and residence tax cuts.    Washington, in apparent frustration about the lack of  progress in the current bilateral "framework" trade talks,  successor to the SII talks, has been urging Japan to inject a  strong and sustainable stimulus into the feeble economy.    Japan has vowed to reach market opening agreements in  several  priority sectors, such as autos, by the February summit.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said during his recent  visit to Tokyo, "If we do not have credible agreements by the  time of the summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the  framework ... we will not settle for any cosmetic agreement."    The Miyazawa program stipulated measures to enhance living  standards, spelling out such goals as lowering the prices of  houses and condominiums down to five times a salaried worker's  annual income, and shortening an employee's annual working hours  to 1,800 or below.    Hosokawa originally intended to inherit the Miyazawa plan,  but changed his mind after his success in political reform  raised the chances of a long tenure, the sources said.    The Hosokawa administration already received a call from a  blue-ribbon advisory council to increase the government's public  works expenditures.    In line with the November recommendations of the advisory  group for economic restructuring, last November, Hosokawa's new  economic program will contain steps to promote deregulation, a  review on taxation and insurance systems in light of the aging  population, and assistance to farmers following Japan's  acceptance of the partial opening of the rice market. The  measures spelled out in the premier's "vision for the 21st  century," which he announced at the start of this year, will  also be incorporated into the plan.    In the "vision," Hosokawa called for lowering housing costs  by one third and tripling the per-capita park area.</p>

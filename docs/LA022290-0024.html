			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRYING TO MAKE TRACKS IN NAPA'S WINE COUNTRY;  </P> <P> EXCURSIONS: TRAVELERS ON THE NAPA VALLEY WINE TRAIN ARE TREATED TO A HOST OF  LUXURIES. BUT THE DRAWBACKS INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE TRAIN STARTS AND STOPS IN  THE SAME PLACE.  </P> <P> The gorgeously outfitted interiors, calming music and black-tie service aboard  the dining car of the Napa Valley Wine Train give no clue to the hurricane of  controversy swirling outside over its very existence.  </P> <P> Outside of its controversial image among locals, the Wine Train has already  succeeded in terms of ambience. Travelers step into a time gone by, an idyllic  setting of elegance and style, good manners and taste.  </P> <P> In the leisurely excursion from the city of Napa north to St. Helena and back  again, travelers are treated to well-prepared food, fine service, elegant  dinnerware and luxurious furniture.  </P> <P> As a dining experience, the train is unique. Meals are creatively conceived by  chef Ken Schloss, a protege of Jeremiah Tower of San Francisco. Menus include  cannelloni in buckwheat crepes, duck terrine, Norwegian salmon, filet mignon  and espresso flan for dessert.  </P> <P> A wide selection of wines from top Napa Valley wineries are offered, by the  glass or bottle, at reasonable prices.  </P> <P> The trappings include china, silver and crystal glassware atop white  tablecloths. A warm towel is presented as you sit down, to refresh the face  before dining.  </P> <P> The 1915-era cars, refurbished with new interiors, include mahogany woodwork,  brightly colored fabric on newly designed chairs and couches, velvet draperies,  wool beige carpeting, brass fixtures, oval glass partitions etched with grapes  and marble countertops in the restrooms. The colors are cream, green and  Burgundy.  </P> <P> There are even small heaters at foot level for cold days.  </P> <P> After meals are completed, dessert is served in the lounge car as diners sit in  plush, oversized swivel chairs or at tables for four.  </P> <P> Still, there are drawbacks, including the fact that you go nowhere. You start  and end in the same place, and until a legal squabble over the train is  settled, that's not going to change.  </P> <P> Also, some passengers never see the sights of the Napa Valley. During late fall  and winter, the dinner train runs in darkness, after the sun has set.  </P> <P> Moreover, passengers float past some of the most famous vineyards in the world,  but have no clue as to which is what. They sail past the famed Napanook  Vineyard that produces Dominus, past the road leading to Martha's Vineyard,  past the vineyard that produces the BV Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, and  there's no one to tell what's here.  </P> <P> In addition, although this attraction should appeal to wine collectors, Wine  Train prohibits patrons from bringing a bottle of wine on board and consuming  it -- not even for a corkage charge. That means that if you buy an older  vintage of a great Napa Valley wine at one of the tasting rooms, you'll have to  sip it elsewhere.  </P> <P> And if a party of five or more wants to enjoy the train together, they'll have  to dine at separate tables. The maximum number that can fit at a table is four.  </P> <P> Napa Valley Wine Train Inc. was formed in 1984 as a limited partnership of  seven investors. Today the company has 13 shareholders headed by Vincent  DeDominico, former chairman of Golden Grain Macaroni Products, the Rice-a-Roni  folks. Jack McCormack was hired as president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> The partnership bought the right-of-way on the 21 1/4-mile line from Southern  Pacific Railroad in April of 1987. Included in the deal was about 125 acres of  land, including a parking area in downtown St. Helena.  </P> <P> Since then, the company says, it has spent $14 million on acquiring and  refurbishing 20 Pullman coaches used to haul passengers, including installation  of a modern kitchen and serving facilities.  </P> <P> The Wine Train depot in north Napa has two gift shops, one of which carries  wine and, ironically, aprons and T-shirts -- items that were among the disputes  in the winery definition controversy that erupted passions throughout the  valley in the last three years.  </P> <P> The Wine Train now runs three times a day on a Preliminary Limited Service  agreement with local groups that prohibits passengers from getting on or off  the train except at the depot. And all riders on most runs now must purchase  lunch or dinner tickets, making the round trip a $45 to $57.50 excursion.  </P> <P> If Wine Train is permitted to run six round-trip trains per day, as McCormack's  wall chart shows, the company would also run shuttle buses to various wineries  from stops at Yountville, Rutherford, and St. Helena. Buses also would run as  far east as the Silverado Trail. The train's current lunch/dinner requirement  would be waived.  </P> <P> "We could operate and make money on our present (temporary) schedule," said  McCormack. "We can make a profit, though not as much. We're booked through  April right now."  </P> <P> The train winds north through the north end of Napa with vistas as grand and  glorious as laundry on a line in a back yard, garbage bins and an industrial  park's parking lot.  </P> <P> The train crosses to the west of State Highway 29 at Trancas Street, then  slowly chugs north past Newlan, Trefethen and Lakespring wineries before it  gets to Yountville, where Domaine Chandon is located.  </P> <P> The train continues north through Oakville, past the entrance to the Robert  Mondavi Winery, and continues past Beaulieu and Inglenook in Rutherford. Just  after it passes Franciscan, it crosses the highway once again, moving to the  east of Highway 29.  </P> <P> A few hundred yards before it enters downtown St. Helena, the train passes a  huge sign atop a truck. The sign has the international red-circle symbol and  the words "Wine Train" with a red slash through it. The complete round trip  takes about 2 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> If full service is ever approved, Wine Train personnel say, the plan is to  extend the tracks north of St. Helena, possibly wind up eventually in  Calistoga.  </P> <P> Few wineries in the valley support the Wine Train, but opponents say only four  wineries publicly support the train -- Sunny St. Helena, Grgich Hills, DeMoor  and Sequoia Grove. All four have taken ads out in the Wine Train's newspaper,  the Napa Valley Traveler.  </P> <P> Wine maker Mike Grgich, an acknowledged supporter of the train, said he felt  the possibility of freight and commuter service would make the train valuable  to the valley.  </P> <P> "I came from Europe, where the train was very friendly," said Grgich, a native  of Croatia. "We used the train all the time, it was an alternative to  automobiles. I'm used to the train."  </P> <P> Grgich said the train could be used for shipping wine, "instead of those trucks  coming up and down the road; if we shipped by railroad, those trucks would be  eliminated. And I believe Wine Train should establish commuter service, which  would be very helpful to the traffic on the highway." (McCormack says commuter  service is under consideration.)  </P> <P> However, some wine makers are irritated at having their names connected to the  train.  </P> <P> A Wine Train waiter, asked which wine makers had ridden the train, said Bob  Mondavi and Jack Cakebread both have taken the trip and were supporters.  However, both men, contacted at their wineries, denied they supported the train  and were bothered that their names were mentioned in that context.  </P> <P> Opponents have been vocal. Dick Grace, who makes one of the most prestigious  Cabernets in the Napa Valley, said, "The wine train could conceivably be the  most damaging contributor toward the demise of the Napa Valley's life style as  well as the quality of its most important product, world class wines."  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Competing With Germany: An orderly model that enforces restraint - The effectiveness of Germany's consensus-based trade union bargaining system The vast differences between Europe's national pay bargaining systems could be the undoing of European monetary integration. Europe's labour leaders did not dwell upon the prospect in Wednesday's May Day speeches but economists are beginning to issue warnings. 'This is the Achilles heel of monetary union. The structurally weak countries with greatest pressure for unsustainable pay rises will become even weaker because they will not be able to use the exchange rate to pass on costs,' says Professor Fritz Scharpf, a leading German labour economist. In the centralised, consensus-based bargaining systems of northern Europe, unions can usually anticipate the macroeconomic and employment consequences of their actions. In the UK and parts of southern Europe they are institutionally unable, or unwilling, to do so. In the early 1980s unemployment in the UK was twice as high as in West Germany, but UK wages rose twice as fast. So does the system in the UK have to become more like the German? The German model has certainly produced impressive results. The country has almost the highest wages and shortest working time in Europe but an ordered bargaining system which produced increases in unit labour costs of less than 1 per cent a year for much of the 1980s with scarcely a day lost in strike action. By contrast unit labour costs in the UK rose by 7 per cent a year, even in the more disciplined 1980s, and each year about 300 working days per 1,000 workers was lost. Union organisation looks relatively weak in west Germany, with about 34 per cent of workers in unions compared with more than 40 per cent in the UK, but labour - whether in unions or not - has a much louder institutional voice. An astonishing 90 per cent of all workers are covered by union-negotiated wage agreements. The state ensures the right to join a union and otherwise keeps out of bargaining. But the law is ever-present. It makes wage contracts (usually industry-wide) legally binding, so strikes can only take place after a contract has expired. If a union breaks the rules on strike conduct it can be sued. This enforced restraint is balanced by the powers granted in Germany's co-determination system. In any plant employing more than five people the workers can elect a works council which has an important influence, for example, over sackings, but cannot call strikes. The rights are enjoyed by employees, not unions, and although three-quarters of works council members are union officials they increasingly represent the shopfloor against union head office. In quoted companies with more than 2,000 employees the workers have rights to business information and to seats alongside the shareholder representatives on the supervisory board, which oversees the executive board. This amounts to a real qualification on the freedom of capital which, in Germany, is just another 'corporate stakeholder' alongside labour and management. Workers on the supervisory board act as a deterrent to hostile takeovers, and are a standing pressure for high, job-creating, local investment. Bigger companies also use workers' pension cash as working capital, a practice banned in the UK, which gives a financial underpinning to co-determination and helps explain German companies' relative reluctance to invest overseas. This company and plant-level co-determination dovetails with the sector-wide wage-bargaining system. Bargaining is made easier by the fact that unions have reliable information about corporate performance. And the fact that strikes cannot originate with the works council, but only with one of the 16 national unions after a wage contract has run out, means plant relations can remain harmonious. For that reason neither employers nor unions want to follow Britain towards more plant-level bargaining. However industry-wide bargaining does not preclude regional pay differences, performance-linked sector variations, and some topping up of wage deals especially for white-collar workers. There are 34,000 west German wage and conditions deals but only six key ones between national unions and employers' associations. Most employers accept the deals even when their workforce is not unionised, saying this regulates competition for labour and keeps unions out. Economists claim centralised bargaining has a downward pressure on pay increases because, in the metal industry for example, the union has to consider not only workers in the big, profitable car plants, but also those in small family firms and in the struggling north German shipyards. In the UK this situation is reversed, with powerful company bargaining groups, such as Ford, setting a target the weaker try to emulate. The fact that pay increases for 90 per cent of German workers are determined in a handful of trend-setting national negotiations certainly concentrates negotiators' minds on the macro-economic effects of their actions. The independence of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has also had an impact. 'Everyone who negotiates here knows they cannot ignore the Bundesbank because it has the power to annul the theoretical wage increase you have just won,' says Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, leader of the German Trade Union Federation. In 1973, for example, the Bundesbank used its control over monetary policy to tighten interest rates sharply. This move deliberately hastened the recession in response to an unacceptably high wage rise. The unions learned their lesson and after the second oil price shock did not try to claw back the price rise. Relations between Bundesbank and union economists remain close and through those links the bank can indicate the room for manoeuvre on wages. The Bundesbank's role underlines how difficult it would be for countries such as Britain, without an independent central bank, to try a wholesale adoption of the German model. That model is also the product of a different post-war history marked by a determination to avoid the social conflict that created Hitler. 'Labour has a different attitude to capital in Germany,' says Mr Meyer. As Professor David Marquand, from Salford University, points out, the social market economy is not just Anglo-American capitalism with better social provision, it is a different sort of capitalism, involving more labour integration into industrial decision-making. There is a powerful union lobby even in the centre-right Christian Democratic party and union views are heard in all the organs of economic management. The model has flaws. Necessary restructuring can be hindered by unions' power to place job security above all other virtues. And despite the macro-economic transparency of the bargaining system, unemployment was about 9 per cent for much of the 1980s. Further, just as unification has dented Germany's exemplary status in fiscal and inflationary prudence it has, too, released a wave of criticism of the unions for pushing up wages in east Germany too fast. Bargaining in west Germany is also going through a rocky patch as some unions try to catch up on the very low, even negative, real pay rises of the late 1980s, partly the result of three-year deals. The metal workers have just begun brief stoppages in pursuit of a rise three times the current 3 per cent inflation rate. But the model remains a magnet to many in Britain. Employers like legally binding agreements, the 75 per cent of votes cast needed to strike, and acceptance of the 'neutral' pay rise. Unions like works council powers and information rights; policymakers admire industrial unions representing all worker grades in an industry and the centralised bargaining open to macroeconomic trade-offs. The model also has opponents, including the craft unions, employers and politicians who further decentralised the UK system in the 1980s. Mr Meyer believes that move has merely encouraged 'plant syndicalism' while Prof Scharpf says British unions need a clearer legal framework and more centralised decision-making. 'Thatcherite decentralisation is a dead-end. You should try again with Barbara Castle's or Ted Heath's reforms,' he says. Earlier articles in this series appeared on March 12 and April 15.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> TWA Reports Loss: Trans World Airlines lost $83.1 million on revenues of $989.7  million in the first quarter, swelling by 58% the shortfall it suffered a year  earlier. Sales were 7.5% higher in the three months ended March 31 than a year  ago. The nation's ninth-largest airline said its operating expenses increased  for the quarter largely because of higher employee costs. TWA, which was taken  private by Carl C. Icahn last year, also said it had $16.3 million in charges  against earnings that resulted primarily from that transaction.  </P></p>

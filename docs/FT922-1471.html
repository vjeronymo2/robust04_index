			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (13): IBM puts pressure on market  -Leasing 'BIG TICKET' capital equipment, such as airliners, earth moving machinery and mainframe computers, is frequently leased rather than bought outright. The primary reason is cost, but in the case of computers, leasing is also a defence against corporate and technological change. One thing is certain when acquiring a computer: at some point - probably much earlier than anticipated - more capacity will be required. On average, customers tend to outgrow the capacity of a mainframe within two years. The dilemma for the customer is that buying sufficient capacity for, say, five years could be prohibitively expensive with mainframes costing several million dollares apiece. Selling a second-hand machine at the right price can also be a problem. Technology also changes, often bewilderingly quickly, bringing substantial improvements in cost-benefits. A company failing to keep up with technological progress can find itself paying far more than its rivals for its data processing, putting it at at a competitive disadvantage. A leased computer, however, can be upgraded or, subject to the terms of the lease, swapped for something more powerful. The leasing company takes responsibility for procuring and, ultimately, disposing of the machine. Leasing companies, therefore, have a long, if somewhat chequered, history in the computer industry. Total revenues annually worldwide are in the region of Dollars 25bn. The leading companies include Comdisc, AT&amp;T Capital Corporation and GE in the US and COS Computer Systems, Promodata and ECS in Europe. The natural risks of the business have been accentuated in the past few years by the new and aggressive presence of IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer. Leasing depends on a stable market for second-hand computers with trustworthy residual - or agreed resale - values. In practice, only IBM and to some extent Digital Equipment computers are used widely enough to establish reliable residual values. There are many varieties of leasing contracts, but typically the deal works like this: the leasing company provides its customer with the mainframe but first it has to find a 'head lessor' - a bank or finance house - to put up the money for the machine. The head lessor collects the leasing payments. At the end of the lease, however, the leasing company makes its money by relocating the computer to another customer, either as a new lease or as a second-hand sale. Without something extra to add ginger to the deal, such a business would be a marginally profitable and deadly dull affair. Leasing companies show their entrepreneurial flair in their ability to 'manage' their portfolio of leases; that is, to persuade their customers frequently to change or add to their systems. In the past few years, the business has been characterised by intense competition and slower growth. IBM's emergence in the market has put pressure on all its competitors, operating as it does, one of the world's largest leasing companies. The rest of the industry is now dealing chiefly in second-hand machines: no matter how large an order it places, no company can hope for a better deal than IBM's own leasing subsidiaries get from the parent company. An example of the friction between 'Big Blue' and its leasing competitors is the vexed issue of 'altered memory', currently the leasing industry's top concern. The issue speaks volumes about the state of the industry. A key skill in managing a portfolio of leases is the ability to configure systems to a customer's requirements. That may involve refurbishing and refitting second-hand machines; semiconductor memory may have to be altered. In the past, IBM checked these rebuilt systems and approved them as qualifying under IBM's maintenance scheme. Systems so certificated by IBM would have a recognised second-hand value. IBM now complains that it is discovering examples of counterfeit memory boards in rebuilt machines which are being passed off as the genuine article. It says these boards, even if built from genuine IBM memory chips, are poorly fabricated and likely to fail. Systems with counterfeit boards do not qualify for maintenance, IBM says, neither can the value of the system be guaranteed. The industry replies that rebuilt boards are an essential part of its business and that there is no evidence they fail any more regularly than genuine IBM components. It believes IBM's concern is simply a manoeuvre to persuade customers to buy new and second-hand machines only from IBM. The way the issue is resolved may determine whether an independent leasing industry survives.</p>

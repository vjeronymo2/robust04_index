			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The environmental  quality at Shanghai's Xinhua Street area, notorious for  industrial pollution, has been greatly improved thanks to a  ten-year effort.    The 2.2-square-kilometer area in the western part of the  city  houses 110 plants involved in industrial chemicals, medicine,  paper-making, metallurgy, machinery and electrical appliances,  and meters and instruments, which discharge heavy pollutants,  waste water and gas.    Since 1985, the municipal government has spent 450 million  yuan in the treatment of pollution in this area, which has  completed 407 pollution-treatment projects and removed, closed  down or merged 25 plants and workshops discharging heavy  pollutants. The municipality has also planted more trees, lawns  and flowers.    As a result, the industrial output value of the area last  year went up by 33 percent over 1985 and the amount of  discharged waste gas was reduced by at least 70 percent and  waste water by 50.7 percent.    Noise in the area does not exceed the municipal  government-set standard at present.</p>

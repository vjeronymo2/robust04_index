Cuccia, who celebrates his 87th birthday today, received a warning from Ravenna magistrates in May that he and three other Mediobanca executives were under investigation for alleged involvement in false corporate reporting by Ferruzzi-Montedison, the troubled industrial group for which the bank masterminded a rescue plan exactly a year ago. Immediately, a terse press release (Mediobanca's first ever) was issued denying the charges, and then there was complete silence.

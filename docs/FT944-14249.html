			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Chicago exchanges may obtain limited exemptions The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will today rule on applications by Chicago's two big futures exchanges for exemption from many of the regulations that have governed the country's listed derivatives markets. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are seeking the same regulatory treatment for some exchange-listed contracts as already exists in the over-the-counter market. They argue that regulations, designed to protect individual rather than corporate traders, make them increasingly uncompetitive against foreign exchanges and the OTC market. The exchanges' proposals would create two-tiered markets that would free institutional, or 'professional' traders from many of the rules governing an exchange's retail customers. It is also a politically sensitive issue, with regulators and some politicians believing there should be further scrutiny of rules governing derivatives trading. The CFTC is today expected to offer the exchanges an opportunity to try the requested exemptions on a limited basis for a few products, and will ask for further public comment on this pilot programme. The 'test' plan is likely to favour the CME, which is seeking regulatory exemption only for its currency products known as 'rolling spot' futures. The CBOT has asked the agency for a broad exemption for any products traded on any US exchange which would be used primarily by institutional traders. A narrower programme would force the exchange to define its plans more closely. The exchanges' proposals, submitted 18 months ago, have languished at the CFTC after drawing fire from powerful opponents. The Federal Reserve wrote to the CFTC in February saying exemptions might bring the exchanges' financial integrity into question. 'A broad exemption from regulation for a wholesale exchange does not appear to be appropriate at the present time,' it said. The US Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission oppose the proposals, and even allies, such as the Futures Industry Association, have urged caution.</p>

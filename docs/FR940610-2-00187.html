The proposed improvement would provide a four-lane highway from Canton, Missouri, to approximately 1.61 kilometers (1 mile) south of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. The project is approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles) long. The Missouri Section would be an expressway on expressway right of way, with freeway and interchange right of way purchased at major state routes. It would run for 37 kilometers (23 miles) along the corridor of existing portions of U.S. 61, U.S. 136 Spur, U.S. 136, and Missouri Route B. The Iowa section would be designed to expressway standards and would generally follow U.S. 218 and Iowa 394 for 53 kilometers (33 miles). The corridor crosses the Des Moines River and includes the crossing now occupied by Iowa 394 and Missouri Route B. However, the new crossing will be at a different location. Several wetland areas associated with rivers and streams will be crossed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In Missouri, alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing alignment, and (3) two alternatives on new alignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first Missouri alternate on new alignment would begin north of the junction on U.S. 61 and Missouri 16, just west of Canton, and would extend along a new alignment west of U.S. 61 and generally west of U.S. 136 Spur. It would provide a western bypass around Wayland, Missouri, and continue northwest to Missouri Route B. St. Francisville, Missouri, would be bypassed on the west. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second Missouri alternative on new alignment would also begin north of the U.S. 61 and Missouri 16 junction and would extend north on an alignment east of U.S. 61 and U.S. 136 Spur. It would bypass Wayland and continue north to Missouri Route B. South of St. Francisville, it would cross Route B and bypass St. Francisville to the east. Within Missouri, combinations of build alternatives are possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Iowa, alternatives being considered include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing alignment, and (3) a construction alternative that includes some sections on new alignment combined with upgrading the existing alignment. This alternative consists of improving existing two-lane sections of U.S. 218 and Iowa 394 to four-lane expressway standards with eastern bypasses of the communities of Donnellson and Argyle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping process was initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies in September of 1993. Formal agency and public scoping meetings were held on October 12, 1993, in Donnellson, Iowa. A meeting with local government officials and community leaders was held in Wayland, Missouri, on February 8, 1994. On February 24, 1994, a second public information meeting was held near Wayland to gain public input about alternatives being considered for the project. In addition, public hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance of the date and time of each meeting. The draft EIS will be available prior to the public hearing for public review and comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the addresses provided above. Missouri is the lead state for the proposed action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: June 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald Neumann, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Program Review Engineer, Jefferson City. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14184 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Information Officer at the  Indonesian Embassy in Washington Hupudio Supardi said here  Friday the signing of a joint communique on the opening of the  diplomatic relations between the two countries will be carried  out at the Indonesian Embassy on February 2.    With these new diplomatic ties, Arifin Siregar will become  Indonesian ambassador to the United States, and pluralistically  to Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia.    The opening of diplomatic relations with Saint Vincent was  conducted in Washington on November 30, 1993, shortly after  Arifin assumed his position as Indonesian ambassador to the  United States, while the diplomatic ties with Grenada was opened  during the term of Ambassador A.R. Ramly.    According to the embassy spokesman, Indonesia's diplomatic  relations with Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, and Grenada are of  high political significance, as the small Caribbean countries  each have the same vote as the major countries.

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> ON THE TOWN: When you hear a band billed as the Legendary Grape, it can only  mean one thing -- Moby Grape, one of the original flower-power pop bands that  came out of San Francisco's psychedelic scene in the late '60s. Out of  commission for years, the group recently reformed and has been writing new  material and playing occasional live dates.  </P> <P> You can see the group, which includes original members Bob Mosley, Peter Lewis,  Jerry Miller and Don Stevenson, Thursday at the Coconut Teaszer. (It's a  classic late-'60s bill -- Jackie Lomax will open the show). The Grape is also  at the Belly Up in Solana Beach on Monday. . . . Remember the much-ballyhooed  deal between Sam Kinison and the China Club, which had the heavyweight rock  comic making a weekly appearance (as a singer) at the hip nightspot? Well --  it's history. In fact, Kinison popped up last week at Spice, the China Club's  arch-rival, where he did his usual "Wild Thing" jam session. The most  encouraging new twist: Kinison and his cronies, who included Julian Lennon and  actor Christian Slater, hung out backstage, contentedly guzzling bottles of . .  . Evian water.  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Nato ready to step outside its borders NATO countries have agreed in principle that the alliance would be prepared to take on a peacekeeping role in Europe beyond the borders of its member nations, Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said yesterday. Mr Woerner, said details had still to be worked out but Nato foreign ministers are expected to give their blessing to the plan at a meeting in Oslo in two weeks. Until now, Nato's military structure and forces have been limited to the defence of member nations, although there is no suggestion the alliance should get involved in Gulf War-style military intervention. The decision could mean alliance troops might one day be deployed in peacekeeping missions, which until now has been the sole preserve of the UN, in places such as Bosnia or Nagorno-Karabakh. 'This is strictly for peacekeeping, not for warfighting,' said one alliance diplomat. According to the idea, backed by the US, Nato could put its military infrastructure, supplies or even troops at the disposal of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) for peacekeeping missions. The fighting in Yugoslavia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the threat of new conflicts breaking out in an increasingly fragmented post-Cold War Europe have given impetus to the idea, which would mark a big policy change for the 16-nation alliance. France and some others had hesitated over the proposal to extend Nato responsibilities. France, which feels that the US has too large a say in how European security is run, would prefer to develop other institutions like the nine-nation Western European Union.</p>

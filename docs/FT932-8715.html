			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Bank staff attack chief's earnings MR PETER WOOD, the direc-tor of Royal Bank of Scotland who is expected to earn at least Pounds 10m this year, was accused by employees yesterday of accepting money that could have preserved some of the 3,500 jobs being shed by the bank. Criticism of Mr Wood's pay as chief executive of Royal Bank's Direct Line insurance subsidiary coincided yesterday with attacks at the annual conference of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union in Llandudno on the jobs policies of banks and building societies. Mr Ian Williams, a member of the union's national executive, accused Mr Wood of betraying Royal Bank employees who face job losses over the next five years as part of the bank's branch restructuring project, called Columbus. 'It may be that some of the jobs are going in order to pay Mr Wood's bonus,' Mr Williams said. 'If that is so, then the going rate for the job seems a bit high. Even Judas was only paid 30 pieces of silver to betray one man.' Delegates expressed worry about large job losses in the finance industry. The union estimates that 70,000 jobs have gone in the past three years and that 30,000 more are at at risk. Royal Bank was singled out for criticism because of its refusal to rule out compulsory redundancies. The union has just reached an agreement with National Westminster Bank which it believes will reduce compulsory redundancies. Mr Leif Mills, the union's general secretary, said employment in financial services had been 'hit savagely' by the recession, and that banks were reducing branch networks to pay for losses on 'reckless' lending in the 1980s. The conference passed motions calling on Royal Bank to give guarantees that there would be no compulsory redundancies, and for the union to insist that all redundancies are agreed within job security agreements with banks. Bifu said yesterday it expected the Co-operative Bank to breach an agreement on job security by making up to 20 managers compulsorily redundant after meetings this week. The union said a further 130 clerical staff risked losing their jobs after being designated 'surplus staff', although the bank had given a commitment they would not be made compulsorily redundant this year.</p>

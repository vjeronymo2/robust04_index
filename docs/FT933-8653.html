			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Receivers called to builder RECEIVERS have been called in at Kent-based Page Building &amp; Mechanical, a medium-sized building company which does construction and technical work for local authorities. Bank of Scotland has appointed Mr Peter Lawrence and Mr Colin Wiseman of the London insolvency practitioners Booth White as receivers for Page, which owes subcontractors more than Pounds 600,000. Page has said that its financial difficulties stemmed mainly from a notice in the London Gazette last December by a creditor seeking a winding-up order. Page is taking legal action against its former solicitors over the matter.</p>

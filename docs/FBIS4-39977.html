			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 13 TASS -- The Federal  Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) is setting up an active  operations division to step up struggle against crime, FCIS  director Sergey Stepashin said at a news conference at the  government building here on Monday.    The division will be established not only at the central  office. It will also have its branches in big Russian cities,  including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.    According to the director, these changes are provided for by  the federal programme for stepping up struggle against crime for  1994-1995. The FCIS is vested with new, but, in actual fact,  old forgotten functions, including the return of investigative  bodies.    In the near future, some 700-800 investigators having  experience of work in security bodies will get down to work at  the service.    In Stepashin's opinion, clear-cut and efficient cooperation  between his service, on the one hand, and the law enforcement  bodies, the security service of banks, currency exchange points,  tax investigation service and, if need be, the president's  security service as well as other interested structures, on the  other, will help to implement successfully the federal programme  for stepping up struggle against crime.</p>

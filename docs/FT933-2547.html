			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Trade points way to Macedonian progress: Name trouble eases for former Yugoslav republic THE CLEAREST sign of improved relations between Macedonia and Greece was the appearance this summer of Greek brands of ice-cream at kiosks in Skopje, the Macedonian capital. Until recently, no Greek exporter would risk being accused of unpatriotic behaviour by sending consumer goods to Macedonia. Dozens of joint ventures, set up by Greek companies when Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia, were frozen after it became independent in 1991. The Greek government's objection to Macedonia's choice of name, on the grounds that it implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia, resulted in an unofficial but damaging embargo on bilateral trade. Greek insistence that the republic of Macedonia find a different name in order to win international recognition also soured relations with its EC partners. However, the Greeks have become less intransigent, agreeing last month to hold direct talks with Macedonia, under UN auspices. Whatever the outcome of the Greek general election on Oct 10, policy on Macedonia is unlikely to change markedly. If the opposition socialists come to power, they will, like the conservatives, refuse to budge on the name issue, while being willing to encourage better economic relations. Macedonia has managed to shake off diplomatic and economic isolation by joining the United Nations under a temporary name, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom), in April. It has since been recognised by more than 30 countries. Banks abroad are now willing to extend credit to Macedonian companies. Foreign exchange reserves have tripled this year, to Dollars 130m, while the new Macedonian currency, the denar, has stabilised against the dollar and the D-mark. Discussions with the International Monetary Fund on a stand-by loan are to begin soon. Even so, the talks in New York, to start once the Greek election is over, must make substantive progress if Macedonia is to start pulling its economy into shape, according to Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, foreign minister. 'It's important to get agreement quickly on some practical things. The Greeks are our natural trading partners, so economic co-operation is important. So is movement of people,' the minister said. Since the name dispute erupted, Greece has granted very few entry visas to Macedonians. In the old days, thousands of Macedonians used to head for the Aegean Sea, two hours' drive away, on a hot day. Now they are restricted to swimming in chilly Lake Ochrid. The absence of both Macedonian and Serbian visitors is blamed for a steep decline in tourism to northern Greece, where the hoteliers' association recently appealed to the government for compensation. However, Mr Crvenkovski is cautious about predicting a compromise on the name issue. Both sides rejected a proposal in June from Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, that Macedonia be recognised internationally as 'Novamakedonija'. Both the Greek and Macedonian leaders will remain under pressure from their respective nationalist factions to make no concession over the name. But that would not affect the chances of reaching agreement on economic co-operation and confidence-building measures, according to officials in Skopje and Athens. The Macedonians know that time is on their side. EC foreign ministers already talk about Macedonia, not Fyrom. If the Greeks persist in being difficult, Macedonia may simply ask the UN general assembly to be recognised under that name.</p>

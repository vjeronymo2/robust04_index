			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on interest EARLY in 1991 I raised a considerable sum by taking out a loan. The sum has been earning interest while waiting to be used. This interest, say the tax authorities, attracts higher rate tax. No allowance has been granted in respect of the interest payable. I have appealed, but the tax inspector has ruled against me and I have had to pay the demand. The tax inspector is right. Tax relief in these circumstances was abolished in 1974 (following restrictions imposed in 1972). In a reference library, you will find the current restricted relief for loan interest in sections 353 to 368 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Look for the British Tax Encyclopedia, British Tax Legislation, Simon's Taxes, or Tolley's Taxation Service. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

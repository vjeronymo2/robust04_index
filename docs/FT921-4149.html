			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Generale Bank up to BFr9.6bn GENERALE Bank group, Belgium's largest, has posted a 19.6 per cent gain for last year, bringing net consolidated profit up from BFr8bn (Dollars 234m) in 1990 to BFr9.6bn in 1991. The bank, which is to raise its ordinary net dividend from BFr270 to BFr300, said gross income rose 10 per cent due to better margins on Belgian franc and foreign currency lending, and a higher return on shareholdings. At the same time, Generale increased its transfer to reserves to BFr13bn last year to guard against a rise in bad domestic debts because of the slowdown in the Belgian economy. The parent bank in Belgium continued to prune its staff. The group's consolidated overheads, however, showed a 5 per cent increase, partly because they include for the first time Banque Parisienne de Credit, in which Generale raised its stake to 70 per cent at the end of last year. Despite the domestic slowdown, private-sector lending rose by 10 per cent. However, loans to the Belgian public sector fell as the government pursued its austerity policy in a bid to qualify for European monetary union by the end of this century. The group's consolidated balance sheet ended the year at BFr2,569bn, compared with BFr2,356bn at end-1990.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N.'S BIG FIVE OKS PLAN TO END CAMBODIA'S 12-YEAR CIVIL WAR  </P> <P> The five permanent members of the U.N Security Council agreed Sunday on the  final draft of a peace settlement to end 12 years of war in Cambodia.  </P> <P> Senior officials from Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United  States adopted a 12-page document that outlines a U.N-sponsored peace plan for  the country, Western diplomatic sources said.  </P> <P> The plan, first proposed in January, calls for U.N. administrators and  peacemakers to virtually run Cambodia during a transitional period leading to  free elections.  </P> <P> "Our work is over," a Western official close to the talks said before the  19-hour session ended at 1:15 this morning. In three days of negotiations,  officials talked for about 40 hours with little sleep or food.  </P> <P> There was no immediate word about the fate of a final communique they wrestled  to write after reaching agreement on the peace draft.  </P> <P> If the U.N. plan is to succeed, Cambodia's four warring factions must first  bury their differences and agree to set up a Supreme National Council, which is  a cornerstone of the draft settlement.  </P> <P> Exiled Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who flew to Paris last week,  urged Phnom Penh Premier Hun Sen and his own two allies in a guerrilla  coalition fighting the government to join him in the French capital as soon as  possible for an agreement.  </P> <P> Full adherence to the plan by the four would allow France and Indonesia to  convene the 19-nation Paris peace talks on Cambodia.  </P> <P> The Paris conference, which could be held this year or in early 1991, would be  asked to give official approval to the U.N. plan.  </P> <P> Two of the five permanent members backed different factions. China has long  supported the notorious Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla group, and the  Soviet Union backed Cambodia's pro-Vietnam government.  </P> <P> China last week announced that it was ending military aid to the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> Although the Soviet Union appeared determined to gain a final draft settlement  in the seventh peace talks held this year, it raised the stickiest points,  diplomats said.  </P> <P> "They apparently had the greatest problems with their allies in bringing them  to the peace table," a Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> Problems surfaced over a cease-fire and dismantling some of Phnom Penh's  powers.  </P> <P> Because of the contrast between Hun Sen's regular troops and the guerrilla  forces, the plan provides for a phased process of disarmament and a return of  people in uniform to civilian life.  </P> <P> Regarding the government, the plan allows the United Nations to directly  supervise functions of key ministries such as foreign affairs, defense,  finance, security and information to ensure "a neutral political environment"  before elections.  </P> <P> No figures on the size or cost of the U.N. role were available. Officials in  the past have spoken of up to 20,000 people, half civilian, half military, and  a budget of $3 billion to $5 billion over two years.  </P> <P> Western diplomatic sources said the document contains:  </P> <P> * A description of a mandate for the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia,  including a civilian and military component, organization of elections and  verification of human rights.  </P> <P> * Detailed provisions for a cease-fire and withdrawal.  </P> <P> * Election plans.  </P> <P> * Repatriation of Cambodian refugees and displaced people.  </P> <P> * Principles for a new constitution.  </P> <P> The draft is accompanied by an agreement covering neutrality and sovereignty  issues and a declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P>  Here are some of the key events in the Cambodian conflict:  </P> <P>  March 18, 1970 -- Prince Norodom Sihanouk ousted after nearly 30 years as  Cambodian leader by U.S.-backed Lon Nol.  </P> <P> April 17, 1975 -- Khmer Rouge faction seizes Phnom Penh.

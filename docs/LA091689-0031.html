			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBITAILLE'S TWO GOALS HELP KINGS TIE QUEBEC IN WEBSTER'S DEBUT  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille scored two goals as the Kings came from behind to give Coach Tom  Webster a 3-3 tie with Quebec in his debut in an exhibition game here Friday  night.  </P> <P> Asked if he felt relieved to have his first game as the Kings' coach behind  him, Webster said: "Hell, yes. My palms just stopped sweating."  </P> <P> Robitaille had no complaints about Webster's decision to try him as the left  winger on Wayne Gretzky's line. Early in training camp Webster settled upon the  Kings' acquisition from Sweden, Mikael Lindholm, as Gretzky's right winger.  </P> <P> The Nordiques led, 2-0, when Robitaille scored in the second period. Joe Sakic  put the Nordiques ahead, 3-1, on a power play goal later in the period.  Robitaille cut the lead to 3-2 just 11 seconds into the final period, and Craig  Duncanson (who played most of last season in New Haven) tied the game at 3:55.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Scott Bjugstad needed some stitches over his left eye after he was hit by a  puck early in the second period Friday night, but he returned to play. . .  .Bernie Nicholls sat this game out while his right winger, Dave Taylor,  recovered from an injury. . . .Larry Robinson sat out the first game but is  expected to play tonight in Cincinnati against the New York Rangers. . . .Barry  Beck, who hasn't played a game since March of 1986 because of shoulder  problems, is expected to play his first game with the Kings Monday in Cleveland  . . . .Among the other King veterans who chose to sit out the first game were  Jim Fox and Chris Kontos.  </P></p>

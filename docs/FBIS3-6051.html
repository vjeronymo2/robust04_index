			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters An Hui-chang and Pak Tu-sik] </F>   [Text] The South-North working-level contact for the  exchange of South and North special envoys was held at Panmunjom  on 12 March. However, because no agreement was reached, the  sides decided to meet again on 16 March. Therefore, it seems  certain that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks  slated for 21 March will be postponed.    A high-ranking government official said on 12 March: "Even  if complete agreement were reached on 16 March on the exchange  of special envoys, it really quite difficult for the exchange  of special envoys to take place before 21 March. Because it was  decided to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks after the  exchange of special envoys, it is certain that the DPRK-U.S.  talks slated for 21 March will be postponed."    The official added: "Regarding the content of the 12 March  South-North contact, even if the 16 March contact was  successful, the exchange of special envoys could not be possible  before 26 March, which our side is calling for; or 31 March,  which the North Korean side is calling for. It is believed that  the United States will hold another New York contact with North  Korea to adjust the date for the third round of DPRK-U.S.  high-level talks to after the exchange of South-North special  envoys takes place."    During the 12 March South-North contact, the North Korean  side proposed to announce a "joint communique" saying that an  agreement has been reached on the willingness to exchange  special envoys between the two sides. Our side, however,  rejected such a proposal.    In a news conference after the contact, our side's senior  delegate, Song Yong-tae, said: "Because reaching an agreement  on matters of different opinions is not a simple task, we cannot  be optimistic about the exchange of the special envoys issue."</p>

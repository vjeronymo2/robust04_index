			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: BMW forecasts improvement BMW, the luxury car, motorcycle and aero-engine maker, yesterday forecast an improved performance this year after making a clear profit in 1993. The group, which has already said it will not match 1992's earnings of DM726m, blamed exchange rate losses and a 9.2 per cent drop in new car registrations for the 7.5 per cent fall in turnover to DM28.9bn (Dollars 16.5bn) Boasting in a letter to shareholders that it was the only German vehicle maker to get through last year without short-time working and to make a profit into the bargain, it said it did not expect a lasting improvement in the world car market this year. Car production fell 11 per cent last year to 533,000 units, compared with a 23 per cent slump in the German industry's total output. West European BMW registrations fell 15 per cent to 375,000 due to a 17 per cent decline in Germany. Even so, the group sold more than 200,000 vehicles in its home market and won market share, especially for its top price models, the letter said. There was some compensation in the US, where the marque became the best-selling European brand for the first time with a 19 per cent rise in sales to 78,000 units. While Japanese registrations fell 10 per cent to 25,800, deliveries in other south-east Asian markets rose 30 per cent to 18,000 units. Forecasts for the current year were based on the prospect of only slightly improved global economic conditions. The US recovery was expected to continue, and a slight upswing was predicted for Europe and Japan. German demand would be dampened by falling real incomes, and exports would feel the effects of the continuing high value of the D-Mark.</p>

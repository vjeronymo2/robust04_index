			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Two Socialist Party Floor </F> Leaders at the Chamber of Deputies -- The Split Begins"]    [Text] Rome -- The end of the present legislature may only  be three days away. However, since yesterday, the PSI [Italian  Socialist Party] has two floor leaders in the persons of Franco  Piro and Nicola Capria, and -- mustered around them -- two  parliamentary groups. One of them, the largest, originates from  the old guard, whereas the smaller one is loyal to [PSI  Secretary] Del Turco. This is a sort of inverted preview of the  split proper, which will take place at the end of the month,  when the majority will follow the party's secretary to form a  new Socialist force on the left, while the Craxian minority will  move, with all their belongings, into the moderate camp:  perhaps to join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, most  certainly -- as has already been announced by Treasury Deputy  Secretary Maurizio Sacconi -- to join forces with the Northern  League and Silvio Berlusconi.    Following weeks of expectation, the split among the  Socialist  deputies is thus suddenly becoming a fact, and will in all  probability lead to the "rebels" being suspended from the PSI.  Moreover, it is becoming a fact in the presence of the entire  old general staff, who all hurried to vote for Piro and to pose  for a group photograph featuring Craxi, De Michelis, Di Donato,  Signorile, and all their unconditional followers, in addition to  a small group of supporters of former Finance Minister Formica  -- ranging from Sollazzo to Dell'Unto -- who voted for Dell'Unto  at the national assembly. Overall, 51 deputies out of 91,  practically all those present once the minority had left the  room in order not to take part in the vote following the  announcement by Capria -- who is supposed to have resigned  months ago, but was never replaced -- that the meeting was  closed.    Led by Ugo Intini and Maurizio Sacconi, the "rebels" decided  to go their own way, declaring that they could not address the  issue of confidence from a position with which they could not  identify. When Capria and his followers left, those who stayed  replaced him with the deputy floor leaders, first electing Piro  and then adopting a document which voiced their "indignation at  the humiliations that the PSI has suffered at the hands of the  so-called progressive table," and warned the secretary "not to  make political choices outside the statutory regulations."    A polemic concerning the two floor leaders' legitimacy  flared  up immediately. Del Turco spoke of a "very serious action" and  of a "split within the parliamentary group," confirming his  confidence in Capria, who, in the meantime, claimed before  [Lower House speaker] Napolitano that the procedure followed by  Craxi's followers for the election was illegal, while Labriola  stated categorically that such an election "does not exist."    For their part -- while they wait for Napolitano to  pronounce  -- Piro and the others claim that the election was carried out  according to the rules: "Nothing tragic happened," said Intini.  "Quite simply, the group elected a new floor leader who does not  share the secretariat's line." While "rebel" deputy floor  leaders Sollazzo and Poti denied having carried out a split and  shouted "neither with Craxi nor with [Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto," Craxi himself ("I have always  been disciplined, I was called, and I came") answered Del Turco  in harsh terms, dismissing his reaction as being "completely  hysterical": "The group simply exercised a parliamentary right,  which comes before any political stance. Since time immemorial,  parliamentary groups have chosen their floor leader freely by  means of a secret ballot, when they have deemed it appropriate  to do so. That is all there is to it."</p>

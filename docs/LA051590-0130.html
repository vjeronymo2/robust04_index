			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> RULING BACKS DISTRICT IN SCHOOL CLOSURE  </P> <P> A judge has cleared the way for the Fountain Valley School District to sell or  lease Fountain Valley Elementary School, despite efforts of a parents group  that tried to keep the school open.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam ruled that the school  district did not act illegally when it voted to close the school June 30.  </P> <P> In February, a 40-member parent group, the Future Education Protection  Committee, filed a lawsuit contending that the school district did not properly  conduct its environmental impact study and that the closing would waste public  money.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also included warnings about Roch Courreges Elementary School, one  of three schools the relocated Fountain Valley Elementary students would be  attending. The parents believe Roch Courreges is too close to high-tension  electrical lines.  </P> <P> "My kids will never attend that school," said Barbara Emerson, a plaintiff in  the case. "If we have to, we'll send them to a private school."  </P> <P> Since April 25, the school district was under a temporary restraining order  prohibiting the lease or sale of Fountain Valley Elementary until the judge  made his ruling.  </P> <P> Allen Brandt, attorney for the parents, said a decision about whether to appeal  the case has not been made.  </P> <P> School district Supt. Rubin L. Ingram said the district has never had plans to  sell the school but may lease the property.ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Management: . . . and politicians too Managers in Britain's public services say they are under pressure from their political masters. Almost half those contacted for a research study to be published next week believe their ability to resist political interference in operational decisions has declined over the last three years. Only 10 per cent felt that ability had increased. This is despite the apparent relaxation of authority and transfer of power from central government which has accompanied the radical restructuring of Britain's public sector in recent years. The survey, carried out by the Institute of Management and the Centre for Public Services Management at London's South Bank University, is expected to show that a majority of those public-sector managers polled are nevertheless willing to accept and implement change. Many principles, such as a new responsiveness to customer needs, are being established and the pressure for efficiency is producing benefits. But it is also causing problems for those managing the new policies. The survey will propose that public-sector managers receive more management development support and specifically more training for dealing with politicians and project management and working in teams. It will show that while there has been increased use of quality management techniques, staff appraisal and team working managers in the public sector have not on the whole been empowered to change the more direct means of control - the hiring and firing of staff. The report will also suggest there is a need for new, revised and strengthened codes of ethics for public-sector managers. The public sector needs clear guidelines on corporate governance to define clearly the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in managing institutions in the public interest.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Markets Report: UK political woes cause sterling to weaken Sterling came under some pressure on the foreign exchanges yesterday amid talk of the government resigning if it were defeated next week in legislation over Europe, writes Philip Gawith. Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed that he would ask the Queen to dissolve parliament if the government lost a vote on the European Union budget. The pound finished half a pfennig lower in London, at DM2.4339, from DM2.4394. Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.5621 from Dollars 1.5701. Although sterling was the issue on the minds of traders, the level of market activity was low. With the US market closed for Thanksgiving, many investors took to the sidelines. 'People do not want to do anything until we get full liquidity back on Monday,' commented Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior international economist at UBS in London. For this reason, trading is expected to be quiet again today. Elsewhere, the lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L1,034, but sentiment remained nervous amid ongoing uncertainty about the political longevity of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his government. With Wall Street closed, there was little impetus for the dollar, which traded sideways to finish at DM1.5582, from DM1.5537, and Y98.435 from Y98.335. With little market activity to comment on, it was no surprise that analysts resorted to outdoing each other with Thanksgiving metaphors. Thus Swiss Bank advised its clients: 'Better give some of that turkey to the dollar as it is going to need every ounce of strength to stay at current levels for the remainder of this year.' In fact, the dollar has been quite well supported in recent days, bolstered by the good performance of US treasuries, and lingering speculation about the possibility of a German rate cut. Yesterday, however, was not the day for lower interest rates. The Bundesbank council wasted little time in deciding to leave interest rates unchanged - the repo rate at 4.85 per cent, the discount rate at 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate at 6 per cent. There had been little expectation of a move in official rates, but some speculation about a return to a variable rate repo. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said one reason why the Bundesbank avoided this route was that the objective would be to let the repo rate fall ahead of a cut in the discount rate. At the end of the month, however, when banks need to meet reserve requirements, there is a risk of the repo rate being bid up by an accident of liquidity. Also, 'the Bundesbank would only ease rates if it were confident that the bond market would benefit', said Mr Jessop. Given continuing uncertainty about fiscal policy and next year's pay rises, he said any sign of weakness would not be well received. The next few days are potentially turbulent ones for sterling. Monday sees the crucial vote on EU contributions, Tuesday is Budget day and Wednesday is the deadline for any challenge this year to Prime Minister John Major as party leader. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in London, commented: 'The weakness of sterling is limited at current levels. Once the Wednesday deadline is out of the way, sterling will have a firm foundation for some future strength.' Mr Persaud said this consisted of the unusual nature of the UK economic recovery: very low core inflation, combined with a pre-emptive rise in interest rates; and strong economic growth, alongside an improving current account. In spite of short term difficulties over the EU bill, Mr Persaud said it was arguable that political risk in the UK had actually fallen. 'Even though there is a significant chance of this government being defeated at the next election, the opposition does not appear to be offering a very different stance in terms of monetary or fiscal policy.' The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 100m of assistance at established rates, and Pounds 330m of late support, after forecasting a Pounds 650m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 3/4 and 7 per cent. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 per cent from 6 1/16 per cent.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: A note of new issue caution - The Bottom Line THE FLOOD of new issues in the last year has proved a rich seam for investors but professionals are beginning to caution restraint. New stocks have been among the best performers in the stock market this year. Tadpole Technology, for example, which reported its first profit yesterday, has risen from 65p to 307p. A more modest new issue increase has been Quality Care Homes', up 72 per cent at 234p since it floated last year. So robust has been the renewed private interest in new issues - and concern that they have been kept way from placings like Tadpole and Quality Care Homes - that the Stock Exchange has tightened its listing rules again to ensure better access for the public. But some brokers and fund managers are beginning to question the quality of some of the stocks coming to market. One wondered whether private investors were not becoming too indiscriminate. The prevailing sense that new issues could not fail reminded him of the old advice to sell as soon as the stock market becomes so popular that even the hotel bell-hop starts giving share tips. With interest rates so low, migration towards the stock market is not surprising. The difficulty is how to spot which new companies to avoid and which are coming to market at the right moment in their development. Particularly worrying is the preponderance of companies floating at a very early stage of development. A number demonstrate very exciting potential and tell fascinating stories but are simply inexperienced. 'The companies have a record in their field and the credibility of the people involved is very high,' says one fund manager. 'But you just don't know if they are going to sell their product.' Tepnel Diagnostics, which makes equipment to identify contamination in food, is perhaps the most extreme example. It had no sales when it came to market but shares have nearly doubled to 233p. Anagen, a medical diagnostic company due to come to market next month, is in a similar position. It has powerful backing from an international distributor. But again the product is not fully developed for a mass market. A third company, Drew Scientific, another diagnostic equipment company that is coming to market via a placing next week, has a product and markets. But it has limited experience of continuous manufacturing at the volumes it is anticipating. Of course if such companies get their product and marketing right, the operational gearing of a low-cost manufacturing base can do wonders and the shares may outperform. This appetite for new issues - perhaps best demonstrated by the six times over-subscription for David Lloyd Leisure - has had a knock on effect on price. If the last issue to market went immediately to a 20 per cent premium, the next sponsor tweaks his price. Not only the risk but the price of new issues may be rising. For private investors not put off by growing professional wariness, there are a number of imminent issues. BT3, the sale of the government's remaining 21 per cent stake, is expected in mid-July. More cautious investors may be attracted by what should be an above average yield. At the other end of the scale is OGC International, the offshore oil and gas contractor, for which the offer closes on Wednesday. OGC last year made Pounds 10.5m on sales of Pounds 226.6m. Fleming Claverhouse, the investment trust, is hoping to raise up to Pounds 100m in an offer of conversion shares that closes on June 4. And pathfinder prospectus are expected soon from Court Cavendish, the UK nursing home operator, Inveresk, the speciality paper maker and RPC, the rigid plastic packaging group. The prospect of commission-free purchase of shares that immediately move to a premium may prove too difficult to resist. But even stags have to be careful. 'The temptation is to put the profits of one issue into the next, says one institutional investor. 'But there is bound to be a howler and then the appetite for new issues will wane.'</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Peace talks at risk, warns Molyneaux THE Major-Reynolds Northern Ireland peace initiative could collapse because of the Irish government's apparent willingness to negotiate an IRA ceasefire, Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said yesterday. Mr Molyneaux's warning followed a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, at which he confirmed that the UUP was willing to keep the door open to a further round of talks. However, it further complicates the peace process, which has shown signs of stalling in recent days because of growing tension between London and Dublin on the ceasefire issue. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, also tried to block the talks yesterday by declaring he would 'never' negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. After a separate meeting with Mr Major, he said he had told the prime minister not to waste his time listening to 'the blarney and the lying from Dublin'. He said Mr Major had told him that if the Anglo-Irish initiative failed, the government would reconsider DUP proposals for an internal settlement based on power-sharing devolution. Mr Paisley's continued hostility to the Anglo-Irish initiative is a disappointment to the government, which had hoped that public pressure for peace would moderate the DUP approach. However, Mr Molyneaux's growing suspicion of Dublin's motives is potentially a far more serious blow to the peace process because of the UUP's much greater support among Ulster protestants. Mr Reynolds appeared to be 'drifting away' from the terms of his joint statement with Mr Major in Brussels two weeks ago. 'The position which has been put forward by Mr Reynolds is causing such unease that it may in fact block sensible progress within Northern Ireland,' he said. The Irish prime minister's focus on an early cessation of violence had caused 'a great deal of unease, confusion and instability in Northern Ireland'. Mr Reynolds was 'at least contemplating some kind of link up with the Hume-Adams talks, which can only mean an unacceptable series of concessions to terrorists'. A survey in today's Guardian shows that 59 per cent of 1,400 people polled in mainland Britain believe the IRA or Sinn Fein should be allowed to take part in peace talks. Some 44 per cent thought their participation should be conditional on ending the campaign of violence, while 15 per cent believed they should automatically be involved.</p>

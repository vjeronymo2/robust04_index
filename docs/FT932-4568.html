			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / SFO asks Turkey for help to break Nadir deadlock A SENIOR officer of the Serious Fraud Office has flown to Turkey in an effort to prevent Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, from travelling from his home in northern Cyprus to the Turkish mainland. Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case, was holding meetings with senior officials in Turkey after flying secretly to Ankara on Monday for a week-long mission to break the deadlock over the businessman, who jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5. News of this latest initiative came as Mr John Major, the prime minister, admitted that Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland security minister, had committed a 'misjudgment' but not 'a hanging offence' in giving a watch to Mr Nadir. Although Mr Major denied that Mr Mates had acted improperly in raising Mr Nadir's case with the attorney-general, the question mark over the minister's judgment was reinforced by confirmation that Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, had refused to become involved after being approached on behalf of Mr Nadir. Speaking in Ankara, Ms Harris said the SFO was 'intent in pursuing all legitimate means to make sure that Asil Nadir attends the trial he is due to attend in September of this year'. Mr John Goulden, the British ambassador in Turkey, confirmed that Ms Harris had met Turkish authorities. He said it was part of a 'continuing process' of co-operation on the case between Turkish and British officials. This is believed to be the first time Ms Harris, the case controller of the Polly Peck affair, has travelled to Turkey and underscores the growing concern that Mr Nadir may try to travel there. UK officials believe that might jeopardise efforts to encourage Mr Nadir to return to the UK to face charges. Contacted at his home in Lapta earlier this week, Mr Nadir restated his intention to fly to Turkey 'very soon', to regain the remnants of his former business empire. Mr Nadir would be legally able to own and run businesses in Turkey, although he is a bankrupt in the UK. In recent days, Mr Nadir's Turkish lawyers have successfully prevented the sale of his Gunaydin newspaper title and had a power of attorney given to his administrators in bankruptcy revoked in the Turkish courts, thus preventing efforts to dispose of Media Print, a company with assets worth several million pounds. Turkey's interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, has said publicly that Mr Nadir is free to travel to the mainland, although informally Turkish officials are understood to have urged Mr Nadir not to travel to Turkey. Foreign minister Hikmet Cetin reaffirmed Turkey's 'full co-operation' on the Nadir affair in talks with UK officials at the end of May. In the Commons yesterday Mr Major conceded that Mr Mates had been unwise to give the fugitive businessman a watch with a supportive inscription. Mr Major emphasisied that Mr Mates had no financial involvement with Mr Nadir, his companies or advisers. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, attacked the prime minister over the way in which both Mr Mates and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had raised Mr Nadir's case with the attorney-general. He accused Mr Mates of undermining the work of the SFO, and described the whole affair as 'shabby and unseemly'. Labour is determined to exploit the Tories' discomfort in the current row. It believes that the government has been hurt because of Mr Nadir's past donations to the Conservative party. Nadir adviser proves to be a friend in deed, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

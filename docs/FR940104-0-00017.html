			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Commission Ruling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission denies the Indicated Parties' and Hadson's requests for rehearing. Their arguments lose sight of the fact that the Form 592 information must still be provided electronically, thus allowing interested parties and the Commission staff to monitor the activities of pipelines and their affiliates and to initiate the appropriate action when evidence of discrimination in favor of affiliates exists. The Indicated Parties' concerns about obtaining reliable and accurate Form 592 information are unfounded. Section 250.16(g)(2) states that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An interstate pipeline must provide 24-hour access, by electronic means, to the data specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Access to the information must be provided once the service has begun. A pipeline must, on a daily basis, either update the information or indicate that no changes have occurred in the log information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most pipelines satisfied this requirement through the use of EBBs in the past, and Order No. 636 now mandates EBBs. Interested parties have been receiving and will continue to receive the Form 592 information electronically. Thus, the Indicated Parties' argument that the Commission and the industry have no experience with EBBs is inaccurate. Moreover, the requirements of Order No. 636 ensure that each pipeline's Order No. 497 EBB must provide for: (a) Downloading by users; (b) daily back-up of information, which must be available for at least three years; (c) purging information on completed transactions from current files; (d) display of most recent entries ahead of information posted earlier; and (e) on-line help, a search function and a menu that permits users to separately access records in the transportation log and standards of conduct information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These features allow shippers to take the information that is currently filed on Form 592s off the pipelines' EBBs and obtain access to the information up to three years after it is posted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In these circumstances, the burden on the pipelines from filing Form 592s and the administrative burden on the Commission from collecting them outweighs any benefits of collecting the data in hard copy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR 284.8(b)(4) and 284.9(b)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR 284.8(b)(4) and 284.9(b)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also does not believe that Hadson's argument relying on 18 U.S.C. 1001 is a valid reason for maintaining the Form 592 filing requirement. Section 1001 states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Hadson's argument implies that because a hard copy of the Form 592 information will not be filed with the Commission pipelines will knowingly provide inaccurate or incorrect information through electronic means. The Commission believes that the language of the statute is broad enough to cover electronic postings. However, in order to prevent any such fraudulent conduct, the Commission deems the electronic posting of the Form 592 information equivalent to a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) which proposes to revise Order No. 497's reporting requirements, including Form 592, the Commission will not address Tenneco's request to delete certain parts of Form 592.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Application of Order No. 497 to Ozark  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Request for Rehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ozark asserts that the Commission's order on remand ignores the court's instructions requiring the Commission to consider the effect of Ozark's evidence on the question of control. Ozark contends that it simply relies upon an equally deficient rationale for concluding, without reference to any evidence, that Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline Corporation each, individually, ``controls'' Ozark, thereby making the marketing affiliates of those partners marketing affiliates of Ozark. Ozark submits that to avoid problems inherent in finding that these partners can exercise ``affirmative control'' over Ozark, the Commission concluded that they can exercise ``negative control'' by simply withholding their vote and vetoing any transportation transaction that would compete with their respective marketing affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

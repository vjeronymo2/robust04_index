			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Suter falls 26% to Pounds 17.8m but maintains the worst is past SUTER, the industrial, distribution and chemical company chaired by Mr David Abell, yesterday announced a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits but said that the outlook for some divisions had improved. 'We have bottomed out,' said Mr Abell. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 17.8m in the year to December 31. The company blamed the fall on the recession, eroded margins and the cancellation of an important contract for Pentagon Chemicals, a subsidiary. Turnover edged ahead by almost 2 per cent to Pounds 205.7m but would have slipped by 3 per cent if adjusted for 1990 acquisitions. Fully diluted earnings fell to 10.5p (15p) per share. The directors recommended a maintained final dividend of 5.6p, making an unchanged total of 8.8p. Turnover in the chemicals division increased 10 per cent, reflecting a full contribution from Chemoxy International, the Middlesbrough chemicals group won from rival bidder MTM in 1990. But operating profits fell 32 per cent to Pounds 6.3m after an unrelated company, which sub-contracted to Pentagon, lost the contract. Pentagon has won some new business but its plant is only at 60 per cent of capacity. Turnover in the industrial division rose 2 per cent to Pounds 96m but operating profits fell 15 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. Air-conditioner sales were affected by recession in the building industry although the valves division, which supplies the petrochemical and oil sectors, performed well. There were extraordinary losses of Pounds 6.3m, which included a Pounds 4.1m provision to cover an investment in Harton, the loss-making plastics distributor. The 21.9 per cent stake cost Pounds 6m and is now valued at Pounds 2.5m. Net borrowings fell by Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 33.6m, bringing gearing down 10 percentage points to 74 per cent. Mr Abell said debt levels would not be reduced this year. The Department of Trade and Industry is continuing its investigations of six companies with Suter links. DTI inspectors were appointed in 1988 and 1989 to establish whether certain investors in the companies acted in concert. Their report is due to be handed to the DTI soon. COMMENT Suter continues to be spurned by the market, which marked the shares down 1p to 121p despite results in line with expectations and a maintained dividend. Parts of the business, such as Chemoxy, the valves division and Raffel, a European supplier of heat exchange equipment, show promise and should come out of recession strongly. But too many questions remain. The investment in Harton now looks unfortunate and Mr Abell admits Suter paid too much for Pentagon. His remarks yesterday that Suter may be interested in buying part of MTM look well intentioned, but it is difficult to see how it can pay with its gearing and share price at these levels. If Suter achieves forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 22m this year, the shares are on a multiple of less than 10. But even if the cloud of the DTI report is removed, the shares are unlikely to be attractive other than for their yield.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] In May, the Russian Government's budget owed  enterprises 8.5 trillion rubles. The figure was mentioned  during a session of the public chamber of the Russian president  by Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy prime minister and minister for the  economy in the government.    The deputy prime minister believes that using privatization  income to set up an extra-budgetary fund, which could be put  into anything from the defense sector to the socio-cultural  sphere, could be one way out of the difficult financial  situation.</p>

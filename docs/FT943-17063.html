			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Aid pledges of Dollars 2.4bn leave PLO with a cash shortfall: Donor's stance is angering Arafat Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, will today head to the land he has sought for so long, supported by more than Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in pledges of aid but few dollars in his pocket. The once-wealthy PLO is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and international donors seem determined that its coffers will not be replenished to the detriment of the West Bank and Gaza strip's development. In Tunis last week, Mr Arafat did not disguise his anger at the 'derisory' cash sums he was being offered to help set up the Palestinian organisations required to take over the administration of territories freed from Israeli occupation. The conflict between immediate, and partly political, needs and the longer term economic and social requirements of the territories can only be resolved by the international aid donors. The two largest, the US and the EU which together have pledged more than Dollars 1bn over the next five years, recognise the need to sustain Mr Arafat politically. But the amount of pledged aid that can be diverted into start-up costs and budget support for the new administration is often limited by the legal restraints under which the donor governments must work. Even more difficult is to provide Mr Arafat and his colleagues with what American politicians describe as 'walk about' money. Such requirements sit uneasily alongside demands for 'transparency and accountability' in the use of funds. For the past two months these issues have dominated the PLO's contacts with donors, at some cost to the urgent work needed to translate pledges into projects and to answer the criticism from Palestinians in the territories that nothing on the ground has changed since Israel and the PLO signed their initial agreement in September. Of the Dollars 2.4bn in development funds on offer over the next five years, Dollars 720m has been earmarked for the first 12 months of the new self-rule authority, a figure well beyond the capacity of the territories to absorb. A key task now is to resolve priorities and persuade the donors to be flexible in their selection of projects. 'We are finding that some countries only wish to be involved in certain prestige projects where they can see long-term commercial benefit. And there are also many difficulties in different demands for bidding procedures, and with those governments which insist that contracts can only be awarded to companies from their own countries,' said a member of the Palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction. These complications have been compounded by the lack of urgency demonstrated by Mr Arafat in appointing staff and his unwillingness to delegate authority. He has, however, also been handicapped by the belated recognition that start-up costs of the new administration and its projected budget deficit for the first two years would be substantial. The gap to be covered until the end of 1994 is put at Dollars 168m. Of this Dollars 133m has so far been committed, with Dollars 60m of it in a special fund administered by the World Bank and named after Johan Joergen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister. The Holst fund has been financed by governments which were persuaded to switch development funds into direct cash aid. They include Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which, because of Mr Arafat's support for Iraq during the Gulf war, had been adamant that none of their contributions should be used to sustain the PLO. It was the World Bank's suggestion that the Holst fund should be drawn down by Dollars 10m a month that Mr Arafat characterised as 'derisory', and prompted him to dispatch Mr Ahmed Qurei, the economy supremo in the new administration, to Washington for talks at the end of last week. The result has been an agreement to step up the monthly payments to Dollars 13m, but the quest continues for more donations to the fund. The danger is that the Palestinian self-rule authority will become addicted to international aid, a risk compounded by the further delays certain to be prompted by the weight of unresolved political issues. There has also been an underlying assumption in drawing up financial estimates that Israel will be generous, both in the repayment of a proportion of tax already collected and in reopening its borders to Palestinian workers. These are not the sort of assumptions on which professional gamblers would place much of a wager. Neither would they bet on Mr Arafat accepting that much of the Dollars 2.4bn is not money in the bank, but funds which will only be disbursed on the implementation of projects.</p>

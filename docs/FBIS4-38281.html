			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive Committee </F> member and leader of the Palestinian People's Party, by Fathi  al-Barqawi in Tunis; date not given -- first paragraph is  al-Barqawi introduction]    [Text] We first asked about what Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat was quoted as saying several days ago, that some  opposition factions would soon take stands in support of the  agreement [with Israel] and that some of these factions had made  contacts with the aim of participation in the National Authority  Council. Was the People's Party one of these factions?    [Al-Najjab] We are not one of them. We did not accept the  Cairo agreement which carefully defines the authority's marginal  powers as evident in all the agreement's articles and  appendixes. We still believe that the Palestinian people's main  task is to end the occupation, achieve national independence,  and find a solution to the refugee problem in accordance with  the UN resolutions. We do not see anything in any of the Cairo  agreement articles that will take us closer to that objective.  That is why we will continue to struggle, outside the  authority, for liberation, but we will support the authority if  it contributes to the struggle against the occupation.    [Al-Barqawi] But how can you support the authority without  being part of it?    [Al-Najjab] There are some tangible issues such as the  Arabism of Jerusalem, resisting settlements, the detainees, and  the Israeli repressive measures. If the authority contributes  to the defense of these causes, it would find us with it in the  same trench.    [Al-Barqawi] So there are points of agreement.    [Al-Najjab] We want to remain in touch with the authority,  with the common objective of resisting occupation, preventing  intensification of national division, and preventing  inter-Palestinian fighting, and at the same time secure the  opposition's right to struggle against the agreement by  political and democratic means.    [Al-Barqawi] Is there a danger of inter-Palestinian fighting  on the horizon?    [Al-Najjab] We are satisfied with the statements issued by  all parties prohibiting infighting, but it is not just a matter  of intentions. There are gaps in the agreement itself. For  instance, under the agreement, the authority is committed to  hand over everyone considered by Israel to be a threat to its  security. If the Palestinian police implemented that provision,  then there would be a threat of collision. Israel also insists  that arms should only be in the possession of the police, hence  the call for arms to be collected from the people. Some of  these arms, used against the honor, property, and lives of the  public, should be taken away because that would fulfill a  national need. However, some arms could be used against the  occupation so long as it is there. Administrative decisions do  not solve that problem. It is, above all, a political issue and  the dispute over it could lead to friction. That is why our  party has suggested to both the authority and the opposition the  idea of forming an authoritative national committee, with  representatives from both sides, that would have the task of  dealing with this sensitive issue and making decisions in the  interest of national unity provided it is equally binding on all  parties.    [Al-Barqawi] Has that proposal produced any results?    [Al-Najjab] Everyone has expressed appreciation and saw it  as a serious proposal, and we are waiting for the replies.    [Al-Barqawi] Regarding the agreement which you oppose, do  you not see a possibility of improving its terms?    [Al-Najjab] That would have been possible before the  agreement was signed, and that is what we called for during the  negotiations. The articles of the agreement that have been made  public fully restrict the authority. We are watching its  implementation, and that includes the approach to the various  disputed issues such as the detainees issue. The [released]  detainees' residence has been confined to Jericho until the  expiry of their prison term. That is stipulated in the  agreement. The same kind of thing applies to the authority's  offices in Arab Jerusalem and the laws to be enforced in the  transitional period. The agreement commits the authority to  maintaining all the laws and military orders which were in force  when the agreement was signed. There is also another provision  which stipulates that the authority can only have offices in  Gaza and Jericho. Israel is trying to use that provision as a  cover for its known policy of clearing Palestinian national  institutions out of Jerusalem.    The authority should take a firm position on all these  issues, the same position taken by the patriotic forces  including the People's Party, upholding struggle for the release  of all the detainees, return of the deportees, deletion of  anything preventing that from the provisions of the agreement  itself, and defense of the national institutions in Jerusalem.    [Al-Barqawi] You are in Tunis for the closure of the office  of the Social Affairs Department which you head. How is that to  be interpreted?    [Al-Najjab] There is some confusion which should be cleared  up, and awareness should be heightened. The PLO is one thing  and the authority quite another. The PLO is necessary because  it still has not completed its national program specified in the  peace initiative approved by the [Palestine] National Council in  1988. The PLO is still the Palestinian people's moral home and  the symbol of their unity and common cause. The PLO has made  major achievements including the vast world recognition of the  Palestinian state, and it is the only body that can protect  these gains. The authority, according to the agreement, is not  allowed to have diplomatic relations with anyone, and its  responsibilities are kept within the confines of the agreement  and its implementation. It is not permitted to raise issues  that have been postponed until the final phase, such as  Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, and the settlements.  Therefore, the PLO should alone continue to mobilize and  concentrate on these issues and urge the United Nations, the  Security Council, and the international community [to tackle  them]. It should also insist on the resolutions pertaining to  these issues and should resist Israeli practices aimed at  perpetuating the status quo. The PLO should continue to seek to  dispel the widespread delusion that the Palestinian question has  been resolved just as the South African question has been  resolved. True, the authority does, for instance, have a social  security department in the occupied territory with specific  powers, but the Palestinian people in the diaspora still have  social issues which the PLO and its departments should continue  to shoulder the responsibilities for, and the same applies to  most departments. What is important now is that the PLO should  create new departments for such issues as Jerusalem and  settlement, and should keep the Returnees Affairs Department and  the Political Department.    We have submitted these ideas to the leadership and we hope  that it will study them and respond in a way that would serve  continuation of the national struggle.    [Al-Barqawi] The supporters of the agreement consider what  has been accomplished as just an interim step to be followed by  other steps such as legislative elections in the future. What  is your position on such elections?    [Al-Najjab] Yes, it is a step, but in what direction? It  should be in the direction of ending the occupation, and the  transition should be from a reality of occupation to a reality  that would rid us of that occupation. We do not see anything in  the agreement that would help that. The agreement adopted the  Israeli concept of the transitional period and its function.  That, at best, would only lead to the implementation of the  Israeli Labor Party's program based on withdrawal from the  densely populated areas, which are small areas not appropriate  for the Palestinians to exercise their right of  self-determination in. As regards elections, the danger is that  according to the agreement, they should merely be elections for  the present authority's council with some "legislative and  executive powers." If that is the case, it would be difficult  to participate. The battle should be started from now for a  separate legislative council that would form and supervise the  work of an executive council.    [Al-Barqawi] If the Palestine Central Council was summoned  to a meeting, would you participate in its work?    [Al-Najjab] We are surprised that the Central Council has  not been summoned to a meeting to consider the agreement. The  question we ask now is: What would be the Central Council's  agenda if it indeed was called to a meeting?</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: BAT revises its Indian ambitions BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance group, has dropped the idea of raising its stake in ITC, its Indian affiliate, from 31.5 to 51 per cent, which would make it a BAT subsidiary. Instead, BAT will support ITC in its aim of becoming an Indian multinational. During a recent visit to London, Mr K. L. Chugh, ITC chairman, received an assurance from BAT that the UK group would maintain its stake at 31.5 per cent. The assurance appears to be the central element of an agreement designed to defuse tensions between BAT and ITC. Managers in the Indian group had feared that after many years of independence, their freedom might be curbed by a re-imposition of control from London. BAT also seems to have taken account of concerns in the Indian government that a leading Indian company with the potential to become a multinational should lose some of its independence. 'Discussions are at an early stage', BAT said. 'What we are trying to do is look for a way that helps ITC develop as an Indian multinational, but helps us develop our interests in tobacco and financial services in India'. Increasing its stakes in the financial services businesses would be an obvious first step for BAT. The negotiations are being handled personally by Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive. ITC Classic, an ITC affiliate, has applied for a licence to start a banking business. ITC is also seeking to break into insurance through an independent company, as soon as participation of the private sector in insurance is allowed. 'BAT is most welcome to have as much shareholding in the bank and insurance companies as it wants,' said Mr Chugh. Mr Chugh also said he had an assurance from BAT that it would add value to ITC's tobacco and financial services businesses which are BAT's core activities. At the same time, ITC, which has a significant presence in paper, agri-business, hotels and global trading, will develop these areas further. According to Mr Chugh, ITC Bhadrachalam and ITC Hotels, the two group companies, will be making Euroissues of Dollars 50m each to develop further the paper and hotel businesses. While BAT has agreed to maintain the status quo, ITC will not be adding any new business to its already large portfolio. Mr Chugh said: 'Our objective is to become a multinational company. We are happy that BAT is supportive of our ambition. Dr Manmohan Singh (Indian finance minister) wants 100 multinationals by the turn of the century. We want to be among the first.'</p>

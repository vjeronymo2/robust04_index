			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Reforms will 'politicise Whitehall' The Labour party was quick to criticise the government's white paper on the civil service, saying it would bring greater politicisation of Whitehall with more recruits from the private sector. The criticisms were echoed by civil service union leaders. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS union, suggested that individual contracts would 'politicise' top advisers and fragment pay systems. Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association, said the white paper had not dealt with issues which the public cared about, 'such as high standards, quality services and restoring confidence in public life'. The only union leader to threaten industrial conflict was Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the NUCPS, which represents executive officer grades. He said the paper was a 'cynical con trick on the public'. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow public service minister, condemned the document as a 'wholly arbitrary exercise' in which the government had 'abdicated responsibility for the overall direction and general goals of the civil service'. He also suggested it was a 'menu for accelerated privatisation of the civil service which threatened the constitutional principles on which the civil service has rested for 150 years'. Mr Giles Radice, Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, welcomed the government's intention to consult opposition parties before introducing change. The white paper won general support from Conservative MPs, who believe the proposals will accelerate efficiency measures. But Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee, warned that nothing should be done that would damage 'the fine tradition of public service'. The union general secretaries criticised the government's intention to scrap national civil service pay bargaining and introduce 150 separate bargaining units. Mr Brett said the Treasury would 'still pull the strings' over the levels of civil service pay and this would lead to more strikes provoked by the government. Mr Howard Davies, the Confederation of British Industry director-general, welcomed decentralisation of pay bargaining. 'Without it the government's pay bill freeze could not work in the long-run,' he said. He added, however, that the proposals for the senior ranks were 'not radical' and would leave the civil service monopoly 'essentially intact'.</p>

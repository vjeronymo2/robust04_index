First, whatever its type, no foreign trade or industrial and  trade enterprise can use a registerer's trademark without his  permission, with such excuses as having "shared" the use of the  trademark or having been its goods-supply unit.    Second, a trademark registerer must adopt effective measures  to protect his trademark properly. If he finds his trademark  rights are being violated, he can -- upon obtaining necessary  proof -- file a suit with the Administration for Industry and  Commerce and a law court or with an administrative organ for  economic relations and foreign trade.    Third, all levels of administrative organs for economic  relations and foreign trade must act strictly in accordance with  the provisions of the Trademark Act and should render necessary  support for the complaints lodged by a unit the trademark rights  of which are violated. They must deal with trademark violators  sternly, whether they are units that supply trademarked goods,  or not. Enterprises that abuse the trademarks of others to a  serious extent or that do not change this practice after  repeated warnings must be punished. Persons with the main  responsibility should be given necessary administrative  punishments.    [Signed] 20 March 1992    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade</p>

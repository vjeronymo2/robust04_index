			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Talks over Spanish car row Spanish government and regional authorities face crucial talks this week on the future of a Japanese-controlled car plant in the southern town of Linares, where roughly half the population took to the streets in a protest at the weekend. The threatened closure of Santana Motor, a subsidiary of Suzuki making four-wheel-drive vehicles, could become a big political issue four months before regional elections in Andalucia, a stronghold of the country's ruling Socialists and home territory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister. The demonstration on Saturday, involving an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 townspeople, was provoked by Santana's announcement that it was seeking protection from creditors after heavy losses. The Santana plant employs 2,400 and is the only large factory in the area since the disappearance of the town's mining. About 60 per cent of the Linares people are reckoned to depend on it. Mr Juan Manuel Eguigaray, industry minister, is to meet management today. Suzuki, which owns about 80 per cent of the company, said it was willing to plough in Pts5.27bn (Pounds 25.4m) to cover losses from the start of last year, but no more. The Madrid stock exchange commission suspended trading in Santana shares on Friday. Unions blamed the Socialist regional authorities, the Madrid government and Suzuki. They accused the company of 'blackmail' and of using the workforce as hostages to obtain subsidies.</p>

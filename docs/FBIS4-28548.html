			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Malaysia's pragmatic policy of opening its markets  far and wide and also seeking opportunities in what overseas  markets have to offer continues to be [word indistinct] and  beneficial. Malaysia's booming economy and rapid growth are  factors that attract bilateral trade to grow at a steady rate  with several countries: north, south, east, and west.    The latest big deal to be struck was a $600 million contract  signed between Malaysia and Russia this week in Kuala Lumpur for  18 MiG-29 Fulcrum air superiority fighter jets. Of this, $450  million is to be paid in cash and the remainder will be supplied  of Malaysian products; namely, palm oil to be delivered to  Russia over the next five years.    Apart from that, Russia has also agreed to supply at no cost  two MiG-29's to Malaysia's military and commercial aircraft  servicing and overhaul center, the Aerod Company. This will  help the latter's engineers to acquire the skills required in  maintaining the frontline Russian fighter aircraft.    The deal took two years to become reality. The delay was  because of the haggling over the price and the terms of the  contract [words indistinct]. However, the vote for the contract  to come [words indistinct].    The deal marks the beginning of a new era in bilateral  relations which was thought inconceivable a few years ago.  Russia is now showing a deep interest and forging closer  bilateral ties and economic cooperation with Malaysia. It wants  to extend its expertise in the industrial, infrastructural,  telecommunications, and energy sectors. Russia also fully  supports Malaysia's need for training, research and development,  and for technology transfer. Malaysia will study the possible  areas of cooperation it wishes to venture into with the Russians.    The purchase of the Russian MiG's will no doubt prove to be  immensely beneficial to Malaysia. It must be understood that  Malaysia does not confine itself to any particular country when  awarding contracts and it is driven by the benefits that the  country can derive through such efforts.    A [word indistinct] factor in the Russian contract is the  proposed establishment of a regional Technical Service Center,  TSC, for the MiG's as part of the deal which can assist the  country's aerospace industry. The center, a joint venture  between the Malaysian Government and three Russian bodies, will  service the MiG-29 aircraft operated not only by the Royal  Malaysian Air Force but also the other air forces in the region.  The TSC is an example of how bilateral economic and trade  relations between Malaysia and Russia can be strengthened  further.    There is vast potential for the two countries to jointly  explore new areas of trade. [Word indistinct] the MiG deals are  concerned, it marks the entry of Russian fighter aircraft into  the Southeast Asia market. And Malaysia welcomes the transfer  of knowhow by the Russian defense industries in Malaysia's  avionics and aircraft component manufacturing.    The visit of the Russian team to Malaysia to sign the  contract will pave the way for the [words indistinct] between  the two countries in the future.</p>

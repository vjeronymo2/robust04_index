			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "NIKA": "Highest Pessimism Since August 1993"] </F>   [Text] The level of social optimism is the lowest since  August 1993. That is the result of a survey conducted by the  Public Opinion Research Center [OBOP] at the end of March. A  majority of Polish people (58 percent) think that the affairs of  the country are heading in the wrong direction. Only one in  four Poles is of the opinion that the situation is improving.    Seventy-nine percent of those polled say that moods among  people are bad, and just 15 percent think they are good. Among  the optimists, the most prevalent social groups are young people  under age 19 (32 percent) and people who are well off  financially (26 percent).    One-fourth of those polled predict an improvement in living  conditions over the next three years, but one-third think that  conditions will deteriorate. The latter view is shared most  often by people between the ages of 40 and 49, with primary  vocational educations and who are in poor financial condition.    Assessments regarding the current economic situation in the  country are not the best, either. Only 5 percent of those  polled think that the country's economic development is  satisfactory, but as many as half of those polled (44 percent)  are of the opposite view.    The number of people dissatisfied with the way democracy is  developing in Poland is also on the increase (64 percent). It  is the highest percentage since August 1993 of people negatively  evaluating the social transformations.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The survey was conducted by OBOP in the period 23-29 March  of  this year, using a random sample of 1,197 people.</p>

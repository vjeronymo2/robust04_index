			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Active buying takes Nikkei to 1994 high Active buying by foreign investors, investment trust funds and dealers pushed up share prices and the Nikkei index rose 1.4 per cent, closing at the year's high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average rose 281.36 to 20,777.16, surpassing the previous high of 20,677.77 in March. It moved in a narrow range in the morning, registering a low of 20,510.10; but buying by dealers in the afternoon session triggered activity by domestic institutions, and a peak of 20,824.56. Volume rose to 530m shares against 399m. The Topix index of all first section stocks jumped 19.78 to 1,670.76 while the Nikkei 300 rose 3.90 to 305.75. Advances led declines by 832 to 197 with 147 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.46 to 1,378.07. In spite of the rise, few in the market expected the index to break the 21,000 level easily. Traders said that large-lot selling orders had been placed. Large capital steels and shipbuilders were higher. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y11 to Y749 and Nippon Steel gained Y2 to Y372. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000 to Y868,000. Other telecommunication and multimedia linked stocks were also higher with Fujitsu up Y40 to Y1,090 and NEC gaining Y20 to Y1,190. Profit-taking depressed East Japan Railway, which lost Y1,000 to Y508,000. Speculative favourites gave way to blue chips. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y11 to Y884. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 213.71 to 22,881.19 in volume of 26.8m shares. Capcom, a video game software maker, gained Y400 to Y4,930 on reports that its pre-tax profits will rise 10 per cent for the current year to March. Roundup Individual markets displayed strength in an otherwise quiet region. SHANGHAI B shares rose 5 per cent on US renewal of most favoured nation status to China. The index rose 3.56 to 75.55, for a 12.5 per cent advance over the week as foreign and domestic buyers built their portfolios. Renewed confidence in the outlook began to emerge at the start of last week after a 40 per cent fall in the market since the start of the year. BANGKOK rose 2 per cent on the day and 3.4 per cent over the week as buyers moved in to large market capitalisation stocks. The SET index rose 27.55 to 1,383.57 in turnover of Bt8.5bn, down from Thursday's Bt10bn. TAIPEI was pulled lower by late profit-taking in industrials after Thursday's rebound, and the weighted index fell 45.59 to 5,806.77, or 1.7 per cent, over the week. Turnover rose to TDollars 41.51bn from TDollars 35.78bn. MANILA opened strongly on foreign buying of blue chips but dipped at the close as profits were taken. The composite index fell 10.07 to 2,907.00, 1.3 per cent higher on the week. SYDNEY firmed on a late spurt of bargain-hunting which took the All Ordinaries index up 5.3 to 2,102.2, little changed on the week, in turnover of 207.3m shares. HONG KONG finished a mixed day slightly lower, sapped by profit-taking on confirmation of US renewal of China's MFN trade status and concerns over the lower domestic property market. The Hang Seng index fell 11.58 to close at 9,470.13, 1.7 per cent lower on the week. SEOUL was slightly higher as investors switched attention between a number of different sectors. The composite index added 3.10 to 953.86, little changed on the week. SINGAPORE was firm on late blue chip buying by institutions which took the Straits Times Industrials index 8.75 higher to 2,323.95, little changed on the week, in volume of 98.48m shares. KUALA LUMPUR finished the day's highs as investors again took quick profits amid continued uncertainty over the market's near-term direction. The composite index closed 3.06 ahead at 1,000.11, almost unchanged on the week. BOMBAY ended with gains on buying by speculators and mutual funds which took the BSE-30 index 51.51 higher to 3,789.51 in a session shortened to enable the BSE to prepare for the launch of two new broad-based rupee and dollar-based indices.</p>

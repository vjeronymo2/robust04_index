Here  is a report from Washington:    [Unidentified correspondent] It cannot exactly be said that  the talks between the delegations of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began at the State Department  yesterday, have achieved any particular progress. However, the  fact that the timing of the talks, set by the Americans, has  been observed promises that a positive conclusion of the  Washington talks on internal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina  can be expected as early as tomorrow afternoon.    This morning the formulation of the republic's name was on  the agenda, a name which should -- mapart from the geographic  and historical name of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- also contain a  constitutional solution, such as federation, confederation,  union, and so forth. None of the solutions has been adopted so  far.    Bosnian territories currently under the control of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina army, and the territories under HVO [Croat  Defense Council] control, which -- we must not forget -- are  also Bosnian territories, should during the negotiations be  defined as parts of the overall territory which is currently not  under occupation, populated by citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs, and others, with the right to have the  occupied territories reintegrated into the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina when this is rendered possible.    Let me also emphasize that the future state, according to  this agreement, looks increasingly similar to the original  Vance-Owen plan. According to the plan Bosnia-Herzegovina is  divided into 17 cantons. The unified Bosnian [word indistinct]  is only the western and central territory; that is, the Bosnian  territories populated by the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Bosniaks, Croats, and others. It would be the successor of the  state sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina and would remain a  recognized member of the United Nations.    The Americans particularly insist that in this phase the  reintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be approached by  first halting the Bosnian-Croat hostilities, then by restoring  their alliance, and by articulating the territorial interests of  the Bosnian people, who would thus preserve their own access to  the sea, which they have had throughout their history, but which  has been territorially reduced in repeated enemy agression.

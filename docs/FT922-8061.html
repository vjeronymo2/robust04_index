			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (7) - An annual Mecca for sailors / Fairs, The October Boat Show is one of the biggest events of its kind in the world and attracts around 350,000 visitors PERCHED on the delta of the river Bisagno on land rescued from the sea, Genoa's fair symbolises much about its host city. With the Mediterranean its immediate neighbour and the city centre just minutes away on foot, the fair highlights the advantages and disadvantages of Genoa's geography. For while the setting may be unbeatable, the narrow site offers little scope for expansion. In spite of its limitations, the fair comes into its own for 10 days each October, when it hosts the International Boat Show. One of the biggest events of its kind in the world, the Boat Show attracts around 350,000 visitors, more than half from outside Genoa and around 20,000 from abroad. The figures for the Boat Show are impressive, with more than 800 exhibitors and 1,500 boats on display in every corner of the narrow site. The biggest boats are reserved for Hall B, which, with its four-storey height, can take big sailing boats up to 32 metres long, masts and all. Bigger vessels, which are also seen regularly in Genoa, have to stay on the water in the specially-built marina used as additional exhibition space during the show and rented out to local sailors for the rest of the year. Having the marina at hand means Genoa can offer much the same amount of exhibition space as its bigger international rivals. Although the boat shows at Dusseldorf and Miami are about the same size, no other exhibition of its kind offers the same combination of sophisticated interior facilities and external possibilities on the water, says Mr Giuseppino Roberto, the fair's secretary-general. The Boat Show, which will celebrate its 33rd anniversary this year, used to be held in February until it was shifted to October in 1972. 'The choice of October was very fortunate. Although it is at the end of the season, it is still very much late summer in Liguria, meaning the weather is very pleasant and people want to come to look at boats,' says Mr Roberto. He is less communicative about the competitive factors which may also have forced the change. Boat shows have become big business in rich European countries and in the US. Apart from Dusseldorf and Miami, Genoa also faces rivals in London, Paris, Barcelona and a number of the Scandinavian countries. The decision to hold a boat show in Genoa reflects the thinking behind the creation of the fair in the mid-1950s. Building started in 1959, and the first Boat Show opened in 1962. 'With Genoa's traditions as a seaport, the original idea was to create a big event concentrating on communications, especially on a cultural level,' Mr Roberto recalls. However, early 'communications fairs' showed the concept had little commercial validity, he admits. It was a different story for the Boat Show, which gave Liguria's recreational shipbuilders a chance to show off their wares and the region's sea-loving public the opportunity to gawp and, sometimes, to buy. But while exhibiting boats turned out to be a swift success, the fair had to dream up other commercially-viable attractions. Many have fallen by the wayside, but two - Tecnhotel and Euroflora - have become established events. The first is devoted to the hotel business, while the second, held every five years, is a huge horticultural extravaganza. The success of both fairs illustrates the importance of presenting shows which have some local roots. With its huge tourist business and thousands of hotels along the Riviera, Tecnhotel fulfils a clear need. Likewise, staging Euroflora, which pulls in around 700,000 visitors for its 10-day run, is appropriate for Genoa given the Riviera's role as Italy's horticultural heart. Tecnhotel, which now has an additional fair on contract furnishing tacked on, began in 1965, while the first Euroflora was held in 1966. The most recent show, held last year, understandably had a Christopher Columbus theme, with the focus on the plants and flowers of north America, says Mr Roberto. While the Boat Show, Tecnhotel and Euroflora are Genoa's three big international events, the city also holds a variety of other, more specialised, fairs. Riabitat, held every two years, concentrates on the businesses of restoring and modernising buildings. Restoration often features as a side event at many big international building fairs. But no other city has an event devoted solely to the subject, says Mr Roberto. 'It's particularly appropriate if you think of Italy, with its historic city centres, where there is a culture of building which must last for centuries.' More recently, the fair has come up with Auto Story, a specialist exhibition of prestige and veteran cars, now in its second year. The fair has had a good reception from the public and car dealers, he says. But in a business noted for its competition, both internationally and between fairs in their own countries, Genoa will have to carry on thinking up new ideas if it is not to rely exclusively on its three big international events, one of which, after all, is only held twice a decade. The fair recognises, but may not have yet met, the challenge. Domestically, both the Milan and Bologna fairs are appreciably bigger in terms of size and prestige. Genoa ranks roughly on a par with cities such as Turin, Verona and Bari, all of which have around the same amount of space available and which all hold at least one event of international importance, as well as many other shows of more local interest. But in some ways, the priority for Genova is to hold its own, implies Mr Roberto. Surprisingly, the fair is not seen as a potential profit-maker for the city. Rather, he takes pride in the fact that it has generally managed to balance its books. Small surpluses in the past 10 years have been used to improve the facilities, with L12bn being spent on creating the marina and L8bn on modernising the congress centre. However, the L15bn investment now needed to upgrade facilities and improve essential services such as electricity and water will have to come from outside sources. 'The big profits come from big events which draw over 50,000 visitors. We don't have many of those,' Mr Roberto admits. 'Our aim is more towards providing an overall benefit towards the city.'</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Observer: Party time Monday's Conservative Winter Ball at the Grosvenor House, the party's main fund-raising event of the year, left several well-known politicians looking rather the worse for wear. But, given that the party is in hock to the tune of Pounds 19m, it was a case of all hands on deck to rouse the party faithful. So how odd to find Lord Archer no longer running the raffle. His court jester's role has gone to Gyles Brandreth whose buffoonery experience is limited to being a game show host and Tory MP for Chester.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Loyalist Tory MPs fail to win control of 1922 committee Loyalist Conservative MPs last night failed in a campaign to break rightwing control of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs and bolster Mr John Major's leadership. In elections for the 12-strong executive committee, the rightwing 92 Group held on to its nine places, in spite of strong lobbying by the loyalist Mainstream group. No Mainstream members were elected, although the group made vigorous attempts to present the vote as an opportunity for MPs to rally round the prime minister. The election will strengthen pressure on Mr Major to placate the right on issues such as Europe, public spending and reform of the welfare system. However, some MPs warned that any attempt by the right to exploit the result could provoke a rebellion by the centre-left, particularly over European policy. The only consolation for Mr Major was the defeat of Sir George Gardiner, the Thatcherite chairman of the 92 Group, and one of the most vocal critics of the Maastricht treaty. Sir George appeared to have paid the price for his outspoken criticism of the government over Maastricht, regarded by some MPs as bordering on disloyalty. He was replaced by Mr David Evans, the MP for Welwyn and Hatfield, who is seen as a member of the hard right on most issues but also professes loyalty to the prime minister. Mainstream failed to dislodge four other key targets - Sir Ivan Lawrence, Mr James Pawsey, Mr John Townend, and Sir Rhodes Boyson - who are all viewed as hard line rightwingers. Voting figures were not released by the 1922 committee, which plays a crucial role in representing backbench opinion and liaising with Downing Street. Mainstream's failure to weaken the right's hold underlines the organisational ability of the ideologically focused 92 Group. Mainstream was forced to include several rightwingers on its election slate after some members failed to agree on a centre-left list.</p>

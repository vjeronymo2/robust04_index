			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensions: how they rate - Debbie Harrison looks at the best and worst performers Millions of employees do not have access to a good company pension scheme. Thus, they should consider the most tax-efficient investment alternative - a personal pension plan. With more than 100 providers to chose from, each offering a big choice of funds, the latest survey on personal pensions from Money Management*, a sister publication of the Financial Times, provides a useful guide to two of the key features: performance and charges. The most popular personal pension investment options for consumers are the with-profits and the managed unit-linked funds. The fortunes of these different investment styles vary according to market conditions, so the choice should be based on your attitude to risk rather than the latest comparative results. With-profits funds comprise equities, fixed interest and gilts and offer certain guarantees as well as a smoothed investment return. Under a unit-linked personal pension, the performance of the units you buy with your contributions mirrors the performance of the underlying fund and is, therefore, likely to be more volatile. The managed fund usually is invested in a range of the provider's main funds. Although the tables show five-year performance, it is important to look at results over a longer period to assess consistency. Unfortunately, the survey found that there was very little consistency in with-profits results over the four periods analysed: five, 10, 15 and 20 years. Best overall were Clerical Medical, Co-operative insurance, National Mutual Life, Norwich Union, Equitable Life, Pearl, Prudential, Royal London and Wesleyan &amp; General. Figures from Axa Equity &amp; Law, Scottish Life and Sun Life, although mainly in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) and middle ranks, were each let down by a bottom quartile figure for a particular period. There is, however, more consistency when it comes to the laggards which rarely struggled out of the bottom quartile. Britannia Life, Royal Life, Guardian Assurance, National Provident and Scottish Mutual all fall into this category. Most managed unit-linked funds gave results over five years only and table 2 shows the best for this period. Several funds missed the top 10 by just a few pounds: these include Rothschild Asset Management, Equitable Life, Norwich Union and Scottish Equitable. The survey notes that Gartmore, one of the few unit trust personal pension providers, has impressive results but also is one of the highest chargers. At the bottom of the five-year ranks are Confederation Life (a good performer over 10 and 15 years), Eagle Star (Advent fund), Irish Life (but good results on single-premium investments) and Laurentian Life (consistently awful). Many people with personal pension plans invest at least part of their money in particular sectors. Looking at consistency of performance over the complete range of unit-linked funds, the top results are shown by National Mutual, Scottish Equitable, Equitable Life, Norwich Union and Scottish Amicable. At the bottom of the heap, three companies show up particularly badly in this survey: Laurentian Life, Scottish Life and Scottish Mutual. Other companies with unit-linked results that leave something to be desired include Aegon, Axa Equity &amp; Law, Barclays Life, Black Horse Life, Friends Provident, Hill Samuel, Merchant Investors, Providence Capitol, Scottish Provident, Scottish Widows and Sun Alliance. Table 3 shows the best buys in terms of good consistent performance married with low charges. 'The reason the list is so short is that most of the top performers have above-average charges . . . and low chargers have less than stunning performance,' the survey says. *Personal Pension Plans survey from Money Management, FT Business Enterprises Ltd, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2: Top unit-linked managed funds over 5 years  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                           Return (pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Gartmore Long Term                         17,492 Skandia (Perpetual fund)                   17,448 Abbey Life                                 16,803 Britannia Life                             16,777 Lincoln Natn'l (Mgd 4)                     16,678 Scottish Prov Adventrs                     16,660 Gartmore Med Term                          16,634 Prov Cap Spec Mkt                          16,472 National Mutual                            16,435 Lincoln Nat'l (Mgd 3)                      16,310  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows five-year results to December 1 1993 for a pounds200 per month policy with full commission paid to the adviser.

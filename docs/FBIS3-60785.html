In their communique, the subversives, who describe  themselves  as "prisoners of war," note: "We support, voluntarily submit  to, and endorse (...) the letters that President Gonzalo and  Comrade Miriam sent to the president of the Republic, engineer  Alberto Fujimori Fujimori."    The terrorists specifically indicate that they support "the  talks to reach a peace agreement, whose implementation involves  ending a 13-year-old war in our country."    Emphasizing their identification with Abimael Guzman's  leadership, the imprisoned Maoists stress that the Peruvian  Communist Party-Shining Path's [PCP-SL] new slogan now is:  "Struggle for a Peace Agreement!"    Apparently, it involves a group of subversives who disagree  with the leaders who have replaced Guzman and his followers  because in their communique the imprisoned Shining Path  subversives note: "The PCP wants peace and no more  provocations," hinting at the attacks that shocked our capital  during recent weeks, including a long blackout and the explosion  of car bombs.    According to police reports, Shining Path hard-liners, led  by  Oscar Ramirez Durand, Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, Teresa Duran  Araujo, and others, are opposed to surrender and, with the  assistance of those Shining Path armed units that have not been  hit and are prepared to carry out terrorist actions, pursue  their plans because "the people's war does not end with the  decision of one man; the people's war is a historic necessity  dictated by the laws of society."    Outside our country, Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea  Cahuas, who are making propaganda for the Shining Path in  Brussels and London, respectively, have said the laying down of  arms is "a hoax, a government maneuver." They stressed that the  PCP-SL will not surrender.    Arce Borja and Olaechea Cahuas based their viewpoint on some  remarks made by Abimael Guzman Reinoso in July 1988. In his  remarks, Guzman Reinoso said the talks "are just aimed at  undermining and destroying the people's war."    Shortly after Guzman's capture, the Shining Path terrorists  who replaced the arrested and killed leaders released a poster  in which they stressed that the fight would continue: "The  party's leadership may have disappeared, but the remaining  leaders must and can pursue the plans, the struggle, the  people's war. We are firmly convinced that the revolution will  not stop, will not be paralyzed."    Nevertheless, the communique issued by the Shining Path  terrorists imprisoned in Canto Grande, which apparently is a  majority group since the opinion of the rebellious group [within  the Shining Path] remains unknown, leaves the leadership that  insists on pursuing armed actions without important support.    The self-styled "Canto Grande Shining Combat Trench's  prisoners of war," including the perpetrators of the most  shocking attacks and selective crimes, stress: "We reaffirm our  highest and unconditional submission to the single leadership of  President Gonzalo and the party's central directorate."    In his letters to the president last October, Abimael Guzman  said: "Peace has been achieved to meet a people's need.  Yesterday we struggled to wage a people's war. Today, with  equal firmness and resolve, we must struggle to achieve a peace  agreement."    For several weeks, the Miguel Castro Castro Maoists had  their  doubts about the authenticity of the letters and a video in  which Guzman reads the letters while Elena Iparraguirre,  "Comrade Miriam," watches him closely.    After long discussions, however, the Miguel Castro Castro  Maoists finally reached a majority agreement and signed an  undated communique in which they decide "to close ranks in this  new period of our party's life and the contemporary Peruvian  society's life."    Miguel Castro Castro is one of our country's most  sophisticated penitentiaries. The largest group of our  country's terrorists are confined there, with the exception of  the Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno Department where top PCP-SL  leaders such as Martha Huatay Ruiz, Edmundo Cox Beuzeville,  Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Maria Pantoja, and others are confined.</p>

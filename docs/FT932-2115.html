			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Bosnia leader to be pressed on settlement: Owen sees five autonomous provinces within existing state EC FOREIGN ministers will hold talks with Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Alia Izetbegovic, in Copenhagen today as pressure mounts on the Moslems to accept Serb and Croat territorial gains in the war-ravaged republic. The talks  - which coincide with the opening-day of the EC summit  - come as the Community strives to salvage something from the wreckage of the Vance-Owen plan for a Bosnian peace settlement. Mr Izetbegovic, who asked for the meeting with EC ministers, has opposed recent Serb and Croat proposals for dividing Bosnia on ethnic lines. At an emergency meeting of EC foreign ministers last night, several EC delegations voiced objections to any EC move towards partition of Bosnia. But after the tense discussions, Lord Owen, the EC peace mediator, and Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, Denmark's foreign minister, made clear that time was running out for the Bosnian Moslems to reach a political settlement. Lord Owen said he expected new guidelines for land-swaps between the Croats, Serbs and Bosnian Moslems to be issued this week by EC leaders and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. He would put these to the presidents of Serbia and Croatia. Lord Owen acknowledged that these guidelines would be less generous to the Moslems than those under the Vance-Owen plan, which he drew up along with the former UN mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance. But he said the best the EC could do was to try to help Mr Izetbegovic by threatening economic sanctions against Croatia and tougher economic pressure on Serbia. Lord Owen presented foreign ministers with an outline map which provided for five autonomous provinces within the existing Bosnian state. The plan, which provides for some Serb withdrawals, would involve the creation of two Croat, two Moslem and one Serb province. The Moslems would need guaranteed access to the Adriatic and to the River Danube. Lord Owen said that conditions inside Bosnia were so desperate for the civilian population that there had to be a negotiated settlement. But he added: 'There has to be roll-back (of territorial gains).' Senior British officials cautioned that this plan would have to be agreed by all parties and was still in its early stages. Mr Vance, now in the US, described recent peace moves as a 'tragic mistake' that would 'end up rewarding those involved in ethnic cleansing'.</p>

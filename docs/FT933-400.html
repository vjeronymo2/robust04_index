			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Sears To be fair, Sears' top management has never pretended that the company's recovery would be rapid. A sleepy and introspective culture takes time to shift and outdated retail operations take time to overhaul. The shortage of good management throughout the retail industry makes it difficult for the company to recruit enough of the people it needs. That said, many changes have been made at lower levels within the operating companies and some of the benefits have already been felt in the partial revival of the British Shoe Corporation. Unnecessary distractions such as housebuilding, menswear and a stake in Asprey have been dealt with. Yet the company remains a sprawling empire, almost all of which still needs serious attention. The Olympus sports goods chain may face competition from out of town 'category killers' before long, but is as yet only testing its own new format. British Shoe and Freemans still need a lot of detailed work, while recently-acquired Richards lost money in the first half despite cost cuts and Selfridges continues to absorb management time. The strain shows in the way that the chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, appears to be involved in quite detailed operational decisions. While that is probably a good way for a non-retailer to get to grips with the business, it may not provide the momentum required to deal with the competitive threats and shock the organisation into a new attitude. Either Sears needs a tighter focus or Mr Strong needs some new highly-powered lieutenants on the company's main board. His desire to work with the existing structure is laudable. But the need is pressing.</p>

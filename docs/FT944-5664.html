			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): British Gas salaries defence a bit rich Sir, Clive of India defended himself from charges of greed by comparing himself with other, greedier Nabobs. Mr Giordano mounts the same defence for the directors of British Gas, but at much greater length. The principles of personnel and salary administration stop at the boardroom door, because remuneration is set by equally overpaid non-executive directors and institutional shareholders. There are many people better qualified and at least as able receiving a tenth of the salary and few other benefits. If directors feel underpaid, they should put themselves on the open market, and make room for new blood. Derek H Broome, Potters' End, 52 Wellingborough Road, Mears Abbey, Northampton NN6 0DZ</p>

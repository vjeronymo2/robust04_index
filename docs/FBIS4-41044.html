			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev met  with foreign diplomats and representatives of foreign missions  accredited in Almaty. Talking to them he stressed the  irreversibility of democratic transformations and economic  reforms in the Republic. The program on lifting the country's  economy out of crisis, highlighted by Nursultan Nazarbayev's  recent address to parliament, will give new impetus to this.  The main purpose of the program is to preserve and strengthen  interethnic accord in the Republic. At present, Kazakhstan is  known for its essential contribution to ensuring peace,  security, and stability. "With great pleasure I would like to  express gratitude for your valuable role in creating a favorable  political environment around Kazakhstan," Kanat Saudabayev said.    Bertrand Fessard de Foucault, the French ambassador to  Kazakhstan, spoke in reply on behalf of the diplomatic missions.  He said that this is the first meeting of foreign diplomats  with Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev since the day Kazakhstan  obtained its independence. "Each of my colleagues is working in  Kazakhstan under the extraordinary conditions of the  transitional period and a huge friendly interest in your  country," he said. He assured that the diplomatic corps will  continue to support Kazakhstan's efforts aimed at national  unity, social progress, and economic development.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section has been changed to provide that an eligible institution may not contract with an ineligible institution for the latter to provide any portion of an educational program if the ineligible institution had ever been terminated from participation in the title IV, HEA programs, or had ever withdrawn from such participation while under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar type proceeding initiated by a State licensing agency, accrediting agency, guaranty agency, or the Department of Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.30&blank;Institutional Notification Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A substantial number of institutions are structured as, or owned by, partnerships or limited partnerships. Customarily, the governance of a partnership is vested in the ``general partners'' rather than in a ``board of directors,'' and the management is under the control of one or more of the general partners rather than under an ``executive officer.'' Accordingly, the term ``a general partner'' is added to &sect;600.30(a)(7)(iv) to clarify that the Secretary considers a person who is a general partner to be exercising substantial control over the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.31&blank;Change of Ownership Resulting in a Change in Control <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make the sale conditional upon securing the Department of Education's certification for the institution under the new ownership. The regulation has been changed to provide that the Secretary will review an application filed with respect to a transfer that is subject to any contingency, provided that the sale was otherwise completed. A transfer that is otherwise final is considered completed even if the seller retains a security interest in the institution or its assets to assure satisfaction of payment of the purchase price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA provides that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family member or to a current owner may be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected transfers of control that would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution owned by a closely-held corporation. The regulation is changed to adopt the same description of the family of the owner as that used in &sect;600.30(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation is modified to state that a change of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation occurs when a person who holds or acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation acquires or relinquishes control of 50 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a change of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely held, the regulation treats as a change of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock of the corporation, or the right under a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual control. Conversely, relinquishing that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation clarifies that a change from a taxable to a tax-exempt entity that qualifies under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vice versa,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> constitutes a change of ownership and control under this section of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.32&blank;Eligibility of Additional Locations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.32 has been revised to clarify that the provisions of &sect;&sect;600.8 and 600.10 also apply to the eligibility of additional locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.40&blank;Loss of Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The loss of eligibility because of a violation of the 85 percent rule was discussed earlier in connection with &sect;600.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 546 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.2.&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Branch Campus <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nearly all commenters confused the definition of the term ``branch campus'' with the provisions governing additional locations. One commenter asked whether an institution's branch campus could be located in a foreign country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary defined the term ``branch campus'' narrowly in the NPRM and in this final regulation to enable institutions to expand to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses without having to undergo a full certification review. Under section 498(j) of the HEA, as amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs, a branch campus must be certified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary under the provisions of subpart 3 of part H of title IV of the HEA. Thus, it must separately meet all of the applicable requirements for participation contained in the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668. Because a full certification review is a complicated and lengthy process, the Secretary believes that a broad definition of branch campus would capture numerous off-campus sites of institutions and would seriously deter institutions from expanding to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses. The narrow definition avoids this adverse impact. Instead, additional locations of an institution will not necessarily be treated as branch campuses and thus will be subject to more moderate provisions elsewhere in this part, including in &sect;600.32.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A branch campus located in a foreign country may not qualify as an eligible branch campus under the HEA because one of the statutory requirements for eligibility (other than for purposes of the Federal Family Education Loan programs) is that the branch be located in a State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Correspondence Course <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggested that the Secretary classify a course offered partly by correspondence and partly in residential training as a correspondence course only if the course is more than 50 percent correspondence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary indicated that a program that is part correspondence and part residential is considered to be a correspondence program because ``This straightforward interpretation eliminates the need for the Secretary to address all the troublesome issues involving the quantity of education that an institution claims to provide in a correspondence program.'' The Secretary is still of that view. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

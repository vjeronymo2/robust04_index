			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-INCOME FAMILIES FACE RELOCATION IF SHELTER OKD  </P> <P> James and Scherry Moore know what it's like to be homeless. Evicted from their  Oxnard apartment, they spent four years living in an 18-foot camper, seeking  refuge in state parks and struggling to feed their three children from  on-again, off-again work in Ventura oil fields.  </P> <P> Without the Social Security checks their 8-year-old son received in 1986 after  undergoing complicated heart surgery, there would have been no way for the  family to finally leave their camper and return to apartment life.  </P> <P> The old De Anza Hotel on Ventura Avenue turned out to be far from luxury  quarters and today, at $550 for a one-bedroom apartment, not all that  inexpensive. But it represented stability for the Moores, who soon learned that  Scherry was suffering from cancer.  </P> <P> That's why this hard-luck family cannot understand why anyone would want to  force them from their refuge to convert the building into a shelter for the  homeless. Even though they and the other low-income residents of the De Anza's  14 units have been told that they will be compensated, the idea strikes Scherry  Moore as painfully ironic.  </P> <P> "I finally got my house and my home and my life as I want it," she said,  sitting in a living room decorated with Easter bunnies, inspirational sayings  and a rifle propped in the corner. "Now they're kicking us out to make room for  the homeless? That's a dirty deal."  </P> <P> But for two nonprofit agencies, each with more than a decade of serving Ventura  County's poor, it is an ambitious plan that will ultimately benefit people such  as the Moores.  </P> <P> Project Understanding and Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. have launched  efforts to raise $1.7 million to buy the hotel and use it to shelter the  growing number of families joining the ranks of the county's estimated 2,000  homeless people.  </P> <P> The project -- which faces daunting economic hurdles, public hearings and  scrutiny from city officials before it can be approved -- envisions the top two  floors of the three-story building divided into 21 rooms with a total of 84  beds. The first floor would become a center for social service agencies.  </P> <P> Present residents would receive about $4,800 in relocation compensation per  apartment, which leaders of the two agencies say would probably be sufficient  to land them in at least equal, if not much improved, living conditions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tide of Gentrification  </P> <P> And in the process, both Project Understanding and Cabrillo hope that the  shelter will help slow the tide of gentrification that is sweeping the Ventura  Avenue area. Any other buyer of the building, they say, would probably raise  rents and drive out most residents anyway.  </P> <P> "Even though it's unfortunate that we have to displace a few families, in the  long run it will be a benefit to the avenue as a whole," said Rodney Fernandez,  executive director of Cabrillo, which has built several housing projects for  low-income farm workers. "We're trying to make a statement with this project."  </P> <P> The project's fate, however, could depend almost entirely on how the Ventura  City Council chooses to divvy up $238,000 in funds that have been earmarked to  help the homeless.  </P> <P> The De Anza shelter is one of four proposals being considered by city  officials. Without a large chunk of the money, it would be nearly impossible to  get the state and federal funds necessary to buy the $855,000 building and to  pay for the extensive earthquake-proofing it requires, Fernandez said.  </P> <P> But Councilman Don Villeneuve, a member of the city's affordable housing  subcommittee, which is preparing to make a recommendation on spending the  money, said it was unrealistic for Project Understanding or Cabrillo to expect  a hefty grant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Other Good Proposals'  </P> <P> "There's so many ifs and uncertainties about their project that I don't see any  way the city is going to kick in the whole $238,000 on the outside possibility  they can pull this together," he said. "There's other good proposals out there  too."  </P> <P> Even though the shelter has yet to be funded, residents have found little  solace.  </P> <P> "We're already overrun with transients now, and they want to bring in more?"  said Lady Blue, owner of the Ventura Tattoo Studio, one of four commercial  spaces that would have to be relocated from the first floor of the building.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's fair. I have a good clientele, not your typical tattoo shop  trash. We're all here trying very hard to lead respectable lives," she said.  </P> <P> Andy Pompa, who has run his Imperial Upholstery shop in the building for 18  years, agreed. "This building is going to be a white elephant," he said. "It's  foolish."  </P> <P> Although leaders of the two agencies conceded that it would be preferable to  construct such a project without displacing anybody, they said the high cost of  real estate and strict zoning requirements left them with few options.  </P> <P> "We realize these are real people and they have real concerns," said Thomas G.  Buford, an attorney representing Cabrillo. "But you're never going to find a  site where no one is inconvenienced and no one objects in this day and age."  </P></p>

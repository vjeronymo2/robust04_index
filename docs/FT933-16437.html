			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Proposal to take Nu-Swift private as profits decline MR JACQUES Murray, the chairman and majority shareholder in Nu-Swift, is seeking take the fire protection, office cleaning and property group private through a share buy-out bid. The privatisation proposal was revealed yesterday as Nu-Swift reported sharply lower pre-tax profits for last year mainly reflecting a decrease in valuation of the group's investment property portfolio. Mr Murray owns a 66 per cent stake in Nu-Swift through European Fire Protection, while Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT holds 22.8 per cent of the Yorkshire-based group which is quoted on the USM. The shares closed 25p lower at 333p valuing the group at Pounds 123.9m and the stake Mr Murray does not own at Pounds 42.5m. Mr Murray said that following discussions between EFP and ADT, the board had decided to appoint an independent financial adviser 'to advise on a proposal whereby all shareholders other than EFP and ADT would be offered cash and/or loan notes in consideration for their shares.' At the same time he said ADT would receive cash, loan notes and property assets, up to an equivalent value, for its stake in Nu-Swift. He added that 'shareholders will be kept informed as these discussions proceed.' Because of the discussions Mr Murray said Nu-Swift would not be paying a dividend in respect of 1992 since the associated advance corporation tax would not be recoverable in the foreseeable future and consequently the net asset value of the group would be reduced by more than the dividend amount - 20p was paid for 1991. Pre-tax profits for 1992 fell from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 14.1m on turnover which slipped to Pounds 318.6m (Pounds 326.5m). Mr Murray noted that 1992 had been 'a year of consolidation for the group with only minor investment activity.' The group's service business activities, then comprising the European fire protection division and the American office cleaning and maintenance division which was sold at the start of June, continued to make 'substantial' profits despite the recessions in both the UK and the US. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 16.1m resulted from the sale of National Cleaning.</p>

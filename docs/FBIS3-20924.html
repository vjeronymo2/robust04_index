			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Dassault Systems Announces CAA Development </F> Agreement With Australia's Moldflow"]    [Text] Moldflow and Dassault Systems have announced their  CAA (CATIA [Computer-Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive  Applications] Application Architecture) development agreement.  The two companies will integrate their engineering design and  analysis products so as to offer CATIA users a complete analysis  system for injection-formed plastic parts. The interface between  CATIA and Moldflow makes it possible to analyze the flow of  material during the injection and cooling of the part, monitor  surface effects and weld lines, check shrinkage, and so on. The  part is designed and meshed by CATIA before being subjected to  Moldflow's specialized problem solvers. The analysis results are  then displayed using CATIA's postprocessor. The development  agreement provides the first solution for analyzing and  simulating plastic injection in complete integration with CATIA,  according to Francis Bernard, general manager of Dassault  Systems. It also makes it possible to "optimize the design of  injected plastic parts by simplifying the design process and  reducing analysis times." Moldflow Proprietary, Ltd.,  established in 1978 and now the world leader in the plastics  analysis market, develops and markets computer-aided engineering  software specifically for the molded-plastics injection market.  That technology, consisting of a combination of software and  design concepts, has literally revolutionized the design of  parts and moldings all over the world. The firm's headquarters  are in Melbourne, Australia, with subsidiaries in Great Britain,  Germany, Korea, China, and the United States employing about 100  people.

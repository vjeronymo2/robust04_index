			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Swiss franc depreciation trims growth in Zurich - Equities have had a good start The Swiss are early risers. That admirable trait may help explain why the Swiss stock market has been extraordinarily lively early in the year for the second year in a row, in spite of an economic backdrop which is as dreary as a foggy winter morning in Zurich. The SMI index of leading shares leapt out of the starting gate on January 1 at 1,670.1 and dashed to 1,840.6 by the end of February, a handsome rise of about 10 per cent. 'The targets we set for the end of June have already been met,' Mr Sylvan Trachsler, head of research at Union Bank of Switzerland, says. The question that torments him and other analysts is whether that is it. Will the rest of 1992 turn out to be as dull as was the rest of 1991? Mr Trachsler, for one, has opted for caution, seeing the market 'more or less going sideways' for the next few months. This is a view shared by Michel Petitpierre, head of Swiss research at Pictet &amp; Co, although he is calling for 'a slight correction' because of the recent setback in the government's monetary policy. Mr Bernard Tschanz, head of Swiss equity research at Credit Suisse, is slightly more optimistic, seeing the SMI at 1,900 by mid-year and 1,950 by year end. Most analysts are agreed that the main prop for the market in January and February was the expectation that interest rates were going to drop sharply following indications that inflation in Switzerland was declining. 'People got a bit too excited about it,' an analyst at James Capel says. Among them was the Swiss National Bank which declined to follow Germany's official interest rate rises in December. Perhaps it thought that Switzerland could still play on its reputation as a stable haven for capital, but that era seems to have passed. In January and February, the Swiss franc declined sharply against the Deutschmark and this month the SNB intervened to stop the fall, nudging up interest rates. The likelihood is that the lingering gap between Swiss and German bond yields has become a risk factor for the equity market, rather than a bull point. Financial shares have been the main victims of the interest rate rises. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, jumped from SFr1,755 at the beginning of the year to SFr2,070 at the end of February, but have since fallen back to SFr1,970. Zurich Insurance bearers went from SFr4,320 to SFr4,620 and back to SFr4,230 over the same period. The negative effects have probably been limited by indications of very strong profit gains in 1991. The big three banks all reported record 1991 profits and analysts are confident that the big three chemical and pharmaceutical companies, which will be reporting results next week, will also do well. The rush of announcements of stock splits and other moves to make companies more investor friendly has also contributed to the market's strength. Mr Tschanz says it has been the most important factor in the first two months, and it will continue to have a big influence in the short term. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict when and how these announcements are going to affect individual shares or the market as a whole, perhaps because, as another analyst observes, the Swiss market suffers from a relatively uneven diffusion of information. The tendency of Swiss companies to do more to please international investors has been apparent for several years, and it was widely known that this would get a big boost this year following modifications to the companies law, facilitating share splits and forcing simplification of capital structures. Some companies, such as Nestle, made clear several months ago their intention to split their shares as soon as they could. Yet Nestle shares reacted sharply to a newspaper article in January rehearsing this point. Holzstoff shares rose on the announcement of a capital restructuring. Its bearers were at SFr5,050 before the announcement and now stand at SFr5,300. But Alusuisse shares did not. In the Holzstoff case, the action was especially radical, with restrictions on foreign ownership coming off, a single class of shares being established and a 10-for-one share split proposed. Also, group 1991 earnings were up 22 per cent and the dividend was raised. One analyst said the shares were now very attractive, combining little downside risk with a possibility of becoming a takeover target. In some cases, significant gaps still exist between the prices of shares and participation certificates of companies which are expected to announce capital restructuring. This, according to Mr Trachsler, offers speculative opportunities, notably in the PCs of Helvetia and the cable maker, Cortaillod. Whatever impact these moves have had so far, there could be further effects after July 1 when the splits will actually be carried out and it becomes easier for small investors to buy many Swiss shares. However, by then, the current squeeze on interest rates may also have eased, bringing other stimuli to the market. Mr Tschanz is looking for another year of strong profit growth - 15 per cent compared with 21 per cent last year. That would indicate that the market is on a prospective price-earnings ratio of 12.7. 'It is not cheap, but it is not expensive,' he says.</p>

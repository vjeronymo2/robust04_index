			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where tradition still plays its part - Investment Trusts / Philip Coggan finds the old and the new in tandem at Merchants THERE IS a strong sense of tradition about the Merchants Trust. It was founded in 1889 with some famous City names on the original board including a Baring, a Benson and a Hambro. Price Waterhouse was appointed auditor at launch, and remains in that role. As with many other 19th century trusts, the original idea was to invest in overseas fixed-interest securities which offered a higher yield than anything available in the UK. Over the years, Merchants moved gradually into equity investments. In 1984, it switched from being an international generalist, to its present strategy of providing 'an above-average level of income and income growth together with long-term growth of capital.' At the time, many trusts were seeking to differentiate themselves so they could justify their continued existence. The change in aims is illustrated amply by the details of Merchants' geographical spread. In January 1984, just 47.2 per cent of the portfolio was in the UK, with 37.5 per cent in north America and the rest in the Far East and Europe. By end-January 1993, the UK portion made up 99.1 per cent of the portfolio with the rump in US unquoted stocks (which are being sold off gradually). This switch to the domestic market has, of course, been of immense help in allowing the trust to increase its dividend from 2.4p in 1983/4 to 10.6p in 1992/3. UK equities traditionally offer a higher dividend yield than that obtained by overseas markets - and the 1980s also saw strong dividend growth in the UK. Although the 1990s have seen many cuts in corporate dividends, the trust says it has built up revenue reserves high enough to see out the storm. According to manager Nigel Lanning, Merchants could pay out half last year's dividend from these. Lanning says the investment policy follows a yield discipline, with shares being bought on high yields and low price-earnings ratios and sold if the yield falls or the p/e rises too far. This philosophy is remarkably akin to that of David Hopkinson, a former investment guru at M&amp;G - who just happens to be one of the directors. Such a strategy worked very well in the 1980s but struggled during 1991 and 1992. The net asset value of the trust rose just 4.3 per cent over the three years from end-January 1990 to end January 1993. During the recession, high yield once more became synonymous with high risk. But since the pound left the exchange rate mechanism in September, lower interest rates and the prospect of economic recovery have revived the high-yielding sector. The yield on the trust is now 5.6 per cent which, says Merchants, is the highest of its direct competitors (although Finstat's list of the UK income growth sector puts the packaged units of M&amp;G income ahead, at 6.2). But Lanning says it is able to offer this return without straying into the wilder fringes of the high-yield sector. The trust receives some boost to its income from around Pounds 10.6m of fixed-interest stock; it also has fixed-interest debt, namely, some Pounds 25m of stepped-rate loans. The 10 biggest stocks in the portfolio at end-January include many names familiar to private investors: BAT, British Gas, BT, National Westminster, Shell, Eastern Electricity, North West Water, Prudential, Great Universal Stores and Allied-Lyons. The high yield has been successful in attracting private investors, who now own more than 50 per cent of Merchants. Accordingly, the discount has narrowed, and the trust now trades virtually at asset value, so investors are at risk from a return to the the days of wide discounts. Merchants' record in its sector is moderate, with Finstat showing it as below average over one, two and three years. It is fourth (out of 10) in the sector over seven years, with growth of 163.6 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income re-invested). But, as the graph shows, the trust has marginally outperformed the All-Share over a 10-year period. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says: 'I have never been particularly concerned or particularly excited by the trust's management style. It is a steady fund which has been successful at attracting private investors because of its high yield. But we are not going to see the same kind of dividend growth as we did in the 1980s.' Key facts Gross assets of the trust are Pounds 280m and net assets Pounds 250m. NatWest Securities estimated the net asset per share at 238.2p on April 6, putting the shares, then 237p, on a discount of 0.5 per cent. The dividend yield was 5.6 per cent. The management fee is 0.35 cent per annum of assets, minus current liabilities and short-term loans. Board Merchants has a remarkably high-powered board. Non-executive directors are Sir John Banham, former director-general of the CBI; Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ; David Hopkinson, former managing director of M&amp;G Group; Sir Thomas Risk, a former governor of the Bank of Scotland; and Sir Anthony Tuke, former chairman of Barclays Bank. Colin Black, the chairman of Scottish Widows, is about to take over as chairman from Robert Henderson, who is retiring. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds 250 for lump sums. Investments of more than Pounds 1,000 will be dealt-with on the following day. There is an 0.5 per cent dealing charge and 0.5 per cent for stamp duty. The personal equity plan has a 3.5 per cent initial charge (2.5 per cent for existing investors in the trust) and a 1 per cent annual charge. The minimum investment is Pounds 6,000 (or Pounds 3,000 if the allowance is split between two Kleinwort trusts). This is the last article about conventional investment trusts. A round-up of the series will appear next week with the first in a new series on split capital trusts.</p>

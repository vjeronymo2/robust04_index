			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Roof work safety to be probed THE HEALTH and Safety Executive yesterday announced a national inspection blitz on the roofing industry. The industry accounts for one in five construction deaths. Sir John Cullen, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, the executive's ruling body, said: 'Roof work is big business and attracts more than its fair share of the 'get-rich-quick' brigade.' He said 109 roof workers had died and 1,500 had been seriously injured in the past three years. Many accidents could have been prevented by simple safety precautions. The HSE estimates there are more than 7,000 roofing contractors employing about 30,000 workers. It expects its 800 inspectors to see more than 1,000 sites. No extra resources will be made available to its inspectorate. The inspectors will start their campaign in May. Companies in breach of regulations will be forced to stop work until they comply. Flagrant and serious breaches of the law will result in prosecution. Mr Paul Davies, head of HSE's Construction National Industry Group, said almost three quarters of roof workers were with companies employing three people or fewer. The executive said the cost of safety equipment for a typical domestic roofing job was about Pounds 400. Unions are sceptical of the campaign because of the lack of extra resources. They said it would divert resources from the HSE's normal work, jeopardising workers in other industries, or fail to deliver improved standards in roof safety.</p>

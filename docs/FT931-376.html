			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Microsoft launches upgraded PC system MICROSOFT today launches a new version of MS-DOS, the operating system program used by an estimated 130m personal computer users. The success of MS-DOS, which controls the basic functions of PC's based on Intel microprocessors, has made Microsoft the world's largest PC software supplier. Mr Bill Gates, the US company's founder and chairman, will formally introduce MS-DOS Version 6 in San Francisco at an event to be broadcast to PC users throughout the US. Over 400 PC manufacturers will begin shipping computers loaded with the new software this week, Microsoft said. Computer users may switch to Dos 6 by purchasing a Dollars 50 upgrade program. Microsoft is said to be planning a Dollars 7m publicity campaign. Analysts estimate that about 6 per cent of PC users will upgrade to MS-Dos 6, generating revenues of Dollars 300m for Microsoft, including up to Dollars 20m in pre-launch shipments and Dollars 100m in its fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30. MS-Dos 6 incorporates several functions that are sold separately in programs offered by Microsoft competitors. For example, it offers data compression, which nearly doubles the amount of information that can be stored on computer disks, along with better memory management, data back-up, and protection from computer viruses and accidental erasure of data. The introduction of MS-Dos 6 poses a challenge to companies such as Symantec and Central Point Software that offer add-on utility programs providing similar functions. As more utilities are built into the operating system, suppliers of competing stand-alone products will be able to charge less for their software, analysts said. The US retail price for MS-Dos 6 will be Dollars 49.95 to May 31 and Dollars 129.95 thereafter.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Malaysians find gambling the best bet - Companies are using the sector as a haven from recession Every day an average of 12,000 people crowd into the Genting Highlands casino complex in the hills above Kuala Lumpur. Some are locals. About 20 per cent have driven up from Singapore. Many have come from as far away as Taiwan and Indonesia. Gaming is big business in Malaysia, accounting for as much as 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Sector turnover in 1993 is estimated at MDollars 4bn (Dollars 1.55bn), with an additional MDollars 10bn thought to have flowed through the illegal, unlicensed market. Some of the country's biggest and most profitable companies derive the bulk of their revenues from gaming. Gaming related companies account for about 10 per cent of the Kuala Lumpur stock market's total capitalisation. When the Kuala Lumpur stock market took off last year, gaming related shares were among the most heavily traded by Malaysia's eager punters, with the sector rising 180 per cent in the 12 months. Average earnings in the sector rose by more than 20 per cent in 1993. Many gaming orientated companies are starting to use their considerable financial resources to diversify into other areas. Some are going international. The Genting group is the largest gaming associated company in Malaysia. It has plantations and interests in rubber manufacturing, but the bulk of earnings come from gaming. Last year its profits rose 38 per cent to MDollars 959m. The group's separately listed gaming and leisure arm - Resorts World, which has a casino and entertainment complex outside Kuala Lumpur - is Malaysia's fourth largest listed company with a market value of nearly MDollars 17bn. Genting itself ranks number five. Analysts estimate that Genting now has cash assets of MDollars 1.5bn. 'Its main problem seems to be searching out investment opportunities and making its accumulated holdings work,' says a Kuala Lumpur broker. Last year Genting spent MDollars 150m on a 6 per cent stake in Lonrho, the UK conglomerate. It is now believed to have sold the majority of that stake. Genting is controlled by the family of Mr Lim Goh Tong, a Malaysian Chinese financier. Recently Mr Lim has taken controlling stakes in a MDollars 1bn paper mill outside Kuala Lumpur and in an adjacent 740MW power plant being built in partnership with British Gas as part of Malaysia's independent power producer programme. The diversification is for both financial and political reasons. Gaming, although big business in Malaysia, is also an extremely sensitive area of activity. Malays, who make up about 50 per cent of Malaysia's population, are Moslems. In Islam, gambling is unlawful. No Malays are allowed to enter the Genting casino complex. The word gambling is never mentioned in official company literature. Genting and other gaming companies are dependent on government goodwill for their operating licences. Political connections are vital: it is also important to invest in projects seen as important to Malaysia's overall economic development. Tanjong, Magnum and Berjaya are the three other stock market listed companies which dominate the gaming sector. A total of 1,600 retail outlets throughout Malaysia deal in variations of the numbers forecasting game, a form of gambling which came to Malaysia from southern China. In spite of a recent rise in gaming tax to 7 per cent, gambling still chalks up big corporate profits. Magnum, the biggest numbers operator with a 40 per cent market share, made pre-tax profits of MDollars 416m in 1993 compared with MDollars 310m a year earlier. Magnum and Berjaya are venturing into gaming operations overseas, with limited success. However Berjaya has won lottery management contracts in a number of Chinese cities. Berjaya has also taken an interest in a casino operation in Argentina. Tanjong, listed in both Kuala Lumpur and London, is moving aggressively into other ventures. Controlled by Mr Ananda Krishnan, a Malaysian Indian, Tanjong last year expressed interest in buying William Hill, the UK betting shops chain. 'We are definitely making moves to go international,' says Mr Ralph Marshall, a senior Tanjong executive. 'William Hill was one of the opportunities that we looked at.' Tanjong runs Malaysia's racing tote system. Through Tanjong's part ownership of the former turf club grounds in central Kuala Lumpur, companies associated with Mr Ananda are developing a new city centre at a cost of MDollars 5bn. Other companies associated with Mr Ananda are involved in a multi-million dollar sat-ellite telecommunications programme. 'There is no better business to be in in Malaysia than gaming, ' says a Kuala Lumpur industrialist. 'Gambling is the great sport of the Chinese (who make up about 35 per cent of Malaysia's 19m population) and appears to be recession proof.'</p>

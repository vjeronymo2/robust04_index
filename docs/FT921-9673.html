			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Time Warner reduces loss for year to Dollars 99m TIME WARNER, the large US media and entertainment group, more than halved its net loss, from Dollars 227m in 1990 to Dollars 99m for the whole of 1991. The improved figure was partly attributable to lower debt servicing, thanks to a Dollars 2.6bn rights issue last year that reduced total debt to Dollars 8.7bn. The company, which had almost unchanged operating profits of Dollars 2.26bn for 1991, recorded a Dollars 9.60 loss per common share in 1991. This followed payments of dividends on preferred stock issued in January 1990 as part of the merger between Time and Warner. This loss per share - against a Dollars 13.67 loss per share in 1990 - translated into a deficit of Dollars 692m following the preferred dividend payout. Revenues for the whole of 1991 were Dollars 12bn, up from Dollars 11.5bn in 1990. Operating income from publishing, which includes Time magazine, dropped to Dollars 246m in 1991, from Dollars 366m in 1990. The other four divisions - music, filmed entertainment, Home Box Office (HBO) television programming and the cable business - all recorded higher operating profit last year. Time Warner said it had Dollars 45m of net income in the last quarter of 1991, compared with a Dollars 34m loss last time. Mr Steven Ross, chairman, said this was the first time since the merger of Time and Warner that net profits had been achieved for the quarter. Fourth-quarter 1991 revenues were Dollars 3.4bn, against Dollars 3.3bn in the last quarter of 1990. The loss per common share after preferred stock dividend payments was Dollars 1.16, against a Dollars 3.08 loss per share in the last quarter of 1990, which translates into a Dollars 107m loss, down from Dollars 177m. The publishing division was affected by declines in advertising revenues and a Dollars 60m restructuring charge.</p>

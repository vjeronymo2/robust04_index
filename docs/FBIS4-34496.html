			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 Jun (EFE) -- Today, a U.S. Coast  Guard vessel intercepted a Haitian vessel transporting food and  textiles from Miami to the Haitian northern coast, sources from  the Dominican Republic's Defense Ministry told EFE.    The boat, named "Roxanna," with registration number  AK212-212, was intercepted in front of the Dominican Port of  Manzanillo, close to the Haitian border, in the Dominican  Republic's northwestern region. The vessel was delivered to the  Dominican Navy at the Puerto Plata dock in the Dominican  Atlantic Coast, where two other Haitian vessels are being held.    The ship was transporting wheat flour, vegetable oil, rice,  other food products, and some textiles. The crew members -- the  exact number was not specified -- are being interrogated in  Puerto Plata by Dominican authorities, who have strengthened the  embargo -- on the economy, oil, and weapons -- declared in a UN  resolution to force the Haitian military leaders to surrender  power and to permit the return of deposed President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kluge Boosts Stake in Orion: Struggling Orion Pictures received a boost as  majority shareholder Metromedia Co., controlled by billionaire John Kluge,  increased its stake to 80% from 70%.  </P> <P> Orion, battered by a string of duds at the box office, said Metromedia had  exercised warrants to buy slightly more than 4.3 million shares of common stock  at $6 a share. The transaction will give Orion, which lost $2.5 million on  revenue of $110 million in its first quarter, a $25-million cash infusion.  Orion's stock rose 37.5 cents to $9.875 a share on the NYSE.  </P></p>

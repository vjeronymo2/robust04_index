			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Managers at Brent Walker bid for brewery and pubs MANAGEMENT at Brent Walker, the heavily-borrowed leisure group, yesterday offered to buy out the company's brewing operations and several pubs. Mr Alistair Arkley, the managing director of Brent Walker Brewing and Trading and leader of the buy-out team, said it was hoped that 'the company will view favourably this firm offer against other options which it is understood to be considering'. Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group, said last week that it had been discussing a possible deal with Brent Walker. One suggestion was that Allied could agree to supply Brent Walker's 1,122 pubs, putting extra volume through its own six breweries. Such a move might involve the closure of Brent Walker's Camerons brewery in Hartlepool, which employs a staff of 400. Union representatives from the brewery yesterday delivered a petition against such a move, signed by 20,000 Hartlepool residents, to the company. Camerons' main beer brand, Strongarm, is sold mainly in the Teesside area. Mr Arkley said yesterday that his buy-out team, which includes the division's finance, production and commercial directors and is being advised by accountants, Price Waterhouse, had secured support from several banks and institutions. An 'indicative offer' had been made to Brent Walker for the brewery and several pubs in the locality. The team is awaiting further negotiations. The buy-out team declined to reveal the value of the offer. Brent Walker, which is due to publish its 1990 accounts next month, is working with its bankers on a restructuring of liabilities. The leisure group must raise cash and prune operations to service its Pounds 1.4bn debt. It has been discussing the sale of various assets for some time. There have been reports that some bankers are pressing for the sale of the William Hill betting shops chain. Brent Walker still owes Pounds 50m on the Pounds 615m purchase price from Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks, food and retailing group. Brent Walker's board has been restructured since the group ran into difficulties. Lord Kindersley became non-executive chairman in January, and Mr Nicholas Ward, former chairman and chief executive of the healthcare group, Macarthy, was appointed group managing director.

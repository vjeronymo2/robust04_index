			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An alliance of nationalist groups in Tatarstan in a  letter to the Central Election Commission in Moscow on Monday  have protested against yesterday's elections to the Federal  Assembly in the republic. They described the vote as  unconstitutional and as a gross violation of human rights and  the Tatars' right to self-determination. "The election has  brought the republic on the brink of civil war", it says.    Leaders of the umbrella organization including the Tatar  Public Center, Ittifak Party and Azatlyk Youth Movement are  challenging the voting results because of what they saw as a ban  on opposition meetings and rallies in the election campaign.  The letter speaks of a government-sponsored campaign of  intimidation and threats of dismissals and non-payment of wages  in urban areas and withdrawal of subsidies in the countryside.    They accused the government of imposing censorship of the  mass media and barring representatives of the nationalist groups  from monitoring the election.    The authors of the letter say they have appealed for  international inquiry into the legitimacy of federal elections  in Tatarstan and an anti-democratic environment in which they  were held.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- If voters allow, the  national, Christian parties may make back some of their losses  in the second round of voting on May 29, Laszlo Surjan, chairman  of the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), said after  his party's board took two sessions on Monday and Tuesday to  assess the situation.    Surjan could imagine voters either becoming discouraged by  the second round or realising they still have some political  leverage. For this reason, the KDNP gives priority to mobilising  voters and making them aware of their responsibility, he said.    KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga told MTI that the  Christian  Democrats have not yet coordinated second-round cooperation with  any party. On Tuesday, they held an informal consultation with  Hungarian Democratic Forum leaders. Varga added that the KDNP  Executive Committee would decide tomorrow under which terms the  party would be prepared to make an electoral deal for the second  round.</p>

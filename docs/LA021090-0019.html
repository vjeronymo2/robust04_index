			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO APPRECIATE LEGENDS WHO ARE LEFT  </P> <P> How dare there be disappointment that Bill Shoemaker didn't win his final race.  </P> <P> How dare there be catcalls for winning jockey Eddie Delahoussaye.  </P> <P> Shoemaker is enough of a man to have been outraged and embarrassed if the other  riders had let him win, and Delahoussaye was only one of three who beat the  Shoe. It doesn't lessen Shoemaker's accomplishments at all.  </P> <P> PATTI GARRITY, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

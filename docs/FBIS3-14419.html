Also taking part in the meeting at the Prime Minister's Office  were Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Environment Minister  Yosi Sarid. Steve Linde has the details.    The Israeli delegation returned home this morning carrying a  draft agreement on security arrangements in Hebron which they  presented to the prime minister. Chief Palestinian negotiator  Nabil Sha'th said the proposal worked out in a 14-hour  negotiating session in Cairo needed the approval of the PLO and  Israeli leaderships. The details have not been disclosed but the  security package apparently includes plans for lightly armed  foreign observers, probably from Norway, and Palestinian police  in Hebron. Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said  significant progress was made in Cairo but several issues remain  to be settled. The head of the Israeli team, Major General  Amnon Shahaq, said the negotiations would resume in Cairo on  Tuesday. Shahaq and Sha'th would not elaborate but reporters in  Cairo said they were both upbeat, laughing and joking before the  Israeli team headed home for the Passover holiday.    An Israeli source said the differences between the two sides  were mainly on numbers, of both foreign observers and  Palestinian police. The source said Israel would agree to  several dozen Palestinian police employed by the Hebron  municipality and connected to the police force in Gaza and  Jericho; but, the Israeli Army would have ultimate  responsibility for security.    Terry Larsen, the Norwegian envoy, confirmed that the  stationing of observers from his country was being negotiated.  When asked about early reports of a 1,000 observers, he said:  take away one zero, presumably meaning 100.    Israeli sources say both the Norwegians and the Palestinian  police would be armed with pistols for self-defense. Sources in  Jerusalem say once the final details for security in Hebron are  agreed, Israel and the PLO will announce the resumption of talks  on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Firefighters set to hold strike ballot THE FIRE BRIGADE union moved nearer industrial action by its 50,000 members yesterday when its delegate conference overwhelmingly rejected a 1.5 per cent pay offer from local government employers. Mr Ken Cameron, the union's general-secretary, said that if the employers did not honour the 15-year-old fire-fighter's pay formula that links their pay to the upper quartile of male manual workers' earnings then a strike ballot would be called. The two sides are due to meet on September 24. The employers have told the union it will honour the pay formula in 1994 but cannot do so this year because they must abide by the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit that expires in November. However Mr Cameron said: 'We are not interested in jam tomorrow while our pay agreement is unilaterally ripped up today.' Delegates at yesterday's conference rejected the 1.5 per cent offer from employers by 37,563 votes to 4,994. A minority of delegates were keen to hold a strike ballot at once. Mr Cameron said that if the September meeting failed to achieve what the union wanted, a strike ballot of the members would be called three days later. The result of a ballot would be announced on November 1. If the vote is for industrial conflict this would start after the seven-day legal cooling off period. Union leaders will meet Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, on October 13 to express their concerns. Employers yesterday pointed out that for this year alone there might be a 'small difference' between what the formula said and what the authorities can pay.</p>

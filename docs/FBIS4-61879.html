			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 88 (578) -- </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] In an interview with Interfax a member of the Azeri  delegation to the Bishkek meeting for a settlement of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict has denied charges that his delegation  was responsible for the failure of the talks. He said the  chance that Azerbaijan would sign the documents of the meeting  in full was actually blocked because they were signed by Nagorno  Karabakh as the third side to the conflict.    Baku believes that the status of the third side should be  given to both the Armenian and Azeri communities of  Nagorno-Karabakh. They should attend the negotiations without  the right to vote or sign the final documents as official sides  to the conflict. They can sign documents only as interested  sides, the Azeri spokesman said.    Meanwhile, an envoy of the Russian president, ambassador at  large Vladimir Kazimirov has told INTERFAX that in Baku the  chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul Gulyev signed with two  reservations the Bishkek protocol urging the conflicting sides  in Nagorno-Karabakh to stop hostilities as of 0000 on 9 May.    In addition to a cease-fire the document signed in Bishkek  by  the heads of parliaments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as well  as mediators from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir  Shumeyko and Medetkan Sherimkulov (the speaker of the Kyrgyz  parliament) urges the conflicting sides to work out a mechanism  of implementing the cease-fire, including the withdrawal of  troops from occupied territories and sending a CIS peace-keeping  force to the conflict zone.    According to Kazimirov, one reservation made by the head of  the Azeri parliament concerns occupied territories. He insisted  on changing the formula to captured territories. He changed the  part of the Bishkek document speaking of the need to send CIS  observers or a CIS force to international observers or an  international force.    Kazimirov said that the changes were made by the Azeri side  and they should be viewed as Azerbaijan's a special opinion  because for all other signatories to the Bishkek document the  text remains the way it was signed. [sentence as published]    The envoy added that under the Russian peace plan the first  stage of six days is given for ensuring the cease-fire, the  second of 34 days for the liberation of captured Azeri  territories (six regions lying outside Nagorno-Karabakh), the  exchange of POW's and hostages, the restoration of power lines  and communications, the return of refugees to their homes. The  third stage will begin with negotiations on the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh. Kazimirov stressed that the future of Shusha  and Lachin regions of Azerbaijan should also be clarified.    According to the Russian diplomat, Russia proceeds from the  assumption that the conflict involves three sides: Azerbaijan,  Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. He felt that this is a realistic  approach and the only one that can speed up the solution of the  problem.    IF Note: According to the press service of the defence army  of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the  Karabakh armed forces in keeping with orders from the command  have strictly observed the unilateral cease-fire since 0000 9  May. Meanwhile, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that despite  the declarations about a unilateral cease-fire at 0300 on 9 May  Armenian forces attacked Azeri Army positions in the south of  Fizuli region, Azerbaijan.</p>

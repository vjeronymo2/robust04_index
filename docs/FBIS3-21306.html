			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Sharqi in Rabat] </F>   [Text] A World Bank delegation is currently on a one-week  visit to Morocco, representing its board, and including  representatives of Germany, France, Spain, China, Poland, and  Chile. The World Bank delegation is conducting talks with  several officials of the Moroccan Government. The purpose of the  visit is exploratory, according to the members of the  delegation. They also met with the board of the Union of  Moroccan Banks, the General Federation of Businessmen, and the  Governor of the Central Bank. They visited the regions of  Morocco in which projects partially or fully funded by the World  bank are located. The World Bank delegation is also waiting to  meet with Moroccan Prime Minister Mr. Mohamed Karim Lamrani.    The preliminary statement the delegation issued after its  arrival in Morocco this week said that the World Bank and  members of its board want a greater familiarity with trends in  the Moroccan economy, especially in the areas of liberalization  and privatization, project funding, the banking system,  investment, and related operation and regulations. The World  Bank indicated that it had offered Morocco, over 30 years, over  $6.7 billion in loans and assorted funding. It is now committed  to participation in funding 30 development projects, with loans  worth a total of $2.9 billion in the areas of agriculture,  irrigation, housing, the environment, education, public works,  transport, and others.    The World Bank report for 1993-1994 published in Washington  last week indicated that Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia are the  Arab countries that have obtained the highest percentage of the  Bank's loans, and the largest rate of foreign investment. The  report explained that the economic liberalization pursued by  these countries has helped them to obtain increased foreign  investments.    For their part, Moroccan sources said that the World Bank's  total loans represent nearly a third of Morocco's total foreign  debt, which stood at $20.5 billion at the end of last year, of  which 17 percent were commercial loans after the rescheduling  arranged with the London Club last year. According to the  statement made by World Bank Vice President Koch Fiers [name as  transliterated] during his Moroccan visit two weeks ago (he met  with King Hassan II in Marrakech), the World Bank is seeking to  boost the volume of loans offered annually to Morocco, to  approach $800 million to $1 billion annually, as against about  $560 million last year. The Bank, however, wants in return to be  familiar with the new (profitable) projects that it can fund in  whole or in part, saying that the Moroccan economy needs to  prove its ability to absorb these loans.    The World Bank mission's presence in Morocco coincides with  the continuation of the parliamentary discussion of the $10  billion 1994 budget plan, which stipulates increased local  economic liberalization and a decrease in the budget deficit of  1.5 percent of gross domestic product, and economic growth in  excess of 7 percent.    The Moroccan Government wants to use 1994's privatization  revenues, estimated at $400 million, to boost economic  performance, develop the employment field, and reduce the tax  burden imposed on companies and individuals, besides permitting  the local and foreign private sector to invest in strategic  sectors that had been the preserve of the public sector, such as  energy, transport, irrigation, communications, and public works.  It is waiting, in light of the World Bank delegation's visit, to  define the volume of loans the Bank will offer Morocco in 1994  and 1995, part of which Morocco wants to allocate to fund youth  projects and provide additional job opportunities to help the  local economy adapt to the global economy after the signature of  the GATT accord in Marrakech in mid-April this year. That  occasion will be attended by a number of heads of state from  industrialized countries, including President Bill Clinton,  according to Moroccan sources preparing the holding of the  global GATT conference.</p>

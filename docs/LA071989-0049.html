			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH CONTACTS;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIANS AMONG ROOT'S LICENSE CLIENTS  </P> <P> Thomas Root, the Washington lawyer whose light plane crashed into the Atlantic  Ocean while he sat at the controls apparently unconscious last week, has dozens  of California clients who have invested money in applications for radio station  licenses.  </P> <P> Root, an attorney for Sonrise Management Services Inc., of Georgia, represents  limited partners seeking FM band licenses in 16 outlying population centers in  Northern and Central California. All Sonrise's license applications are now  under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission. Both Root and  Sonrise have denied wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Booker T. McClanahan Jr., hoping to become general manager of a 3,000-watt  radio station on the Monterey Peninsula, started to become discouraged about  the license application handled by Root and Sonrise when some of those who had  invested in the application pulled their money out earlier this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problems With Root  </P> <P> Then, a month ago, the former disc jockey and radio advertising salesman  received a letter from Sonrise saying that there were problems with Root and  suggesting that he find a new lawyer.  </P> <P> "Mr. Root was telling us he was really good at getting the stations,"  McClanahan said in a phone interview, reached at an Assembly of God church in  Seaside where he volunteers his time.  </P> <P> " . . . I thought he was a pretty prominent attorney around Washington, and I  thought he had put a lot of people on the air."  </P> <P> McClanahan, who has worked in advertising sales and on the air at various San  Francisco and Monterey-area stations, still holds out hope that he can get the  station he has always wanted.  </P> <P> "Three-thousand watts is pretty big in the Carmel-Monterey area," he said.  "That would have been pretty powerful. It would have got us over to Santa Cruz,  and that's an hour drive."  </P> <P> Root and Sonrise found investors in California through church contacts. They  also tapped people with broadcast backgrounds who aspired to run their own  stations. One said that he had heard of the investment from his financial  adviser.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buy Into Dream  </P> <P> Investors could buy into the dream of winning an FCC license for slightly more  than $3,000. They could profit if the station, once licensed, became a success.  </P> <P> Charles Walker, a retired Missionary Baptist preacher in Pine Bluff, Ark.,  invested in partnerships seeking licenses in Ohio and Kansas. Walker said that  although there was "no religious connection" to the investment, he knew that  the Sonrise principals were Christians.  </P> <P> "I felt better about it when I found out they were Christian," he said. He felt  so confident that he told his niece, Kathleen Manning, a television producer in  Bakersfield, about Sonrise, who also became involved.  </P> <P> The day Root's plane went into the Atlantic, Manning received a letter from  Sonrise, telling her that she should consider changing lawyers because of  problems with Root.  </P> <P> "I was a little bit concerned," said Manning, a Bakersfield television producer  who also is listed on the application as the intended general manager for a new  FM radio station in Kern County.  </P> <P> Manning invested no money in the project, but allowed Sonrise to use her name  as general manager. She said one reason that Sonrise wanted to list her as the  general manager was because she is a woman. The FCC has encouraged women and  minorities to seek ownership of new stations.  </P></p>

The meeting relayed Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's opinion,  which called on all localities to do practical work and  earnestly implement the principles on rural work for  comprehensive agricultural development as outlined by the  central authorities. At the meeting, State Councillor Chen  Junsheng stressed: This is a crucial year for China's efforts  in deepening reform. The State Council has successively  introduced a series of reform measures such as the establishment  of taxation, financial, investment, and foreign trade systems.  This is an important step in establishing the socialist market  economic system. Furthermore, as comprehensive agricultural  development is directly linked to reform, this effort is vital  for ensuring a smooth reform process. Therefore, in  comprehensive agricultural development, we should focus our  tasks closely on the overall reform situation and strive to  produce more grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and vegetables, as  well as to stabilize and enrich market supplies so as to create  a better material base for the smooth implementation of reform  measures.    It is understood that investing in large-scale comprehensive  agricultural development projects is a measure of the state's  macroeconomic control of agricultural development and a strategy  for achieving ultimate agricultural modernization under the new  historical condition. Since reform and opening up, China has  made breakthroughs in traditional agricultural production  patterns. We have achieved production efficiency through  systematic and progressive utilization of resources as well as  through comprehensive investment and administration, thereby  creating a new avenue for comprehensive agricultural  development. In five years of comprehensive agricultural  development through garden-style farmland cultivation,  mechanized farming, and the introduction of fine varieties and a  series of support services, food production increased greatly in  five provinces in the Huanghe-Huaihe-Haihe Plain, the great  Northeast Plain, southern Hunan, the Changjiang- Hanjiang Plain,  central and southern Jiangxi, and project zones in Hainan  Province. According to statistics, the nationwide increase in  food production from 1988 to 1992 through comprehensive  agricultural development included 17.16 billion kg of grain,  5.04 million dan of cotton [one dan equals to 50 kg], 700,000  tons of edible oil, and 620,000 tons of meat. Spurred by state  development projects, Anhui, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, and Henan  also took the initiative to develop over three million mu of  "local projects" and "peasants' projects," which greatly  improved production conditions and increased peasants' income.  In regions where development projects were undertaken, per  capita income generally increased by about 200 yuan following  development.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: We should further understand the  significance of comprehensive agricultural development, achieve  the major goal of improving basic conditions for agricultural  production, and make deeper and wider use of agricultural  resources. We should effectively improve basic production  conditions so as to increase the comprehensive production  capacity for major agricultural products such as grain, cotton,  edible oil, and meat. We should combine the goals of maintaining  steady growth for major agricultural products and increasing  peasants' income. We should establish the efficiency concept  and attach great importance to the task of helping peasants  increase their income.    As for the next phase of comprehensive agricultural  development, Chen Junsheng called for vigorous measures to  increase grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat production;  effective development of pastoral regions and utilization of  farmland straw; increase beef and mutton production; and  large-scale development of selected wastelands. He said: We  should gradually shift our future investment to the central and  western regions.    Chen Junsheng stressed: We should increase our capital  investment in comprehensive agricultural development in the  future. We should use the majority of excess special  agricultural and forestry taxes collected for comprehensive  agricultural development. The central government should  gradually increase its investment as the central financial  situation improves. We should use more World Bank loans. Bank  loans for agricultural production should be gradually increased  yearly on the basis of previous loans. Agricultural banks should  only increase their input, and not cancel or reduce their loan  targets for comprehensive agricultural development because of  bank reform. He asked all localities to mobilize the peasants  to increase their investment in comprehensive agricultural  development, utilize excess labor force, and embark on farmland  capital construction. Meanwhile, governments at all levels  should adopt scientific, standard management methods for  development projects, realistically upgrade development  efficiency, and strive to push comprehensive agricultural  development to a new stage.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2-CAREER FAMILY DILEMMA: BALANCING WORK AND HOME;  </P> <P> POLL: A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WOULD QUIT WORK AND STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF  THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.  </P> <P> Haunted by anxiety about spending too little time with their children, nearly  40% of fathers and 80% of mothers in Los Angeles and Orange counties say they  would quit their jobs, if they could, to rear their children at home.  </P> <P> Most parents say they are often overwhelmed by the responsibilities of  child-rearing and worry about whether they are doing a good job of it,  according to a Los Angeles Times-commissioned survey of 1,000 households in the  two counties.  </P> <P> Some social historians say the findings reflect a "new realism" about the  financial and emotional toll that an 80-hour work week inflicts on dual-earner  families.  </P> <P> "We've reached a time when we're more realistic of what the costs are of  full-time employment for two-earner families," said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, a  social historian and consultant with the Chicago-based Public Policy Assn. The  top two responsibilities of parenthood -- providing financial security and  passing on values -- are on a collision course that will continue at least  through the decade or until the economy eases, she said.  </P> <P> The telephone poll, conducted July 19-23 by Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp;  Associates, surveyed an equal number of men and women, evenings and weekends,  in English and Spanish. The margin of error is 3 to 5 percentage points.  </P> <P> Among other findings on the state of the family:  </P> <P> * Many cannot live up to their ideals of even the most mundane family  traditions, such as eating dinner together.  </P> <P> * Los Angeles County parents perceive crime as the top problem threatening  their children, while Orange County parents think substance abuse is the  greatest threat.  </P> <P> * Parents are apparently motivated to join the rat race by what is also one of  their biggest concerns in rearing children: money.  </P> <P> "Every day is a challenge and a balancing act," said single mother Linda  Sonnonstine, 42, of Irvine, who left a corporate communications job in Los  Angeles for one in Long Beach to reduce her commute and have more time for her  son, Benji, 13.  </P> <P> "Something suffers, either the child, the relationship with your significant  other, or the job," she said.  </P> <P> On the bright side, the poll suggests that Southern Californians, whether  mainstream or non-traditional, care profoundly about family life.  </P> <P> Altogether, about eight in 10 said the most important things in their lives are  family and children, marriage and love, and financial security -- more  important than work and career or leisure time. Two-thirds also called family  and love life the most satisfying aspects of their lives.  </P> <P> But that focus often turns to guilt for spending too little time with the  children, according to 57% of the fathers and 55% of the mothers.  </P> <P> For Benay Clark, facing her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Mallory, before her  husband takes the girl to day care each morning is "a real struggle."  </P> <P> Sometimes, Mallory clings to her; she says she's scared; she asks why Clark has  to have a job.  </P> <P> "I've cried on my way to work many times," said Clark, a 35-year-old  administrative clerk living in the West Hills area of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Irene Quintanilla Smith, who runs the child-care center where Mallory spends  her days, said she often sees tears on parents' faces as well as children's.  Mothers and fathers tell her they "had a parent home when they were children  and they wish they could do the same. But they can't," because their financial  situation forces them to work.  </P> <P> Eighty-six percent of residents in Los Angeles and Orange counties agreed with  Smith and said two incomes are necessary.  </P> <P> Working parents, particularly men, believed strongly that the demands of the  job are taking a toll at home. A little more than half of the men said the job  they are doing as a parent has suffered "a lot" or "some," contrasted with 39%  of the women who felt that way.  </P> <P> In 1983, Pat Donovan, 42, was divorced and given custody of his two children.  For two years, he continued to work long, erratic hours at Bendix Field  Engineering near Barstow, squeezing in trips to the beach and the zoo on the  one weekend a month he had off.  </P> <P> Five years ago, he decided that his children needed him more than he needed his  job: "If you neglect your car long enough, it's going to break down. If you  neglect your children, something down the line will happen you'll be sorry  for."  </P> <P> So Donovan moved his family to Morrisville, N.Y., took a job with better hours  and devoted more time to his family. With his children in their teens, he has  returned to California and a better-paying job in Pasadena with his former  employer.  </P> <P> Donovan realizes that his salary has suffered as a result of his focus on  child-rearing. But the daily rewards of watching his children mature, seeing  his daughter in her dance recitals and his son in wrestling tournaments more  than compensate for any slippage on the career ladder, he said.  </P> <P> Psychologist and syndicated columnist Dr. Joyce Brothers attributed the  closeness many men feel to their children to changes in domestic attitudes and  behavior. In America today, only 10% of the homes fit the traditional  "breadwinner" model where the father goes off to work and the mother stays home  to take care of the children, according to a study by the Ford Foundation.  </P> <P> Fathers have "held more crying infants in the middle of the night; they've fed  them, rocked them, changed their diapers, to say nothing of talking with school  and camp counselors and attending PTA meetings," Brothers said.  </P> <P> Unlike Donovan, only 28% of the fathers reported the demands of parenthood have  hurt their work careers, while 41% of the mothers believe family priorities  have forced them to scale back their careers.  </P> <P> The findings helped confirm a June survey by Catalyst, a New York-based  not-for-profit research and advisory group that found a majority of corporate  human relations professionals still perceive work and family conflicts to be a  "women's issue."  </P> <P> "There's a lot of pressure now for men to say they would like to spend more  time with their families," but little evidence showing they do, said Mary  Mattis, vice president of research for Catalyst. "For the most part, women are  still working two jobs."  </P> <P> Dr. Rebecca Wexler had just begun a residency program in radiology when her  second child, Rachael, was born last year. There was no question what she would  do: "I wanted to be at home with her when she was little."  </P> <P> The Pasadena resident knew she might not be able to get back into the extremely  competitive radiology program. "People may look down on the fact that I  interrupted this residency," she said.  </P> <P> She and her husband, Tony, who is completing his doctorate in mechanical  engineering, are also well aware of the financial implications of their  decision. "The mean salary for radiologists is $160,000 a year," Tony said with  a smile.  </P> <P> Tony believes he devotes more time to child care than his peers. He feels close  to his children. But he would not have made the career sacrifice Rebecca made.  He is unsure why, but suspects that his wife, by bearing and breast-feeding the  children, developed a stronger bond. "Women's stake is much higher," he said.  </P> <P> For her part, Rebecca remains strongly committed to her career. When the  children are napping, for instance, she reads her radiology journals. But she  does not regret her decision.  </P> <P> Parents who were polled tended to idealize family togetherness, ranking family  activities as highly important.  </P> <P> For instance, 95% of respondents agreed in theory that a good chat about school  or other children's issues is important, 86% believe in the importance of  having regular family dinners, and 82% say that families need to go to the  movies or the beach together. But in practice, many fell short of reaching  their ideals.  </P> <P> Only three-quarters said they managed to talk with their children about school  and other children's issues. Single parents said they talk less with their  children, and attach less importance to doing so. And only 66% said they have a  regular dinner hour together.  </P> <P> The largest gap fell between those who felt it was important to attend church  services, 65%, and those who said they actually attended, 48%.  </P> <P> The poll also confirmed what is already apparent to many -- that family forms  are changing.  </P> <P> Three in 10 households with children are so-called "blended families" --  including children from previous marriages; 18% of the parents are rearing  their children alone and often facing even more difficulties than their peers  in two-parent families.  </P> <P> Melissa Thompson of Altadena is studying at Cal State Los Angeles to be a  teacher. The 22-year-old woman also works full time at the Caltech Children's  Center in Pasadena. But she cannot afford to send her children there.  </P> <P> So each morning she drops her 5-year-old off at a public school and her  6-month-old at a baby-sitter. After work, she picks up the children and takes  them to her mother's house, where they remain while Thompson attends classes.  At 9 p.m., Thompson picks up the children and returns home, "and then the  children want time with me."  </P> <P> "Sometimes, when I need to get somewhere and have absolutely no one to turn to  to baby-sit, or I've just been paid and I know money has to go to rent, bills,  car payments and I need to go to my mother for food, I think, 'Goodness  gracious, is it worth it?' "  </P> <P> Invariably, she said, she looks at her children and concludes that it is.  </P> <P> Residents in Los Angeles and Orange counties responded almost identically on  most questions, such as considering two children the ideal family size or  giving television the lowest priority as a family activity.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles residents were more disappointed with their finances, careers,  love lives and families than are Orange County residents.  </P> <P> Orange County residents -- particularly women -- ranked leisure time as more  important than did their counterparts in Los Angeles or either group of men. In  fact, 75% of the Orange County women rated it as a "very important" feature of  their lives.  </P> <P> Nearly one-third of Los Angeles residents said Los Angeles County is a "poor"  place to rear children, contrasted with only 12% in Orange County.  </P> <P> In both counties, childless families perceived drugs and alcohol as the biggest  problem for parents rearing children today. Parents in Orange County agreed,  but Los Angeles parents said they were most concerned about crime.  </P> <P> Peach Manion, 67, was born in Los Angeles and has seen the stresses of city  life influence three generations. Her parents lost their Silver Lake home  during the Depression. As Peach and her husband, Pete, reared their own five  children, now ages 31 to 44, they worried about alcohol and, later, drugs.  </P> <P> Now, Manion finds herself waiting up and worrying about gangs and crime and  other urban problems until her 18-year-old grandchild, who lives with her  parents across the street, comes home at night.  </P> <P> Still, she thinks growing up in the city has been good for the girl, as it was  for her children, giving them a rounded and realistic view of the world, said  Manion, adding, "I love this community."  </P> <P> In both counties, parents also worry about schools and lack of time in rearing  their children. In Orange County, twice as many people as in Los Angeles worry  about the expense of rearing children. Several of them -- including the most  affluent -- complained about pervasive materialism.  </P> <P> In the affluent community of Fullerton known as Sunny Hills, homemaker Cindy  Huff, 39, said all the teen-agers have their own cars, Nintendo sets and the  equipment and lessons for any sport to which they're drawn. Her three sons have  all been to private schools, taken lessons in violin, swimming, gymnastics,  performing arts and various sports.  </P> <P> "If you can buy shoes for it, we've done it," she said. "It's a very 'have'  society, and it's difficult for them to understand that somebody worked for  these things, and they were expensive and that not everybody in the world has  them or is entitled to them by birthright."  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: View  </P> <P> </P> <P> How the Poll Was Conducted  </P> <P> The Family Poll was conducted July 19-23 for the Los Angeles Times by  Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. The telephone survey used a  computer-generated random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers to  contact 1,000 households, including 500 in Orange County and 500 in Los Angeles  County. For analysis of the two counties, combined results were statistically  weighted to represent the actual distribution of population in Los Angeles and  Orange counties. Interviews were conducted evenings and weekends, in English  and Spanish, and included an equal number of men and women. All respondents  were guaranteed anonymity. However, some agreed to be reinterviewed for news  stories. The margin of error is 3 percentage points for the total sample and  4.5 percentage points for each county. For subgroups, such as parents, it is 5  percentage points. Results may not add up to 100% because of rounding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POLL RESULTS  </P> <P> OVERALL IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY LIFE  </P> <P> "In general, how important are each of these features of your

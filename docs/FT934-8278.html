			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Market Report The ALUMINIUM market led a general price fall at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon, with the three months delivery position ending after hours trading Dollars 19 down at Dollars 1,059.50 a tonne. Dealers said the market had opened on the defensive following its failure to breach resistance at Dollars 1,080 a tonne on Friday and quickly lost ground under pressure from Far East selling and trade offerings. Speculative liquidation pushed three months COPPER towards the lower end of its recent range. Last business was at Dollars 1,659 a tonne, down Dollars 11.50 from Friday. ZINC prices drifted in early trading but found support below Dollars 950 a tonne for three months metal, which ended at Dollars 952, down Dollars 3 on the day. Three months LEAD spiked to Dollars 417 a tonne in early trading, but profit-taking reversed the trend and although prices remained underpinned by recent consumer interest and an analyst's report of a tightness in lead concentrate supplies it ended at Dollars 412, up only Dollars 1 on balance. NICKEL continued to correct from an oversold condition and the three months price bounced away from the Dollars 4,600-a-tonne level. Compiled from Reuters</p>

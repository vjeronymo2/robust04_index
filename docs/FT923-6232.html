			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / French split on Maastricht, polls suggest A SHARP erosion in French support for the Maastricht treaty was shown yesterday in four opinion polls - one of which for the first time indicated a No vote in next month's referendum. Opposition to the treaty among the French, traditionally staunch backers of European union, has been growing throughout the summer. A No vote in the September 20 referendum would be a crushing blow for the treaty, a blueprint for closer European Community unity. The poll which showed a 51 per cent vote against the treaty - carried out by BVA for Paris-Match magazine and the Antenne 2/FR3 television network - pushed the country's stock market to a new low for the year. The other three polls showed a narrow vote in favour. A negative result would be damaging to France's Socialist government, which has been leading the pro-Maastricht campaign. It would also be a personal blow for President Francois Mitterrand who launched the referendum in June, confident that France would deliver a resounding Yes vote to revitalise the cause of European union following the rejection of the treaty by Danish voters. Early last month, when he set the date for the referendum, the polls indicated about 60 per cent support among the French people for the treaty. Yesterday's BVA poll suggests that the Yes vote has fallen from 56 per cent in late July, when it conducted its last survey, to 49 per cent. BVA's polls have a margin of error of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Among the polls showing a vote in favour, one commissioned from IFOP by L'Express magazine found 51 per cent intending to vote Yes. A poll by Sofres for Le Figaro newspaper showed the same 51-49 vote in favour of the treaty, while a survey by Louis Harris for VSD magazine, gauged the Yes faction at 52 per cent. The government is now trying to regenerate its lacklustre campaign in time for next week's return to work after the end of the summer holiday. Last week Mr Jack Lang, the arts and education minister, was drafted in to lead its campaign effort. Mr Lang has since announced a series of media appearances by prominent politicians, including Mr Mitterrand, who will appear next Thursday in a television debate against Mr Philippe Seguin, a prominent anti-Maastricht campaigner.</p>

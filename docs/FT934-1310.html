			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Battle over economy cabins A US survey of couriers' opinions on airlines' economy cabins this week rated British Airways as the best on international routes and Alaska Airlines the best within the US, writes Danny Green. BA was followed by United, Singapore, American and Lufthansa. Alitalia and Air Canada came in last, in 19th and 20th place respectively. BA rated especially highly on food, beverages and personal attention. These were the key factors in its overall victory, said Mr Byron Lutz, who edited the survey for the International Association of Air Travel Couriers. 'BA is very good at handing out the free drinks,' he said. Other notable results of the survey of more than 1,600 couriers was that TWA scored highest on comfort but lowest on friendliness and food. Virgin Atlantic was the most uncomfortable but managed to catch up somewhat thanks to the personal attention it gave.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Iran may soon have N-weapon IRAN COULD have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade, according to Mr Robert Gates, until recently director of the US Central Intelligence Agency. He said this was probably 'a reasonable estimate' if Iran did not receive fissile materials from abroad. If it did, it could complete a nuclear arms programme earlier, he told a BBC Panorama programme due to be broadcast last night. The US intelligence community has been divided about the state of advance of Iran's nuclear programme. Panorama cited unconfirmed intelligence reports that beryllium, used as a component of nuclear weapons, and uranium pellets for a nuclear reactor had been shipped to Iran from Kazakhstan. Mr Reza Amrollahi, president of the Iranian Atomic Energy organisation, strongly denied that Iran's nuclear programme, including its recent reactor deal with China, was for anything but peaceful purposes. Mr Gates also told the programme there was evidence of an Iranian chemical weapons programme, including choking, blister and blood agents. Estimates of its stockpile ranged from a few hundred tonnes to 2,000 tonnes. Iran was among signatories of a treaty banning chemical weapons in January.</p>

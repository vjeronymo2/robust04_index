			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Books: Miraculous yes, but hardly credible - Fiction THE ROBBER BRIDE by Margaret Atwood Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 470 pages MILLROY THE MAGICIAN by Paul Theroux Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 440 pages AUTOBIOPSY by Bernice Rubens Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 231 pages WE LIVE in a credulous age, seeking miracles, so it is little wonder when serious, sensible, novelists look to the supernatural, the magical, the other-worldly for their plots. In Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride it is the return from the dead of a she-devil to haunt the lives of three middle aged women. In Paul Theroux's Millroy the Magician, conjuror develops into a miracle-working Messiah. And in Bernice Rubens' Autobiopsy (Sinclair Stevenson), a blocked writer literally squeezes inspiration for a novel from the refrigerated brain of his former mentor. What happened to social realism? Atwood takes us among women. Tony, a (female) medievalist specialising in warfare; Roz, a successful venture capitalist; and Charis, an unrepentant hippie, are drawn together by their hatred of Zenia, the Toronto college chum who successively seduced and destroyed their men. Zenia's death in Lebanon is cause for much relief, celebrated at a monthly lunch. Their re-patched lives are threatened when Zenia walks into the restaurant. This is Daphne du Maurier territory, lightly dusted with feminism. The men are insubstantial background figures, but Atwood is astonishingly skilled in developing intriguingly quirky characters and detailed backgrounds for her heroines. Three times Zenia exploits men and wrecks their women; and three times we follow with dread. This is escapist stuff, meat and drink for an American TV mini drama, with enough tension, enough silliness, and enough sympathy in the perhaps too carefully contrasted trio to appeal to the broadest audience. It is Atwood stripped of intellectual pretension, but writing fluidly and at ease. Zenia is a credible monster, a wheedling liar who sent shivers down my spine and yet is surprisingly accepted into the Sisterhood at the end. Atwood could have made more of the mystery. Instead she settles for an adventure, a surprising jeu d'esprit from Canada's most uncompromising novelist, and an unreservedly recommended read for an escapist winter break. Theroux is much more ambitious - well, pretentious really - in Millroy the Magician. It begins with promise as 14-year-old waif Jilly is spirited away by Millroy, the magic man at a New England travelling circus. He gives her security; chaste friendship; and an initiation into his tricks. You settle back for a picaresque tale of life on the American road: JB Priestley meets Jack Kerouac. But not all Millroy's stunts are tricks. He can work miracles and he certainly manages to carry Theroux off into a farrago of symbolism. Jilly, disguised as a boy, introduces Millroy to the power of television, and after easy success as a magic-making uncle on breakfast TV he exploits the medium to establish himself as a modern Messiah, aiming to convert not the souls, but the bodies of the American public. If they would only eat the food mentioned in the Bible and pay strict attention to their bowels they would achieve moral perfection and live to be 200. Theroux is spot on in homing in on the most likely medium as well as the most persuasive message to convert health obsessed Americans. But as Millroy recruits his outcast disciples to run a chain of Day One high fibre food outlets and faces the inevitable official hostility and eventual treachery from his followers, the parallels with Jesus become facile. You wait in dread for the Last Supper - and here it comes, Millroy chopping off his finger, with an appropriate benediction, before sharing it around his little band as they flee across the country in a trailer. The ending manages to be both mystical and trite, not a bad description of a book which seems to have escaped from the control of its author. Both Atwood and Theroux write with gusto and conviction. In Autobiopsy Bernice Rubens seems to have been over-whelmed with an idea and forced it unconvincingly into a novel. Martin Peabody is as pathetic as his name but hopes that draining off the genius of dead novelist Walter Berry will stimulate a new creativity. Instead it leads to a convoluted but predictable plot in which Peabody builds up a biography for Berry from the few random comments of his decaying brain. At the same time Peabody grapples with his own rather tedious family life and that of Berry's widow and step daughter. Parallel lines run into each other, to general confusion, but it is hard to raise the enthusiasm to work out which theme is being pursued at any particular time. It is also dangerous to have a poor novelist as your storyteller.</p>

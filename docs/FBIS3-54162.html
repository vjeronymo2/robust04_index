			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Syria in Zero Plus Zero"] </F>   [Text] When the allies' war against Iraq ended, only the  simple-minded could have believed that the Americans would leave  the area. At the same time, it was also proved that there was a  heavy price tag attached to their staying on, especially when  more issues came to light and all the Muslims in the region and  world public opinion found out that Iraq had been armed by the  West.    The Arab countries met the heavy cost of the military  expedition to the region. But it was the Westerners who got all  the glory and the shaykhs who got all the disgrace. America,  which was making plans for the future of the world and the  region in view of the emerging signs that the Soviet Union was  disintegrating, starting to create imaginary enemies for the  shaykhs in a bid to gather them together in a extra-regional  pact--that is, outside the Persian Gulf. Egypt was one of the  staunch supporters of this plan and immediately announced its  readiness to participate; and in order to legitimize this pact  or gathering, the Syrian capital, Damascus, was chosen as the  venue. And the pact came to be known as the six-plus-two pact.    After the Persian Gulf war, these eight countries met to  draw  up plans for a regional security strategy.    Now, after at least two years, the six-plus-two has neither  put forth a plan nor does it have the guts to announce its  dissolution, even though its recent session was also  unsuccessful.    Meanwhile, the six Persian Gulf countries insist on their  past beliefs and have fear in their hearts--a fear that is based  on American analyses and assessments. But Egypt and Syria are  an exception to this rule.    The Egyptians are dreaming of returning to the Jamal  'Abd-an-  Nasir era in the Arab world. However, they neither have the  economic ability nor a leader like an-Nasir to do so.  Therefore, they attend sessions on America's orders and  heatedly speak about the process of Islamism in the region and  about the possible threat of Islamic Iran, hoping to reap  something from these efforts. But this is not so with Syria.    The Syrians accepted the six-plus-two pact because of their  extensive differences with the Baghdad regime. However, they  have nothing in common with the other members of the pact. They  are aware of world diplomacy and of the need for independence,  and they have adopted a completely progressive course. But the  Syrian statesmen should also bear in mind that from America's  point of view the six-plus-two pact is also considered as a club  of friends who believe in the process of compromise in the  Middle East.    Egypt attends the Damascus sessions because of Camp David,  and the shaykhs attend the sessions because of their military  pacts and complete concordance with America. Therefore, Syria's  presence in such a gathering is a blow to the political prestige  of an independent and progressive country. Of course, it will  be a different matter if America succeeds in binding Damascus  with Tel Aviv. But if not, then Syria will have no place among  the remaining seven members of the pact.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Halifax cuts home loan rate to 9.29% HALIFAX Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, yesterday cut its standard mortgage interest rate from 9.99 per cent to 9.29 per cent in the wake of Friday's fall of 1 percentage point in base rates. Halifax's new rate is slightly above the 9.25 per cent rate set on Friday by Abbey National and National &amp; Provincial Building Society. Halifax has cut rates on larger loans to 8.79 per cent for loans between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000 up to 75 per cent of value (old rate 9.49 per cent) and to 8.54 per cent on loans over Pounds 100,000 (old rate 9.25 per cent). Loans between 75 per cent and 90 per cent of the value of a property have been cut to 8.99 per cent for mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000 (old rate 9.69 per cent) and 8.79 per cent for mortgages over Pounds 100,000 (old rate 9.49 per cent). An average endowment mortgage of Pounds 60,000 will be Pounds 30.63 a month cheaper, said Halifax. First-time buyers will be able to obtain a mortgage at a discount rate of 6.9 per cent - the lowest mortgage level from the society since 1965. The change in rates will apply immediately for new borrowers and for existing customers from December 1, although Halifax is going ahead with an earlier planned cut in its standard rate from 10.65 per cent to 9.99 per cent on November 1.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] A few moments ago Army Division General Rafael Angel  Montero Revette was sworn in as defense minister. Following the  ceremony Montero and outgoing Defense Minister Radames Munoz  spoke with reporters.    [Begin recording] [Montero] I was just sworn in as defense  minister. Yesterday and today the commanders of all the  military forces, the Armed Forces inspector general, and the  joint chief of staff were also sworn in, and the new military  hierarchy will be confirmed tomorrow by President Caldera.    Initially I will have three priorities at the Ministry:  social welfare; everything pertaining to sanitation, garrison  housing, clothing, food, and so on. My second priority will be  training; I will consider the possibility of conducting joint  maneuvers by the entire Armed Forces during the course of the  year. My third priority will be the maintenance and recovery of  all the installations and equipment that may be damaged.    [Munoz] It is my belief -- and I would characterize this as  a  piece of advice to the new minister -- that it is necessary to  consolidate the Armed Forces' spirit of democracy, support the  country's development and, above all else, within that support  improve the Armed Forces' efficiency in border areas to give the  country the reassurance it needs at this time that its food  supply will be protected.

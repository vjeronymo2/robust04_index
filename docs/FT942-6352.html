			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: Sunny side up with Roger Ackling - Visual arts There is conceptual art and conceptual art. The fatuities of what we have come to call it in its limited sense are only those of its exclusive and self-conscious avant-garde extreme. Yet all art, and all true craft too, must have something of the mind, of sentience and intention to them, some informing idea, at least at the outset, or the activity and engagement are nothing more than mindless occupational therapy. Pace Saint John, all things were made by it, that is to say the idea, and without it was not any thing made that was made. The artist declares his initial interest and method, the patron his requirement: the rest is a matter of emphasis. It is only when that informing idea alone is taken as the justification of the work, and the form left unconsidered to shift for itself, that conceptualism becomes limited, pretentious and self-serving. For the rest, we can only wait upon results as they come, to take on their merits, for better or worse. So it is that within the scope of conceptualism in its broader sense, these 30 years past, we have had isms and attitudes that have produced work of real and lasting quality and interest, for all that it has come sailing in under the Jolly Roger of the experimental, the radical and avant-garde. Minimalism, for example, with its reduction to the simplest physical presence or statement; systems art, in which form is the function of process and the application of a set of rules; nature art or arte povera, of which the point is to celebrate and exploit the qualities of found and natural objects and materials. Roger Ackling, whose largest show in this country in number of works exhibited is filling the Annely Juda Gallery, contrives in his quiet and self-effacing way to engage fruitfully with all these conceptual isms at once. His Flooded Margins of his title are, in this instance, the beaches and foreshores of East Anglia, from which he takes the driftwood fragments that are his tabulae rasae. Only a pair of wretched, derelict plimsolls here seems out-of-place. His principal tool is the burning glass, which makes him entirely dependent upon the sun, just so long as it shines. He works where he is, while the moment lasts, the rules which he accepts - as opposed to imposes upon himself  - the arbitrary ones of weather and sunshine and whatever the object is that chance throws in his way. But that is not to say that the work itself is arbitrary or automatic, left to run on of itself. Rules and process may together determine its nature and appearance in the general sense - just as a painting may be a thing of paint on canvas - but its singularity lies in what the artist alone makes of it. And Ackling's creative signature is unmistakable. He moves the glass laterally across the surface of the wood, the scorched line steady and set at regular intervals. But even here, innate and intuitive differences and decisions reveal themselves. The wood itself is hard or soft, to be worked in its appropriate way. It is washed clean perhaps, or perhaps dense with a surface history of old paint, rusty nails, vestigial hinges, and all to be taken into account. The compositions are thus as various as the objects themselves, subtle and responsive, for all that Ackling's approach is insistent in its formality - frontal, architectural, hieratic. The horizontal bands set up a moire shift against residual streaks of old paint or tar on a weathered disc: a pristine shadow is left within the linear system by the removal of the protective skin of old metal: the scorched diptych holds attention upon the clean, sharp gap between its component panels: surfaces are disrupted, systems interrupted, contradicted. But in spite of all such explanation and special pleading, all this order and process, all this conceptualising, what we end up with is a set of odd and ambiguous objects, beautifully made under the artist's own hand, and each one just as he thought it might be, not at the moment he started, but when he left off. None of them are exactly big, many of them tiny. They are what they are, no more, no less, rich in the associations and references we may care to bring to them, but that is entirely up to us. These things are like fetishes and talismen, perhaps, trophies of long-forgotten rituals and special moments, half-remembered. For the artist himself such memories are naturally more particular, but then he alone knows the place where he picked up his trophy, and how he felt about it, and how warm the sun was as he marked it for his own. And he is artist enough, romantic and imaginative, to keep his counsel. The boring, portentous conceptualist would hardly resist spelling out the message. Ackling, for his part, is saying nothing, and good for him. Roger Ackling - Flooded Margins: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until June 25.</p>

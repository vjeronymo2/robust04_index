			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 11  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE,  reported on 30 December that retail sales rose by 3.7 percent  from January to October 1993, compared to the same period in  1992. Furniture and home appliance stores registered a growth of  14.1 percent in sales. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  31 Dec 93 p 1C)    A report by the National Association of Industrialists,  ANDI,  indicated that in 1993 the economy grew at the 5.16 percent rate  announced by the government. The contribution of the industrial  sector to this growth was less than 1 percent, meaning the  Colombian economy in 1993 was marked by low vitality in  productive activity, it added. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO  SIGLO in Spanish 31 Dec 94 p 27)    A cold spell in Santa Fe de Bogota's savannas destroyed 30  percent of the areas's flower harvest. In addition to harming  exports, approximately 26,000 workers will lose their jobs. The  cold weather also destroyed the potato harvests in Boyaca and  Cundinamarca Department, the country's chief suppliers. (Santa  Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT  7 Jan 94)    The government granted a 21-percent pay increase to all its  public officials, except the members of the military and some  members of the Judicial Branch, who will receive a higher  increase as part of the strategy to control public order and  upgrade the system of justice. The increase represents 0.9  percent of the total production of goods and services of the  economy or the GDP. The state indicated the raise will not hurt  its macroeconomic goals because it has been included in the  estimates for the 1994 budget. During the first half of 1993,  the state's total spending grew 39 percent, and functioning  costs rose 46.2 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in  Spanish 5 Jan 94 pp 1a, 6b)    Textile manufacturers have rejected the government  announcement to lift the port restriction on textile imports and  proposed a "civic overseer" to assist customs in contraband  control and detect fraudulent under invoicing. Jose Manuel  Arias Carrioza, president of the Colombian Association of  Textile Producers, sent a letter to Pedro Nel Ospina, director  of the National Customs and Tax Directorate, complaining that  port controls have slackened. Arias reports that 80 percent of  Colombian textile factories suffered losses in 1993. The "civic  overseers" are not intended to check customs work, but to ensure  that the type of textiles imported do not compete unfairly with  local production. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 5 Jan  94 pp 1a, 8b)    Colombian coal exports increased 27 percent in 1993 with  shipments totalling 13.7 millions tons and worth $464 million,  the Colombian Coal Enterprise, Carbocol, reported. During 1992,  exports were 2 million tons less than the amount of coal  produced. Carbocol disclosed that in 1993 production costs were  reduced by 10 percent from $272 million to $245 million.  Colombia faced a tough situation during 1993 when world coal  surpluses topped 11 million tons, thus reducing long term  contract prices by five dollars per ton. Currently, Colombia  sells coal at $35 per ton maximum. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in  Spanish 1735 GMT 7 Jan 94)    Housing and food prices were the main culprits for the  government overshooting its 22 percent inflation rate goal for  1993. The inflation for 1993 has been reported at 22.6 percent.  Dane Director Rodolfo Uribe says that the 1.13 percent increase  in Christmas prices was mainly due to increases in the cost of  gasoline at the end of the year. Housing costs for December  reflected the greatest increases and were rated at 1.37 percent  followed by food that registered a 1.18 percent increase.  Clothing, health, transportation, and education registered  below average increases. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in  Spanish 3 Jan 94 pp 1, 9)</p>

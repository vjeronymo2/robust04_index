			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Operating loss of Dollars 19m at Reynolds Metals Reynolds Metals company, the US aluminium processor, had a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 19.1m, or 31 cents a share, before special charges, despite improvement in western world aluminium demand and year-over-year gains in its own aluminium shipments. The loss compares with an operating profit of Dollars 2.9m, or 5 cents a share, in last year's fourth quarter, also before special charges. Including charges, the loss was Dollars 238.6m, or Dollars 3.98 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 2.55 a share, a year ago. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 1.35bn, nearly unchanged from a year earlier. For the year, the company had operating losses of Dollars 94.6m, or Dollars 1.58 a share, before special charges, on revenues of Dollars 5.29bn. This compares with income before charges of Dollars 44.6m, or 75 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.66bn in fiscal 1992. Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said: 'Reynolds' results for the fourth quarter and the year reflect a continuation of one of the most difficult periods in the history of the aluminium industry. 'The problem is the severity of the world aluminium supply-demand imbalance, which escalated in 1993 and drove ingot prices to historic lows, on an inflation-adjusted basis.' Mr Holder said that lower ingot prices rippled through a broad range of fabricated product prices. 'The primary factor in the supply-demand imbalance continued to be CIS exports, which increased an estimated 1.7m metric tons in 1993, compared to 1.2m in 1992, and only 250,000 as recently as 1989,' Mr Holder said. The world's largest aluminium producting countries met in Brussels last week to discuss solutions to the metal glut.</p>

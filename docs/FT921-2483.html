			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Henderson Land slips 12.4% to HKDollars 1.38bn HENDERSON Land Develop-ment, one of Hong Kong's leading residential property developers, announced a 12.4 per cent drop in net profit for the six months to December to HKDollars 1.38bn (Dollars 178.3m), compared with HKDollars 1.58bn in the year-earlier period. The decline came from a reduction in the number of developments completed in the first half of the year. However, the company forecast a 'satisfactory' increase in profit for the full year. Henderson completed five developments in the first half of its financial year, but it has already commenced pre-sales of a further 15 projects. Turnover declined by 23 per cent to HKDollars 2.5bn at the interim stage, due to the reduction in property sales, but there was an increase in investment income, particularly from its portfolio of shopping centres. Its two associate utility companies - Hong Kong and China Gas and Hong Kong Ferry - also reported strong profit growth. The company said that 'with local interest rates presently staying at a level below inflation rate, the public is generally keen to acquire residential properties as a hedge against inflation and the property market is likely to remain active.' The company recommended an interim dividend of 19 cents, compared with 16 cents in 1990.</p>

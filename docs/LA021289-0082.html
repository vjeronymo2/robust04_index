			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEE JACK RUN;  </P> <P> FRIENDS, FOES -- AND HIS WIFE -- WONDER WHAT TURNED MCGRATH FROM CONSULTANT TO  CANDIDATE  </P> <P> Jack McGrath, write-in candidate for the City Council, is a restless man.  </P> <P> He is forever pacing, puffing cigarettes and fidgeting with the frames on his  wire-rimmed glasses as he plots political strategy for his campaign against his  former boss and pal, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.  </P> <P> Write-in candidates rarely garner more than a fraction of the vote, but McGrath  has some big ideas. First he dropped his last name and recast himself as  "Jack." Why burden people with two names when one will do?  </P> <P> Then he took to the streets with the message that people power is back. "I love  people in the streets," he proclaimed.  </P> <P> He found one such street person, a wayward Catholic priest living in a park who  hit him up for a few bucks, and anointed him as his North Hollywood  coordinator. McGrath may not have a prayer, but at least he has a priest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grocery Store Bag  </P> <P> And he set out in search of a campaign theme and found it on the side of a  grocery store bag. "The Ralphs bags say change is for the better," McGrath  said. "I bought 200 of them. The power of that message is very strong."  </P> <P> What happens next is anyone's guess. But the "Jack for City Council" campaign  is sure to be anything but dull since the candidate is McGrath, a veteran  campaign consultant who possesses an Irish ward heeler's flair for political  showmanship.  </P> <P> The paunchy but boyishly handsome McGrath has already delivered a case of  Russian vodka and some pine saplings to the Bel-Air home of Ronald and Nancy  Reagan, two of the 5th District's newest arrivals. McGrath also invited the  former First Couple to call if they have any problems, such as potholes.  </P> <P> More recently he stood outside Yaroslavsky's City Hall office and brazenly  accused the councilman of financial shenanigans. McGrath holds Yaroslavsky  responsible for traffic congestion, intense commercial growth, the parking  shortage and just about everything else that's wrong with Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky has deftly deflected the charges leveled by his former council  chief deputy so far, but professes to be genuinely mystified by McGrath's  sudden emergence as a political foe. "I don't have much to say about it because  I have no idea why he's running," Yaroslavsky said recently.  </P> <P> Others who are close to both men also question what's motivating McGrath.  </P> <P> "It's a disastrous move," said one confidant who asked to remain anonymous.  "There's no rational basis for what Jack is doing here."  </P> <P> "People are worried about him," said another who also spoke anonymously. "A lot  of his friends don't want to have anything to do with him anymore."  </P> <P> McGrath, 43, who decided to run as a write-in candidate after he failed to  collect the 500 signatures needed to formally qualify for the ballot, says he's  aware of his friends' concerns. But in dismissing them he is fond of invoking  the name of one of his heroes, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> "I'm reaching for the promised land," McGrath said recently. "And I'm not  afraid to die politically. If I die politically, my life still goes on. But if  I don't die, that means that I get to serve my constituency."  </P> <P> People who have worked with him over the years say such hyperbole is typical of  McGrath, who was once described as the merry prankster of municipal politics.  The North Hollywood resident is credited with adding spark to the campaigns of  clients such as Yaroslavsky and state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) in the  1970s. And last November he helped mount a highly successful reelection bid on  behalf of Santa Monica City Councilman Herb Katz.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right From Wrong  </P> <P> But he also has a reputation for recklessness.  </P> <P> In 1981, while serving as campaign manager for city attorney candidate Bob  Ronka, McGrath was involved in the making of a television commercial linking  Ronka's opponent, Ira Reiner, to convicted murderer Charles Manson. McGrath  resigned under pressure after the spot was roundly denounced.  </P> <P> McGrath also got into hot water with Yaroslavsky around that time for using the  councilman's name to promote a real estate venture. People who have worked with  McGrath say he often has a hard time distinguishing right from wrong.  </P> <P> "If you don't help Jack, he will get into trouble," said one political  consultant who asked not to be named. "He has a tendency to step into it."  </P> <P> "He has always been one of the most creative people around," said another. "He  just pops with ideas. But he often loses his judgment."  </P> <P> Many see McGrath's decision to run as a perfect illustration of that point. At  the outset of the campaign season, when Yaroslavsky was expecting to run for  mayor and others started lining up to succeed him, McGrath signed on as an aide  to Steve Saltzman, a veteran political activist from Century City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Surprise  </P> <P> It was only after Yaroslavsky changed his mind and filed for reelection that  McGrath suddenly emerged as a candidate himself. "One night we had dinner with  a possible contributor," Saltzman said. "On the following morning, unbeknownst  to me, Jack filed to run for the seat. . . . It seemed ludicrous. He had no  funds, no campaign management and no support."  </P> <P> The move also came as a surprise to Yaroslavsky, since McGrath had just  attended his yearly Christmas party and given $500 to his mayoral campaign.  </P> <P> "He was patting me on the back at my party," Yaroslavsky said. "He had his arm  around me. . . . It was very friendly and chatty. I guess in the first week of  January he decided that my performance had diminished considerably."  </P> <P> The story soon made the rounds that McGrath had also neglected to reveal his  plans to his wife, Maria. McGrath concedes that she was angry about the  decision and that even now she "is not emotionally committed to this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Why Not Me?'  </P> <P> At the same time, however, McGrath defends the move. "Sometimes you have to  make your own decisions," he said. "We're not fighting over it now, though we  did initially. She said, 'Why you?' And I said, 'Why not me?' "  </P> <P> As McGrath explains it, he first became disenchanted with Yaroslavsky while  working for Saltzman. Everywhere he went, he said, people complained about  development, traffic tie-ups and other problems. "I thought, 'Jeez, what  happened?,' " he recalled.  </P> <P> McGrath kept his reservations about his old friend to himself. But when  Yaroslavsky filed for reelection in early January, causing speculation that  Saltzman would drop out, McGrath said he had to act.  </P> <P> "I spent two days considering my options," he said. "I drove around past places  where things had happened in my life. Then I decided to go for it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing to Gain  </P> <P> Many wish he hadn't. People who travel in the same political circles as McGrath  and Yaroslavsky say McGrath has nothing to gain and everything to lose.  </P> <P> "I feel it is not a productive act on his part, but I don't know how to talk to  him about it," said Jackie Brainard, a friend of both men. "I guess he really  believes he can do a better job, and that's why he's running."  </P> <P> Added Richard Lichtenstein of Marathon Communications, who hired McGrath to  help out with Santa Monica City Councilman Katz's reelection campaign: "I told  Jack that everybody's entitled to run. But I also reminded him to campaign in a  manner that's not going to do him irreparable harm."  </P> <P> As he sat inside his tidy ranch style house recently, smoking cigarettes,  drinking coffee and thumbing through a scrapbook that contains several pictures  of himself and Yaroslavsky, McGrath questioned what all the fuss is about.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Hall Experience  </P> <P> After all, he's just one of three people challenging Yaroslavsky. The others  are Westwood activist Laura M. Lake and traffic consultant Ryan Snyder. And  he's the only challenger who has City Hall experience.  </P> <P> McGrath said San Fernando Valley voters, who account for about a third of the  5th District, have been waiting for one of their own to assume power. In one of  his strongest campaign pitches, McGrath has pledged to protect his neighbors  from the kind of growth that has plagued the Westside.  </P> <P> "As councilman, I would only approve good development," McGrath said. "And when  I say good, I mean damn good. If not, let em build it in Cudahy."  </P> <P> McGrath, the son of professional dance teachers who worked at the Arthur Murray  studios, grew up in the valley and has lived there most of his life. In  addition to serving as Yaroslavsky's campaign manager and deputy, he has been a  lobbyist, a bus shelter executive and an Assembly candidate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Real Estate Broker  </P> <P> Most recently he was employed as a commercial real estate broker. McGrath said  he not concerned about his real estate dealings costing him credibility within  the slow growth community. "All we do is the buildings that Zev has already  OKd," McGrath said.  </P> <P> What people on both sides of Mulholland Drive are most interested in is finding  someone who understands and shares their frustrations, he said, adding that  solving problems is easy once you understand how the bureaucracy works.  </P> <P> On a quick ride through his neighborhood, McGrath points to a health club that  suffers from a parking shortage and a weeded area that people could be using as  a dog run, then claims he could instantaneously rectify both problems once he  got inside City Hall.  </P> <P> He expounds on that theme in a cable television commercial that highlights  problems plaguing the district. The commercial ends, inexplicably, with a  lingering shot of McGrath talking to a man bundled up like an Eskimo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credibility Problems  </P> <P> McGrath knows that he suffers some credibility problems because of his past  political mistakes and his recent failure to qualify for the ballot. But he  also revels in the role of underdog and political provocateur.  </P> <P> People who have known him for a long time say he is only happy when he's in the  thick of things.  </P> <P> "I know I'm a long shot," McGrath said. "But my whole life has been a long  shot. People said I was crazy in 1975 when I first supported Zev for the City  Council, and they're saying I'm crazy now. But these people are going to be  surprised. They're going to see the best street operation ever run."  </P></p>

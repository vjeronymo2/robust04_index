			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Leading Article: No time off for America THE US presidential election campaign has been dominated by a single question. Who can do most to revive the domestic economy - President George Bush, with his continuation of the low-tax, minimum-government strategy initiated by President Reagan, or Governor Bill Clinton, with his new interventionism? Outsiders who regard the occupant of the White House as the natural leader of the developed world must accept that foreign policy issues will not be decisive in this contest. Americans today believe that they need time off from world leadership. Preoccupied with social and economic problems at home, they have come to see their incumbent president's interest in foreign policy as an expensive luxury. In deciding for or against him next Tuesday they will be asking who can, above all, restore the American economy's ability to withstand global competition, create employment, generate wealth and arrest the descent of important cities into anarchy. At best this mood reflects an understanding that superpower status, even if measured by military strength and exercised by diplomatic skills, depends in the long term on a productive economy and a cohesive society. Yet Americans should be under no illusion that they can solve their domestic problems purely through domestic policy. While the main military threat to US security has disappeared, the US economy is much more dependent on international trade today than in the past. More than ever the US needs an open world market. Free trade President George Bush appreciates this. He has grasped the opportunity of Mexico's conversion to free trade, and has given high priority to the Uruguay Round, in spite of many interest groups lobbying in the opposite direction. Mr Bill Clinton appears to share the free trade orientation, but the contrary pressures within his party are stronger. Security issues are equally important. Experience has taught Americans that their security is ultimately bound up with that of Europe. They cannot be indifferent to the success or failure of political reform in Russia. They cannot but regard China's rapid economic growth as at once an opportunity and a threat. They must be worried by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in controlling which both Russian and Chinese co-operation will be essential. And they should worry also about the world population explosion and the ecological balance of the planet - issues inseparable from the gnawing question of third world poverty. Broader challenges In dealing with such issues, Mr Bush's record has been mixed. He was deft and forceful in handling the reunification of Germany; even more so in organising the response to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait. He has averted the fragmentation of Soviet nuclear forces; shown strategic vision in dealing with China; and brought Arabs and Israelis together in a promising peace process. But he has not risen to the broader challenges of the time. Understandably, the US has no appetite for the role of universal policeman. But under Mr Bush it has not gone very far, either, in adapting its policies to favour an effective multi-polar system. In Europe, it has payed lip service to European unity while allowing a weak dollar to help pull the European monetary system apart. It has insisted on the primacy of Nato in security matters, yet discouraged any Nato involvement in coping with the most serious breakdown of European security, in Yugoslavia. Latterly even the control of arms exports has been sacrificed to electoral interests. Mr Clinton is inexperienced in foreign policy but has good advisers, drawn from a party with a tradition of paying prices and bearing burdens in the cause of freedom. A Clinton victory would not necessarily bring a change for the worse in foreign policy - or an improvement in domestic policy. While ridiculing Mr Bush's 'read my lips' pledge, Mr Clinton has given a similar hostage to fortune by promising not to increase taxes on 'the middle class'. Whoever wins will be immediately confronted with the task of promoting growth in the domestic economy, tackling the budget deficit, and, at the same time, refocusing on the inescapable global responsibilities of what is still the most powerful nation on earth.</p>

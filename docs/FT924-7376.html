			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Edvard Munch, a soul exposed - William Packer reviews the exhibition at the National Gallery 'I have always worked best with my paintings around me. I placed them together and felt that some of the pictures related to each other through the subject matter. When they were placed together, a sound went through them right away, and they became quite different from when they were separate - they became a symphony'. So wrote Norway's greatest painter Edvard Munch, in explaining how he came to see his work as a unified and cumulative expression of his ideas. There is of itself nothing unusual in this, save only that Munch's approach to his work was peculiarly and insistently subjective in the meanings and interpretations he loaded onto it. For so directly visual a medium of communication, and so essentially painterly the manner of its employment, so literary a reading of the imagery is remarkable. Munch came to his conclusion in a general way early in his career, in relation to his work around 1890 that centred upon an unhappy love-affair, and maintained it throughout his life - he died in 1944 at the age of 80. Again, there is nothing unusual in the picture of the artist surrounded by his work, but, with Munch, the work he seems constantly to have kept by him, even in his old age, was that of this, his early maturity, extending through the 1890s. The concept of 'The Frieze of Life' as a more comprehensive cycle of paintings, taking the theme beyond Love and its defeats to Melancholy, Anxiety and finally to Death, seems to have crystalised in his mind somewhat later in the 1890s, and it was under that title that he showed a large retrospective group of these paintings at the Berlin Secession of 1902. Munch clearly attached the greatest significance to 'The Frieze' cycle. Here, if anywhere, he felt, was concentrated the very essence of his art. And it is this essence that has been brought to the National Gallery, in as close as possible a reassembly of that first 'Frieze' show of 1902. A hundred years ago almost to the day an earlier show in Berlin was closed down in a storm of controversy and complaint, and Munch has remained, if not quite so controversial, at least a difficult artist ever since. If this comparatively small but spectacular exhibition, beautifully installed, does not persuade you that he was indeed a great artist, nothing will. The difficulty, if difficulty it is, lies in part with subject-matter that is obviously and intensely personal, but rather more with the manner of its realisation. Munch was a sophisticated and thoroughly professional painter, and here we are given repeated demonstrations of his mastery. The self-portrait of 1895 with which the show begins, the artist's disembodied head and hand, brightly lit from below, emerging from the shadows and wreathed in cigarette-smoke, is one of the great self-portraits of any age. The woman standing before her house, ghost-like in the moonlight, is again one of the great images of its period and worked with manifest sensitivity. The woodcuts throughout are wonders of virtuoso simplicity. And yet rather more often we confront an image stark in its presentation, raw in its colour, the paint thin, the drawing perfunctory, the figures grotesque. It is not that Munch cannot paint but rather, so intense is his involvement with his image and idea, and so impatient is he to resolve them, that he can hardly be bothered to do so. The mark, the gesture, driven by an intuitive desperation and without further refinement, must stand as they are, the very soul and truth of his creative expression. 'I do not paint what I see', he said, 'but what I saw.' 'Nature . . . is the inner reflection of the soul.' 'I felt as if a scream was going through nature . . . I painted . . . the clouds like real blood. The colours were screaming.' 'And I painted what I remembered without adding anything - without the details I could no longer see . . . I painted pictures from my childhood . . .' Here we confront a great paradox of art, for the artist has only his experience of life and the world from which to work, yet to be so self-centred is to risk limitation and irrelevance. The danger with Munch is always the too-literal biographical and psychological reading of his work, his difficulties in love, the deaths in the family, the nervous debility. His vindication and triumph as an artist is that in pursuing so relentlessly his personal obsessions, he yet allows them a universal relevance, that we may come to in our own way. The melancholy of rejection and the pain of jealous love were very much his own, in the lonely figure sitting on the rocks at twilight, with the new lovers together at a distance, but the pain is there for us to share, and the truth universal. The kiss of passion is transformed into the bite of the Vampire: the Sphinx shown in the three characters of Woman - virgin, temptress and mother - and no wonder a dejected and puzzled man hides in the shadows. 'The Sick Child', of 1896, was the occasion of yet more scandal when it was first shown. Now, with its companion version, made some ten years later, it hangs at the centre of the show, just as Munch himself acknowledged it to be at the very heart of his work. The death in adolescence of his sister, Sophie, had deeply affected him. Here, long afterwards, he works through his still-active grief, as it were objectively, to produce a work of magisterial authority and radical simplicity, the surface reworked, as though to conjure the integral image out of the memory. 'No painting', he tells us, 'has ever caused such disapproval in Norway. On the opening day . . . people were crowding in front of (it) - there was laughter and shouting . . . ' Together with the exquisite lithograph of the child's head, of which there are about a hundred variations, it is gentle and affecting, and as beautiful a painting as any he ever made.

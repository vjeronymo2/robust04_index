			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Hassan II on the occasion of Throne Day, the </F> 33d anniversary of Hassan's accession to the throne, in Rabat --  live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Last year was full of  variously important events, diversified according to the time  and place where they occurred. Most of these events were  important, however, and they affect our history. Assuredly, as  days pass, we will adequately appreciate their significance and  fully understand their lessons.    In view of the great upheavals witnessed during the last  decade, one can say that the post-war era has come to an end and  that a new era is on the horizon. In our view, the agreement  signed in Washington will be the most important event defining  the outlines of the future. What was considered a figment of  imagination yesterday--or at best a possibility--is gradually  turning into a reality today in front of our eyes. Perhaps the  plots and conspiracies will come to an end soon, plots that  lasted a whole century and that were concocted against a whole  people and--behind them--the whole Arab nation. However, we  must not surrender to optimism more than we should, because  clouds are still hiding the horizons of the future and because  the road is still full of obstacles.    We are satisfied that both parties in the Arab-Israeli  negotiations are seriously and truly determined to take the  peace process to its conclusion. As far as we are concerned, we  have worked for peace for more than 20 years, by calling for it  and working to achieve it. This allowed us to talk about the  matter all sides with the required frankness.    We told the Israelis that they had to deal with the facts  because the first Gaza-Jericho agreement is only a stage. Peace  will not become real and lasting unless it is comprehensive and  encompasses all the occupied Arab land. As to the Palestinians,  we brought to their attention the fundamental change their  behavior must undergo because they are no longer merely fighters  seeking to liberate their land, but responsible leaders  answerable to their people and to the world.    Yes, it is true that their struggle and their many  sacrifices  brought them affection and support from all parts of the world.  This deserves to be praised, especially since their adversary  enjoyed the unconditional support of the majority of the great  powers. Now they must make use of this affection and support  without hesitation and reap the benefits. The Arab-Israeli  negotiations are still continuing and are going through  difficult times, in which it is difficult to disentangle the  intricacies. Nevertheless, it will reach its aim. The whole  world wishes for this and works toward it. [passage omitted]    We arrive now at the issues of our relations with our  foreign  partners and allies. Primary among these problems, naturally,  is that of the ties that we are trying to ensure between us and  the EEC. The proposals made to us in December 1993 were not to  our liking. They did not please us. For this reason, we  presented to our partners a document containing our reaction to  these proposals, and recalling, in particular, the decision made  by the ministerial meeting of the 12 states aimed at concluding  a new agreement with Morocco based on four main foundations:  political dialogue; economic, technical, and cultural  partnership in the sectors of common interest; the gradual  establishing of a free trade zone; and financial cooperation.  We insisted, in particular, on the need for Moroccan products  to enter the EEC market, particularly our agricultural products.    As for the European program, it is, regrettably,  characterized by caution and ambiguity. It is contenting itself  with maintaining the usual monetary machine. Without clear  commitment, it makes promises that there will be a discussion in  the future about financial matters. Pending the early  implementation of a new agreement--soon, hopefully--Morocco  believes that beginning now it has become necessary to reexamine  the current agreement so that it may be in accord with the  effects of the Uruguay round and the requirements of the  European Union market. Morocco also urges its partners to be  more understanding and more open and to treat Morocco the way it  is treating them.    My dear people: Neither the challenges of the issues we have  just raised nor their priority could make us forget the  essential issue that comes at the top of our concerns--namely,  the issue of our territorial unity. We are, as far as our  Sahara is concerned, still committed to organizing a  confirmatory, self-determination referendum under UN control  that will lead to the final joining together of our southern  provinces with the motherland.    Despite the dilatory ambiguities and tricks of our  opponents,  we are certain that the international community will know how to  impose its commitments and implement the various decisions that  have been agreed upon to this effect.    We are naturally pleased--while talking about our  territorial  unity--to raise the thorny issue of Ceuta and Mellila and  neighboring islands that are still under Spanish authority. We  have been keen so far, in faithfulness to our longstanding  traditions, to avoid confrontations that would lead us nowhere  and that might only lead to worsening of relations between Spain  and Morocco.    We have always tried to solve our problems in peaceful ways  based on consultation and negotiation--always driven by the firm  conviction that the course of time will not affect our rights  and that there will be no concessions concerning this part of  our land. In an attempt to bring our positions and those of our  neighbor closer, we have proposed to our Spanish friends to  establish jointly a think tank, which will be in charge of  examining a solution that would secure the rights of one side  and preserve the interests of the other. It has become  impossible to delay the solution indefinitely. Therefore, we  hope that our proposal will be well received so that a solution  is found for an abnormal situation. [passage omitted]</p>

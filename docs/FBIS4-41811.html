			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report published under the rubric "Fact"] </F>   [Text] Foreign specialists, who visited the "White  Panther" [Bila Pantera] special-purpose battalion within the  Kiev regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, were highly impressed  by the level of training of the guards. One can imagine how  surprised they might be if they had learned that the  special-purpose guards' nourishment is worse than that of  regular servicemen and that the average pay received by the  commander of the battalion constitutes 400,000 coupons a month.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Air traffic stages modest recovery UK AIR traffic staged a very modest recovery in the first quarter of this year after last year's slump caused by the Gulf war and the economic recession. Passenger traffic at airports in the south-east run by BAA, the airports operator, increased by 19 per cent to 13.6m passengers in the first quarter, against 11.4m in the same period last year at the height of the Gulf conflict. The BAA figures, published yesterday, show traffic increased by barely 1 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1990. Passenger traffic last month rose 12 per cent on March last year and was flat compared with March 1990. The small recovery in passenger numbers compared with 1990 reflects the continuing impact of the recession. Traffic at London's Heathrow airport has shown the strongest improvement, but Gatwick is still struggling to recover former passenger levels. Traffic at Heathrow increased to 9.5m in the first quarter of this year from 7.7m in the same period last year and 9.2m in 1990. In contrast traffic at Gatwick totalled 3.7m passengers in the first quarter of this year compared with 3.5m last year and 4m in 1990. Apart from the recession, Gatwick was hit by several airlines' decision to transfer operations to Heathrow after the government last year scrapped London air-traffic rules and opened access into Heathrow to all carriers. Food at Heathrow has made impressive improvements during recent months, while food at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris is 'disastrous' and 'abysmal', according to a report by Mr Egon Ronay, the food critic. A survey published yesterday by Mr Ronay's magazine said of the French airport: 'How a nation which justly prides itself on its gastronomic prowess could tolerate what we consider is disastrous food, particularly in an international shop window, is beyond me.' By contrast there had been a 'remarkable and commendable transformation' at Heathrow after an unfavourable first report. 'It is heartening to see what can be achieved after a none-too-gentle prod,' Mr Ronay said.</p>

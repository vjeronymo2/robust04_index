			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tracking the behaviour of stock pickers - A Citywatch survey taking in 50 of the UK's largest fund managers A group of 12 leading fund managers account for half the 'stock-picking' behaviour of the UK stock market, disproportionately contributing to the volatility of individual share prices, according to a new study. The study, conducted by Citywatch, a City information service which monitors institutional shareholding, concluded also that many fund managers do very little real stock-picking. Instead, their choices closely mimic the relative value of shares within the FT-A All-Share Index although they do not necessarily describe themselves to clients as index trackers. 'There certainly are closet indexers out there who do not take any bets on stocks,' said the chairman of one leading UK fund management company. 'Clients may well ask themselves 'why am I paying active management fees for passive management?'', he said. Active fund managers typically earn fees of 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent while passive index-trackers may charge clients no more than 0.05 per cent of assets under management. The Citywatch survey included 50 of the UK's largest fund managers measured by asset size. However, of these, several are in-house managers who do not compete for clients and a number are UK insurance companies whose clients consist largely of their own policyholders. The data was gathered by examining the share registers in early November of all UK traded companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 300m or above. Citywatch identified the ultimate holders behind the nominee companies and was able to distinguish which shareholders controlled each group of shares. Mr Mark O'Hare, chief executive of Citywatch, says the data also has implications for companies' relations with their shareholders. It might be argued that directors should focus their attentions on improving communication with stock-pickers who will dump or buy shares depending on their perception of the company. There could be less value in wooing shareholders who are likely to maintain an indexed holding in the company regardless of its prospects. Citywatch approached its analysis by first identifying the average percentage of individual company shares held by each manager and the difference between each manager's largest and smallest percentage holdings. Researchers then calculated a standard deviation, the extent to which a manager's percentage shareholding varies from one company to the next. It is this calculation which is said to indicate stock picking behaviour (see table). The study found that M&amp;G, the UK-based unit trust company, had the greatest propensity to stock pick. Others who rank high on the list of stock-pickers include Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford, Clerical Medical, Gartmore Investment Management, Guardian Royal Exchange and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, which is in the most active 15, says he is not surprised by the findings. 'M&amp;G have a pronounced value style focusing on recovery stocks,' he said. By contrast, Gartmore, has a management style which emphasises so-called growth stocks. If a manager makes selections based on changes in, say, share price-to-book value, he is by definition a stock picker. However, the fact that a manager stock picks does not tell you everything you need to know about his style, according to Mr Myners. Gartmore ranks equally with PDFM on stock-picking 'but we are mirror images of each other'. While both managers have outperformed the industry average in recent years, PDFM looks for stocks with a low price-earnings ratio, a very different approach from that of Gartmore. Not surprisingly, Citywatch found the lowest propensity to stock pick evident among fund managers whose avowed policy is to manage an index-tracking pool as part of their UK equities portfolio. Heading this list is Postel Investment Management with several large in-house managed funds close behind. Pension scheme consultants who advise clients on picking a fund manager said the data largely confirms the views they have formed from a more qualitative assessment of styles. However, they cautioned against relying solely on that type of analysis to form judgments. 'You have got to know about each manager's client base,' says Mr Michael Coop, assistant investment consultant at actuarial firm R Watson and Co. The tendency to stock pick may be as much a reflection of the type of mandate the manager has won, as it is of style. Also, because the data only examined the larger companies traded on the London Stock Exchange, a manager who stock picks heavily among smaller companies would not show up.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           FUND MANAGERS' HOLDINGS AND STOCK PICKING ACTIVITY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Average %        Standard                                   holding in       deviation                                    UK stocks            from                                                     average*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH ACTIVITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- M&amp;G                                 0.77               2.08 Clerical Medical                    0.42               1.94 Confederation Life                  0.33               1.87 Guardian Royal Exch                 0.40               1.80 Abu Dhabi Inv Auth                  0.67               1.78 Lucas Pension Trustees              0.34               1.78 Britannic Assurance                 0.51               1.76 Baillie Gifford                     0.43               1.70 Provident Mutual                    0.48               1.65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOW ACTIVITY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Average %        Standard                                   holding in       deviation                                    UK stocks            from                                                     average*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Postel Inv Mgmt                     1.48               0.23 Legal &amp; General                     1.97               0.28 ESN Pension Mgmt                    1.02               0.35 County Natwest IM                   1.05               0.34 Bankers Trust IM                    0.49               0.44 British Gas Corp                    0.63               0.48 Shell Pension Trustees              0.49               0.49 British Pet Pen Trustees            0.51               0.50 General Accident                    0.51               0.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Variation in size of holdings in an institution's portfolio, adjusted for the institution's size.

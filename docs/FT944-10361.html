			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Lisbon diplomat to head WEU Mr Jose Cutileiro, a senior Portuguese diplomat whose candidacy enjoyed the support of Britain, was appointed yesterday to the top job at the Western European Union, a nine-nation security club of growing importance. The choice of Mr Cutileiro, 59, who joined the Portuguese foreign ministry after Lisbon's democratic revolution in 1974, marked a success for London's drive to boost Europe's defences in a way that avoids weakening Nato. Yesterday's choice of secretary general, taken by a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, will be formally endorsed when WEU foreign and defence ministers gather at Noordwijk in the Netherlands on Monday to discuss ways of upgrading the organisation. Two rival candidates - the Italian ambassador to Nato, Mr Giovanni Jannuzzi, and Mr Enrique Baron Crespo, a Spanish Socialist politician - stepped aside after initial soundings showed that Germany had swung behind Mr Cutileiro. France - the strongest advocate of an independent European defence capacity  -initially backed Mr Jannuzzi but gave away after the Germans opted for the Portuguese candidate, who already enjoyed UK and Dutch backing. Diplomats said the two unsuccessful candidates had decided not to insist on a definitive vote which would have damaged the fledgling institution's credibility. 'It would have looked bad if somebody had won in defiance of several major countries,' one diplomat commented. The WEU is already involved in naval operations to enforce the international embargo against the former Yugoslav republics, and it is also setting up a police force in the divided city of Mostar. But its role - hitherto dwarfed by Nato - looks certain to grow as the US partially disengages from Europe and the European Union develops a common foreign and security policy. Britain has set aside its earlier doubts about the organisation, and it now sees the WEU as a useful way of developing defence relations with its continental allies, including France which is outside the military wing of Nato. Mr Cutileiro - who won acclaim in his homeland by writing a doctoral thesis at Oxford University on inequality in southern Portugal - will have to bridge the gap between French zeal and British caution over upgrading the WEU. But he comes up from a country whose views on European security overlap considerably with those of the UK. Both Britain and Portugal want to avoid creating fissures in eastern Europe by rushing to draw some ex-communist states into the western security system while keeping others out.</p>

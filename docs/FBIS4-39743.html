			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Jun -- "Russia is not threatened with the  fate of the USSR, which disintegrated. The fourth anniversary  since the day that the declaration on the state sovereignty of  the Russian Federation was adopted on 12 June, 1990, confirms  that the Russian Federation, in acquiring its independence, has  been preserved as an integral state and is continuing to grow  stronger." This was the stand expressed by Sergey Filatov, head  of the Russian President's administration, on the eve of the  state holiday.    Filatov attributes great significance in the strengthening  of  the Federation to the working out of a new regional policy,  which still has not been reinforced by the constitutions of the  Russian republics, by the regulations of the krays and oblasts,  and by the law on local administration, which the State Duma is  scheduled to adopt in June. According to Filatov, the efforts  of the state legal administration and the directorate for work  with the territories under the Russian president, as well as of  the Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, will  be aimed at equipping the subjects of the Federation with their  own legislation.    In Filatov's opinion, adopting the bilateral treaty between  Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that became the prologue to  establishing new relations between the center and the subjects  of the Federation -- was an important landmark in strengthening  the Russian Federation. Similar agreements will be signed in  the near future with Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkortostan, and  Kaliningrad Oblast, and in the future with all subjects of the  Federation.    Filatov said that it was the purpose of state policy to  achieve a "wealthy and uniform standard of living for all the  citizens of Russia," which is only attainable in conditions  where there is accord in society.    To implement the treaty on public accord, to which 854  state,  political, and public figures put their signatures to last  month, a decree from Boris Yeltsin on the transformation of the  public chamber supervised by the Russian president into a  conciliatory coordinating body is expected in the near future.</p>

This was the reaction of the  Belgrade Patriarchate to the claim by Archbishop Mihail,  newly-elected head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which have  recently been published in the media, that Patriarch Pavle said  that "Macedonians are a people, they have their state, and they  have the right to have their own church."

Islam Karimov Aspires to the  Role of Leonid Brezhnev, Apparently, in the Affairs of Our  Southern Neighbor"]    [Text] For 10 long years, the word "Afghanistan" was  ever present in the newspapers. Journalists of the Lenin school  would adduce it with well-paid pride; ordinary people would  utter it with condemnation or hatred.    Time has passed, and the Amudarya was left astern of  the last Soviet tank, and Afghanistan remains merely in the  nostalgic songs of burned and legless poets. It has once again  become as alien and remote as prior to 1979, when the  semi-idiotic slack-jawed old man called on us from the  television screen to fulfill our "international duty."    But those who think that peace and prosperity have come  to reign in Afghanistan following our departure are wrong. Not  always is fighting followed by peace, and it happens that one  war is replaced by another--as has been the case in Afghanistan  also. Jihad--"holy war against the infidel"--has come to be  replaced by civil war--a war of all against all. The  "international duty" in whose name Afghanistan was in flames for  a whole decade dragged out into the open all the conflicts that  had built up over centuries in Afghan society, inundated  it--illiterate and backward--with piles of weapons, and made it  ungovernable. And after the Soviet departure, the fire of war  not only did not die out, but flared up with even greater force.    According to eyewitnesses, the devastation of recent  years has surpassed many times over what was done with our  "assistance": Kabul, for example, has already simply died; it  does not exist. And considering that it is around this latter  that the main struggle is being conducted, it may be assumed  that there will shortly be nothing left to fight over. This  might seem improbable and blasphemous, but many people in  Afghanistan remember with nostalgia the days when the "shuravi"  [Russians] were there--in just the same way that the most  inveterate democrats in Russia are beginning increasingly with a  wistful sigh to recall stagnation. The reason is the same:  "There was at least some order then. Now...."    But, as reality shows, it is still somewhat early to  forget conclusively about Afghanistan. The Afghan knot not only  has not been completely untied; it has in places--primarily on  the southern flanks of the former USSR--been pulled even  tighter. We have tried to pull out one of the threads of this  knot.    I would like to call the reader's attention to the fact  that none of what is discussed below is the fruit of the  imagination of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA journalists. We  obtained the information that we are making public via two  channels, perfectly reliable, not connected with one another,  and sufficiently authenticated, of the former KGB (we will not  specify the subdivision) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  Russia. We set forth the viewpoint of these specialists, who,  for understandable reasons, wished to remain incognito.    Were someone to try to make a national-ethnic map of  Afghanistan, he would, most likely, get something akin to a  patchwork quilt: dozens of tribes and national groups, related,  for the most part, to our Central Asian groups, and dozens of  independent enclaves, where local "authorities"--of varying  caliber, but united by a single aspiration--never to submit to  anyone ever--rule. It was precisely the inveterate  national-ethnic conflicts--primarily between the Pashtuns,  Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazara--that were the basis of the  antagonism that erupted in Afghanistan following the withdrawal  of the Soviet forces.    As we all know, the principal "heroes" of this protracted  armed confrontation have from the outset been the Tajik Rabbani,  the present president of Afghanistan, and the Pashtun Gulbuddin  Hikmatyar, who in the years of the Soviet presence were,  perhaps, the main figures in the Afghan resistance. But others  besides them have been participating in this game also.  Specifically, Gen. Rashid Dostum, whose name surfaced in our  press only recently in connection with the combat operations  that he mounted in Kabul at the start of January. In the game of  chess that we wish to investigate, this figure is, perhaps, of  greater significance than his distinguished competitors, and we  will dwell on him, therefore.    Gen. Rashid Dostum is, in his way, a unique personality.  Primarily because there have been practically no Uzbek generals  in Afghanistan. Uzbeks never fought here, being one of the most  peaceful groups of the population. But in the final years of the  war, an Uzbek volunteer force, which was headed by Dostum and on  which, however odd, Kabul officialdom--Pashtun--came to rely,  emerged. The Uzbek militia took part increasingly often in the  armed struggle against the mojahedin and subsequently was the  main lever that....removed Najibullah himself.    Subsequently, Dostum became the uncrowned king of all the  enclaves of Afghanistan populated by Uzbeks, this being several  northern provinces of the country bordering Uzbekistan and,  partially, Tajikistan. Having seized power in the north, he  concentrated in his hands a very strong military grouping. He  succeeded in uniting under his command colossal  forces--practically all the government formations located in  this region--with a large quantity of hardware, up to and  including aircraft and tanks. In addition, the main weapons  stores from the time when arms had been transferred from the  territory of the USSR were based in the north. And, finally, the  Afghan North means, in addition, the most economically developed  zone of the country, where gas is recovered and mineral  fertilizer is produced, and where the Afghan granary is located.  And Dostum was able to bring all this under his control.    It is for this reason, most likely, that the antagonistic  groupings of Rabbani and Hikmatyar conducted a constant struggle  for him, attempting to win the general over to their side. And  at the same time, on the other hand, they were unwilling to  recognize him as an independent political force and equal  participant in the political process or let him into Kabul. The  Pashtuns and Tajiks continued to keep the Uzbeks at the  doorstep. This is, generally, typical of the politics of any  country: No one wants to admit to the game a new player, to  acknowledge for him the same rights even less. It was made known  to Dostum, as it were: You are a powerful and robust fellow,  just stay up there in the north and do not butt in here. But he  wanted more. And this grievance is a reason why General Dostum's  artillery has begun to speak in Kabul as of late.    The processes occurring in Afghanistan, particularly in the  north, long since ceased to be exclusively Afghan. The extensive  involvement of Tajikistan here is obvious and not in question.  But a tremendous place is occupied here also by Uzbek interests,  which is, in fact, the main subject of this article.    According to our source from the Russian special services,  Islam Karimov and his circle almost immediately began to regard  the northern zone of Afghanistan, which is populated by ethnic  Uzbeks, as their own patrimony. Not as a piece of Uzbekistan, of  course, but, at least, as a zone that lies in the sphere of  their "vital interests." "Tashkent," he said, "immediately  gambled on Dostum and has in the past 18 months to two years  turned him, essentially, into Karimov's puppet. This is written  about extremely infrequently even in intelligence material--it  is too delicate a subject."    Uzbekistan has picked up with enthusiasm the relay baton  dropped by the Soviet Union and is attempting to do everything  to take its place--in the region of interest to it, at least.  Remember the rail bridge across the Amudarya, on one side of  which is Uzbek Termez, on the other, the Afghan Khayraton, the  headquarters of General Dostum. Earlier the Soviet Union fed  almost all of Afghanistan via this artery; now it is being used  by the Uzbeks. It is just that the freight traveling along it is  intended exclusively for General Dostum. This fact is not  paraded anywhere, we were told in confidence in the Foreign  Ministry. This is being done in concealed and clandestine  manner--so clandestinely that it is assumed that even the  Russian General Consulate is unaware of this.    What is actually crossing the Uzbek-Afghan border? Weapons,  primarily. According to our contact in intelligence, Tashkent is  providing fully for Dostum's small arms and ammunition  requirements, driving armored equipment across the border....  Not, of course, on the scale and in the flow as was formerly the  case from the Soviet Union, but it is more than enough for the  northerners. In addition, aside from the weapons, Dostum is  receiving from Uzbekistan wheat, sugar, petroleum  products--everything without which he could not exist. This is  partially being done on a noncompensable basis, partially--as  far as the weapons are concerned--for hard currency. The Uzbeks  take dollars from their ethnic brothers with pleasure--and the  flow of weapons into Afghanistan is constant.    Uzbekistan's positions in the camp of General Dostum today  are very reminiscent of those that the Soviet Union once had in  Kabul. Dostum is surrounded by Uzbek advisers, and constant  contact is maintained at the top political leadership level and  at the special services level. The Uzbek consul general is the  No. 2 after Dostum himself, and he is the point of contact for  the general's whole entourage. That is, there is total apical  adhesion. On top of everything else, it is based on Tashkent's  continuous direct bribery of Dostum and his circle. If just a  year ago, even, some general of Dostum's drove around in a  Volga, he was considered somebody. There are now in Dostum's  retinue approximately 150 brand-new Rajero jeeps. Or, for  example, Dostum drives to a meeting with an Uzbek leader  somewhere closer to the border. Uzbek combat helicopters fly  here--"to guard Comrade Dostum"....    According to our contacts in the Foreign Ministry and  intelligence, their colleagues coming from Afghanistan tell of  literally incredible things--incredible from the viewpoint of  any normal state. An Uzbek Government delegation goes to  Mazar-e-Sharif to meet with General Dostum, say. It does not  inquire about visas, does not register the border  crossing--nothing! Helicopters simply fly in and set down, as if  at home. And unless Kabul officials are given a "knock on the  door" in time, they do not even find out about this--no one asks  them about or tells them anything. Yet we are talking about the  arrival of an official delegation at the ministerial and deputy  ministerial level! What is this--de facto recognition of the  existence of some virtually independent Uzbek state on the  territory of Afghanistan?    Whatever authorities are in place in Kabul, and however they  are torn apart among themselves, it has been difficult for them,  of course, to put up with such humiliation. This is why they  have been attempting to lay hold of Dostum. For six months,  longer, perhaps, Rabbani and his circle have been attempting to  besiege Dostum if only somewhat and put him in his place. He was  "rapped on the knuckles" when he attempted to expand the sphere  of his influence and has sometimes even been forced out of the  zones that he has traditionally controlled. Thus as a result of  one such action, on 14 November Dostum lost his base of Sherkhan  on the border with Tajikistan. "Speaking in confidence," a  well-informed employee of Russia's Foreign Ministry notified us,  "the Uzbeks even started to complain to us about this: Comrade  Dostum--our supporter--they say, who is defending Russia's  interests as well, is being squeezed by the damn Islamists.  Earnestly trying to persuade us that Dostum is a conduit of our  interests and a defender of the borders, they asked us to give  him weapons (and he wanted a great many). But this trick did not  work, fortunately. And 'damn Islamists' had absolutely nothing  to do with it--it was an exclusively Afghan showdown: Kabul was  putting the squeeze on the Uzbeks, who, from its viewpoint, had  somewhat overstepped the mark."    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA experts were unanimous in  surmising that the position of Dostum, autonomous and hostile  toward all, has been programmed and continues to be programmed,  by all accounts, by Karimov. After all, he who pays the piper  calls the tune. Were it not for the powerful Uzbek influence,  Dostum would, most likely, be behaving somewhat differently, and  his relations with the central authorities would be organized  more flexibly, at least. But under the pressure of the Uzbeks  and relying constantly on their assistance, he has been able to  permit himself such a line of behavior.    What has happened today? There are two versions in this  connection, and they are not mutually exclusive, what is more.    First version. The aggrieved, dissatisfied general simply  decided to bare his teeth. And he had teeth: Dostum's armed  formations were in Kabul, even, controlling several important  points.    The second version is that it is Tashkent, possibly, which  pushed Dostum into this war. Karimov is very unhappy at all the  recent events--the results of Rabbani's visit to Dushanbe and  the signs of fraternization of the Tajiks--ours and their Afghan  counterparts--that have emerged. And so he decided via his  protege to emphasize his interests, without, possibly, looking  for anything in particular, what is more. "I believe," the  intelligence expert told us, "that Karimov is sufficiently smart  and understands that Dostum is not in a position to aspire to a  seizure of power in Kabul, even technically. But this way he  could make his presence felt. The Afghan Uzbeks are very simple  people, and pushing them and inciting them to some serious  actions is not difficult, therefore. So I do not rule out there  having been direct pressure, direct prompting from Tashkent,  here. Any assistance, any support was promised, and Dostum was  told: Do as much as you can; they are victimizing you and  hitting you on both cheeks.... You need to show them. Come on,  boy, let us go into action." This is conjecture, of course, but  it may be considered correct, because it is difficult to find a  logical explanation for this entire business otherwise.    One further factor that has to be taken into account when  analyzing this mixed-up game of solitaire is the mutual  relations and intermingling of interests of Tashkent and  Dushanbe. As the Foreign Ministry specialist believes, Tashkent  would not want to see the failure of the present Tajik regime,  but nor at the same time is it interested in national  reconciliation in Tajikistan. It is Karimov, by all accounts,  who is pushing President Rakhimov toward the most radical,  extreme position in the struggle against his adversaries. In  analysts' opinion, he would like a solution of the Tajik problem  on his, Uzbek terms, even hoping, perhaps, for the  disintegration of Tajikistan and the annexation of some Tajik  territories--disputed oblasts with mixed population--to  Uzbekistan.    On the other hand, Tajikistan cannot today be regarded as a  serious rival in the Afghan game. Essentially, Tajikistan itself  barely still exists in practice: There is no authority, the  government is incredibly weak, the economy is not working,  levers of administration are lacking, and there are no effective  special services or armed forces. Tajikistan is not currently a  working proposition. It is for this reason fully dependent on  Russia, and Karimov is constantly reproaching the president of  Tajikistan for this dependence, incidentally, failing to  understand that the latter simply cannot act otherwise.    Uzbekistan itself is already pursuing its own national  policy, exaggeratedly national, what is more. It is literally  supplanting Russia on the southern flanks, saying, as it were:  This is our border, this is our zone of responsibility, these  are our interests, there is nothing for you to do here. The same  thing is constantly being drilled into the Afghans, Dostum  included.    This entire situation prompts very serious reflection.  Several years ago, when the fratricidal Afghan strife erupted,  many people got a headache: Now, they said, Islamic  fundamentalism will spill across the border and flow over Soviet  territory, engulfing our republics. Life turned out differently.  Now, it would seem, the Central Asian republics of the former  USSR could be a center of problems. It is from there that the  blast waves of hard-core nationalism and separatism will come.  And this is being manifested today even in the game that is  being played around Afghanistan: The events occurring there are  dictated to a tremendous extent by the Central Asia factor.    The creation and formation of Central Asian states could  prove more frightening than Islamic fundamentalism. They are  artificial and never existed on the map within their present  borders, in their present form, in their present shapes. Within  the framework of the Soviet Union, they were not normal,  full-fledged states either: Tied by an umbilical cord to Moscow,  they were nursed and fed from there and controlled from there.  And now a process of their national-state formation, which  simply cannot be painless, is under way. It will certainly be  fraught with incredible excesses, which we can partially see  today, even.    It is perfectly possible that unless other powers, Russia  included, succeed in bringing this process under some prudent  control, we will acquire an immense zone of regional crisis  called Central Asia--a long and painful crisis that could bring  about a total recarving of the borders and colossal human and  other casualties. This would be a Transcaucasus squared. Signs  of this gathering storm are in evidence. Will it be averted?    This will depend on many things, on Russia included.    In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, Russia's eastern  policy needs, generally, to be devised from scratch, because the  old one has failed, and there is no new one as yet. Nor,  furthermore, should it be as rectilinear as yesterday or as  amorphous as today. The political course in respect to this  region should be as flexible, subtle, and multifaceted as  possible. Especially since no one in Afghanistan any longer  views Russia as an enemy, and all, including the most odious  personalities, are prepared to cooperate with it today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov has forwarded a  letter to the UN secretary general and the chairman of the UN  Security Council to inform them of the Armenian Armed Forces'  banditry attack on the [name indistinct] locality in Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic's Sharurskiy Rayon on 27 May. Nine  Azerbaijani troops were wounded and four others were killed in  the incident.    Gasan Gasanov described the Armenian Armed Forces' attack as  an act of banditry. He said: The military operation has taken  place in a locality which is very far from Daghlyk Karabakh. It  occurred while Azerbaijan strictly adheres to the agreement on  the imposition of a cease-fire. Consequently, it conflicts with  the talks that are held within the CSCE framework, in which  resolutions are drawn up and adopted for a political solution to  the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    Gasan Gasanov urged the UN, the CSCE, and other  international  organizations to condemn the Armenian militarists' aggressive  activities and take measures to obstruct Armenia's aggression  against Azerbaijan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has said: Our aim is  to preserve the country. What we are seeking through our stance  is the best interests of the people.    Addressing large public delegations that flocked to his  residence from various areas in Lebanon today, he said: Our  assets are the good people of this country. The country has had  enough of 17 years of war. The country has been hijacked for 17  years, and now is the time for our good people to govern, and  you represent these good people.

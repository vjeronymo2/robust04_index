			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Venezuelans jittery after banker quits THE resignation last week of Mr Pedro Tinoco as president of Venezuela's central bank has left the Venezuelan government and investors jittery in the wake of the failed military uprising of February 4. The resignation comes at a time when President Andres Perez is trying to gain broader support for his government and is expected to announce cabinet changes. Mr Tinoco's departure seemed to cause most concern among Venezuelan bankers, who worry that his successor may not provide as much support for the domestic banking system. The government has proposed a series of reforms of Venezuela's financial system, including opening it up to foreign investment. Some of these are strongly opposed. Mr Tinoco is a major shareholder in one of Venezuela's largest commercial banks, Banco Latino. His departure had been rumoured since last year, with unconfirmed rumours that he was leaving for health reasons. In announcing his departure, Mr Tinoco, who will be 65 later this year, gave no indication that he was in disagreement with government policies. On February 21, the day after the resignation was made public, the Caracas Stock Exchange Index fell by 1.5 per cent and Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, declined less than one per cent against the US dollar. The value of the bolivar has been falling against the dollar since the beginning of the year. No one has been named to replace Mr Tinoco, but President Perez has reiterated his intention to push ahead with the unpopular economic reform programme his government initiated three years ago. This suggests that the new Central Bank chief will, like Mr Tinoco, support the reform plan.</p>

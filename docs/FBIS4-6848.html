			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The formation of newly  elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet was delayed Monday  [25 April] because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) reacted  sharply to the abrupt establishment of a new 130-legislator  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives that  excludes the party.    An intracoalition standoff intensified a few hours after the  Diet voted to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata,  58, to power as the replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation),"  comprises Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two splinter groups that  recently defected from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  -- the Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai.    By incorporating former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, the  parliamentary strength of the new camp shot up to 130.  Yamaguchi himself is an LDP rebel. The group's strength has  already dwarfed the SDP's strength of 74.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, blasted the  sudden  attempt to alter the coalition's makeup for betraying the SDP,  which was the largest contingent in the ruling coalition.    The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five  political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by  the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new  unified party, political analysts said.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito  counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally proposed such a  convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming general election  under the newly legislated electoral system, which has  introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation.    The leaders of the coalition were originally scheduled to  begin talks on the formation of a second coalition at 4 P.M.  [0700 GMT] but the SDP's rage apparently delayed the start of  the consultations for more than four hours until SDP Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama went to the premier's official residence at  8:30 P.M. However, Murayama walked out of the meeting 18  minutes later to discuss his party's response at the SDP  Headquarters.    The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo  Ouchi told DSP legislators the coalition parties should initiate  such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support base" for  the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier one of the  chief critics of such a move.    Kubo, the SDP's chief strategist, told reporters, however,  "it is a universal rule to live by the etiquette based on mutual  trust and obligations. It is outrageous for them to suddenly  initiate this move on the very day of a cabinet formation  despite the fact that the SDP has cooperated with other  coalition partners in running the government until today," Kubo  said.    Ouchi later told a news conference, "the reason why we have  to establish the parliamentary group to back up the new prime  minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point  policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties."    The platform was created after two weeks of squabbles and  standoffs since Hosokawa suddenly announced his resignation  April 8.    Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary  base to support the prime minister and we put together parties  that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to  enlist all the parties immediately into the new group."</p>

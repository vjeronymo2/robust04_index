			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuenstorf (DPA) -- This weekend, the Western Group  of Russian Armed Forces will commemorate the anniversary of the  German capitulation on 8 May 1945 for the last time on German  soil. On Saturday afternoon [7 May], its Supreme Command  honored the millions of Soviet soldiers who were killed in World  War II with a concert in its Wuenstorf (Brandenburg)  headquarters.    Brandenburg Minister-President Manfred Stolpe (Social  Democratic Party of Germany -- SPD) promised the Russian forces,  which will be withdrawn by the end of August, that Brandenburg  will honor the memory of the dead Soviet soldiers in the Seelow  mountains, Baruth, and other places. Stolpe said that many  Germans had also experienced the victory of the Red Army over  Hitler fascism as a day of liberation.    This Sunday, representatives of the Western Group will lay  wreaths in military cemeteries and at other memorials in  Brandenburg and Berlin. On 9 May, a large military show marking  "victory day" will be held at Wuenstorf headquarters. The  Brandenburg land government will see off the Russian Armed  Forces with a festive rally in Potsdam on 29 July.</p>

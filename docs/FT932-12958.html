			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Viennese alternatives - London Sinfonietta Several hundred more people were needed to fill the Queen Elizabeth Hall for Saturday's 'Alternative Vienna' concert, by the London Sinfonietta. Nearly all of them would have been entranced and even moved by the final work, HK Gruber's hugely disarming Cello Concerto (1989). Most would have responded to Kurt Schwertsik's mock-simple music too, as also to Gruber's edgily tonal, sweet-tempered revue movement The Red Carpet is being Unrolled (1968). They should have been there. There are four more concerts to come, this week and next. Only a pair of Intermezzi from the music-theatre Medea of a younger Viennese composer, Christian Ofenbauer, let the side down. Dadaism without verve, pointillisme with no guiding line to join the dots - and unconscionably long: in that dim context, Ofenbauer's mildly outre instrumental effects had no point to make. 80-odd years ago, Ravel used three non-synchronised metronomes in his L'Heure espagnole prelude; they must come together periodically, but never quite in synch with the tender orchestral music - a metaphor for that whole little opera. Ofenbauer multiplied the trick interminably, and his protracted coda for metronomes alone, one after another being switched off, was painfully predictable. Everything else was far better. Schwertsik's song-cycle Shal-i-mar after HC Artmann's 'Persian Quatrains', sung freshly and eagerly by the baritone Peter Savidge, recalls the old romantic ache of the young Berg in a temperate new language. His octet Twilight Music, plainer still on the surface, makes charming play with ancient Celtic jigs, in which Nona Lidell's fiddle struck all the right notes. (Schwertsik himself was present, and unsurprisingly he turns out to be a kind of leprechaun.) Gruber's 20-minute Cello Concerto is a tour de force and a kind of masterpiece. These same musicians gave its London premiere two and a half years ago. Christopher van Kampen delivered the fiendish solo part with even more generous warmth than before, and Lothar Zagrosek drew enchanting sounds from Gruber's magical little ensemble, in which everything gleams. The vibes, and the falling phrase (with a turn-up at the end) that haunts the score, suggest an hommage to Berg's Lulu: might that have been intentional? The phrase itself also recalls the master-tune of Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto ' but I suppose that must be an accident. If it is, it's a happy one.</p>

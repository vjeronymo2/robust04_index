			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA NOW MUST ANSWER TO A HIGHER CALLING  </P> <P> Independence fever is over for Santa Margarita High School. After spending the  regular season wondering where it would be placed in the playoffs -- compiling  a 10-0 record along the way -- the Eagles landed in Division IV, five levels  higher than last year.  </P> <P> With the division question answered, Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team,  has started preparing for its first-round game against Claremont (5-4-1) Friday  at Saddleback College.  </P> <P> "They're a good football team, they do a good job throwing the ball, running  the ball, and they have a very aggressive offensive line -- probably the best  we'll face all year up to this point," Eagle Coach Jim Hartigan said. "Their  record is not the greatest, but they've had some big wins. . . . It all depends  on how they come to play."  </P> <P> Quarterback Trevor Yankoff and running back Josh Ireland lead Santa Margarita,  which lost in the Division IX quarterfinals to eventual champion Carpinteria  last year.  </P> <P> Yankoff has thrown for 1,087 yards, completing 56.1% of his passes with five  touchdowns and four interceptions. He has also rushed for nine touchdowns.  </P> <P> Ireland has rushed for 1,229 yards -- averaging 7.3 yards per carry -- and  scored 17 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Other Santa Margarita standouts include wide receiver/defensive back David  Shearer, who has caught 22 passes for 316 yards (14.3-yard average). Shearer  and teammate Steve Feeney have intercepted five passes each.  </P> <P> The Eagles' biggest offensive lineman, 6-foot-6, 275-pound senior tackle Nathan  Beckett, missed Monday's practice because of a knee injury suffered in last  week's game against Warren and is questionable for Friday's game. Tailback  Sergio Muniz (knee) and linebacker Thad Zak (shoulder) also are questionable.  </P> <P> Claremont, which many expected to win the Baseline League this year, instead  had a season of ups and downs -- a loss to Damien, a 2-7 team, among the downs  -- and finished the league season in a second-place tie with Chino (4-4-2).  </P> <P> Claremont is well-balanced, with quarterback Adam Metwalli (1,379 yards, 10  touchdowns) and running backs Ryan Williams (835 yards, eight touchdowns) and  Terrill Grant (505 yards, three touchdowns) sharing the offensive load.  </P> <P> Canyon Springs, 10-0 and the top-seeded team, features option quarterback Chris  Ogle, strong, speedy running back Reggie Carter (975 yards, 18 touchdowns) and  a defense that has allowed an average of just six points per game. Khary  Williams (750 yards) and Cleveland Smith (400 yards) supplement the Cougars'  running game.  </P> <P> Nogales, 9-0 and seeded second, is a fast, run-oriented team, focusing on the  option. Tyrone Edwards (900 yards) is the key running back.  </P> <P> Glendora (9-1), the division's co-champion last year with Ramona, is led by  running back Bill Zernickow, who has gained more than 1,300 yards. Glendora has  been riddled with injuries, though, losing five starters for the season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIVISION IV  </P> <P> Defending Co-Champions: Glendora, Ramona.  </P> <P> First-Round Schedule: Friday, 7:30 p.m. -- Chino (4-4-2) vs. Canyon Springs  (10-0) at Moreno High School; California (5-5) at Baldwin Park (7-2-1); Bell  Gardens (7-3) at Walnut (8-2); Claremont (5-4-1) vs. Santa Margarita (10-0) at  Saddleback College; Rowland (6-4) at Glendora (9-1); Northview (5-5) at J.W.  North (8-2); Arlington (7-3) at El Rancho (7-3); Covina (6-4) at Nogales (9-0).  </P> <P> Top Teams: Canyon Springs, Nogales, Glendora, Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> Dark Horses: J.W. North, Claremont.  </P> <P> Best Draw: Canyon Springs vs. Chino. A victory would match Canyon Springs  against Baldwin Park or California.  </P> <P> Worst Draw: El Rancho vs. Arlington. Two evenly matched teams, with the winner  probably advancing to play Nogales.  </P> <P> Key Players: Reggie Carter, RB, and Chris Ogle, QB, Canyon Springs; Trevor  Yankoff, QB, and Josh Ireland, RB, Santa Margarita; Henry Preston and Chris  Hall, RBs, J.W. North; Bill Zernickow, RB, and Tim Flynn, FS, Glendora.  </P> <P> Noteworthy: Undefeated Santa Margarita entered the playoffs as an independent.  Last year, the Eagles advanced to the Division IX quarterfinals, so Eagle Coach  Jim Hartigan was disappointed to learn his team had been placed five levels  higher. Still, Santa Margarita opens at home against a 5-4-1 team (Claremont).  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: Bartoli's 'Cenerentola'/'Cosi fan tutte' - Opera in Italy Concluding its opera season, the Bologna Comunale has just mounted a sparkling new Cenerentola, obviously intended also as a contribution to the Rossini bicentenary festivities, which continue in full spate throughout Italy. The new production served further as a showcase for the young mezzosoprano Cecilia Bartoli, the brightest rising star in the Italian operatic firmament, known as much for her notable recordings as for her theatre appearances. But Bartoli in the real life of the stage is even more exciting than Bartoli on discs, for in addition to her vocal virtuosity she is an engaging, natural actress, sensitive to words, including those of her fellow-performers. She never performs in a vacuum, but securely in context. In Bologna she was surrounded by first-class performers. Cenerentola is not a mezzosoprano vehicle: it makes heavy demands also on the other interpreters, and the casting of Ramiro, Magnifico and Dandini is as important as the choice of the heroine. Bologna had William Matteuzzi, Claudio Desderi and the talented young Lucio Gallo for these three parts, and the spiteful stepsisters were aptly played by Fernanda Costa and Gloria Banditelli. The philosopher Alidoro, of whom little but stately nobility is required, was strongly cast, too; and the bass Pietro Spagnoli added to that nobility of mien authority of voice and evident human concern. Riccardo Chailly, the permanent conductor of the Comunale, used the new critical edition of the score, which inspired a translucent reading with far more subtlety and charm than the usual. Chailly allowed the vein of pathos to run through the performance. Bartoli's Cinderella, however, was not pathetic or sentimental, even in the opening scenes. Her first words to the prince were immediately moving in their simplicity. In the end, when goodness has triumphed and the radiant newly-made princess proclaims that her forgiveness of her stepsisters will be her revenge, there is just a hint that vengeance will get the upper hand and the stepsisters had better watch out. This Cinderella is a young woman of strong character, whether among the embers or on the throne. In unusually good voice, Matteuzzi portrayed a youthful man of spirit, convincing as prince and lover. The young Gallo has a big, commanding voice, perhaps more suited to verismo opera than to Rossini; but he handled it well and provided an untraditional, originally comic valet-turned-prince. Claudio Desderi was a Don Magnifico totally in command, outrageously funny and infallibly musical, singing not grumbling his music. Like all the others, he was firmly supported by the staging of Roberto De Simone, whose view of the piece entirely corresponded to that of Chailly: the comedy always had a welcome elegance. Greedy, self-important, foolishly ambitious, this Don Magnifico was, nevertheless, an aristocrat. Odette Nicoletti designed delightful costumes; and Mauro Carosi invented a splendid and versatile set, a high arch crowning two curved staircases, in Vesuvian-villa style. Thus, with a minimum of shifting, the scenic elements could be transformed from the Baron's decaying palace to the Prince's country seat. The Comunale orchestra was obviously in complete agreement with Chailly's approach, and they played at the top of their form. The chorus, too, seemed newly energised. All this bodes well for the recording which Decca will make just after the final performance of the season. Stimulated largely by the success of his recent recordings, considerable interest surrounded the Italian debut of John Eliot Gardiner as producer, staging Mozart's Cos fan tutte at the charming Teatro Comunale in Ferrara. This was a co-production with the Teatro Sao Carlos of Lisbon, where it was seen last month. The Ferrara opening night, last Friday, was sold out; and critics and cognoscenti came from all over the country for the event. The reception was warm, but the artistic results were mixed, and some of the specialists were disappointed. Not with Gardiner's conducting, which was, as expected, of great authority and sensibility. From the very first bars of the Overture it was clear that the excellent English Baroque Soloists were in secure hands: tempos were firmly set, but never so rigid as to exclude expressive play. And, except for a very few awkward horn blurts, the sound was sweet and silken, unusual for an 'original instruments' orchestra. It was the voices that fell short of expectation, especially the women. Amanda Roocroft (Fiordiligi) and Rosa Mannion (Dorabella) both have a pretty soprano sound, but without personality. True, in Gardiner's view, the two sisters should be, for much of the piece, virtually identical (and they wore confusingly twin costumes in the first scenes); but their interchangeable sameness quickly became monotonous. The generic quality of their singing was exacerbated by their woeful enunciation of the Italian text and the excess of gesticulation and grimacing that marked their acting was a hindrance rather than a help to comprehension. In the mugging department, Eirian James was the worst offender; the voice also lacked charm. Carlos Feller gave the Italian words their proper value, and his Alfonso was the only character with three dimensions. He really looked and moved like an 18th century Neapolitan gentleman, not like a costumed singer. Unfortunately, his voice is an unpleasant bark and he had difficulty with pitch. The boys - Rainer Trost (Ferrando) and Rodney Gilfry (Guglielmo) - were generally better actors, but their singing suffered from the same lack of focus as the girls', and their Italian was only marginally better. In a long evening (four hours including one interval), the generic singing grew soporific, and one could not help wondering if it was worth opening cuts and restoring often-suppressed recitative. Gardiner, in a programme note, insists that he has turned producer only to prevent someone less knowledgeable from mucking about with the work. An excellent motive, and his staging does indeed respect the text and the music, except for a few instances where the maestro himself succumbs to produceritis, introducing chained prisoners into the scene of the troops' arrival and two mincing Pulcinellas into the near-wedding. The story is firmly set in late 18th century Naples by the splendid, seductive sets as costumes of Carlo Tommasi. Dorabella and Fiordiligi could not have been brought back to their native Ferrara in a more handsome visual context.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Treasury accused of seeking 'alibis' THE Treasury is being forced to seek outside advice to improve its decision-making because of the view that it has made mistakes, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday. Mr Davies said one reason for the Treasury's efforts to step up consultations with outside economists and industrialists was to give it 'alibis' in case policy-making errors were repeated. Speaking at an Association of European Journalists lunch, Mr Davies, a former Treasury official, said the Treasury habitually 'internalised' discussions on economic policy. The Treasury's view - justifying its customary secrecy - was that 'information, power and control (were) synonymous'. As controller of the Audit Commission, the government public spending watchdog, Mr Davies helped advise the Treasury on reforming its internal management structure. He said the traditional Treasury approach was 'fine as long as you're winning'. But if the Treasury made 'mistakes' it alone received the blame, since the importance of external advice even from the Bank of England - was seldom acknowledged. Signs that it was seeking more outside contacts were a 'sea change'. Mr Davies, who criticised the government's handling of the departure from the exchange rate mechanism, predicted that it might have difficulty in maintaining its anti-inflation credibility. s</p>

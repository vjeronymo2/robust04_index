			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Litigation against coastguard rejected The coastguard service cannot be sued for negligence over the way its staff perform their normal duties, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Claims for damages against the service, controlled by the Department of Transport, would be against the public interest because its efficiency and the trust between it and the sea-going community could be damaged, Judge Gareth Edwards QC said. He dismissed claims for negligence against the service which alleged coastguards had failed to respond promptly to the distress calls on September 5 1988 of fishing boat Inspire, which sank off the Welsh coast with the loss of three lives. The claims were made by Mr Sam Skinner, sole survivor of the incident, who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after his ordeal, and the widow of crew member David Webster. Mr Skinner and Mr Webster's widow sued the Department of Transport, claiming that coastguards should have acted on Mr Skinner's Mayday distress call at 3.20pm that day - heard very indistinctly by a radio operator - instead of waiting until the boat was reported overdue at 10.30pm. The judge ruled that coastguards owed no legally enforceable duty of care to any member of the seafaring community - even in emergencies - except when the danger was created by their own actions. 'The coastguard has vast responsibilities and slender resources,' he said. 'Litigation could involve examination of operational decisions made at a time when an officer had to choose swiftly between several options.' The threat of legal action was unlikely to prompt higher standards, but might lead to a 'defensive mentality' and a drop in the effectiveness of the service. The judge added that he doubted whether many seafarers would wish their relationship with the coastguard to be soured by the possibility of litigation. He noted that the widow of Mr Terry Jones, skipper of the boat, did not pursue a damages claim, and said it was possible that Mr Skinner, who owed his life to the coastguards, initially took the same view. But Mr Skinner's psychologist had encouraged him to bring the legal action because a finding of blame against someone might have helped him recover from his trauma. The judge went on: 'Speaking for myself, I wish to advise those who believe in therapy by litigation to think again.'</p>

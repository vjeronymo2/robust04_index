			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Possible French connection for BA BRITISH AIRWAYS is understood to be considering investing in a minority stake in Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), the French regional airline which is this year planning to launch a big expansion in European services. TAT, which operates a fleet of 50 aircraft and is one of the main beneficiaries of French airline deregulation, yesterday said it was talking to several potential airline partners. Although it declined to confirm specific talks with BA, the UK airline is believed to have been approached by TAT to invest in the French independent carrier. BA, which yesterday reported a substantial increase to Pounds 100m in third quarter pre-tax profits, and is currently involved in negotiations to link-up with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, said it never commented on speculation about mergers or acquisitions. TAT's search for a strong international partner follows the disposal last year by Air France, the French national airline, of its 35 per cent stake in the regional carrier. Air France sold its TAT stake as part of its agreement with the European Commission to enable it to take control of Air Inter, the French domestic carrier, and UTA, the independent French long-distance airline. The French national carrier also agreed to give up several routes to independent airlines in return for EC approval to take over in 1990 its two main domestic competitors, Air Inter and UTA, giving it a 97 per cent share of the French market. Mr Michel Marchais, founder and main shareholder of TAT, indicated last week he would be prepared to sell 20 per cent of his family's 72 per cent controlling interest in the airline to a new industrial partner. The other big shareholder is Credit National, the French state credit institution, which acquired its 25 per cent stake from Air France. TAT was founded 20 years ago but because of its association with Air France was until now largely considered as a subsidiary of the national flag carrier. In spite of last year's airline industry slump, the regional carrier has continued to operate profitably. It employs about 3,100 people, has annual sales of about FFr2.4bn (Pounds 240m), and is involved in the express freight, airline maintenance and pilot training businesses as well as operating regional airline services on 30 routes. But it is now poised to launch a big expansion of European services as a result of the French government's redistribution of airline routes. It plans to start 15 new services during the next 12 months, including services from Paris and Lyon to London Gatwick next month. Other new European services include flights from Paris to Copenhagen, Munich, Geneva, Milan and a summer schedule of flights from French regional cities to London's Stansted airport. However, the airline clearly feels it will be in a stronger position to compete head-on against Air France if it can forge a partnership with a big European carrier like BA.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dos": "Hungarian Civic Party's Conditions for a </F> Coalition"]    [Text] Bratislava--L. Nagy, chairman of the Hungarian  Civic Party [MOS], yesterday made public MOS's conditions for  entering into a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition with  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and  Coexistence. They include, first and foremost, a general  screening of candidates in accordance with the screening law,  the candidates' sworn statement that they will not have any  other income besides their deputies' salaries, a joint electoral  manifesto, the Hungarian deputies' unanimous voting on all  important issues pertaining to the minorities, the publication  of concluded agreements, and the banning of campaigning against  the other coalition members. According to Nagy, during the  negotiations, MOS will demand, as a starting point, a 25-percent  share on the common slate of candidates, which would correspond  to the outcome of the last parliamentary elections. As MOS  spokesman K. Petocz went on to say, MOS tried to initiate talks  on a three-member coalition as early as February so as not to be  pressed for time. This has now happened, according to Nagy,  despite the fact that MOS's ideas about a coalition are not too  different from the ideas of the MKDH and Coexistence. Nagy has  detected a certain shift in the Coexistence movement because the  latest statement by its Executive Committee no longer contains  the toughest conditions originally laid down by Coexistence for  talks with MOS.</p>

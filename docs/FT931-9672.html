			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Bid for Giroleasing 'was miscalculated' THE Post Office almost signed an agreement with Norwich Union to sell Girobank's leasing business for Pounds 19m too little because the insurance company miscalculated its own bid by Pounds 55m, the National Audit Office disclosed yester-day. In its report on the sale of Girobank to the Alliance &amp; Leicester building society in 1990, the public spending watchdog, said that the separate bid for Giroleasing was only found to have been miscalculated the day before an agreement was signed. The office said that after making inquiries with Norwich Union about the error it was satisfied 'that this was a genuine mistake'. It said the sale would not have been allowed to proceed if the mistake had been found later. After discounting the Pounds 55m error, Norwich Union's bid was worth Pounds 323m - or Pounds 19m less than another company had bid. Norwich Union subsequently raised its bid to Pounds 342m. Although Alliance &amp; Leicester was initially given two months exclusive negotiating rights for the sale, this was eventually extended by a year because of legal and regulatory difficulties. During the delay, Girobank's investments fell in value, and the final sale price was adjusted to Pounds 112m from Pounds 130m. The Sale of Girobank plc. Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. HMSO Pounds 6.10.</p>

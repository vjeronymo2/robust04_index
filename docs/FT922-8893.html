			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / From design studio to new car showroom / Examining the evolution of R&amp;D at Ford Europe The restructuring of Ford of Europe's research and development operations announced last week goes to the heart of its efforts to regain a competitive edge in the fierce battle for European car market leadership. The US car maker's record loss in Europe in 1991 - the worst financial performance among the big six European car makers - has been a bitter pill for a company which led the west European car market in the mid-1980s and which prided itself as the European industry's most efficient volume car maker. To revive its fortunes, Ford has launched an optimistically-titled 'drive for leadership' campaign. High on the agenda is the implementation of so-called 'simultaneous engineering' in the reform of product development. Simultaneous engineering seeks to bring together design and manufacturing engineers to work in a project team (instead of their working in sequence and passing responsibility down the development line) so as to improve the speed, efficiency and quality of the complex process of developing a new vehicle. To this end, Ford has embarked on a controversial programme to concentrate - by the end of 1994 - all its R&amp;D activities at two sites at Dunton, Essex, in the UK, and at Merkenich, near Cologne in Germany, in place of the present six locations, four in the UK and two in Germany. The plan will transfer several hundred jobs from the UK to Germany - and a few from Germany to the UK - as Ford seeks to overcome the competitive disadvantages of having vehicle development and engineering split between two countries. UK trade unions are preparing to fight the proposals, which, they claim, will transfer core engineering skills from Britain to Germany. Ford insists that more than half its R&amp;D effort will remain in the UK. Much of the analysis of European and US car makers' shortcomings in the battle against their Japanese rivals has focused on the relative efficiency and productivity of their assembly and manufacturing plants. Increasingly, however, attention is switching from the manufacturing process to design, development and engineering. 'Unless we can manage more product programmes faster, at lower cost and with lower investment, we will not be competitive,' says Mr John Oldfield, Ford of Europe's vice-president for product programmes, vehicle engineering and design. Mr Oldfield's concerns are underlined by a recent study* by Mr Kim Clark and Mr Takahiro Fujimoto, professors at the Harvard Business School and Tokyo University, which identifies gaps in lead time and engineering productivity between Japanese and western car makers. The study finds that 'the average Japanese firm has almost double the development productivity and can develop a comparable product a year faster than the average US firm'. On average, Japanese car makers needed 1.7m engineering hours to develop a standard car compared with 3.2m hours in the US and 3.0m hours for a European volume car maker. According to Mr Oldfield, US and European car makers still take up to five years to develop a new car. 'The Japanese have about a three-year development cycle and the best Japanese are even a little better than that. We have started on that route. We have not yet delivered a major programme in three years, but we now have some on the books.' Ford has been converted to the gospel of simultaneous engineering, but it has faced a big hurdle in matching its rivals: not only is its R&amp;D split between the UK and Germany, but the design and manufacturing engineering has been scattered between several plants. 'Product engineers and manufacturing engineers must be in the same country, and ideally in the same office,' says Mr Oldfield. 'You cannot achieve simultaneous engineering by telephone or video-conferencing.' In the UK, Ford is planning to move 1,200 engineering staff by the end of 1994 from satellite operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham to the main R&amp;D site at Dunton, where the total workforce will be increased to about 4,500. In Germany, some 1,300 staff are to be relocated to Merkenich, chiefly from Ford's Niehl Cologne car plant, bringing the total at the site to 3,800. Controversially, as part of the restructuring about 300 jobs are to be transferred from the UK to Germany, while between 20 and 30 jobs will be moved from Germany to the UK. MSF, the British industry and services union, claims that another 200-400 jobs could be moved by 1994. Ford says that no more transfers are planned. The movement of engineers between the UK and Germany is Ford's attempt to make the best out of a less than ideal situation. If it was starting afresh, Ford would undoubtedly locate all its R&amp;D effort at one site in one country to gain the full advantages of simultaneous engineering. 'If two sites are better than six why not one instead of two,' says Mr Oldfield, posing the question that has worried the UK trade unions. 'We looked at the option of a single site, because many of our competitors have this already,' admits Mr Oldfield, 'but it is impractical. We have too much invested in the UK and in Germany in people, skills, experience and facilities. We could not contemplate the cost and disruption of going to a single site.' Instead of the single site solution, which would have provoked an outcry from the unions and government in the UK - or in Germany - Ford of Europe is seeking to consolidate different areas of a vehicle's development either at Dunton or at Merkenich. At those sites will be gathered not only the design engineers and the manufacturing engineers, but also the support staffs, purchasing engineers, finance and quality control specialists. At Merkenich, for instance, Ford is concentrating body engineering - responsible for the body structure and all sheet metal parts - while at Dunton the vehicle interiors will be developed including instrument panels, mechanisms, seats, paint, trim and plastics. Basic engines will be developed in Germany. The UK will have engine systems, performance, economy and emissions development - and electronic engine management systems. 'After all these moves the balance of activities will still be close to 50/50 between the UK and Germany,' says Mr Oldfield, 'but we think the balance is in favour of the UK.' The split remains complex for a product as complicated as a motor car with thousands of parts. 'Yes, we have compromised,' says Mr Oldfield. But the legacy of Ford's parallel historic development in the UK and Germany could not be overcome in any other way - yet. *Product Development Performance: Strategy, Organisation and Management in the World Auto Industry, published by the Harvard Business School.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Berlusconi to bid for Britain's Channel 5 MR Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has decided to make a bid for the new Channel 5 commercial television franchise in the UK designed to compete directly with ITV. The controversial Italian entrepreneur, who owns supermarket chains and publishing houses as well as the AC Milan football club, would, if successful, be the first foreigner to operate a British television channel. Mr Berlusconi is the dominant figure in Italian commercial television after creating a national network out of linked local stations which show videotaped programmes delivered by motorcycle. He also has stakes in German, French and Spanish television. A move into the UK has been planned for some time. Mr Berlusconi's main group, Fininvest, will lead a consortium to bid for the channel which is expected to be put out for tender in the next two months. The aim is to broadcast a national channel of high quality entertainment aimed directly at ITV, Britain's main commercial television channel. The plan is to spend several hundred million pounds on programmes from the outset to try to make an immediate impression in the market. Fininvest has already linked up with Channel X, the independent production company run by Mr Mike Bolland, former deputy director of programmes at Channel 4. Channel X had been seen as a bidder in its own right. Fininvest says it is also talking to other potential UK investors. Channel 5 which will be awarded by competitive tender, is expected to reach around 75 per cent of the UK population using conventional transmitters. The winner of the franchise will however have to pay for the cost of the transmitters and retuning several million video recorders likely to suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal. In most parts of the country a separate aerial will be needed to receive the channel which has to be on air by the end of 1994 at the latest. Mr Oliver Novick, head of corporate development at Fininvest, said he believed the difficulties could be overcome. 'If the product is good the public is willing to make the investment to get a new channel,' he said. As well as using normal transmitters, Fininvest would almost certainly broadcast by satellite to reach parts of the country that Channel 5 could not otherwise reach. Fininvest looked at the possibility of bidding for an ITV franchise last year but decided it was not interested in regional television. 'This is the last opportunity to create a new terrestrial channel in a major European country,' Mr Novick said. Sponsor price indicated, Page 8</p>

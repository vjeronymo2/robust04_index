			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roman Czerwinski, deputy minister of </F> industry and trade, and Stanislaw Glowacki, chairman of  Solidarity's national armaments industry section, by  correspondent Katarzyna Klukowska; place and date not given;  from the "Bilans" program--recorded]    [Text] [Klukowska] There are ever more strikes and  demonstrations taking place in Poland. Last Friday it was the  Solidarity national armaments industry section that protested.  The continuation of such policies by the government of the  Polish Republic is read by the work forces of armanents industry  enterprises as indicating an intention to liquidate this sector  of industry. This may cause an unimaginable social explosion,  for the consequences of which the Government of the Polish  Republic will bear responsibility.    [Czerwinski] I think that the internal restructuring  processes, supported by certain decisions at the level of both  parliament and the government, the law on special regulations in  the sphere of ownership transformations, constitute a certain  political and economic indication of the fact that the  government nonetheless is in favor of the maintenance of this  industry, that this industry is necessary both for our economy  and, above all, for our defense preparedness. And we will be  doing what we are doing, but able to do so in the sphere of  rescuing this industry.    [Klukowska] The armaments industry consists of over 80  enterprises. Just a few years ago, we earned at least several  hundred million dollars from the sale of arms every year, being  the third placed exporter, after the former Soviet Union and  Czechoslovakia, of the countries of CEMA.    [Czerwinski] The arms trade market is nonetheless a market  that is very brutal and a market for professionals. The gun  scandal precisely was an example of an instance where what was  in practice a private company tried, without government  protection, without the protection of the special services, to  strike a particular deal. It was trapped by a straightforward  provocation, one that could have been discovered much earlier.    [Klukowska] It transpires that over 70 percent of the  products of the armaments industry are civilian production, and  it is precisely in this that many, inter alia the Ministry of  Industry and Trade, see an opportunity for bringing this branch  of the national economy back to health.    [Czerwinski] Were we to rest the restructuring of the  industry solely upon supplies to the Polish Army, solely upon  export opportunities, this industry would not be capable of  getting out of this enormous trough. That is why we decided to  go for, above all, legal regulations and the protection of this  industry in its special role and, thus, payment for an economic  mobilizaton plan, which was adopted last year, preferential  treatment as regards purchases by the Ministry of National  Defense, protection and assistance by government offices for  export opportunities. This, of course, very often taking into  account certain international implications, as also the  associations between particular enterprises of ours.    [Klukowska] What is the situation of the armaments sector at  this moment?    [Glowacki] Tragic. If I say that at this moment remuneration  has since last year, since the notorious consultation meeting,  increased in essence by 500,000 zlotys [Z] and varies around a  level of Z2.8 million, this is witness to what the mood is, what  the situation is in these plants, and what can possibly be  expected in the near future.    [Klukowska] Is the issue just remuneration or the fact that  you are producing, we as a state produce equipment that is not  all bad, but for which there is no use?    [Glowacki] Also so. Also so, although this situation is  subject to change insofar as the enterprises are themselves  attempting to counteract it. Nonetheless, without systemic  solutions, without decisions at the level of government, we will  unfortunately end up stewing in our juices.    [Klukowska] When listening to trade unionists, one gets the  impression that you, with your optimistic faith in the future,  are nonetheless an isolated figure. They do not have such  optimistic perspectives.    [Czerwinski] I think this transpires from a certain long  expectation. The first signs of improvement are appearing. It  seems that it is at this moment appropriate to exchange this  very long expectation, these starved work forces, for concrete  economic results. The year 1994 will already be the year of  breakthrough. It will be a year of growth, improvement of the  economic situation of both enterprises and work forces as  against this background. On the other hand, we expect a clear  improvement; we can expect it in the years 1995-96. The  enterprises ought to return to a standard level of economic  efficiency on the order of 5-6 percent [as heard]. For this  year, we would wish to bring about a situation in which all of  the enterprises have in practice a net profit close to zero and  thus are not yet too profitable but, on the other hand, do not  bring losses.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Panel tightens rule on 'creeping control' THE TAKEOVER Panel has tightened its rule on 'creeping control'. With effect from yesterday morning, when the announcement was made, the owner of between 30 and 50 per cent of the voting rights of a company can only buy a further 1 per cent in any 12 month period. Previously the limit was 2 per cent. The change to Rule 9.1(b) of the Takeover Code has been under discussion for many months and the Panel said yesterday that the arguments on each side had been finely balanced. It concluded that 'the interests of shareholders would be best served' by cutting the purchasing freedom to 1 per cent. The Panel's concern was that the rule could be abused by a predator which could gradually increase its stake and gain control without making a full bid. However, it also felt that some flexibility was still needed in Rule 9. Complaints about the rule are rare, the Panel said. The rule was introduced in 1974 as part of the mandatory offer rule, under which a bid is required if a stake of 30 per cent or more is acquired. Originally the limit on purchases was 1 per cent but it was increased to 2 per cent in 1976. The Panel said it could not recall a case where a predator had acquired control of a company using this rule. The closest that a company has come to be acquired this way was Molins, the engineering company. Leucadia National Corporation, a US group, failed in a takeover bid for Molins in May 1990, but retained a 45.14 per cent stake afterwards. It subsequently bought shares taking its stake to 48.45 per cent. However, an attempt in October 1991 to use its votes to gain control of the board failed and Leucadia then sold its shares.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Price cuts are back in fashion at Benetton - The priority is to increase sales through international expansion ITALY'S Benetton clothing group will announce a 10 per cent rise in 1992 sales when the group's results are revealed next month. Sales will be about L2,500bn (Dollars 1.61bn) on earnings which will have remained static at worst. But the upbeat figures will again raise doubts about how long the company, never shy of publicity, can continue raising turnover and earnings at a time of worldwide recession. In spite of the downturn in consumer spending, Benetton's profits should at least equal the net L164.8bn made in 1991. In the first half of last year, net earnings climbed by 6 per cent to L92.8bn on a 6.9 per cent sales rise to L1,233bn. The expected increase in profits has triggered hopes of a higher dividend, already boosted last year by L50 a share to L300. In 1991, shareholders were shocked when the company halved its L500 a share payout to generate extra cash at a time of continuing sharp growth. Last year's dividend rise restored confidence in Benetton's payout policy. 'Now we've established this good relationship, it's important to maintain it,' hints Mr Luciano Benetton, managing director. The company's priority is still to increase sales by expanding internationally. It has just opened its 7,047th store, this time in Cuba. But early indications for this year suggest even Benetton's sales growth could be turning more sluggish. Turnover growth has fallen below last year's 10 per cent level. 'But we hope to pick up in the second half,' says Mr Benetton. Benetton has cut prices by up to 15 per cent this year in order to improve competitiveness. The price cuts vary between markets and seasons. While price tags in Italy have hardly changed, prices in France, Germany and the US will be between 6 per cent and 10 per cent lower. The decision to cut prices was made six months before the lira left the exchange rate mechanism last September and before the landmark agreement in July between employers and unions to abolish Italy's 'scala mobile' (wage indexation system). Both were windfalls for many Italian manufacturers. 'We acknowledged our markets were becoming more difficult,' says Mr Benetton. 'So we tried to improve the appeal of our products by cutting prices.' The strategy has been conducted without putting profits at risk, he claims. Internal costs have been squeezed. 'We have frozen our costs for the past two years and expect to do the same in 1993.' Lower borrowing has helped too by reducing interest charges. Benetton has been sending a similar pricing message to its hundreds of independent suppliers although Mr Benetton denies the group has demanded lower prices. He does admit, however, to having looked askance on suppliers pushing for price rises. Highly-geared suppliers have been treated with particular caution, on the grounds that companies facing heavy interest charges are unlikely to be pricing as keenly as those with more solid balance sheets. Mr Benetton acknowledges that last year's 'scala mobile' deal and the lira devaluation provided unexpected benefits. The two developments have given Italian exporters an edge after years of declining competitiveness. The labour agreement 'came out better than we had budgeted,' he says. And the devaluation of the lira, which has fallen by about 20 per cent against the D-Mark, has greatly enhanced competitiveness. Meanwhile, recession and oversupply mean important raw materials, such as wool and cotton, have not gone up in price in spite of the lira's fall, says Mr Benetton. Exchange-rate factors will only come through fully in the 1993 accounts, although there will be some limited effect this year, he says. In spite of the recession, he remains confident about the year ahead. Sales of the spring-summer 1993 collection, already ordered by retailers, have exceeded levels for same season in 1992 - even excluding the additional small orders that filter through later in the season. Based on such indications, Mr Benetton's expects turnover to rise by 7 to 8 per cent this year. But even Benetton has its problems. Plans to expand in Russia, where there are now 10 of the group's stores, have gone adrift due to the severe slowing of production at the Armenian factory set up to supply the new shops. Matters are as gloomy in the US, where Benetton is still struggling to find the right niche and pricing for its goods. Such difficulties have led to heavy losses and closures. The store network has been cut to around 300 units from a peak of 700 in 1987. Mr Benetton admits the company's clothes are 'too expensive' in the US. 'We have the image of being more of a luxury goods there.' Theoretically, Benetton should be isolated from such problems. Under its store licensing system, it is the retailer, rather than the manufacturer, which bears the burden of pricing policy in the high street - Benetton's job is done once retailers buy its collections. However, Mr Benetton admits the group has been hurt by the bankruptcy of several US outlets. 'With the lira having fallen to L1,500 against the dollar, I think we now have a chance with products made in Europe,' he says. 'We feel very commited to this market.' Benetton's bruises in the US have given it vital, if costly, experience in one of the world's toughest retailing markets. 'And that experience comes in very useful elsewhere,' Mr Benetton adds.</p>

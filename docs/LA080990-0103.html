			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACTION FREES SWISS HELD IN LEBANON FOR 10 MONTHS;  </P> <P> HOSTAGES: CAPTORS DON'T EXPLAIN WHY A SECOND RED CROSS WORKER IS NOT FREED.  </P> <P> A Swiss Red Cross worker who had been held hostage in Lebanon for 10 months was  freed Wednesday and handed over to Swiss authorities, officials and witnesses  said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said they saw Emanuel Christen being handed to Swiss authorities  shortly after midnight in front of the Syrian Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> Christen, 33, was kidnaped Oct. 6, 1989, along with fellow Red Cross worker  Elio Erriquez, 24.  </P> <P> A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said in a statement  Wednesday that he had been freed. The Syrian Foreign Ministry and Red Cross in  Geneva confirmed the release.  </P> <P> The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Christen was handed to  Swiss Charge d'Affaires Fritz Kuehni and that he was then driven to the Swiss  Embassy.  </P> <P> The statement from the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads did not explain why  only one of the Swiss men was released.  </P> <P> That was the first time since their abductions that a group had claimed to hold  Christen and Erriquez.  </P> <P> "After we have promised yesterday night to release the two delegates of the  International Red Cross in Lebanon within 24 hours, one of them, Emanuel  Christen, has been set free and handed over to a representative of Brig. Gen.  Ghazi Kenaan at 6 p.m. this evening," said the statement, handwritten in  Arabic.  </P> <P> Kenaan is the chief of Syrian army intelligence in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Christen and Erriquez were abducted outside an artificial limbs center in  Sidon, a port city 25 miles south of Beirut.  </P> <P> Police in Sidon had blamed their abduction on the Libyan-financed Revolutionary  Council of Fatah, led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. That group  denied the charge.  </P> <P> A statement Tuesday said that the decision to free the Red Cross captives was  made in response to the wishes of Syrian President Hafez Assad, Libyan leader  Moammar Kadafi and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.  </P> <P> The statement also said the group had guarantees that their demands would be  met, but it did not specify what those were.  </P> <P> Six Americans are still among hostages held in Lebanon.  </P></p>

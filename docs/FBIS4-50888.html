			<p>BFN     [Text] Low interest rates and China's credit tightening  caused a significant outflow of funds from Macao last year,  according to a study by the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange  Authority.    The authority's 1993 monetary trend analysis noted that  "real  negative interest rates" had driven funds from Macao's banking  system into Hong Kong's stockmarket. And China's austerity  measures, which affect Chinese businesses in Macao, had led to a  liquidity squeeze.    Details of the unpublished report were leaked to the  Portuguese-language weekly Comercio de Macao over the weekend.  The report says that for the first time in many years, Macao  recorded a balance of payments deficit last year because of a  net outflow of capital. It also points out that bank lending  increased by 38 percent last year over 1992, showing the  dynamism of the enclave's service and construction sectors. A  quarter of domestic credit last year was taken up by mortgage  loans.    Banks in Macao will today raise savings-deposit and 24 hour  call-loan rates by half a percentage point and time-deposit  rates by 0.75 percentage points. The prime lending rate is also  expected to rise as Macao banks usually follow Hong Kong banks  closely. Most major Hong Kong banks put up the prime rate by  half a percentage point to 7.25 percent.    Macao's banking sector comprises six local banks, 13 banks  incorporated abroad, one off-shore bank, a post-savings bank and  the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority. The Bank of China  (Group) controls more than half of Macao's banking business.  The Macao government plans to turn the enclave into a  sub-regional banking centre in the Pearl River delta, mainly  serving its Chinese hinterland, which includes Zhuhai.    Macao's total private banking-sector assets grew  year-on-year  by 27 percent to 107bn patacas at the end of last year, the  Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority announced in a  1993 year-end report on Saturday. Domestic credit grew 38  percent to 31.4bn patacas, while net foreign assets slipped 12  percent to 28bn patacas.    M1 money supply decreased year-on-year by 1.8 percent to  21bn  patacas, while M2 money supply rose 7.1 percent to 54bn patacas.    The circulation of patacas, Macao's sole legal tender, has  grown at an annual rate of 11.6 percent, reaching 1.08bn at the  end of last year. The pataca, issued by Portugal's Banco  Nacional Ultramarino at the behest of the Macao Monetary and  Foreign Exchange Authority, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at  a rate of one pataca against HK$0.97.</p>

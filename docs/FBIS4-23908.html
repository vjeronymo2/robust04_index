			<p>BFN     [Text] A service brigade is to be established to absorb  members of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; MK -- ANC  Military Wing] and the defense forces of the former homelands  who do not qualify for integration into the South African  National Defense Force [SANDF]. A spokesman for the  (Walmansdaal) base north of Pretoria, Colonel Johan Preller, is  quoted by THE CITIZEN newspaper as saying that the volunteers  will undergo training in skills such as bricklaying and  mechanics for a period of 18 months. He said they could then be  taken up in the auxiliary services of the SANDF.    It was reported earlier that more than 3,000 former MK  members would begin their training at (Walmansdaal) on Monday.</p>

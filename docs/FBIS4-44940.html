			<p>CSO     [Text] Mr Manoranjan Hazra, former CPI(M) [Communist Party  of India-Marxist] MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and a  prominent leader of the newly formed Proletarian Revolutionary  Party of India [PRPI], will contest the forthcoming Assembly  by-polls at Serampore in Hooghly district on a PRPI ticket, the  party general secretary, Mr Sumanta Hira, said on Sunday.    The PRPI candidate will be supported by a 10-party combine  including the SUCI [Socialist Unity Center of India] and the  CPI(M-L) [Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist], Mr Hira  said.    Mr Hazra has already begun a door-to-door campaign to garner  votes for himself. Being new, his party, not surprisingly, has a  limited following in Serampore.    The Congress(I), Mr Hazra said, had won the past three  Assembly polls in the constituency on the strength of the  "negative votes," cast against the CPI(M).    The PRPI leadership is reportedly of the view that Mr Hazra  will cut into the votes of both the Congress(I) and the CPI(M).    Mr Hazra would get the Congress(I) votes because of his  association with the freedom movement, Mr Hira said.    Traditional CPI(M) voters, he added, would also support Mr  Hazra as he had initiated several development projects in  Serampore.</p>

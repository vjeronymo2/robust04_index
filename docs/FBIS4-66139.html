			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Arrigo Levi: "Keep an Eye on the World"] </F>   [Text] Meanwhile, back in the world, a lot has been  happening, and Italy's absence from the world, between one  government and another, cannot go on much longer, because a lot  of these things, indeed many of the most important things,  directly involve us.    First and foremost, Europe. We have no doubt as to the  strong personal commitment of the new foreign minister, Antonio  Martino, who now holds the portfolio once held by his father at  a historic moment for both Italy and Europe; and we have  confidence in his capacity to to take account of the current  situation, devising possible personal changes of key (of a  Thatcherite timbre, it has been said) in a Europeanism that must  be innate in the son of Gaetano Martino. As we see it, one fact  stands out above all the others.    The European Union has proved that it can withstand displays  of nationalist whims and tantrums from one or another of the  major powers at any one time -- first France, then England; when  this happens, the process of unification is impaired or slowed  down in various ways, but it does not come to a standstill. But  the European project, with the Maastricht Treaty as its charter,  would suffer serious damage should there be two, and not one, of  the major powers making up the Union rowing against the tide at  the same time.    I have always maintained that we must "be understanding  toward the English," make allowances when they flare up or dig  their heels in, and give their insular instincts time to adjust  to their new European destiny. But if the instinctive  reluctance of the English were to find encouragement in another  major power, Italy, for instance--if a "Rome-London axis"  committed to slowing down the constitutional negotiations that  are about to begin in preparation for the 1996 intergovernmental  Conference were to be formed--the damage done to Europe would be  extremely grave.    It would really be tempting providence to place most of the  weight of the European project on the shoulders of Germany  (which Germany? Kohl is still a giant, but for how much  longer?) and of a France of an uncertain political color, as  this project will have the difficult task of devising mechanisms  for adjusting to the inevitable complexities of enlargement  eastward.  <H5>  Continuity </H5>   Good relations between Rome and London have always been  useful in playing down the English sense of isolation in the  face of the great Franco-German entente, but only provided that  Rome works hard to involve London in the European process,  certainly not if it fosters nationalist instincts.    This must be the reasoning behind Italy's European policy  commitment to "continuity," as announced by the new government.  Italy's other, no less crucial, contribution to the European  project is to pursue and promote our economy's compliance with  the Maastricht criteria. This is in our own interest, even more  than it is in the European interest.    If we take a look at Europe, and all the more so if we list  our other immediate and imminent foreign policy priorities,  starting with the Naples summit, hovering between the G-7 and  G-8, and potential commitments, including those of a military  nature, in the former Yugoslavia, we must stress another  fundamental aspect. Following, among other factors, the  revolution that has taken place in communications and  telecommunications, foreign policy nowadays involves heads of  government directly and forces them to take direct  responsibility for the major decisions at their meetings.  Suffice it to mention the fact that the G-7 summits repeatedly  see them seated alone around a table, with their ministers and  advisers relegated to seats against the wall or to another room.  <H5>  Little Experience </H5>   A head of state or government with little experience of  international affairs, or with little interest in them -- the  case of President Clinton is a glaring example -- weakens not  only the action taken by his or her country but the efficiency  of the whole international system.    I made similar remarks when commenting in this paper on the  birth of the De Mita government back on 14 April 1988. I  pointed out how the machinery of world politics made it  essential that "every head of government assume strong personal  responsibility." And I emphasized how this was the area in  which De Mita, who was "deeply immersed in our domestic  politics, but an `object of mystery' to the rest of the world,"  would face "perhaps his most difficult personal test in terms of  both image and substance," as he would, moreover, have to "throw  himself into a hectic round of international summits" (even  then!). I recall that Giulio Andreotti, with all his  experience, was appointed foreign minister. And they did not  have the burden of the "postfascists" in the government to  contend with. Just six years have gone by since then, but it  feels like a century.    History repeats itself; and I have no different words for  describing the challenge that new Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi, another "object of mystery," will have to face over  the next few days and weeks. Do not neglect foreign policy, Mr.  Berlusconi; at the end of the day, this is perhaps where your  stature as a politician will find its measure.</p>

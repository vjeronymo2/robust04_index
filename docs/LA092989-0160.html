			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDS ARE MISSING, BUT GIANTS CELEBRATE TITLE WITH PARTY AT CRAIG'S HOME  </P> <P> Roger Craig threw a little party for the San Francisco Giants at his home near  San Diego Thursday, and because of the Cincinnati Reds, the get-together was a  celebration.  </P> <P> Craig would have liked to include the Cincinnati players on the guest list, but  they'll be traveling.  </P> <P> The San Francisco manager did, however, figure out one way to express his  gratitude for the Reds' 13-inning, 2-1 victory over San Diego Wednesday night  that gave the Giants the National League West title and a playoff date against  the East champion Chicago Cubs beginning next Wednesday night in Chicago.  </P> <P> "I'm going to send (Red Manager) Tommy Helms a quarter of a share," Craig said  late Wednesday night after he and his players -- who had just lost, 1-0, to the  Dodgers -- learned that the Reds had eliminated the second-place San Diego  Padres from the West race.  </P> <P> After being swept in three games by the Dodgers, matching their longest losing  streak of 1989, Craig and his players spent a tense hour and a half in the  clubhouse waiting for the game in San Diego to end.  </P> <P> Had the Padres won, the Giants would have faced a weekend series in San Diego  needing a victory to clinch the West. Those final three regular-season games  now are meaningless.  </P> <P> The Giants became fervent Red fans during the clubhouse wait, listening to the  game from San Diego on the radio and cheering for Cincinnati.  </P> <P> When the game finally ended, there were shouts of joy -- and relief.  </P> <P> "Whew," first baseman Will Clark said. "We're all glad it's over."  </P> <P> Looking ahead to the best-of-seven matchup with the Cubs, Craig said he plans  to use Scott Garrelts, 14-5 after Wednesday night's loss to the Dodgers and  still the NL earned-run average leader, in the opening game of the playoffs,  then go with Rick Reuschel (17-7) in the second game. The Cubs will open with  Greg Maddux (19-12) and follow with Mike Bielecki (18-7).  </P> <P> The Giants had a 6-6 record against the Cubs this season, with the teams  splitting six games at both Candlestick Park and Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> Craig said there are similarities between his team and the Cubs, who are  managed by Don Zimmer, a former teammate of Craig's with the Dodgers in  Brooklyn and Los Angeles, and later with the New York Mets.  </P> <P> "I think we're a little like Zimmer's club," Craig said. "Nobody expected us to  be here."  </P> <P> Craig said he was one of those that didn't expect the Cubs to win the NL East  but added that they earned the title.  </P> <P> The Giants will be shooting for their first NL pennant since 1962, the year  slugging outfielder Kevin Mitchell was born. The Cubs haven't won a pennant  since 1945, when Craig and Zimmer were 14.  </P> <P> San Francisco won the NL West title in 1987 but, hampered by injuries, finished  fourth in the division last year, 11 1/2 games behind the Dodgers, who went on  to win the World Series.  </P> <P> This year, the Giants were alone in first place after June 17.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The death of an employee at the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and his  wife during a holiday in Libya has still not been cleared up.  The case was discussed by the Bundestag Parliamentary Control  Commission (PKK) today, its chairman Johannes Gerster said  afterwards. The German Government has briefed the Commission  about the "brutal" circumstances surrounding the death of the  two Germans. The Control Commission strongly criticized the  fact that the Libyan Government has still not complied with a  German Government demand that the incident be completely cleared  up with a comprehensive report.    According to press reports, the employee was a section  leader  in Department VI of the Cologne-based Office for the Protection  of the Constitution, a department which deals with extremist  acts by foreigners and international terrorism. He is said to  have died in a military hospital in Tripoli in mid-April.  According to the reports, the "Middle East and North African  expert" had a holiday trip to Egypt authorized by his employers.  There was a ban on travel to Libya at the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Market opens to rolling settlement Share trading under the new 10-day rolling settlement system starts today, the result of a year of effort by the Stock Exchange and its member firms. Much of the public focus has been on private-client stockbrokers whose customers are chary of the new system, but the Stock Exchange itself has undergone frenetic activity to adapt its Talisman settlement system. According to the Stock Exchange its efforts have paid off. Every Talisman participant has given assurances that its own system is fully prepared to cope with rolling settlement. But until the exchange completes one 10-day settlement period the efficiency of the system will remain untested. Under rolling settlement share bargains settle - that is, shares must be delivered or paid for - 10 business days after each bargain is struck. That may not sound onerous to an investor in the US, for whom a five-day gap is the norm, but the London Stock Exchange has traditionally operated two and three-week settlement periods. The new system means that stockbrokers, institutions and marketmakers will have to deliver cash or securities every single business day instead of on one day at the end of 24 settlement periods each year. Talisman is the Stock Exchange's internal settlements system, first built in 1977. Market participants broadly give the system high marks for durability and efficiency in spite of the surge in share turnover since then. Mr Bernie Till, who runs the system, said: 'Talisman was originally built as a rolling settlements system.' The alterations from the trading account system to rolling settlement require the reversal of changes put in place more than 15 years ago. To indicate the size of the Stock Exchange's task, Mr Till pointed out that: Thirty six of the 58 exchange mainframe computer systems and four personal computer-based systems had to be modified. Participants - stockbrokers, marketmakers, the registrars who keep records of share ownership, and institutional investors - had to modify their own systems to accommodate changes to Settlement Network Interface Specification (SNIS) records. These are pathways through which the exchange communicates electronically with participants. Talisman handles more than 200 input and output SNIS records. Member firms had the greatest number of changes, modifying 36 SNIS records, while registrars were required to modify five. Meanwhile, the exchange said, it spared no effort in informing investors, both professionals and private individuals, about how life would change for them.</p>

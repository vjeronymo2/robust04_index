			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAN AWAITING DRIVING TEST RAMS DMV OFFICE  </P> <P> A 72-year-old man in line to take a driver's test today plowed his car into the  Department of Motor Vehicles building in Canoga Park, injuring four customers  and two employees before stopping 40 feet inside the office.  </P> <P> Most of the injuries were minor. Four of the six injured were taken to area  hospitals for treatment, said Pat Marek, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire  Department.  </P> <P> File cabinets and desks were shoved out of way by the car, said DMV  Investigator Steve Torres. One woman was dragged underneath the car and another  went tumbling over the hood, witnesses said. When the car finally stopped, one  person was pinned against the wall, they said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred as John Anderson of Reseda pulled his black pickup truck  up along the side of the building to take a driver's test. Torres said that for  some reason Anderson drove forward at a high rate of speed, made a large circle  around the parking lot and crashed into the brick wall of the one-story DMV  building. Anderson was not injured. The cause of the accident is under  investigation, he said.  </P> <P> The DMV facility in the 20700 block of Sherman Way was closed after the 9:45  a.m. accident because the computer system was down and employees were visibly  shaken, Torres said. The building will be closed until the computer system is  repaired, he said.  </P> <P> "People were yelling it was an earthquake. They were screaming and running  through to get out of the way," said Jerri Watson of Agoura, who was inside the  building at the time and was still visibly shaken an hour after the incident.  </P> <P> After the accident, Anderson said he lost control of the truck when the  accelerator jammed. "I was pulling up to my spot to wait and the throttle  stuck," Anderson said. "I put on the brakes. What I should have done is turned  off the ignition, but I guess I panicked."  </P> <P> Ruth Johnston, the registered owner of the truck who had driven Anderson to the  DMV and was waiting inside for him, said she had never had any problems with  the accelerator.  </P> <P> "I don't care if I ever drive again," Anderson said after the accident.  </P></p>

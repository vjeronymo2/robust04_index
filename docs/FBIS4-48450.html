			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo says there is no  truth in reports that South Africa could send soldiers to  Rwanda. Mr. Nzo said in a statement in Pretoria that the reports  were based partially on incomplete information on South Africa's  possible reaction to steps that could be taken by the UN to end  the conflict in Rwanda. He said although South Africa was  extremely concerned about the slaughter in Rwanda, the  government would have to consult with other African countries  and the UN before taking a decision on any peace initiatives.</p>

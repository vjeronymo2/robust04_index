			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Dollar hopes lifted as Washington sees rates rising to 5% The Clinton administration signalled yesterday that it expects a further significant tightening of US monetary policy, with short-term interest rates averaging about 5 per cent next year. Short-term rates are currently 4.25 per cent. Higher rates would help bolster the dollar on foreign exchange markets and prevent the US economy from growing too fast and hitting constraints on production capacity. The dollar continued its cautious recovery yesterday, helped by comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. It closed in London at DM1.5457 from DM1.5383 on Wednesday, and at Y98.28 from Y98.155. In late trading in New York, it was at DM1.5547 and Y98.55. The dollar's rally helped US share prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 34.97 at 3,739.25. In its economic projections for its 'mid-session' budget review, the US administration assumes that interest rates on three-month treasury bills will average 4.7 per cent next year. This implies that it expects the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to have raised the key federal funds rate to about 5 per cent. The Fed has raised short-term rates four times this year to 4.25 per cent against 3 per cent in early February. Next Wednesday Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may provide clues to his monetary plans when he delivers his main twice-yearly monetary testimony to Congress. The White House also claimed credit for a rapid reduction in the federal budget deficit, projecting a shortfall of Dollars 167.1bn in the fiscal year beginning this October, against a projection of Dollars 301.8bn before enactment of last year's deficit-cutting measures. As a proportion of gross domestic product, the deficit is projected to fall from 4 per cent in fiscal 1993 to 3.3 per cent this year and then to stabilise at about 2.4 per cent of GDP. The administration's interest rate projections are sharply higher than those in its February budget when it projected a Treasury bill rate of 3.8 per cent in 1995. The White House also concedes that bond yields will remain higher than earlier projected. It expects yields on 10-year Treasury bonds to average 7 per cent next year rather than 5.8 per cent. Since the economy is near full employment, this means the administration does not expect to reduce the structural deficit below about 2.5 per cent of GDP. White House growth and inflation projections are little changed. As in February, it expects economic growth to slow from 3 per cent this year to 2.7 per cent next year and 2.5 per cent later in the decade. Inflation is expected to rise gradually from 2.9 per cent this year to 3.2 per cent next year and 3.4 per cent by 1997. The unemployment rate is projected to stabilise at just above 6 per cent rather than decline to 5.5 per cent as previously projected.

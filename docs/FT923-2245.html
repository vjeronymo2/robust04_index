			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Astra International falls 67% ASTRA INTERNATIONAL, Indonesia's second largest company and dominant player in the automotive industry, yesterday announced a 67 per cent fall in first-half net profits. The company recorded net profits of Rp44bn (Dollars 21.6m) compared with Rp129.4bn a year earlier. The performance of Astra, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, deteriorated in the second quarter, registering net profits of just Rp11.8bn. The interim net figure included a Rp16.9bn gain on the sale of shares in its United Tractors subsidiary. Brokers have been downgrading forecasts in recent months and said the figures were in line with expectations. The company's vehicle sales were down 32 per cent by volume, although it increased market share to 59 per cent against 55 per cent. Some brokers expressed optimism for the second half and believed sales would be lifted by an easing of bank lending rates. One foreign broker was forecasting net profits for the year of about Rp120bn, down from Rp210bn in 1991. The half-year results come amid increased speculation that the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per cent of the company, is preparing to sell up to half its stake. The family has acknowledged it needed to raise finance to restructure its privately-owned Summa Group. Bank Summa, the group's core company, has suffered from losses in its property portfolio. Brokers said the family has raised about Dollars 400m, using Astra shares as collateral, to inject into the Summa Group. Astra is holding an extraordinary general meeting today to confirm the appointment of Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo as chairman, to replace Mr William Soeryadjaya, the company's founder. Astra officials said the move was to reassure investors that no formal link existed between the company and the Summa Group. Speculation over Astra's future ownership has helped depress its shares which have underperformed the Jakarta stock exchange index by 32 per cent in the past year and by 10 per cent in the past month.</p>

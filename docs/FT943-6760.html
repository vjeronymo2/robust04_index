			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Lady Archer told of bid before share deal: Stock Exchange to check if rules for directors were followed Lady Archer attended an Anglia Television board meeting, at which MAI's detailed terms for its proposed takeover were first discussed, on the day before her husband Lord Archer placed his first order for the purchase of Anglia shares. Details were yesterday disclosed for the first time of the price-sensitive information Lady Archer possessed at the time her husband placed instructions with stockbrokers to buy 50,000 Anglia shares. She has told Anglia that she passed no inside information to her husband. However, it emerged yesterday that the London Stock Exchange is examining whether Lady Archer took sufficient steps, under its Yellow Book rules, to prevent her husband from being involved in Anglia share dealings before the Pounds 292m takeover of the television company by MAI. Lord Archer said earlier this week that placing these orders, on behalf of an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, was a 'grave error' and apologised to his wife for any embarrassment he may have caused her. The Department of Trade and Industry has decided not to take any further action against him following a five-month inquiry into alleged insider trading. The DTI inspectors were informed that Lady Archer was present at an Anglia directors' meeting on January 12, when the full board was for the first time told MAI's proposed bid terms. MAI's planned bid, at that stage, was about 610p a share, compared with the stock market price at the time of 482p and the terms eventually put to Anglia shareholders of 637p a share. The following day, Lord Archer telephoned stockbrokers Charles Stanley, a firm he had never used before, and instructed it to purchase 25,000 Anglia shares. The day after, he placed an order for the purchase of a further 25,000 shares. The cost of buying the 50,000 shares was about Pounds 250,000. On January 18, when the takeover was publicly announced, he placed instructions to sell the shares, netting a dealing profit of Pounds 80,000. The cheque for the profit was made out to Mr Saib, although it was sent to Lord Archer's London penthouse near Vauxhall Bridge, overlooking the Thames. Lady Archer said yesterday that she had not tendered her resignation from the Anglia board and said it was 'impertinent' to ask whether she intended to resign. She has told Anglia that she takes very seriously her fiduciary duty not to disclose confidential information relating to the company. Her papers are kept in an outbuilding of the family home at Grantchester near Cambridge. Lady Archer was also present at the board meeting, held at Anglia's merchant bank, SG Warburg in the City, on January 16, which finally agreed that the company would be taken over by MAI. The first board meeting to discuss the MAI approach was on January 5, but at that stage it was unclear whether the takeover would take place. It emerged yesterday that the stock exchange, having been given a copy of the DTI inspectors report, is examining whether Lady Archer fulfilled all her obligations under its Yellow Book of rules governing the behaviour of listed companies. Any serious breach would be publicly censured by the exchange. The exchange's Continuing Obligations department is determining whether Lady Archer took sufficient steps to prevent her husband from placing the share orders and whether she properly fulfilled her responsibility to disclose any dealings by her spouse. The Yellow Book's code for directors states that a director must 'seek to prohibit any dealing in securities of the listed company during a closed period or at a time when the director is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information in relation to those securities' by or on behalf of any member of the director's family. The code also states that the director must tell family members when they cannot deal, for example in the run-up to a takeover, 'unless his duty of confidentiality to the company prohibits him from disclosing such periods'. It says: 'A list of dealings in the securities of the company since the date of the previous list should be circulated to members of the board with the board papers for each board meeting.' Strange case of Lord A, Weekend I</p>

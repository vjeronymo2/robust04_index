			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Tunnel vision - Marina Benjamin looks at a photographic record of Britain's last days as an island When the Queen and President Mitterrand officially open the Channel Tunnel today, the ceremony will also mark the culmination of an ambitious photographic project recording the end of Britain's days as an island. The Cross Channel Photographic Mission, sponsored by South East Arts, is a rich, diverse, and bittersweet essay on Britishness drawn from the sum of its parts, its history, street-culture, landscapes, traditions, and self-delusions. Work by a dozen photographers provides a portrait of a nation in limbo, immobilised between the legacy of a heavily mythologised but fast-fading imperial identity, and faced with the necessity of adapting to a new order. Hew Davies takes as his subject the British neo-colonists who have forsaken Albion for the greener pastures of Nord Pas de Calais - re-christened 'south Kent'. Davies presents them not as Utopian dreamers chasing a Rousseauesque back-to-nature ideal, but as hard-nosed London yuppies and misfits, who, having conquered the home counties territories, see France as the new frontier. Amidst anglicised pubs, houses and gardens, the emigrants have set up a home from home. The Royal Festival Hall is showing three Cross Channel commissions under the sub-heading Britannia. Karen Knorr's allegorical Europhiliac tableaux, featuring androgynous figures in wigs and frock-coats, draw inspiration from the Enlightenment. This was an age of cultural exchange, of curiosity and exploration, a time when no gentleman's education was complete without a European Grand Tour and when Samuel Johnson pronounced patriotism to be the last refuge of the scoundrel. Driving the point home, Knorr has titled her images in English and French. Such bonhomie, however, was the privilege of a small band of channel-hopping intellectuals, who ignored the old enmities between the nations and prized liberty, equality and fraternity before these ideals were used to justify the guillotine. Leaving the tricky issue of Anglo-French relations aside, Peter Kennard and Paul Trevor choose to focus instead on London. Kennard's wittily-titled and hard-hitting installation, 'Welcome to Britain' depicts the bleak side of the metropolis encountered at Waterloo, our cross-Channel starting point. Working in collaboration with the poet Peter Reading, Kennard has constructed an edifice of our time from gaudy souvenirs and scavenged urban flotsam, including wooden pallets and scraps of corrugated card - the bricks and mortar of the homeless. Photographic images of forlorn faces, hands and street-signs can be discerned through its dust coating. The hands are particularly evocative: such eloquent symbols of authorship and manufacture, they are here transformed into the scratching, grasping means of escape. What Kennard has effectively conjured up is the fright at the end of the Tunnel. Paul Trevor's equally gritty work tells a tale of two cities in one. Taking in the square mile occupied by the capital's money market and the street market at Brick Lane, he plays with the notion of neighbours remaining worlds apart. Top cats and underdogs. By getting right up close yet remaining unobserved, Trevor has photographed the passing faces of passing trade. In the City, there are clear complexions, confident jawlines, mobile phones, cigars, pin-strips, handshakes and designer sunglasses; in Brick Lane there are wrinkles, pimples and tattoos, second-hand clothes, cheap make-up, fag-ends and NHS specs. Life - delivered to us in its minutiae - is very different at the two poles of our market economy. And so, by implication, is the inner landscape of the mind. Where symbols of Empire are depicted at all, they are represented as obsolete relics, part of the furniture of nostalgia. Nonetheless many of the photographers seem prone to a spirit of regret, dwelling on what we stand to lose rather than what we might hope to gain: the 'dustman of Europe' looms large while any vision of a potential nouveau Britain is sadly absent. Karen Knorr, Paul Trevor and Peter Kennard at The Royal Festival Hall, until June 5, July 3 and from June 11 to July 10 respectively.</p>

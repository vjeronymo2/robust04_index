Among these parties is Hizballah. Both at home and abroad,  Hizballah is widely seen as one party that is more likely than  others to do some rethinking. Hizballah's regional and domestic  views link its fate closely to the talks. Hizballah is known  for its special links with Iran, a country that aspires to a  regional role and sees Lebanon as a major vehicle for that role.    According to Hizballah sources, the party has not awaited  the  convocation of this summit or the resumption of negotiations to  redraw its guidelines and rethink its role. Hizballah, thanks  to the information it has and the close contact it maintains  with Damascus and Tehran, has for a long time prepared its  answer to all possibilities involving the talks' success or  failure. Hizballah has been getting ready for all the possible  outcomes and repercussions of the negotiations ever since they  started.    Domestically, Hizballah's position continues to be one of  general opposition to negotiations and reconciliation with  Israel. It will continue to maintain this position. What  changed is the method of confrontation it will follow depending  on whether the negotiations succeed or fail.    If the negotiations succeed, Lebanon will, naturally, sign a  peace agreement with Israel. In this case, Hizballah will  oppose any agreement before Israel withdraws completely from  Lebanon. If Israel withdraws before reaching such an agreement,  Hizballah will consider this withdrawal a victory for the  resistance. Subsequently, Hizballah will examine ways of  adjusting to the coming phase and its regional implications. If  the signing of the peace agreement with Israel takes place  before Israel's withdrawal, Hizballah will fight this agreement  and seek to annul it.    In this context, well-informed sources say that Hizballah  has  told senior security officials that it is opposed to any peace  agreement reached before an Israeli withdrawal. Hizballah's  Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has met with security  officials and told them in no uncertain terms that "if someone  tries to shed our blood, ours will not be the only blood shed."    According to the same sources, if the negotiations fail to  produce positive results, Hizballah will continue its course of  armed resistance. It has taken all precautions and preparations  to continue the confrontation. According to reliable  information obtained by AL-SHIRA', the decision to continue the  military confrontation, pending the outcome of the negotiations,  is divided into two parts: The first is to introduce internal  changes and the second is to rehabilitate all Hizballah elements  militarily.    Regarding the first part, the two visits paid by Hizballah  Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah to Tehran in the past few  months resulted in several agreements designed to bring about  better control of the party's various political, security, and  social departments. One important result of these two visits  was a decision to strengthen the security and political  departments, confine them in the hands of Nasrallah, and  eliminate all departments subservient to Iranian officials.  For this purpose, a special bureau has been established under  the control of Nasrallah. The bureau will coordinate in advance  all military and security operations and seek Nasrallah's  approval of them. Consequently, 'Abd-al-Hadi Hammadi has given  up his security responsibilities within the party. Hizballah  has also focused its activity on the south at the expense of its  presence in other areas. It has given priority to the south on  all levels, especially in the field of services and in  implementation of the secret resolutions of a conference it held  seven months ago. The conference was then unofficially coined  the "South Conference."    Regarding the second part, namely military rehabilitation,  in  the past three months Hizballah has retrained all its full-time  and part-time elements. It has retrained 10,000 full-time  fighters in several classes held in al-Hirmil and nearby areas.  The training took place under the supervision of the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard. Long courses, some lasting over two months,  were held for cadres, military officials, and others in Tehran.  The part-timers who are able to fight have undergone 10-day  training courses. About 6,000 part-timers have taken part in  these courses.    If Hizballah has reviewed its calculations and prepared  itself for the coming period, other parties in the Lebanese  arena will also find themselves compelled to review their  calculations after the Geneva summit. This particularly applies  to the parties that have opposed the al-Ta'if accord, as well as  the parties that have wagered and still are wagering that  international and regional developments will turn the clock back  in Lebanon.</p>

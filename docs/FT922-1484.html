			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hungary launches third stock market tier HUNGARY yesterday launched a third tier to its stock market in an attempt to bolster interest in the Budapest market and draw over-the-counter trading onto the market floor. Rules come into effect this week, on the second anniversary of the Budapest Stock Exchange, setting up the new category, the Free Market, for public securities which do not meet full listing requirements. The latest category allows any BSE member, rather than just the issuing company, to introduce a security onto the new market once it has met a simplified set of requirements. Trading is expected to begin next week but brokers do not expect the new market to build up momentum until the second half of this year. Shares in up to 40 public companies, including the main commercial banks, and 260 bonds are candidates for the new market. That compares with 21 listed shares and only one company bond with a full BSE listing. The rigour of full listing requirements has deterred many companies from the BSE. The exchange estimates that between 80 and 90 per cent of securities trading takes place outside the official market. With own turnover languishing the BSE is keen to inject new interest. Trading volume for all securities in May was a disappointing Ft2.3bn (Dollars 30m). The authorities had long planned a third market but were only able to move ahead with it after the opening of a new trading floor last month. Postabank is to raise Ft3bn via a public offer of shares, Reuter reports. It will offer shares at par between June 26 and October 16.</p>

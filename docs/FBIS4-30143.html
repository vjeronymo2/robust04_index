			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Disposal of Nonperforming Assets </F> Requires More Time"]    [Text] On 2 [June 1994], the Bank of Japan (BOJ) published  the so-called white paper on finance titled, "Financial and  Economic Trends for Fiscal Year 1993." It provides the  assessment that write offs of nonperforming assets reached  historically high levels in fiscal year 1993 and comments,  "Financial institutions have demonstrated the desire to  aggressively dispose of bad assets," but that a further  extension of sluggishness in commercial real estate is expected  and complete disposition of such assets "will require  considerably more time." Relative to the deterioration of  balance sheets based on falling asset values, the white paper  explains, "There are signs that worsening balance sheets may  have reduced the capability to assume risks," and adds, "The  impact (on the macroeconomy) should not be disregarded." In  summary, the white paper indicates:    1. The recession in our nation which started in the spring  of  1991 continued in fiscal year 1993. As a result, the recent  recession has proven to be severe in comparison to past  recessions, both in terms of length and scope.    2. Prices such as domestic wholesale prices moved on a weak  basis throughout the fiscal year based on a strong yen and  easing of the supply and demand ratio for manufactured goods  while there was a considerable decline in the rate of increase  of prices for services provided to businesses. Further, consumer  prices stabilized increasingly because of steady labor costs and  an increase in cheap imported products.    In the area of current account balances, the effects of the  strong yen caused a decreasing trend in the real trade surplus  between the spring of last year to year end. However, the  dollar-based trade surplus and current accounts surplus both  rose sharply to new historical highs because of a strong yen and  increase in overseas investment income.    3. The extended recession called for continuation of the  relaxed monetary policies in fiscal year 1993. In September  1993, the BOJ reduced the official discount rate to the  historically low level of 1.75 percent.    4. Loans issued by financial institutions declined  throughout  the year, while the money supply grew slightly over fiscal year  1992, at a low rate. That trend was based on a) sluggish demand  for capital to invest in real assets amidst a prolonged  recession; b) financial restructuring of businesses, and c)  decline in capabilities of businesses to assume risks based on a  drop in asset values.    However, recent monetary easing has contributed to rising  investments in housing and an underpinning for corporate profits  based on lower interest rates. Further, monetary easing  functioned to provide for an environment that enhanced the  feasibility of restructuring of businesses and financial  institutions, thus serving as a factor to sustain the economy.    5. The financial system reflects substantial write offs of  bad loans during fiscal year 1993 over the prior year by banks  throughout the nation, indicating that financial institutions  took unprecedentedly aggressive action in the disposal of bad  loans. It appears that such actions were made possible because  of a favorable financial environment including the ability to  procure capital at a stable low cost and firm stock prices and  the favorable impact of revisions in systems for handling write  offs and reserves for bad loans. Even among financial  institutions, there seems to be a growing desire to enhance  future competitiveness through the aggressive disposition of bad  loans. However, extension of sluggish conditions in the  commercial real estate market will require considerably more  time before completion of bad loan disposal actions by financial  institutions.    6. The persistence of the recent recession was caused by a  concurrent adjustment process on three fronts to include a)  cyclical stock adjustment; b) balance sheet adjustments required  as a result of the collapse of the bubble, and c) pressure to  adjust the industrial structure based on changes in  international competitiveness emanating from a strong yen  throughout 1993.    7. Fluctuations in asset values centered on real estate  after  the mid-1980's have caused major losses on the balance sheets of  businesses and households which used debt to acquire assets  during the period of rising asset values as well as the  financial institutions that issued loans for such purchases,  only to be followed by a decline in asset values. It is believed  that the deterioration in balance sheets of such economic  entities and decline in risk assumption capabilities had a  restraining effect on overall economic expenditures. It is felt  that as a minimum that these conditions have led to sluggish  growth in loans by financial institutions and in the money  supply despite a major decline in interest rates and the  extended recession in capital investments in the small and  medium businesses in the nonmanufacturing sector. However, it is  difficult to quantify the impact of balance sheet adjustments on  current economic trends.    8. World economic trends in recent years reflect spectacular  economic growth in East Asian nations that have an abundant  supply of low-cost labor. And in the United States, productivity  has risen in the manufacturing industries, primarily in the  computer and automotive sectors. Such developments have caused  changes in the relatively superior status of Japanese  industries. The economy of our nation is undergoing a long-term,  structural change referred to as an adjustment in the industrial  structure, in addition to restructuring in response to a  cyclical change in revenues.    In the manufacturing sector, a rapid expansion is taking  place in imports of labor-intensive goods from East Asian  nations. Further, mass production of medium-range high-tech  goods, which Japan has comparative advantage, has been  transferred not only to Europe and the United States but to East  Asian nations via direct overseas investments. Such steps have  led to an active shift to overseas production of existing  products such as automobiles and electrical equipment. The  changes have caused Japanese businesses to convert to production  of technology intensive products. Even in the nonmanufacturing  sector, lower overseas production costs associated with a strong  yen and the effects of deregulation have caused a phenomenon  called "price destruction." This development has functioned to  reduce foreign and domestic price differentials through  efficiencies installed in the distribution system and serves as  an underpinning to bring about real improvements in household  incomes. Elimination of foreign and domestic price differentials  has worked to promote restructuring in the existing  nonmanufacturing sector.    9. An increase in improving economic indicators has been  experienced recently and the economy as a whole manifests signs  of bottoming. As the economy improves in the future, there is a  strong possibility that the impact of adjustments in balance  sheets and industrial structures will have a moderating effect  on the pace of the recovery. There is the possibility that the  pattern of economic recovery will differ from the past when  consideration is given to the varying progress made on stock  adjustments and severity of balance sheet deteriorations in the  respective economic sectors (with conditions being more  favorable in household balance sheets as opposed to those for  businesses) and the positive or negative effects of economic  restructuring on the respective economic entities.    10. Structural adjustments in the industries of our nation  are inevitable as a response to structural changes in the world  economy. Revisions in government regulations will be of crucial  significance in promoting such adjustments and to enhance the  capability of Japan's economy to respond to worldwide changes.  In other words, relaxation and repeal of regulations by Japan  can contribute to: a) establishment of feasibility in forming an  internationally efficient production pattern based on the  construction of a horizontally arrayed division of labor with  nations of the world, especially East Asian nations, in the area  of trade; b) promotion of efficiency in non-trade goods sectors  and enhancement of real purchasing power based on lower consumer  prices, and c) development of new business sectors and expansion  of new industries.    11. Methods for dealing with surpluses in the current  account  are also an issue for Japan. The cyclical portion of surpluses  in the current account attributable to differentials in external  and domestic growth rates should lessen as Japan moves toward  economic recovery. On the other hand, other portions of the  current account surpluses will be affected by Japan's basic  savings and investment balances and are not expected to  disappear on a short-term basis.</p>

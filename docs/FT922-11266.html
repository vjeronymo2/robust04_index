			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Axa plans to sell insurance directly AXA, the second-largest French insurance group, is launching direct sales of motor insurance, a move which could have significant consequences for France's insurance market. Mr Claud Bebear, Axa chairman, said his group planned substantial investment in the venture over the next five years. The initiative, begun earlier this month in the Paris area, involves selling directly to the public through the mass media, direct mail, and by telephone. Axa is the first of the large French companies to sell motor insurance directly. Until now the major companies have sold policies through their agents. However, two smaller French insurers, Azur and Lloyd Continental, have already established direct sales operations as have two UK companies - General Accident and Commercial Union. In the past the French majors have been reluctant to begin direct selling for fear of alienating the agents which have had exclusive rights to sell their products. Agents also act as a barrier against new entrants to the French market thereby detering potential international competitors. However, pressure is growing for change from the agents, many of which favour breaking ties to individual insurers so they can act as brokers. The French majors also face increasing competition from the growing band of mutual companies which claim 29 per cent of the French market for motor and home insurance policies. Large companies like Axa have been encouraged by the success of direct sales companies elsewhere in northern Europe, particularly in the UK, where direct writers - such as Direct Line, the subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland  -now have a market share of about 10 per cent. Mr Bebear estimates the market for direct sales in France could be of a similar size. The Axa chairman also alluded to his group's possible ambitions in the UK. Axa's two existing UK non-life operations - Westgate and London &amp; Hull - are both niche operations. Its other UK subsidiary, Axa Equity &amp; Law, has a more sizeable share of the life assurance sector. Mr Bebear said his aim was for Axa's UK subsidiary to be at least a third as big as the top UK composites.</p>

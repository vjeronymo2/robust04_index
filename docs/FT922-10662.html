			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Political dimension of drug prices in EC Sir, Your article, 'Car prices vary by 40 per cent in parts of EC' (April 27), very succinctly points out a major pricing problem in the EC. This example pales into relative insignificance, however, if one looks at the 200 per cent-plus discrepancy between prices of pharmaceuticals in different EC countries. Also, unlike the case of retail car prices, the cause of the drug price problem is a relatively simple one: artificial price fixing and squeezing by some governments. Politicians and bureaucrats find drugs to be the only sector of healthcare where they feel it is politically possible to cut costs to balance their books, without considering whether pharmaceuticals can save costs in the long run by cutting down on hospitalisation and other costs.

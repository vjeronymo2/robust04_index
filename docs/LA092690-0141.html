			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHORALE OPENS 35TH SEASON ON AN ITALIAN NOTE  </P> <P> The Appian Way  </P> <P> The Master Chorale of Orange County opened its 35th season Saturday night with  two Italian-theme parties and, in between, a production of Verdi's Requiem at  the Performing Arts Center. After the curtain dropped, about 250 chorale fans  packed a gala at Gianni's Ristorante in the Crystal Court at South Coast Plaza  for wine, hors d'oeuvres and dessert. Before the concert began, 73 of the  group's most dedicated supporters met at Alfredo's Ristorante in the Westin  South Coast Plaza hotel for cocktails and a gourmet sit-down dinner.  </P> <P> Welcoming Words  </P> <P> Director William Hall -- whose sonorous voice is a concert in itself -- mingled  with the dinner crowd at Alfredo's, then stepped up a few stairs from the  sunken dining area to greet the group en masse. He praised his singers, saying,  "I've learned that all I have to do is do the downbeat, let them come in, then  follow them." He briefly described the accomplishments of the four "superstar"  soloists performing with the chorale that night -- Elizabeth Biggs of the New  Zealand Opera, Leslie Richards of the San Francisco Opera, Jonathan Welch of  the Metropolitan Opera and Louis Lebherz of Covent Garden. Hall, beating a  hasty retreat, exited as the risotto and tomato basil appetizers were being  served (these were followed by a choice of entrees: grilled salmon with Italian  salsa or spinach rotolo stuffed with seasoned chicken). "You guys enjoy the  good food," Hall said, laughing. "I'm going to go back to my hotel room for a  cheese sandwich and a little more preparation before the concert."  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> Among the dinner guests was Donna Bunce, a frequent flier on the society  circuit and member of the Master Chorale. "I eat, I sing, I do it all!" Bunce  joked. Also doing it all were chorale members Gary Busby, John Rynerson, Maxine  Trotter and Diane and Bob Guyett. Jim Hissey, a fan from Canoga Park, made the  hour-plus drive to attend the party. Arriving from less distant points were  county residents Jane and Philip Winsor, Linda and Joe Gatlin, Georgina and  Stan Califf, Lois and Richard Gettys, Carol Adams, Susan Beechner, and Marcello  Doffo. Nancy Sorosky -- a longtime resident of the Westin South Coast Plaza,  where the dinner was held -- chaired the event.  </P> <P> Quote  </P> <P> When this is over, I think I'm going to run upstairs and put on a nice,  comfortable knit dress for the concert," said Sorosky, who chose a nice,  not-so-comfortable black crepe strapless to dine in.

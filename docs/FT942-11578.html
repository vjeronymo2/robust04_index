			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Martin Stanbridge of the FT: Obituary Martin Stanbridge, a senior editor on the International Companies pages at the Financial Times, has died at the age of 41 after a long battle against cancer. He was born in South Africa but moved to the UK as a small child with his family. He obtained a BSc in geography at University College London, before joining Price Waterhouse as a trainee accountant. He decided accountancy was not for him and became a trainee journalist on a London weekly paper, later moving to the now defunct Evening Post-Echo at Hemel Hempstead, Herts, before joining the FT in 1981 as a UK Companies News sub-editor. He joined our UK News sub-editing team in 1984 and the International Companies section as night news editor in 1987, moving to take responsibility for the section's overseas news page in 1990. As a journalist, he was a true professional, working with quiet efficiency to ensure everything he handled attained the highest quality and dealing with writers, often in far flung corners of the globe, with an appropriate mixture of tact and firmness. As a colleague, he was unfailingly kind, courteous and helpful, inclined to self-deprecation, and widely liked. Outside the office, he was an avid reader, particularly in art, architecture and history. He will be much missed.</p>

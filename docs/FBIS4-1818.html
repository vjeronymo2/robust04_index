			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, March 23 (XINHUA) -- A delegation  consisting of 100 representatives from nearly 90 big publishers  on the Chinese mainland left here today for Taiwan via Hong Kong  for a book fair, to bolster cultural exchanges across the  straits.    The fair, sponsored by the China Publication Distribution  Trade Association, is expected to be staged in Taibei [Taipei]  city from March 29 to April 4.    About 26,000 new books in nine categories produced by 181  publishers on the mainland will be on display at the show.    As one of the publications exchanges across the straits  projected by the China National Publication Import and Export  Corporation (CNPIEC), the book exhibition will be the mainland's  first such show in Taiwan.    In November 1993, the CNPIEC held the first fair on the  mainland of books from Taiwan, and more than 20,000 books from  307 Taiwan publishers were displayed.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Military in Chile adamant on general Chile's democratic government faces renewed embarrassment at the hands of the military today if, as expected, General Rodolfo Stange resumes his post as chief of police in spite of government insistence that he step down. Gen Stange, who is being investigated for the alleged cover-up of police involvement in three killings, said he would defy government requests to extend his leave indefinitely. Under the 1980 constitution handed down by the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's president cannot dismiss commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, of whom Gen Stange is one. Government spokesmen have resorted to oblique references to the 'inconvenience' of the situation or to the general's 'moral' duty. At one point, public bickering was reduced to a discussion of the legality of an 'indefinite vacation'. Behind such semantics lies the conflict between the residual power of the military, which ruled for 17 years, and that of a four-year-old democracy, gradually growing in confidence and intent on regaining its traditional constitutional powers. President Eduardo Frei, who took over in March, has pledged to democratise the 1980 constitution. Some commentators argue that Mr Frei may have deliberately provoked confrontation with Gen Stange in order to galvanise public opinion in favour of constitutional amendments.</p>

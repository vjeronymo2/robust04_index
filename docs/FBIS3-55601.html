			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 06, BNS - The CSCE high commissioner on  ethnic minorities, Max van der Stoel, voiced new, constructive  proposals for the resolution of the citizenship problem in  Latvia, said parliament's speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs. Van der  Stoel is visiting Riga this week to discuss citizenship and  ethnic minorities' problems with Latvian officials.    Under the proposals, Latvia should naturalize citizens'  spouses and children, and ethnic Latvians who still lack  citizenship in 1994 and 1995.    In 1996, citizenship should be offered to all permanent  residents who speak Latvian and have lived here a certain number  of years, recommended van der Stoel. The residence qualification  could be 20, 30 or 40 years, he said.    This option, said van der Stoel, would not threaten the  identity of the Latvian nation and would provide non-citizens  with clearcut future prospects.    Van der Stoel criticized as too vague the naturalization  mechanism in the ruling coalition's citizenship blueprint. The  resident non-citizens may find it difficult to judge their  prospects to ever get naturalized, the high commissioner said.    The Latvia's Way-Farmers' Union bill grants citizenship  under  a system of annual quotas. The government sets the quotas in  compliance with the current economic and demographic situation  to ensure the development of Latvia as a national state. The  parliament passed the first reading of the bill Nov. 25.    Gorbunovs pointed to one major shortcoming in van der  Stoel's  proposal. The bulk of non-citizens came to Latvia by 1977 what  may lead to mass-scale naturalization if the country introduces  a 20-year residence threshold, for example, in 1996.    The speaker told van der Stoel that the new version could  only be considered if the problem of repatriation of  non-citizens was tackled simultaneously.    Gorbunovs suggested that the CSCE structures could be  helpful  in drafting a repatriation program, just like they are helpful  in settling the citizenship issue.    The Saeima (parliament) would discuss the high  commissioner's  recommendations when discussing the citizenship bill. At the  same time, Latvia waits for conclusions by international  organizations to whom the citizenship bill was sent for expert  study, Gorbunovs added.</p>

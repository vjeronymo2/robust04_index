			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N in talks to acquire German stake T&amp;N, the engineering group, is believed to be in talks with Metallgesellschaft over the potential acquisition of the German company's 47 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle components maker. The talks are likely to intensify following reports that Metallgesellschaft's agreement to sell its stake to Dana Corporation of the US has run into difficulty. It is believed that talks between T&amp;N and Metallgesellschaft have been in progress for about six months, and continued even after the Germany company came to an agreement with Dana. T&amp;N said: 'This is speculation and we cannot comment.' The stake in Kolbenschmidt was put up for sale in January by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who was brought in by creditor banks to salvage the ailing German engineering giant. It had suffered huge losses, totalling more DM1bn (Pounds 400m) on oil derivatives trading by a US subsidiary. Last March, Dana agreed in principle to buy the stake, though no price was put on the deal, which has not been approved by the companies' boards. Given its financial difficulties, Metallgesellschaft may be under some pressure to secure a sale of the stake. Kolbenschmidt lost DM123m in the year to last September and is labouring under heavy borrowings. T&amp;N's interim pre-tax profits, due to be released on Thursday, are expected to reach Pounds 51m, helped by an upturn in European car sales and in the US car industry.</p>

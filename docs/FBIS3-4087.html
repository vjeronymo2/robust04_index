This is the first time  since the implementation of the bankrupcy law for a Sichuan  court to hand down a bankruptcy order involving such a large sum  of debts.    The dyeing factory went into operation in Neijiang city in  1987 and it suffered losses because of poor management,  unsuitable equipment, low grade of products, high costs and a  continuously weak market for textiles. Not a single improvement  was seen even though the factory received various kinds of help  and it was forced to stop production in December, 1992. The  1,040-strong staff received a minimum monthly wage to meet their  living expense. The factory saw accumulated losses of RMB  47,829 million while its fixed assets was put at RMB 56.987  million with gross liabilities of RMB 104.81 million. The  factory applied to the court on January 25 this year for  bankruptcy.    The court ruled that the factory was unable to service the  due debt and a bank loan for the factory was stopped. A  deferred settlement was considered more damaging to the state  while the factory met the requirements set out in the bankruptcy  law. The court finally handed down a bankruptcy order to the  factory and a clearance team was set up to deal with the debt  servicing matter.    The local labour and employment departments have worked out  certain measures to settle the situation regarding the workers  of the defunct factory. They will be entitled to employment in  the factory after re-organization, to seek jobs in other  business entities or undertake other kinds of career by  tendering their resignation from the factory.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Royal Ordnance comes into the firing line Almost seven years after the government sold Royal Ordnance to British Aerospace for Pounds 190m, a question mark has once again been placed over the future of the arms and munitions manufacturer. BAe confirmed at the weekend that it had been in talks for some weeks with Giat which could lead to some form of collaboration between the French state-owned arms manufacturer and its Ordnance subsidiary. The acquisition in April 1987 not only strengthened BAe's already substantial defence business but appeared to ensure a stable future for 300-year-old Royal Ordnance following aborted plans for its stock market flotation a year earlier. At that stage Ordnance was a sprawling organisation employing 16,000 workers spread across 13 factories and two research and development sites. With the Ministry of Defence as it biggest customer by far it had annual sales of Pounds 440m and a forward order book of Pounds 800m. Sir Austin Pearce, BAe chairman at the time, said of the deal: 'We feel strongly we can increase the business of Ordnance.' However, he added more ominously: 'Clearly there are areas where we can improve its efficiency.' Four months later, following a detailed study, it became clear what Sir Austin had meant when plans were announced to close the Enfield plant - source of the 2m .303 Lee Enfield rifles used during the First World war - with the loss of 1,200 jobs. The job cuts at Enfield were to be the first of many as the 1980s drew to a close and defence spending was cut in the wake of the dramatic event in eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet empire. Since then Ordnance's UK-based workforce has been reduced to 6,500. Some 2,100 jobs have gone in the last two years and another 300 are to go at the company's ammunition factory in Chorley, Lancashire, under the latest round of cuts announced in January. BAe, which last month reported a Pounds 273m pre-tax loss despite recording a Pounds 345m profit before interest and tax in its defence operations, does not break out figures for Ordnance. However, BAe describes Ordnance's operations today as 'very competitive' and says it is 'cash generative and broadly profitable' excluding the ongoing costs of rationalisation. Ordnance, which has annual sales of about Pounds 400m, has been trying to build up overseas orders to help offset declining MoD expenditure. As part of this drive it acquired Heckler &amp; Koch, a German small arms manufacturer, in 1991. In October the company won a crucial MoD five-year contract worth about Pounds 250m to supply ammunition types ranging from small arms to tank shells. The contract, delayed after coming under Treasury scrutiny, was won against fierce competition. However, highlighting the effect of defence cuts, the new ammunition order was worth only about half the previous five-year deal agreed in 1988 and further job cuts and rationalisation measures have not been ruled out. Even without the profit and loss figures it is clear that Royal Ordnance has not been the bargain some suggested it was at the time of the government sale.</p>

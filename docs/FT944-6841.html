			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / People: Germany's man of tomorrow and his problems of today / A look at the challenge facing Jurgen Ruttgers, recently appointed as the country's first minister for the future Freshly installed as Germany's first minister for the future, Jurgen Ruttgers faces a busy time dealing with some matters from the past before he can hope to look very far ahead. One job in particular - the establishment of a national academy of sciences  -seems tailored to provide him with the experience he will need when he gets round to dealing with the responsibilities loaded on to his 43-year-old shoulders by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Ruttgers, head of a combined super-ministry in charge of education, science, technology and research policies, has already been warned by friendly observers that the federal (some might say tribal) make-up of the German scientific community provides it with an in-built resistance to centralisation and political tampering. But Bonn has decreed that a national body is needed to complement and provide a point of contact with similar organisations in other industrialised countries. During Ruttgers' maiden ministerial speech on Friday, he won promises of support from the opposition Social Democrats, despite lingering suspicions that the academy of sciences might turn out to be a pure propaganda factory. It is now up to Ruttgers to build the necessary consensus, which will require him to test in an alien environment the skills of persuasion which he has hitherto only applied in smoke-filled back rooms in the Bundestag. The new minister was formerly chief whip to Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and respected among conservatives and Social Democrat opponents alike as a thoughtful and persuasive politician. Since he first took his seat in the Bundestag in 1987, he appears to have risen through the upper parliamentary atmosphere without creating any of the enemies customarily found smouldering in a shooting star's wake. He endeared himself to his party leadership by taking on complex and apparently thankless assignments, such as the challenge of an esoteric and decade-old inquiry into how to monitor and assess the impact of new technologies on society. It was a process initially regarded with deep suspicion by the liberal Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners, and the opposition. But Ruttgers won through, and now the Bundestag has a modest advisory bureau: not because the government wanted it, but because Ruttgers apparently came to believe in the concept. 'Those who want to take advantage of the liberating potential of technology must improve their understanding of the short- and long-term effects and side-effects of (related) political decisions,' he was to comment later. As that quotation suggests, Ruttgers, described as using his brain more than his elbows while in the chief whip's job, may not be the snappiest wordsmith in the Bundestag. But his adherence to such principles is likely to make him more than a match for the Greens and other outright techno-antagonists in parliament. He returned to the theme again on Friday when he repeated a previous acknowledgement that there were limits scientific progress could not overstep, particularly where human dignity might be impeached. But the question of whether mankind was already capable of doing everything it had to be able to do to handle hunger, unemployment, sickness and environmental damage demanded an answer, he said. Principles aside, the minister of the future also showed himself a master of the art of making a promise and then suggesting that its fulfilment might not be terribly important. Spending on future-oriented projects would be increased, he proclaimed. But money was not the real issue. 'Innovation starts in the head,' he said, and German minds were more in need of change and innovation than any departmental budget. The Jeremiahs and doubters had the upper hand, he added. He will find no shortage of such types in regional educational authorities, nor among the autonomy-minded scientific research institutes, where the minister is charged with balancing the various and often conflicting requirements of vested interests in local, regional and federal government, industry and academia. One of the chancellor's favourite projects, for example, is to reduce the time students spend at university before entering work. As the chancellor enjoys saying, Germany cannot afford to educate people up to the age of 30 and then allow them to start drawing retirement pensions at 60. Industry, meanwhile, demands that university study should be funded by loans rather than grants, and complains that highly-specialised German college courses turn out too few of the business-minded, broadly-based graduates increasingly to be found on the payrolls of international competitors. At the same time, the business world demands that 'excessive' expenditure on basic research in government-funded institutes should be diverted into work more relevant to the needs of an economy which has a structural deficit in innovation. According to the electronics industry association, ZVEI, only 50 per cent of basic research projects in Germany have any economic relevance. The dislocation of the relationship between business and government, the responsibility for which many lay at the door of a neglectful Chancellor Kohl himself, has been painfully exposed by the wrench of recession. The coalition's ideas for an academy of science and a research, technology and innovation council as a central clearing house for political, business and scientific ideas, is intended as part of the cure for the neglect. Drafting grand ideas and even leading the intended participants to the meeting table is the easy part. Planting the idea that innovation might start in their heads is the real job facing the minister of the future, who will be assured of a substantial future of his own if he pulls it off.</p>

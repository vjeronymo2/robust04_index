			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / People: Richard Ramsay to run Ivory and Sime's City office Ivory and Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management company, has appointed Richard Ramsay, 41, as an executive director to run its newly expanded City office and its private client business. Ramsay has had a long association with Ivory and Sime in his former capacity handling corporate finance clients at Hill Samuel and Co and, since 1988, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. He was responsible for most of the company's investment trust flotations and reconstructions and is a director of one of Ivory and Sime's investment trusts. He also played a part in the privatisation of Scottish Power. The former head of the company's private client business, David Nichol, 45, who retired at the end of December to run a family farm in Scotland, was the last of Ivory and Sime's 'old guard' following a well-publicised defection of directors in 1990. Alan Munro, managing director, says Ramsay's appointment is intended to help raise the company's profile in the City of London: 'It's the first point of contact for new private client and institutional client business'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, Para (Brazil), 6 Jun (EFE) -- On 6 June,  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa told EFE NEWS AGENCY  that Chile will establish a free trade zone with the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur), composed of Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay, within 10 years, at the very most.    Figueroa added that the Chilean Government will formalize  its  proposal in a document to be submitted to Argentine Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella, who is also Mercosur Council chairman,  on 8 June.    The Chilean foreign minister is participating in the 24th  OAS  General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in Para  State's Amazon region, on 6 June and will continue its  deliberations until 10 June.    Figueroa noted: "We have not joined Mercosur due to  difficulties arising from import duties."    Chile levies an 11 percent tariff on all imports regardless  of the country of origin, whereas Mercosur member countries levy  higher tariffs, the rate of which varies according to products.    After a meeting with Mercosur foreign ministers in Belem,  Minister Figueroa announced on 5 June that Chile will join  Mercosur as an associate rather than full member. He  nonetheless did not rule out the possibility of his country  joining Mercosur in the future.    Chile is one of the Latin American countries with the  highest  growth rate and the largest volume of foreign trade. It is the  only country in the region that has not joined any integration  movements in South America like Mercosur, the Andean Group, and  the Amazon Pact.    Figueroa said this decision will not produce changes in the  negotiations his country is undertaking with the United States,  the main partner of NAFTA, which also comprises Canada and  Mexico.    The foreign minister added that the Treaty of Asuncion  allows  "any country" that does not belong to other economic blocs "to  join" Mercosur.    Mercosur was established in March 1991 by Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay. These countries had invited Chile to  join Mercosur since its inception but to no avail. At that  time, Chilean authorities contended that they would rather not  join this integration movement since Chile's import duties were  lower than those of its neighbors.</p>

An operation will not be considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In addition to the trains operated by railroads specifically excepted in paragraph (a) of this section, this part does not apply to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A freight train of four-wheel coal cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A freight train of eight-wheel standard logging cars if the height of each car from the top of the rail to the center of the coupling is not more than 25 inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A locomotive used in hauling a train referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section when the locomotive and cars of the train are used only to transport logs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> [The final rule may contain a directory of the definitions] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air Flow Indicator <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a device used to indicate the flow of air from the locomotive brake valve into the brake pipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air Flow Indicator, AFM  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a specific air flow indicator required by the air flow method. The AFM Air Flow Indicator is a calibrated air flow measuring device which is clearly visible and legible in daylight and darkness from the engineer's normal operating position. The indicator face displays (1) markings from 10 cubic feet per minute (CFM) to 80 CFM, in increments of 10 CFM or less, and (2) numerals indicating 20, 40, 60, and 80 CFM for continuous monitoring of air flow. The AFM Air Flow Indicator must be used when performing the Air Flow Method of train brake testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air Flow Method (AFM)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means an alternate method of measuring the leakage of air from a train brake system by use of an AFM air flow indicator. The controlling locomotive on the train must be equipped with 26&hyph;L Freight Locomotive Brake Equipment, or equivalent, and the train equipped with an end-of-train device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bind  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means restrict the intended movement of one or more brake system components by reduced clearance, by obstruction, or by increased friction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dispute over Aerolineas settled Argentina and Iberia, Spain's state-owned national airline, have settled their three-year dispute over the privatisation of Argentina's flag carrier Aerolineas Argentinas. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr Javier Salas, Iberia president, signed a deal last week requiring Iberia to inject Dollars 500m into the heavily loss-making Aerolineas, raising its stake to 85 per cent from 30 per cent. The latest crisis at Aerolineas was sparked off last year by Mr Cavallo's refusal to commit its share of the Dollars 500m capital increase. The government's 33 per cent stake will drop to 5 per cent, with the employees holding the remaining shares. The government will, however, continue to recognise Aerolineas as Argentina's flag carrier. Most of the capital injection will be used to reduce the Dollars 700m in loans Iberia had advanced Aerolineas, and Dollars 100m is earmarked for new investments. The Spanish and Argentine banks that held most of the remaining shares in Aerolineas on behalf of Iberia have withdrawn from the company. As part of the deal, the government will ban charter flights, removing a growing source of competition on international routes. However, it rejected Iberia's demands for tighter regulation of domestic flights. Iberia wanted it to restrict the entry of strong, possibly foreign-owned, competitors into the local market. Iberia will also be allowed to provide ground services for Aerolineas, which are monopolised by an air force-controlled company, helping to reduce operating costs.</p>

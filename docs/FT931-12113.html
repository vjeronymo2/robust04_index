			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home repossessions fall from 1991 peak REPOSSESSIONS fell from their 1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 at the end of last year, according to figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders this week. But the 9 per cent drop was accompanied by a sharp rise in the number of those with mortgage arrears of at least six months. At the end of last year, more than 350,000 households were six months behind in their mortgage payments - an increase of 28 per cent on the 1991 total of 275,350. Home-owners who were between six to 12 months behind increased to 205,010 at the end of 1992 from 183,610 the previous year, while borrowers more than a year in arrears rose from 91,740 to 147,040. Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, gave two main reasons for the rise. When a property is repossessed, those with mortgage arrears fall out of the statistics. And since lenders increasingly were accepting lower monthly payments rather than repossessing, the arrears figures had increased. Boleat added that lower interest rates inflate the figures because of a 'statistical quirk.' Figures for monthly arrears are calculated by dividing the total outstanding by the monthly payments. When interest rates fall, so do the new monthly payments. The number of months of arrears for those falling behind with their payments then increases automatically. Shelter, the charity for the homeless, said that it did not agree with this interpretation. Director Sheila McKechnie said: 'The problem of mortgage debt is not diminishing, it is just shifting from repossessions to long-term arrears. The crisis has been postponed, not solved.' Shelter is calling for a mortgage benefit scheme similar to low-income housing benefit to those who rent. Jim Murgatroyd of Halifax, the largest lender, said it was 'illogical and unfair' that those who owned homes should not be in the same position as those who rent. In the case of a joint mortgage, keeping up payments was not so much of a difficulty if both parties became unemployed because they would be entitled to social security. But if one was made redundant or had a loss of income, it was more difficult for them to make regular payments. The launch of schemes designed to contain the total number of repossessions has had a limited effect compared with a policy of 'forbearance' by lenders. Boleat estimates that only 1,000 homes have been saved as a result of mortgage to rent schemes. But 10,000 households have been saved from repossession because of the government's decision to pay the mortgage interest element of income support directly to lenders. While more than 60 per cent of repossessed households had a second mortgage, the CML said, the second lender had been responsible for repossession in only 1,000 cases. But the figures show that those with greater debts found it harder to stave off repossession than others. Halifax said that situation was changing. Those falling behind with mortgage payments now were more likely to be doing so because of loss of income rather than multiple debts. CML said that lenders would not increase repossessions once the market improved.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Market conditions hit Woolcombers float WOOLCOMBERS Group, the Yorkshire wool processor, yesterday postponed its planned flotation because of unstable market conditions and the lack of liquidity in small companies. Following the circulation of the outline prospectus on September 10, James Capel, the stockbrokers, were to announce the details of the issue yesterday. A market value of between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m was expected for Woolcombers, with just under Pounds 20m set to be raised via a share placing. However, not enough institutions were prepared to take the shares. Mr Alan Lewis, chairman of Woolcombers, said: 'We have just been through the most turbulent market conditions since 1987. This coupled with the lack of liquidity in the small companies sector forced us to postpone the issue.' He denied that the postponement had anything to do with the business. Mr Lewis hopes Woolcombers will return to the stock market when conditions stabilise. However, he indicated that uncertainty in the markets could delay the planned flotation for a long time. Woolcombers is part of the Illingworth Morris group, taken private by Mr lewis in 1989. Mr Lewis controls a string of textiles companies.</p>

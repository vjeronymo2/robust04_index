			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Political Notebook: Back to the 'basics' drawing board Midsummer madness in January. That was the most optimistic gloss one cabinet minister could put on the latest furore buffeting Mr John Major. Back to the bad old days was the more realistic assessment of another colleague. The odds are that if the government keeps its nerve, the present storm will blow itself out eventually. But it could rage for some time yet. A damaging auditor's report on the activities of Westminster City Council will reinforce the impression that the Conservative party is frequently indifferent to the traditional values it is now preaching. Downing Street may well have underestimated the political fall-out. Lord Howe's appearance yesterday at the Scott inquiry and Mr Major's evidence to the same body next week will refocus media attention on Whitehall's less-than-honest handling of arms sales to Iraq. The tabloid press is determined to keep up the pressure on those ministers and Tory MPs who, like many of us, have the odd skeleton in the cupboard. The prime minister may insist that he is not in the business of witch-hunts  -but witch-hunts sell newspapers. However absurd have been some (but not all) of the revelations of the past few days, few in the government doubt the cumulative damage inflicted on Mr Major. Downing Street has exercised little or no control over events. No-one, it seems, knows how to run a damage-limitation operation. So even in the minds of his friends Mr Major emerges once again as an irresolute leader, a victim rather than a master of events. The old cliche that the prime minister is 'on probation' has resurfaced in the bars of Westminster. His cabinet colleagues have not won any prizes either. Like the rent-a-quotes on the backbenches, ministers have clamoured for spots on radio and television to offer their personal and differing interpretations of what Mr Major means by 'back to basics'. And for all the prime minister's insistence that his campaign is about education, law and order and the economy rather than sexual behaviour, the friends in the cabinet of the moral majority have made the most noise. But the buck stops at No 10. If his cabinet is undisciplined, it is the prime minister's job to restore order. He cannot ignore the need for his ministers to speak with one voice. Nor can he avoid a more detailed explanation of the moral dimensions of 'back to basics'. That in itself should not be difficult. Cabinet ministers are at last using 'line-to-take' notes to ensure that they say roughly the same thing when explaining the policy. The note omits any detailed exposition of the stance ministers should adopt towards adultery. But it does not take much imagination to explain that distinguishing between right and wrong stretches some way beyond the sexual behaviour of MPs. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is expected to do the job in a speech tomorrow. Mr Major's problem, though, is one of credibility. Sections of the Conservative press have decided that whatever he does or says, he is not up to his job. His enemies on the Tory backbenches speak of him with contempt. There is an air of resignation in the defences offered by his friends. The opinion polls reinforce the gloom. Even before the latest furore the Conservatives' standing was consistently below 30 per cent and Mr Major's own rating the worst of any post-war prime minister. The fragile reawakening of self-confidence apparent in the closing weeks of last year has been stifled. The current unease could be turned to panic by tax rises in April followed by dismal Conservative performances in the local and European elections. Some on the backbenches are already saying that if the government's share of the vote does not climb above 30 per cent then the prime minister must pack his bags. Mr Major cannot be written off. The economy is on his side at last. That counts. If he can restore a grip, the appeal of 'back to basics' might yet confound the cynicism of the metropolitan intelligentsia. He is a more resilient politician than his critics allow. Most of the bookmakers think it is even money that Mr Major will lead the Conservatives into the next general election. One or two think his chances are slightly worse. As of now, most of his colleagues are not offering much better odds.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Takeover activity drives London market up The driving forces behind the London stock market this week have been the agreed bid for Portals, the security paper manufacturer, from De La Rue, and the Trafalgar House bid for Northern Electric, which triggered a wave of takeover speculation throughout the utilities areas. The FT-SE 100 index ended the day 8.3 points off at 3,083.4, its first decline in six trading sessions, but remained 69.8 points, or 2.3 per cent, higher on the week.

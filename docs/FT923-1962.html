			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: Inside the Peking palace walls - How the inscrutable Chinese leak the dirt and manipulate history THE NEW EMPERORS, MAO AND DENG: A DUAL BIOGRAPHY by Harrison E. Salisbury HarperCollins,Pounds 20, 544 pages THIS COULD have been a magnificent book, an intimate, colourful yet definitive double biography of China's two all-powerful post-revolutionary leaders. Instead, it is marred by conceit and bias. It is, nevertheless, a good read. Harrison Salisbury has enjoyed enviable access to China doubtless because his years as Moscow correspondent for the New York Times established his anti-Soviet bona fides in Peking's eyes, and this book benefits enormously from unbuttoned conversations with many of the main players and their acolytes in Peking's palace politics. His rival China watchers, who despite China's intermittent bouts of relative openness must spend long years pouring over documents, fitting bits of evidence into a complicated jigsaw, must gnash their teeth in jealous rage as Salisbury casually attributes a fascinating titbit to a personal conversation with China's president Yang Shangkun or with Mao's personal secretary. But the impact of such impressive footnote references is mitigated when Salisbury gives equal billing to sources such as the aged New Zealand Marxist poet Rewi Alley, Mao's hagiographer Han Suyin, or journalist Russell Spurr (who will be amused to see himself billed as a historian and specialist on Korea). More damaging are the names of many distinguished China scholars and journalist labourers in the nightsoil of Chinese politics meanly omitted from both the index and the bibliography. Salisbury has cast himself in the twin roles of ace reporter on the spot and guru, and appears reluctant to acknowledge rivals. Nevertheless, the book represents a stunningly detailed account of two enigmatic figures; their years as leaders of a revolution and thereafter of a huge country; their tortured relations with each other, with their colleagues and with the outside world (Salisbury is particularly good on the Sino-Soviet relationship). Indeed, so detailed and circumstantial are some of the accounts of private conversations that the reader's critical faculty is jolted into suspicion that the line between history and gossip, even that between fact and 'faction,' has been crossed. Anyone who has conducted interviews in China, even on those occasions when the interviewee has obviously received permission to talk pretty freely, finds himself being fed an indigestible 'line' rarely enlivened by personal touches and reminiscences which do not serve as parables to underline the propaganda theme. The very detailed richness of Salisbury's anecdotal evidence confirms that Salisbury is not so much playing the part of a historian, but of a messenger boy for the Deng faction. This is the way Chinese history has unfolded for generations: emperors attempt to influence history's verdict on their predecessors; their successors do likewise. Salisbury has obviously been fingered by the Deng faction to convey their version of Mao, and of Deng himself, to the outside world, just as Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, once picked out an unknown American sociologist, Roxanne Witke, to tell her story. One can only wish that he had exploited the resulting material by stepping back and putting both men into an objective context. Instead, Salisbury has softened Deng's hard edges, accentuating the pragmatic builder and glossing over the egotistical survivalist who ordered the tanks into Tienanmen Square and sacrificed comrades like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, who were no longer assets to his interests, just as cynically as Mao had dumped him. The hard-liners Deng appointed to keep the lid on dissent in the aftermath of Tienanmen come across as essentially benign realists. The full viciousness of Salisbury's sources falls on Mao. He is deservedly painted as a bloody tyrant, an increasingly neurotic Chinese Stalin who shut himself away from the people he constantly evoked to justify his worst excesses, who destroyed the bearers of bad news, and who brought death to millions, from famine in the wake of the Communes and the Great Leap Forward and from violent anarchy during the Cultural Revolution. But the verdict of blood-stained tyrant does not fully serve the Deng clique's ends. Further smears are called for: Mao is portrayed as a decadent emperor, alternately fasting and gobbling braised bears' paws as millions of peasants starve; addicted to sleeping pills and drugs, wallowing 'like a rutting walrus' in his heated pool within the Zhongnanhai, the imperial compound adjoining the Forbidden City, with assorted naked dancing girls. All this may be true, or maybe exaggerated for foreign audiences The effect is bathetic: 'Psst] I can exclusively reveal that Mao was not only a mass murderer; he was an adulterer too]' All those leaking the dirt on Mao to Salisbury, even those who, like Deng himself, suffered humiliation, prison and worse at Mao's hands, were part of the machinery which put Mao at the helm of China and kept him there. Today they still pay lip service to him and his doctrines, denouncing as sacrilegious those Tienanmen demonstrators who defaced his portrait which still dominates the great square. They are the men who run post-Tienanmen China today in the forlorn Maoist hope that China can import the West's technology, capital and business methods while embargoing its ideas. As often happens in journalism, privileged access leads to copy which could have been dictated by interested parties. One can only assume that, like many 'friends of China' before him, Salisbury wanted to maintain his access; if so, his hands too bear traces of tar. He can comfort himself with the thought that he has provided much of the material which someone will turn into a better book.</p>

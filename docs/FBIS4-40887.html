			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mykhaylo Soroka: "Approach to Europe"] </F>   [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk spent only six  hours in Luxembourg on 14 June. There is no doubt, however,  that this visit will become a hallmark in the history of the  young Ukrainian state. Having signed the agreement on Ukraine's  partnership and cooperation with the European Union [EU], Leonid  Kravchuk, speaking figuratively, opened for our state the door  to Europe. The meaning of this step will be fully assessed in  the future. Meanwhile, we want to emphasize that Ukraine was  the first of the former USSR republics to make this step.    Both in Ukraine and near abroad, certain people view the  "Luxembourg breakthrough" as definite orientation by Ukraine  toward the West. However, is this actually so? Speaking at a  news conference at Seningen Palace, which served as the  Ukrainian president's official residence, Leonid Kravchuk  underlined that we have equal interest in good-neighborly  relations and mutually advantageous relations with all nations  -- East, West, North, or South. Shortly after those statements,  speaking at Boryspil airport, the president placed special  emphasis on the development and consolidation of Ukrainian  relations with Russia. Thus, our state is by no means going to  curb these. On the contrary: It is in Ukraine's vital interest  (probably just as in our eastern neighbor's interest) that our  relations consolidate and are of a stable and mutually  advantageous nature.    However, would it do any harm to our state if it finds new  promising directions for cooperation, including in a westerly  direction? I think that the answer to this question is evident.  Yet, once we asked it, let us cite the opinions of renowned  experts to find out how Ukraine is going to benefit from  cooperation with the EU and what possibilities are opened by the  Luxembourg agreement.    This is how the URYADOVYY KURYER question was answered.    European Commission Chairman Jacques Delors: "This is a very  important agreement for Ukraine. It will help Ukraine  consolidate its sovereignty and carry out a gradual, and what is  more, soft transition to an efficient economy in the interests  of its people.    "I would like to especially single out this point for your  readers: Ukraine is the first of the former USSR states to sign  an agreement with the EU. Before the signing, we held detailed  discussions with the Ukrainian president about the acute  problems facing your state, and how to expeditiously make the  agreement work to help Ukraine resolve these problems. I want  to add that both I and other European Commission members will  everything in our power to achieve this goal."    Borys Oliynyk, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council  Commission for Foreign Affairs and CIS Relations: "I believe  that Tuesday 14 June is indeed a significant day, and not only  for Ukraine, but for all of Europe as well, because we are  returning to Europe. Or rather, not returning but turning our  face toward it, because we often turned our back on it. This is  not an ordinary everyday event. It is opening new prospects for  us. I am not going to sink in euphoria. Today, the Ukrainian  president pointed out that we have secured a base. This is  correct, but we now have to `grow roots' in this base. The  return to Europe does not mean that we are turning away from our  other neighbors. No matter where our partners are  geographically located, we have to turn our face to them. This  would be honest policy."    Oleh Slepichev, Ukrainian minister of external economic  relations: "The very name of the agreement explains its meaning  -- it deals with both cooperation and partnership. Take trade  and economic relations for instance. Ukraine needs markets,  including European markets. However until now, the European  market was for all intents and purposes closed to us. First, it  is being protected with quotas, and second, with the so-called  antidumping legislation. The agreement gives us the chance to  overcome this barrier and enter the European market. This will  help shore up our production and improve the quality of exported  goods. On the other hand, the signing of the agreement amounts  to Ukraine's breakthrough to GATT. Support from GATT members is  very important to us, and the EU is among the most influential  members of this organization. Besides, it is vital for Ukraine  that it is recognized as a state undergoing a transition from  centrally managed economy to a market. This would give us the  chance to enjoy GATT privileges for a certain period of time,  regarding the selling of our products on foreign markets. In  other words, the Luxembourg agreement is our great political  victory."    Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko: "The  agreement lays the political-legislative groundwork for  Ukraine's relations with EU states, which would be equal to,  civilized, and advantageous for us. Work on drafting this  document was very strenuous and lasted for almost a year. There  was a series of talks and expert conferences in both Kiev and  Brussels. The negotiation process was significantly accelerated  after the issue of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons was  resolved. What is the essence of the 14 June agreement? This  is quite a voluminous document comprising 100 articles and a  number of provisos. The introduction to this document  emphasizes that EU states recognize Ukraine's independence and  support its sovereignty and territorial integrity. A  significant portion of the agreement deals with the issues of  Ukraine's trade and economic relations with the EU, including,  in particular, the issue of a transitional period in trade  between them. This period is to last until 31 December 1998,  after which Ukraine's admission to the free trade zone could be  discussed.    Thus, the agreement opens broad prospects for Ukraine's  existence on the European continent. The decisive word is to be  had by the Ukrainian legislature, which has to ratify the  agreement."    This is what our and foreign senior officials think about  the  agreement. As we see it, despite all the nuances, the general  conclusion made by them is: Integration with the EU is not only  advantageous for Ukraine -- it is imperative. Even more so  since sooner or later all European states will approach and join  the EU. Europe does not have any other option. Russia is closer  than anybody else to following Ukraine's example. This may  happen in near future.    Yet, our state was the first to make this step. How can one  explain why it was Ukraine that was given this chance? I have  asked Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to answer this  question.    President Kravchuk: "Two factors must have had their effect  on this matter. The first is the political, international  factor. This is a confirmation of the role Ukraine is currently  playing. I think and hope that European and world nations have  seen the persistence of our domestic and foreign policies even  in such extremely complicated situations as the resolution of  the problem of nuclear arms, relations with our neighbors, the  Crimean issue, or the division of the Black Sea Fleet.  Everybody sees that Ukraine is acting in accordance with the  law, the Constitution, abiding by the principles proclaimed by  the United Nations, its Security Council, and the CSCE. This  cannot pass unnoticed. Thus, by signing the agreement, not only  respect toward Ukraine was demonstrated, but also our state's  actual role in the European process marked.    There is also the other, so to say, technical side -- our  departments, including the Foreign Ministry, worked more  efficiently [than foreign ones] to achieve this goal."    Europe, in which world wars have flared twice in this  century, for the last 50 years has been building relations on  norms that are civilized, peaceful, and generally acceptable for  all the states. The EU, which comprises the Western states of  our continent, has become an influential force in this process.  The mission of the young Ukrainian state, which is establishing  its position in the world and, primarily, in the European  homeland, is to find the shortest way of rapprochement with the  EU. From this perspective, Leonid Kravchuk's 14 June visit to  Luxembourg and the documents signed there should be viewed as an  event of European scale and historic significance.</p>

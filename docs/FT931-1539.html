			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Yugoslav peace talks in peril as Karadzic leaves The Yugoslav peace talks in New York appeared in doubt last night as Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, withdrew and prepared to fly home. Lord Owen, one of the two international mediators, said Mr Karadzic refused to sign the proposed map dividing Bosnia. The UN Security Council again put off voting on a plan to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia. The delay was caused by Russian efforts to restrain the proposed action, mainly aimed against the Serbs. A UN airlift to evacuate wounded Moslems from the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica was due to begin early today, carried out by British and French helicopters. The commander of UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, said he had reached agreement with Moslems to evacuate Serb families from the Moslem city of Tuzla. Meanwhile, Austria, host to 60,000 refugees from Bosnia, said it would no longer accept asylum-seekers from the region.</p>

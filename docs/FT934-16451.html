			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Change of strategy at Murray Enterprise MURRAY Enterprise, the investment trust, is switching its investment strategy from European unlisted securities to UK listed smaller companies. It was also announced that Murray Johnstone had liquidated the holdings in Murray Enterprise of its other managed trusts, Murray International, Murray Smaller Markets and Murray Ventures. The shares rose 25p to 233p, reducing the discount on its net asset value which was put at 246.7p on October 4. An analyst said that as a result of the liquidation of the stake the shares were not trading at such a large discount and this was pushing the shares higher. Murray Enterprise forecast that it would pay a dividend for the year to September 30 1994 of not less 4p, against 1.31p last time. In addition it is planning a bonus issue of warrants for early next year. Proposals should be ready to be put to the annual meeting. The trusts sold their total holdings of 25.82 per cent of the ordinary shares and 44.8 per cent of the zero-coupon convertible unsecured loan stock 1994 at 222p. They were placed with institutional investors. Murray Enterprise's existing portfolio will be liquidated when investments conditions permit, the proceeds being invested in accordance with the new policy. Enterprise's main investments are in Fleet Call and Envoy Corporation as well as holdings in Bowater and BAA.</p>

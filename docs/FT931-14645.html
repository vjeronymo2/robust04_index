			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Marlene, the mistress of divine scorn - Nigel Andrews considers Dietrich and the true condition of stardom MARLENE DIETRICH by Maria Riva Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 792 pages MARLENE DIETRICH by Steven Bach M HarperCollins Pounds 18, 610 pages THE DAUGHTERS are massing on the skyline. The come-lately biographers are gathering on the tree-branches. And the publishing industry is racing about the land signing up memories. Death in show business is a grim spectacle. No sooner has a deceased legend completed his or her lying-in than the body is taken out to the vultures. Is there anything new to be said about Dietrich? Oh, yes. Lots and lots, according to these two books. There she is, the goddess with the smoky voice and hooded eyes, peering out from the two interchangeable black bookjackets with an interchangeable Mona Lisa smile, daring portraitists to penetrate that enigma called a face. Maria Riva, Dietrich's daughter, offers a family perspective on the legend. What was it like sharing a house with Mum, Dad, Josef Von Sternberg, Mercedes De Acosta (lesbian lover), Erich Maria Remarque, a dog, a maid and anyone else who happened to be passing by with suggestions as to make-up, love life or career direction. Steven Bach, a former United Artists executive and author of the Heaven's Gate hatchet job, Final Cut, goes for the movie angle. Onward we trawl through Morocco, Shanghai Express and Touch of Evil, seeking the constant Dietrich in the changing movie character. But of course the movie character never did change. Dietrich was as immovable as a Caryatid through her seven great Von Sternberg films. (Not all were great individually, but taken whole the septet was a mythopoeic masterpiece). She did let the odd hair down in Destry Rides Again - fourth hair from the left, if I recall - and she let a whole wig down as the cockney-impersonating murderess in Witness for the Prosecution. But it was the same Dietrich, whether hieratic or histrionic. She made film acting seem easy because she never did any. Yet she obsesses the entire world. In neither book do we quite find why, though Bach's 600 well-researched pages are written with wit and vivacity. He tunes in to Dietrich's camp charm and the absurdist cul-de-sacs of her (best) movie plots. Of The Scarlet Empress: 'There is a war going on. Finland? Doesn't matter. Back to the real battlefield - the bedroom.' And he responds to Sternberg the stylist's dazzling line in petrified exoticism. I laughed out loud when I read that Clive Brook came to Shanghai Express having just had a face-lift. As if a movie needed two main characters with paralysed face-muscles. Bach enjoys the backstage secrets of the movie business. Dietrich's 'tape lifts' (hitching her facial skin up to bestow instant youth); Charles Boyer's sandblown, accident-prone wig in The Garden of Allah; Sternberg's command that all the actors speak in the click-clack rhythm of trains in Shanghai Express. But he never, we feel, quites knits the minutiae to the macro-picture. Dietrich became a star by bowing to all these imperatives. But she bowed in a spirit not of obsequiousness but of lordly, luminous passivity. There was a divine scorn in her obedience: a scorn that came out later in Maximilian Schell's spellbinding documentary Marlene (Bach has a good passage on its making). When Schell recorded the cranky star in Paris at age 82, she kept calling everything she ever did in movies 'quatsch', German slang for tripe. But the disdain she poured on her own legend was, of course, the disdain that made that legend. If Bach does not join all the dots, Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva scarcely joins any. Her book's most inspired episode - Bach would have made a meal of it - is thrown away. It depicts Dietrich on a farm, helping to deliver a calf while dressed in a peach-satin dressing gown and using for lubricant Elizabeth Arden's Blue Grass Facial Oil. This beats even the high heels kicked into the sand at the end of Morocco or the pre-firing-squad lipstick in Dishonoured. Riva does not seem to possess a sense of humour. Elsewhere her book is at once frank and elusive. Flying into the star's orbit like moths around the flame are such exotics as Ernest Hemingway, Fritz Lang, Maurice Chevalier and Mercedes Da Acosta (or, as Clifton Webb dubs her in a quoted letter, Countess Dracula da Acosta). This gaunt vampira (see picture page 147) was Greta Garbo's cast-off Sapphic friend and may or not have become Dietrich's. But then may-or-may-nots abound. While Riva regales us with some melodramatic certainties from her own life, including teenage rape by a quasi-protectress foisted on her by Mum, the portrait of Dietrich becomes fogged by the ever more prolix confusion of perhaps-lovers, floating friends and quoted-at-length correspondents. Whenever Riva sharpens focus, it is to be unflattering: from the 49 tormenting takes it took the new German star to enunciate her virtual first word in a Hollywood movie - 'Help' - to the final Sunset Boulevard-ish melodrama of Dietrich's dying days. 'Her once translucent skin is parchment. She exudes an odour of booze and human decay . . . Her snores are ragged, spittle trails from her furrowed lips. Like a foetus she lies, bony hands cradling a sunken cheek . . .' With daughters like this who needs demonographers? Domestic intimacy being what it is, we learn facts about Dietrich from Riva that we could learn from no-one else. But often they are spiteful, partial facts, conjured not for improved portraiture, one suspects, but for personal exorcism. Bach's book, a more traditional fan-heated tour through the career, gets us closer to Dietrich the diva and to the strength of her lofty, luminous indifference. If 'being' not 'doing' is the true condition of stardom, Dietrich 'was' more radiantly and effortlessly than anyone else in movie history.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology: World explorers on software trail - Software at Work / A system that sets travellers and tour operators in the right direction People usually have clear ideas about what they want from a holiday. Sun, sea and sand are still on the list, but an increasing number of travellers wish to set their own agenda. The standard package does not cater for them, but straying from the beaten track is encouraged by Rainbow Holidays of York. Rainbow specialises in tailored itineraries for individuals who are making the trip of a lifetime - a retirement trip, for example, or a family reunion in a remote area of Australia. Every item on the trip, down to the car transfer from the airport, appears on Rainbow's TourCat computerised system. Beside the items, vital information appears for the tour operator: the profit margin and how it is divided between operator and travel agent. The system is used to quote on complex trips with multiple components, and enables the UK company to explore a variety of options. If a client needs to keep costs down, Rainbow can look for substitutes: a bus connection from the airport, a cheaper room or a cheaper hotel altogether. If the customer changes his or her mind, the system provides instant re-quotes, including airline bookings via a central reservation system such as British Airways' Galileo. This 'modelling' of the ideal trip results in a printed itinerary for the client showing the breakdown into individual components, sometimes running to several pages. 'The printed itinerary really makes the dream trip come alive,' says chairman David Miller. 'When people see all those wonderful place names appear in print, along with actual times of arrival and departure, and details like the car pick-up, people's aspirations suddenly become real. That's when they begin to get excited.' The same computer system has helped Rainbow to target closely three different markets and to track its success with individual products and agents. An unexpected benefit has been its use in competitive situations: Rainbow is able to shave margins in a head-on bid or offer instant alternatives. For instance, Rainbow has won business because its detailed itinerary made clear that a rival company's lower price did not include all the items - such as the ferry fare for a campervan between New Zealand's two islands. The travel and leisure business has proved precarious during the recession. But with the information available on the computer system, Rainbow's staff is particularly attuned to profit margins and the group now has a turnover exceeding Pounds 23m. Survival in the travel trade, Miller believes, depends on responding to changes in the market with the right products. An entrepreneur with interests in other business areas, he has built the company up by reacting quickly to market trends. Miller founded Greenfield Holdings (of which Rainbow is a part) as a hotel company in 1977 after 17 years in hotel management. Rainbow was founded in 1981 to offer short breaks in the UK. As well as filling empty beds in its own three Croft hotels in Dundee, Birmingham, and Edinburgh, the company took other hotels on to its books and started a booming business in weekend breaks. The UK Short Breaks brochure offers 400 hotels in more than 200 locations. Rainbow's long-haul business started in 1989 and quickly expanded from covering Australia and New Zealand to include more unusual destinations. In 1991, the short breaks formula was extended to Europe, and Rainbow acquired the European Travel House to build up inbound European business. This is high-volume, low-income trade, along the lines of package holidays. The long-haul niche market has grown as other more conventional holidays have struggled to maintain market share. The tailor-made holidays, known as 'itinerary build' in the trade, now account for 57 per cent of Rainbow's turnover. 'The long-haul business is the most volatile in terms of margin because each component can affect gross profit margins. But we also have to be market-driven and respond to the competition,' says Miller. The recession flattened turnover to the degree that Miller had to look closely at Rainbow's costs. The company had become computerised with its first reservation system in 1984, but the various departments had incompatible systems that had limited new product development and cost large amounts in maintenance. The aim was to standardise with a single computer system able to deal with all three areas of business, including specialised itineraries. It had to provide good communications, instant links and booking capabilities with airline CRSs, a range of specialised reports, and confirmations and ticketing. None of the standard travel systems met all Rainbow's criteria. Rainbow knew the TravelCat software developed by C-Cat of Hull, and when C-Cat approached with the idea of TourCat, Rainbow invested Pounds 1.5m in a joint development. 'We needed the ability to react to the market and its changing products very quickly, and we couldn't wait for the technology to catch up,' explains Miller. C-Cat now sells TourCat as a 'turn-key' package of hardware and software: a system of 60 terminals such as Rainbow's costs around Pounds 150,000. For Margaret Simpson, operations director in charge of the system, the main challenge was to make everyone feel that the system could cope with their specialisation. A lot of time was spent analysing industry needs and any resistance to change was dealt with by showing staff TourCat's potential. 'One of the main problem areas in the old system was building the Sunday evening discount into the hotel costs,' she says. 'Once people realised they could throw away their calculators and paper, they couldn't wait.' Sharon Hutchinson, reservations manager for short breaks, agrees: 'No more mistakes on discounts, and it is excellent for checking availability and offering alternatives.' Long-haul reservations manager Simon Bean uses TourCat as a management reporting tool as well as for quotations and availability searches. 'I use it to compile statistics on the reservations clerks, so that I can see their conversion rate, spot gaps in their product knowledge, and provide appropriate training.' Rainbow's inbound tour business depends on good marketing relationships with customers such as Air Malta, and Cathay Pacific and Creative in Sydney. These customers want direct online access, and they get it. The system links to terminals in 7,200 retail travel agents. Communications are an important part of the software package. 'The future is all based around communications,' says Miller. 'The way a company our size competes with First Choice (recently renamed Owners Abroad) or Thomson is by being better in our niche, more focused on specific client bases. And the information we are getting from the system is stunning.' He cites a controlled experiment on two batches of 200 travel agents, where one simple targeting tactic brought about a 51 per cent improvement in conversion rates in one group. It also resulted in fewer brochures, and a saving on the print bill of Pounds 128,000. 'We thought our gut feel was terribly good until we began to get real information out of TourCat,' admits Miller. The TourCat system has earned its keep since its installation in June 1993. 'We printed 2.5m Short Break brochures for 1994. In the past we have not been sure of the conversion rate for any specific agent, but TourCat can run a report in four minutes that tells us about the grading of our various agents. We buy 1,250 tonnes of paper annually, and with paper prices rising, that is a significant saving. 'The system gives full leash to the creativity of the staff here, it makes them more successful in what we call directional selling. It is the confidence the agents have in us that matters and that is where the system makes us better,' concludes Miller.</p>

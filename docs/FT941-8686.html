			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iceland's changing economy Sir, In the article 'Iceland's trade policy 'to blame for downturn' ' (February 11), Frances Williams introduced a report by two General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade economists on the Icelandic economy. The Icelandic economy is not an everyday issue in the international media. Therefore, I feel it is important that when it is examined the evaluation gives an accurate picture of our situation. The article focuses on that part of the Gatt report which deals with the past and gives a fairly thorough estimate of what we could have done better. This is all very well but it does not reflect the present state of affairs in Iceland. Allow me to dwell on that for a moment. Despite stagnation since 1988, the Icelandic economy has undergone significant structural changes, not least in agriculture and the fisheries. The capital markets have been liberalised, the tax system has been completely reformed and the public sector has been down-sized. At the same time marked improvements can be noted in the economic field; inflation has been brought down from double-digit figures to 1-2 per cent; the current account is in balance and the fiscal deficit is well below the OECD average. These facts are at least an indication of the present state of the Icelandic economy. I would be the first to acknowledge that there are many things still to be done but there are also a great many issues that have been successfully addressed.

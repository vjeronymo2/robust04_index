			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur static at Pounds 2.01m EXCALIBUR GROUP, the jewellery manufacturer, music merchandiser and engineer, yesterday played down its reliance on retail jewellery when reporting flat interim profits. The group said it agreed with last week's estimate by the Ratners Group that sales were down about 15 per cent over the Christmas period, but said only about a fifth of its annual jewellery sales of Pounds 20m went to the troubled retail chain, Britain's biggest. Excalibur's pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.01m, compared with Pounds 2.05m, although sales for the six months to October 31 rose from Pounds 30.9m to Pounds 33.4m. The group said difficulties in the jewellery market were offset by solid performances in giftware and merchandising. In precision engineering, the aerospace business performed well in difficult circumstances, with customers putting pressure on margins. The order book was satisfactory, and the group was optimistic that the worst of the recession had passed for this division. In industrial products, the group had decided to withdraw from the low-margin transmission business undertaken by its Clarke and Hi-Ton operations. Costs of Pounds 993,00 associated with this closure were taken as an extraordinary item. Gearing at the half-year was 69 per cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1m. Because of an increased number of shares in issue following a Pounds 8.5m rights issue, earnings per share fell from 3.4p to 2.4p. The interim dividend is held at 0.4p.</p>

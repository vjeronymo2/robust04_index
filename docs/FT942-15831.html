			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: UAP head outlines profits goal Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group which is poised for privatisation, hopes to increase net profits by around 30 per cent in each of the next three years, according to Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman. Mr Friedmann said yesterday UAP intended to at least equal its 1993 performance - when net profits rose by 32 per cent to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 243m) from FFr1.08bn in 1992 - in the mid-1990s. However, he made his forecast just before Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, announced it was downgrading UAP's rating to A1 from A1 plus. S&amp;P, which has also downgraded the ratings of Axa and Assurances Generales de France, said it was concerned about the deterioration in operating profits at the large French insurers, and about uncertain recovery prospects. The French insurers have for the past two years been under pressure due to competitive market conditions and heavy provisions on property interests. UAP has also been burdened by the problems of the loss-making Banque Worms. Mr Friedmann said he planned to inject an additional FFr1bn into the bank, and hoped it would return to profit in 1996. In spite of these difficulties, the government is pressing ahead with the sale of its 50 per cent stake in UAP, valued at more than FFr25bn.</p>

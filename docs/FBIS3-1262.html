			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Since yesterday there have been rumors of an  attempted coup d'etat and the news has even been reported by a  number of international radios. Cyriaque Simbizi, minister of  information and government spokesman, has denied the rumor which  is creating tension in our country. He added that whoever is  charged spreading this rumor will be severely punished.    [Begin Simbizi recording] On behalf of the government, I  would like to tell Burundi and the world that there has been no  coup d'etat in recent days. These are rumors which we heard  mainly here in Bujumbura. As I announced even yesterday, these  are rumors circulating here in the town of Bujumbura. We were  surprised to hear foreign radios adamantly asserting that there  has been a coup d'etat. Foreign radios -- about two of them --  reported that nobody knew the whereabouts of the head of state  and that ministers had fled the country. I can state that all  these are lies. I would like journalists to explain to the  citizens and the international community listening to us that  this is a baseless lie. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

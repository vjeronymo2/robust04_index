			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Continental Airlines secures investment deal CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, was last night poised to emerge from bankruptcy court protection, after finalising an investment agreement with Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texan investment group. It is two and a half years since Houston-based Continental sought Chapter 11 protection from its creditors. Continental also went in and out of bankruptcy during the 1980s. In Delaware, the company's lawyers were reported to be the putting finishing touches to the investment deal, which would give Air Canada and Air Partners a 55 per cent stake in Continental. The carrier announced that it would hold a press conference this morning, to herald its emergence from protection. The company's reorganisation plan has been approved by creditors and the bankruptcy court judge. The larger US carriers have complained about unfair competition from bankrupt airlines, who get relief from debt payments and some other operating advantages. Continental's emergence would leave America West and TWA operating under Chapter 11 protection.</p>

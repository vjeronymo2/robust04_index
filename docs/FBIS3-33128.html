Mungra in Paramaribo; date not given: "`The Recovery of  the Surinamese Economy Should Limit Exodus'"]    [Text] Paramaribo -- In Suriname they are already saying  jokingly: Will the last person to leave please switch off the  lights. Will that person be President Venetiaan? Or the former  Army Leader Bouterse perhaps?    It is estimated that last year another 10,000 Surinamese did  not come back from a "holiday" in the Netherlands, like the year  before. There seems to be no end to emigration. Many Surinamese  are asking themselves in despair how long this can go on. The  reasons why the Surinamese people decide to seek refuge abroad  in massive numbers have varied: In 1975 it was uncertainty  about independence, then it was the military government, and now  it is the economic collapse.    Foreign Minister Dr. S. Ch. Mungra also has concerns about  emigration. Not that Suriname will empty suddenly -- in 1992  the General Statistical Office estimated that there were still  420,000 inhabitants. It is above all the departure of the top  management which causes him real concern.    "We are in the middle of an economic adjustment program," he  said. "That means that purchasing power must be lost. That is  a sacrifice. But many people do not want to wait for recovery.  Our problem is that we want to consume like a western  industrialized country but we produce like a Third World  country. Unfortunately, we, the Surinamese, regardless of who  is to blame, have been destroying our economy for the last 10  years. Just think about the war here, which led to a drastic  drop in exports."    The minister said that the distressing position of education  also played a role. In addition to the problems with school  transport and the regular strikes, lessons sometimes stop for  weeks because a teacher has not returned from his holidays  overseas. "That makes people leave too," he said. "They hope  to be able to give their children a better education abroad."    The Netherlands is not open to immigration, according to a  cabinet decision, and therefore The Hague is sticking by the  visa requirement. In contrast, the Paramaribo has been calling  for the free movement of people for years.    "Many Surinamese reason as follows: Once I have that visa, I  will stay in the Netherlands," Mungra said. "But if you are  free to travel, then the urge to stay is far less, because  people know that they can always return to the Netherlands. And  in my view the Netherlands can build in enough guarantees so  that people do not stay unnecessarily."    Abolishing the visa requirement is not a point of discussion  between the two countries: Their positions are diametrically  opposed. "But I still think that special family links justify  the free movement of people," he said.  <H5>  Wage differences </H5>   Despite all the optimism about the start of the Venetiaan  Government, very few immigrants return with a bonus to Suriname.  "The difference in salaries is too big," Mungra said. "We can  never pay them what they earned in the Netherlands. Here a  minister earns U.S. $150 , when the salary is converted. That  is less than a cleaner receives in the Foreign Ministry in The  Hague."    Figures from the Migration Institute in Paramaribo show  that the number of people using the scheme annually has varied  between 55 and 155 for years. Around half of them are on social  security or receive a pension and therefore make no active  contribution to constructing the country. It is also estimated  that round 50 percent of the returning immigrants are back in  the Netherlands after two years.    The minister wants to make a priority of giving upper  management a salary bonus in hard Netherlands guilders. The  money for this was to come from the development cooperation  funding. "We want very much to prevent more management from  leaving and encourage well-educated countrymen in the  Netherlands to return," he said. "After all, it is they who  sustain development. I do not expect any jealous faces in the  Army and middle management: We have other support measures for  them in prospect."    People were inclined solely to material welfare, Mungra  said.  "But welfare is not well-being," he added. "In the Netherlands  everyone lives on top of one another, you have 1,001 rules and  you have to work a whole year for 21 days under the Spanish sun.  Here it is easy-going, there is space, a clean environment and  there is fine weather every day."  <H5>  Hopeless </H5>   Although the crisis seems to appear more hopeless every day,  the minister is strikingly optimistic about the chances of the  tide turning. "First of all, we are busy with restoring and --  even more so -- maintaining the rule of law and democracy," he  said. "Because of course those are also important for citizens.  I cannot see any new dictatorial movements forming here.    ``Also I am hopeful that the development relationship with  the Netherlands can be restored in the second half of this  year,'' he said. "Then the industry fund can start up so that  production gets going. That will cause an uplift in the  economy. That would be an important psychological factor.    ``So far we have not been able to impose the price increases  because the economic measures were not implemented  simultaneously,'' he said. "You cannot make cutbacks first and  only afterwards do something for the productive sector. But we  can already see that a large number of investments are getting  off the ground: The bauxite sector, the gold and wood sectors,  and the oil refinery, which is to be ready in 1996. Also this  year we will join Caricom, the Caribbean Community, with a  market of 250 million people. You certainly cannot say that  Suriname has done nothing to make its economy healthy."    Nevertheless the Netherlands, the Antilles, the United  States, and neighboring French Guiana remain irresistibly  attractive. Many people have plans to emigrate. But do  Surinamese in the Netherlands get what they thought they would  find? [passage omitted]</p>

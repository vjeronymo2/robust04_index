			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory General Funding Preference Provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 791(a) and 860(e)(1) of the Act, with respect to the above listed grant programs, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> When program applications are peer reviewed, preference will be given only for applications ranked above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the appropriate peer review group. In several formula grant programs affected by this preference, the applications are not required to be submitted to a peer review group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Definition of ``Graduate''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 791(c) and 860(e)(3), ``graduate'' is defined as an individual who has successfully completed all training (and residency requirements) necessary for full certification in the health profession selected by the individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Methodology for Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed notice, the public was invited to comment on the proposed changes in the definitions of ``high rate,'' ``significant increase in the rate,'' and ``medically underserved communities'' and on the implementation specifics for new programs and small programs. HRSA received 2 comments prior to the end of the comment period. Comments regarding each of the proposed areas will be discussed. Comments on implementation aspects that were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Definitions of ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed definition of ``high rate'' is a minimum percent of graduates in academic year 1991&hyph;92 or academic year 1992&hyph;93, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. The minimum percent for ``high rate'' for each program was to be identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement for that program and in the program materials. The following statements are proposed amplifications of the basic ``high rate'' definition. For undergraduate medical education programs academic years 1988&hyph;89 and 1989&hyph;90 were proposed. Preventive medicine, public health, dental public health, and public health nurse graduates were proposed to be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience were to be counted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' is that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. The minimum percent for ``significant increase in the rate'' for each program was to be identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement for that program and in the program materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment received from a professional association suggested that the percentage rates published for grant programs which benefitted their constituency should be lower. We believe that the percentage rates are appropriate. The rates for FY 1994 are similar to the rates used in FY 1993. In FY 1993, only 40% of grant applicants for programs affected by this preference did not apply for the preference. Of those applicants who did apply, 90% met the criteria and did receive preference in funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Implementation Specifics for New Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To allow new programs to compete equitably in FY 1994, criteria for the general funding preference were proposed which applied only to new programs. It was proposed that a new program be defined as any program which has graduated less than three classes. After a program has graduated three classes, that program will be able to provide the information necessary for the general funding preference as defined in the law and will no longer be considered a new program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was proposed that a new program would qualify for the general funding preference if four or more of the following criteria were met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The mission statement of the program identifies a specific purpose of preparing health professionals to serve underserved populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The curriculum includes content which will help to prepare practitioners to serve underserved populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Substantial clinical training experience is required in medically underserved communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A minimum of 20 percent of the faculty spend at least 50 percent of their time providing/supervising care in medically underserved communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The entire program or a substantial portion of the program is physically located in a medically underserved community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Student assistance, which is linked to service in medically underserved communities following graduation, is available to the students in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The program provides a placement mechanism for deploying graduates to medically underserved communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent suggested that (1) ``substantial clinical training experience'' in criteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3 should be defined; (2) the word ``faculty'' in criteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4 is unclear; (3) criteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5 should be deleted because ``the physical location of a program does not determine the practice type;'' and (4) criteria  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6 should be deleted because student assistance does not apply to grants for residency programs. Since this preference applies to a wide variety of programs, a single definition of ``substantial clinical training experience'' or ``faculty'' could not be applied generally. Individual grant programs may develop specific definitions if this becomes necessary. Such definitions would be included in program application materials. We believe that programs located in medically underserved communities will provide an opportunity for students to develop skills needed to provide care to underserved populations. We do not plan to delete criterion  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Since student assistance is relevant to many of the programs which are subject to the general preference, we do not plan to delete criterion  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. New residency programs can qualify for the preference based on any combination of four other criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it was proposed that new programs could also qualify for the general funding preference by providing assurance that a minimum percent of their prospective graduates have signed commitments to practice in medically underserved communities after graduation contingent upon receiving some type of student assistance. This minimum percent was to be equal to the minimum percentage for ``high rate.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

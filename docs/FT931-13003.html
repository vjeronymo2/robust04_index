			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UN inspectors step up search for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction TEAMS of UN inspectors yesterday stepped up their search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction yesterday without any hindrance from local officials in Baghdad. Iraq's co-operation with the UN will be watched closely as evidence of its commitment to the unilateral ceasefire it announced last week to mark the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. Prof Maurizio Zifferero, who heads the nuclear inspection team, said that he hoped Iraq would provide the remaining names of foreign suppliers. 'The Iraqis say they have already given us 90 per cent,' he said. 'They have said they will answer questions about the other 10 per cent. We shall have to see whether this is true or not.' The ballistics missile team also resumed its weapons search concentrating on Scuds of the type fired at Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Gulf war. Iraq has adopted a conciliatory line towards the new US administration, and newspapers in Baghdad yesterday noted that cracks had appeared in the US-led coalition over recent air attacks. One paper said that Iraq's initiative would encourage Mr Clinton to enter a dialogue with Iraq, and stressed the differences between him and former President George Bush. Meanwhile, Iraqi air defence officers produced maps, missile fragments and videotape to bolster their case that a Tomahawk missile had been fired deliberately at the Rashid hotel in Baghdad on January 17. They said that a flash of light, captured on film by a western television crew, lit up the hotel just before the missile struck. They said the flash was part of the missile's guidance system and proved that it was on target. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, said yesterday that his country sought no confrontation with the US but was not happy with the stance of the new US administration, Reuter reports from Baghdad. 'We do not want to be in continuous confrontation with the United States of America,' he said in an interview with Cable News Network (CNN) television. But he accused President Clinton's new defence secretary, Mr Les Aspin, of 'an arrogant and belligerent response' to the Iraqi initiative of offering a unilateral ceasefire.</p>

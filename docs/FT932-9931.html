			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Waigel pressed to take over as Bavaria premier TURMOIL within the German political establishment looks set to cause a new upheaval in the government, with growing pressure on Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and close ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to quit and take over as state premier in his home base of Bavaria. Reports yesterday said that Mr Waigel, a symbol of stability and key figure in the ruling coalition, is set to return to Munich and replace Mr Max Streibl, his protege within the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, as prime minister. The move could aggravate the current climate of uncertainty surrounding the German government, by bringing an unfamiliar politician to the finance ministry at a critical moment in the struggle to bring government spending under control in the wake of German unification. The leading contender for that job is said to be Mr Rudolf Seiters, currently the interior minister in Bonn and former head of the chancellor's office. However, Mr Seiters lacks any background in finance or economics. At the same time Mr Waigel's move would be intended to bolster the position of the CSU in Bavaria, where his party faces a growing challenge from the far-right wing Republicans in next year's state, national and European elections. Mr Streibl is under enormous pressure to quit as Bavarian premier, because of reports that he accepted free holidays from a business friend. The whole reshuffle, confidently forecast yesterday by the conservative newspaper Die Welt, depends on the outcome of a struggle for power within the CSU, sister-party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the ruling coalition. If Mr Waigel, the party leader, comes out on top, he will go home to replace Mr Streibl, whose resignation is now taken for granted. If he loses, he will stay in Bonn as finance minister. His great rival for the state premier's job is Mr Edmund Stoiber, currently interior minister in Bavaria, widely regarded as the strong man of the party, and a close associate of the late Bavarian leader, Mr Franz-Josef Strauss. Insiders say he does not want to go to Bonn, where he would be offered the job of federal government interior minister, but wants to become state premier himself. In Bonn Mr Stoiber could be a positive asset to the federal government in the promised position of interior minister. He is seen as a stern, conservative advocate of law and order, likely to be a big issue in the 1994 elections. On the other hand, Mr Kohl might prefer such a forceful character to take over in Bavaria, leaving him the beetle-browed and good-humoured Mr Waigel to soak up the unpopularity of being a penny-pinching finance minister.</p>

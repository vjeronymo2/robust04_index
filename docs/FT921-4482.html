			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Metro-Cammell to supply HK mass transit trains GEC Alsthom's Metro-Cammell subsidiary yesterday announced an order to supply eight eight-car electric multiple unit trains to Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). No terms were disclosed for the contract, which totals 48 motor-vehicles and 16 trailers, and includes an option for up to three extra eight-car trains. The rolling stock will be assembled in Hong Kong by Metro-Cammell for delivery between March 1994 and August 1995. GEC Alsthom said the trains would enable the MTRC to cope with forecast growth in passenger traffic at a time when an increasing number of vehicles will be undergoing half-life maintenance. The trains will be interchangeable with the existing fleet and include new energy-saving electronic motor-control equipment. This is being fitted to the present fleet by Metro-Cammell.</p>

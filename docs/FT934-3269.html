			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Allders meets flotation forecast Allders, the department store and tax and duty-free retailer, has fulfilled the forecasts made in its flotation prospectus. The group, which went public last month, made a pro-forma pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.3m in the year to September 30, compared to its forecast of Pounds 13.2m. The shares closed yesterday at 191p, down 1p on the day but ahead of the 170p flotation price. Lord Prior, chairman, said consumer confidence was still fragile. However, he was confident the current year would see the benefit of new stores opened in 1992 and 1993, and new tax and duty free outlets. He said 'with our financial position now established, we are well placed to secure future growth'. Allders learnt last Friday that the Canadian government was cancelling the redevelopment and privatisation of Toronto airport, which would have given Allders the right to operate shops in terminals 1 and 2. Allders is hoping for compensation for the preparation work it has done. Actual pre-tax profit was Pounds 6.36m (loss Pounds 3.44m), after an interest charge of Pounds 8.85m (Pounds 10.6m), which would have been Pounds 7m lower had the group had the Pounds 75m cash raised through the flotation at the start of the year. The group had been heavily borrowed because of its management buy-out in 1989. Group sales rose 16.4 per cent to Pounds 685.5m and operating profits were Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 15.2m), including associates of Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 2.24m) and before exceptional costs of Pounds 7.99m (Pounds 8.08m) which related to rent on an unused property. Pro-forma fully diluted earnings per share were 13.9p, against an estimate of 13.7p. The group said at the time of the float that it would not pay a dividend in respect of 1992-93, but if it had been quoted throughout the year would have paid a total of 6.1p. Department store sales were up 10.6 per cent to Pounds 286.6m, with the increase due to new stores. Operating profits in this division rose 21 per cent to Pounds 12m, but this included a Pounds 1.2m benefit from a 53rd trading week. The duty free shopping division increased sales 21 per cent to Pounds 398.9m. Operating profits nearly doubled to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 6.7m).</p>

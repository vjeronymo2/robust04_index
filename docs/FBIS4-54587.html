			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Matthias Rueb: "Romania Is Looking For Close </F> Ties With the European Union"]    [Text] Bucharest, 29 April -- Romanian President Iliescu  hopes that his country will receive financial compensation from  the United Nations for about 12 billion German marks in damages  that it has suffered as a result of sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro. The sanctions against Libya and Iraq, however,  demonstrated that neighboring countries of the isolated states  that suffered most did not receive any compensation. For  Romania this means that, in a time of transition, which is  difficult in itself, it has to cope with the loss of one of the  most important and most developed trading partners and the  blockade of many transit routes by itself, Iliescu said in an  interview with this newspaper.    The future integration into the military and political  alliances of the West remains an important foreign policy goal  for Romania. Iliescu hopes that the association agreement  between Romania and the European Union [EU] will be ratified by  all EU member states by the end of this year. Bringing Romania  close to the EU as an associated member is an important step for  his country on the path toward full EU membership. In  restructuring, Romania expects "economic partnership" with the  developed Western countries. In the West much is being said  about economic aid. Romania does not need charity but "normal,  equal conditions for access to loans and modern technology" to  stimulate the dynamism of economic growth in the East, Iliescu  said. "We will be able to solve the problems here and in the  West only together," the Romanian president stated.    Asked about the thinking in terms of so-called spheres of  influence, which has become popular again recently, above all in  Russia, Iliescu answered that the view, gained from historical  experience, that there are big powers that determine politics  and economy must be eliminated from the mentality of  international politics. "We need a new democratic climate also  at the international level, at the level of relations between  the states, be they big or small," Iliescu demanded.    Regarding Romania's relations with Moldova, one must  distinguish between historical ties and a new political reality,  Iliescu said. At a "referendum" in March in the former Soviet  Republic of Moldova, where two-thirds of its 4.5 million  inhabitants are Russians, a majority voted for independence and  closer ties with the CIS. Even though there are common roots, a  common history, and a common language between Moldova and  Romania, the existence of an independent Republic of Moldova,  which owes its independence to the collapse of the Soviet  Empire, is "a definite reality." From the very beginning  Romania has supported the independence of "this second Romanian  state." Iliescu expresses understanding for the efforts of the  government in Chisinau to cultivate and expand the developed  economic relations between Moldova and the former Soviet area as  well as to establish normal political relations with its eastern  neighbors.    In the Romanian president's view, it has been possible to  stop the negative economic development in the country. For the  first time in years of production decline, one can expect zero  growth in 1994, Iliescu assumes. Last year all negative  processes of structural change from the planned economy to the  market economy accumulated: Today Romanian industry is working  at about half- capacity. In contrast to the general assumption,  Ceausescu's ambition to repay all of Romania's foreign debts did  not bring the country any advantages but only disadvantages on  the path toward a market economy. First, because the country  and its infrastructure were impoverished as a result and,  second, because as an unknown debtor Romania has greater  problems getting foreign loans than its competitors on the money  market.    Combating inflation, which was about 300 percent last year,  and unemployment, which is 11 percent, is still the top priority  of economic reforms. The "internal convertibility" of the leu,  which was introduced a few weeks ago, has managed to make its  exchange rate vis a vis Western currencies relatively stable, so  that now there are hardly any differences between the official  exchange rate and the black market rate. In addition, further  "fiscal policy discipline measures" have meanwhile contained  the inflation-promoting consequences of the introduction of  value-added tax and the raising of the energy prices. According  to Iliescu, the monthly inflation rate is now between 6 and 8  percent; the 1994 annual rate might be between 70 and 80  percent, according to the forecasts. The year 1994 will be a  difficult one for the people and individual companies. Two  periods of drought did great harm to agriculture so that in 1993  Romania was forced to import even wheat. Iliescu expects a  slight improvement in the microeconomic situation at the end of  1994 at the earliest.    Asked about the problems of the former Romanian King Mihai  from the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in connection with  entering the country, Iliescu tersely answered that Mihai may  enter the country as a private person at any time. The former  king had planned to travel to Romania for the orthodox Easter  celebrations. Any trip by Mihai to Romania is a problem only if  it serves as an excuse for social unrest.    In the Romanian president's view, relations between Romania  and Germany are good. The signing of the German-Romanian treaty  of friendship and cooperation by then Foreign Minister Genscher  in Bucharest in April 1992 is the clearest sign of that. Germany  supports Romania in its desire to become a member of the EU and  NATO. At the same time, however, Iliescu hopes for additional  economic and political signals from Germany. In Bucharest  government circles one hears surprisingly often words of  disappointment about the fact that high-ranking German  politicians seem to ignore Romania on their trips to reforming  countries in Central Europe. Bucharest has in vain waited for a  visit by the chancellor since the revolution in December 1989.  The last German chancellor to visit Romania was Kohl's  predecessor Schmidt, who traveled to this country in 1978.</p>

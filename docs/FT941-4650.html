			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Observer: Vingt ordinaire The French have surpassed themselves in gastronomic one-upmanship, judging by a press release from Michelin that accompanies its 1994 Guide to France. Michelin's views on Britain's culinary skills are well known. Only two British establishments are deemed worthy of its snooty three stars. By contrast, 457 eateries in France have been awarded this accolade, according to a table in Michelin's latest press release. Obviously someone had enjoyed a good lunch; the true figure is a more modest 20.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of Republic of </F> Tatarstan, by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin; place and  date not given: "Mintimer Shaymiyev: The Market Is No  Hindrance to Tatarstan"]    [Text] Of all the evils of the present period Tatarstan  seems to have chosen the very least: A moderate, wise policy  has been adopted in the republic -- to create something new  while destroying as little as possible of the old. The tactic  of "gently" entering the market has proved correct. With this  topic I began my conversation with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president  of the Republic of Tatarstan.    [Shaymiyev] We should not flatter ourselves, for negative  tendencies do, unfortunately, remain: Stability has not come  about in the economy, and the financial position of major  commodity producers is critical. The situation is exacerbated  by the fact that a natural slump has occurred in oil extraction  -- the fields, which have produced 2.5 billion tonnes of oil,  are getting old. One-third of the oil wells are unprofitable,  and many are standing idle. This and the increase in  nonpyaments are creating additional difficulties:  Subcontractors -- petrochemical enterprises -- are on the verge  of coming to a halt.    [Sorokin] To this has been added the tragedy at KamAZ [Kama  Truck Plant]....    [Shaymiyev] Yes, the thread breaks where it is weakest. At  the most critical moment, in April 1993, the head plant -- the  engine plant -- of the "KamAZ" Joint-Stock Company burned to the  ground. By concentrating 100 heavy cranes and 10,000 workers on  the site and organizing round-the-clock work according to a  flextime schedule, we managed to eliminate the consequences of  the tragedy in a shorter time. Construction workers cleared the  debris of 90,000 tonnes of metal structures in three months.  The final roofing unit was recently installed, and the engine  plant will soon start working at full capacity.    At the same time I wish to speak about the fate of YelAZ  [Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant], which is under construction.  The intergovernmental agreement "On the Joint Creation of the  Motor Vehicle Plant in the City of Yelabuga" was signed in Minsk  last year. The proportions of the investments by the  participants -- Russia, Tatarstan, Ukraine, Bashkortostan,  Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Tajikistan -- were determined. The "YelAZ-invest" interstate  corporation was set up in Tatarstan for the purpose of  concentrating the investors' funds for the construction project.  It was planned to form the incorporation capital in full within  a year. The world's major motor vehicle companies have joined  in the YelAZ project. All the conditions are being created for  the creation of a modern, competitive motor vehicle production  facility.    [Sorokin] On the other hand, things are improving in the  agro-industrial complex.    [Shaymiyev] Our general line is to give the countryside all  possible support. The government has channeled from the state  budget 156 billion rubles [R], or half the expenditure, into  improving the land's fertility, increasing spending on  reclamation, supporting seed growing and pedigree breeding,  developing the food and processing industries, and constructing  housing. As a result, not only has the slump in production  volumes been eliminated in the countryside but an increase has  also been achieved. Livestock numbers have been restored, and a  record harvest for recent years was grown -- 23 quintals per  hectare. The volume of purchases, compared with 1992, stood at  107 percent for meat and poultry, 109 percent for milk, and 104  percent for eggs. These indicators stand at 85, 94, and 99  percent respectively for Russia. This year we intend to  preserve the system of procurements of the products of fields  and livestock units on the basis of contracts. The  restructuring of kolkhozes has begun: Kolkhoz members are being  allocated a share of property and an allotment of land.    [Sorokin] Two years of hard, unpredictable reforms. What  are the lessons?    [Shaymiyev] The reforms begun in 1992 have become  irreversible -- this is the most important result. What are the  landmarks of the reforms? First, a partial price liberalization  has been carried out. The abandonment of state regulation has  brought inflation from a hidden state out into the open. This  has made it possible to assess the state of the economy  correctly at the macro level and the micro level. Consequently,  management has become more efficient. Second, partial  convertibility of the ruble has been introduced. Fluctuations  in the ruble rate have become one of the indicators and a real  tool regulating the movement of capital and, partly, the  dynamics of prices. But it is a disturbing fact that inflation  has acquired a stable, self-producing nature. Third, the  privatization process has begun. Approximately half the  property in Tatarstan has already been privatized. Plans have  been approved for the privatization of 360 more enterprises with  an incorporation capital of more than R500 billion.  Unfortunately, small-scale privatization is lagging behind.  Before the end of the year we plan to create conditions so that  at least two-thirds of small cafes, cafeterias, workshops, and  hairdressers find owners. The privatization of housing has  begun, and a housing market is coming into being.    [Sorokin] What is a strategic area in Tatarstan's economy?    [Shaymiyev] Life has brought us to the truth that we will  not emerge from the crisis without structural restructuring of  the entire economy. It is an alarming fact that labor  productivity has not increased but has fallen in some places  since the start of the reforms. Compared with 1992, it stood at  just 89 percent last year. It will be possible to overcome the  monopolized economy with its cost-led mechanism and to attain a  competitive level only through painstaking, long-term work.  This cannot be done quickly.    The Government of Tatarstan has concluded an agreement with  the "Mashinoeksport" Association on the joint implementation of  18 projects of innovation and conversion. The republic's former  military plants will produce 70 kinds of new products of  interest to the world market. There are positive examples.  Kazan's "Terminal" Association has been entirely deprived of  military orders, which a year ago made up 90 percent of its  output. The enterprise has quickly started up production of  domestic appliances and other products and has emerged from a  complex situation without standing idle and without cutting the  work force. We intend to give selective support to  life-supporting sectors -- the agro-industrial complex above  all. It is planned to reduce oil extraction by 10 percent,  while, on the other hand, production of polyethylene, rubber,  bricks, foodstuffs, clothes, and furniture will increase.    [Sorokin] How is it possible to assess the social position  in the republic?    [Shaymiyev] The average wage stood at R128,000 in December.  In February the living wage is forecast at the level of R30,000,  and we intend to increase the minimum wage to the same level.  The state subsidizes each city resident for housing and  municipal services, transport, food, and medicines to the tune  of R39,000. Additional funds will be allocated to maintain  children's preschool establishments.    [Sorokin] Finally, what is the state of Tatarstan's  relations with Russia? Two years have elapsed since work began  on a draft treaty.    [Shaymiyev] The protracted break in the treaty process has  now ended. In addition to examining questions of the economy at  the January meeting in Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, an  accord was reached on completing the preparation of the treaty  and intergovernmental agreements. An entirely new, previously  unknown document is coming into being which proclaims the  primacy of the person and the principles of Tatarstan's  relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and  international organizations. It is proposed to form  plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and  Moscow. The treaty, on which we have been working for a long  time, will soon happen. It will be a document of the reforming  of Russia and of the Federation's renewal on democratic  principles and the guarantor of Tatarstan's statehood.    Strange though it may seem, politicians have appeared who  oppose the treaty. Living by the principles of "the worse, the  better," they call for self-isolation. But the people do not  support them. It is senseless, to say the least, to speak of  Tatarstan's isolation. Are we not seeing how sovereign states  are asking to join the CIS and wish to establish or restore  economic ties? The people have gotten nothing from wholesale  disintegration but new misfortunes. We cannot disregard this.  Therefore we favor the treaty. The people are now inclined  toward the elections, which will be held a second time in  Tatarstan 13 March. We hope that deputies will be elected to  the Federal Assembly and the State Duma.</p>

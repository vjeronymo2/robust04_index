			<p>BFN     [Text] Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of  Ministers and foreign minister, said yesterday that the  preliminary report of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights  Committee (CIDH), which recognizes the violation of ex-President  Alan Garcia Perez's human rights, has no juridical effect and  that this organization lacks any jurisdiction.    He harshly questioned the leaking of the preliminary report  which he said is a "confidential" report.    Goldenberg expressed annoyance over the CIDH report which  adds that Peru violated the guarantees of an adequate process in  the case of Alan Garcia.    He said the judicial proceedings against Garcia for illegal  enrichment and for the illegal possession of weapons will  continue "because this investigation is completely independent  of the matters discussed by the CIDH which has no power to make  decisions or issue rulings."    He said the Peruvian Government has a term in which to  implement appropriate actions, adding that the committee could  even decide to shelf the case.    Goldenberg several times denied that the committee's  preliminary report was a warning of the unstable Peruvian  juridical system.    Regarding the release of the report in Washington,  Goldenberg  accused the head of the CIDH executive secretariat of unduly  releasing the report.    He added that the diplomatic protest was already conveyed to  the OAS through the permanent representative to that  organization.    He believes the "leak" could affect the calm consideration  of  issues still pending for study by the committee.    The CIDH preliminary report indicates that the trial for  illegal possession of weapons and illegal enrichment are based  on "evidence obtained illegally" because action was taken  without a court order and without the presence of a prosecutor.    But the forceful part of the report is the condemnation over  the violations of the human rights of ex-President Garcia, his  wife, and children.    Minister Goldenberg labeled the classification of Peru as a  "narco state" by a French independent organization as completely  out of place.    He said Peru was once in danger of becoming a "narco state"  but this is no longer the case.    He stated categorically that it is not state policy to  encourage the production, consumption, and traffic of drugs.    On the country, he said, Peru fights that criminal activity  and the "results can be seen."    He said that the French organization was probably using old  information.    He added: "The newspapers now frequently show the capture of  light planes and other concrete facts."    Goldenberg did not want to be more specific of when there  was a danger of becoming a narco state. At the insistence of  reporters he said, smiling, that he was not referring to the  Middle Ages "but to a recent period."    Goldenberg also revealed that Peru has signed agreements on  investment protection with Paraguay, Colombia, France,  Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and that one is  about to be signed with the United States.    He expressed the government's great interest in continuing  to  sign this type of agreements with all countries with which it  maintains relations.    Goldenberg also talked about the recent creation of the  National Patriotic Council [Junta Patriotica Nacional--JPN]  headed by Hugo de Zela Hurtado which strongly defends the  enforcement of the 1929 Treaty with Chile and demands the  annulment of the harmful 1993 Lima Convention.    In a conciliatory tone, Goldenberg said the government fully  agrees with the objectives of the council but refused to talk  about annulling the questioned convention.    He said the government will at no time neglect the defense  and protection of national interests.    He said the enforcement of treaties is part of the  government  policy and that there is no need to worry about the government  failing to enforce international treaties or neglecting the  country's interest.    Foreign Minister Goldenberg made these comments after  signing  an important food aid agreement with U.S. Ambassador Alvin  Adams, USAID Director George Wachtenheim, and Peruvian Economy  Minister Jorge Camet.</p>

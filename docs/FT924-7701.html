			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts The congestion at the retail end of the gilts market this week prompts a comparison with what happened on Wall Street as US interest rates came down. In a rush to obtain better returns private investors sold short-term money market investments in favour of equities. The result was a rise in the equity market which held despite a degree of scepticism among the professionals about the outlook for both the economy and earnings. Could it be that something similar is happening in the UK now that returns on bank and building society accounts are crumbling? The beneficiary, of course, would be the gilts market rather than equities where smaller investors may see the risks as too great. Such a flow might help to explain the relative resilience of the gilts market to the deteriorating news on supply. Certainly, small investors can be under few illusions about the chances of finding savings bargains in the high street after the abrupt withdrawal of many National Savings products on Thursday night. Whether retail demand for gilts will be enough to offset the supply problem is another matter. Retail savers account for only about 10 per cent of the total gilts market and have tended to concentrate on the short end. Their appetite may also have been reduced by liquidity fears after the well-publicised execution difficulties for small deals. At the margin retail demand may help support the gilts market for a while. The danger is that the market might be lulled even deeper into a false sense of security.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRAIGHT FACTS FOR STORY ON GAY CATHOLICS  </P> <P> Your story "They Pray Alone" really struck a chord. Gay, straight, man, woman,  young, old -- it doesn't matter. All Catholics pray alone.  </P> <P> The Pope, cardinals, bishops and priests are little more than superfluous,  self-appointed middle men with pretenses to divinely ordained authority.  </P> <P> Many priests are genuinely decent, compassionate men, concerned with the lives  of their congregations. But few of the men who actually run the Catholic Church  are interested in matters of spirituality. The Church's administration is the  ultimate fascistic dictatorship, a remnant of bureaucracy/theocracy directly  descended from the all-time champion of state despotism, the Roman Empire.  </P> <P> This elite, privileged male priesthood is contemptuous of everything that does  not support the politics of patriarchal monotheism -- particularly women and  all notions of personal or social freedom.  </P> <P> NED MADDEN  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

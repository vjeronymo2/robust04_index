The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the contracting officer's request for additional supporting documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the contracting officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a contracting officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional information under subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If the contracting officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant to subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Not been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one contracting officer shall notify each contracting officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which contracting officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The contracting officer who initiated the first in time unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other contracting officers who have challenged the restrictions and the contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Contractor appeal_Government obligation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a contracting officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the contracting officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For a period of one year from the date of the contracting officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following the contracting officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days; or, (B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed suite within one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the contracting officer's final decision; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) File suit within one year after the date of the contracting officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the contracting officer's final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The agency head, on a non-delegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or, (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7; or, is a government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.'' The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the contracting officer's final decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE SWITCHED LIGHTS ON IN KINGS' SURGE  </P> <P> Everyone knows how the inspired play of a great star, calling on all his  remembered skills, turned around the Kings hockey team last season, turned them  from the NHL version of Holiday On Ice to the most dangerous things on ice this  side of the polar bear.  </P> <P> You just have to hail this guy who went out and all but doubled his total in  goals from a year earlier, who led his team (and almost his league) in goals,  and who became only the fifth man in league history to score 70 goals in a  season.  </P> <P> By now you've guessed whom I'm talking about. Bernie Nicholls, of course.  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky? Who said anything about Wayne Gretzky? Come on. He had only 54  goals, didn't he?  </P> <P> Oh, I won't say Gretzky didn't help. His 168 points (goals plus assists) helped  keep the opposition honest. But it was Bernie Nicholls who came in to light the  red light 70 times. You can get two assists on a play. Goals come one to a  customer. Assists are like the bunt in baseball. Goals are homers.  </P> <P> The moral is that Bernie Nicholls is a considerable hockey player in his own  right. Even in a game where trying to decapitate your opponent is called  "misconduct," he holds his own. He once played the last half of a season with a  broken jaw wired shut (in 1984). He couldn't talk but he could check.  </P> <P> He was second in the league in goals-scored last season with 70 (Pittsburgh's  Mario Lemieux was first with 85). He was fifth in total points. He was one of  the main reasons the Kings led the NHL in goals (with 376).  </P> <P> He was not the retiring type. He bashed 385 shots on goal in his 79 games last  year. When Nicholls was around the net, the goalie thought it was raining  pucks.  </P> <P> Even when the Kings used to skate around the rink as if an organist were  playing a Strauss waltz for them, and they were trying to get judges' 9s,  Bernie Nicholls was a threat. He threw in 46 goals and 54 points in '84-'85.  His 300 goals and 383 assists are third on the Kings' all-time list behind  Marcel Dionne and Dave Taylor. They are nowhere near Wayne Gretzky's gaudy  career totals (637 goals, 1,200 assists) but whose are?  </P> <P> The renaissance of the Kings last season, from the Skater's Waltz to the  Stanley Cup playoff games, was nowhere near as remarkable as the wake-up call  Bernie Nicholls left -- from 32 goals to 70, from 46 points to 150, the biggest  one-year increase in NHL history.  </P> <P> The addition of a major threat to a lineup is well known in baseball as a boost  to more than morale. It makes the hitters on both sides of him more dangerous.  They see better pitches. When Roger Maris joined the New York Yankees, the most  home runs he had hit in a season was 28. With Mickey Mantle hitting alongside  him, he hit 61. (And Mantle hit 54.) Almost every great hitter had a sidekick  to help him soften up the pitching -- Mantle-Maris, Mathews-Aaron,  Gehringer-Greenberg. Pitchers can't pitch around a whole lineup.  </P> <P> In the case of Nicholls-Gretzky, the pattern is complicated. They are both  centers. Thus, they are not on the ice at the same time (except in certain  penalty-killing situations). No matter. When Gretzky is on the ice, it behooves  the opposition to counter with its best defensive personnel. Nicholls does not  exactly get the second string. But he does get, so to speak, good pitches to  hit. As witness his 70 goals.  </P> <P> It's not likely Wayne Gretzky will ever again be able to duplicate his 92-goal  season of '81-'82. The league now assigns "shadows" to the great one. This is  like walking Babe Ruth.  </P> <P> But it is entirely possible 70 goals is only a beginning for Bernie Nicholls. A  hyperactive strawberry blond who is not only in furious motion on ice but  usually off it as well, Bernie has been on skates since he was in booties. His  first pair of shoes had blades on the bottom. He could skate before he could  walk, and as soon as the ponds froze over in his native Guilford, Ont. (about  August 5 or so), little Bernie would be on them. The puck was a tennis ball,  the sticks were cut down and taped rejects or even tree limbs. Since it gets  dark in Guilford about noon in winter, Bernie played by the swaying light of  two electric bulbs hitched to a car generator. If the lights ever get dim in  the Forum next season, Bernie Nicholls will become the new Maurice the Rocket.  </P> <P> He might anyway. He is already being hailed as a coming superstar. Sunday night  at the Century Plaza, he shares a podium with the likes of Magic Johnson, Orel  Hershiser, Tim Brown and Dick Butkus as athletes of the year in their sports at  the fourth annual Sports Spectacular to benefit Cedars-Sinai Hospital. When you  double your offensive output in a year, the least they can do is buy you  dinner.  </P> <P> But the league may give him more than a trophy of his own next year. They may  get him his very own shadow. And take their chances with Wayne What's-His-Name.  </P></p>

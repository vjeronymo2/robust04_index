			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Israel embarrassed by corruption probe into how it spends US aid: Allegations of the siphoning off of millions of dollars are not helping Jerusalem's quest for loan guarantees AS ISRAEL seeks to persuade the US to provide it with Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to buoy an immigration-burdened economy, US investigations into corruption associated with US defence assistance to Israel are turning an embarrassing spotlight on how Israel spends its annual Dollars 1.8bn in military aid from the US. 'We think the US taxpayer has been getting screwed,' is the blunt assessment of one American acquainted with the investigations. Among the allegations recently repeated in the Israeli press - eliciting strong denials from the Israeli Government - is that some misappropriated money was used to fund espionage in the US. The chief object of concern is Israel's military procurement programme which spends the bulk of the annual US military grant aid on buying arms, equipment and supplies from US companies. Both the US government, through the justice department, and Congress, through the House energy and commerce committee headed by Democratic Congressman John Dingle, are gathering evidence of a complex network of corruption involving the siphoning off of millions of dollars of aid stretching back more than five years. The issue first came to public light in late 1990 when General Rami Dotan, a former head of Israeli Air Force procurement, was arrested and convicted of skimming Dollars 12m from IAF purchasing programmes through bribes, falsified contract values and links to 'front' companies to which he directed contracts. Last Sunday, Colonel Yitzhak Sa'ar, a former IAF quartermaster, pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring with Gen Dotan between 1987 and 1990 to award contracts to companies in return for Dollars 3m. According to Israeli prosecution documents, in one Dollars 250m deal in 1986 to buy engines for IAF F-16 fighters from General Electric, Gen Dotan used a secret association with a US consultant advising GE to persuade GE to place an engine-testing contract with an Israeli company run by another associate of Gen Dotan's which owned only an empty warehouse at the time. The deal allegedly netted the conspirators more than Dollars 7m. Investigators working for the Dingle committee believe that the extent of corruption extended well beyond that revealed in Israel's prosecution of the Dotan case. Much of their attention has focused on Israel's military procurement mission in New York and suspicions that malpractice among its employees has become endemic over the years. On Sunday three Israelis were charged in a Tel Aviv court with running a bribery operaffice. Mr David Felder and Mr Mordechai Markovitz, both former employees in the mission who left in 1985 to set up a military marketing company called Rotair, were charged with illegally obtaining information from Mr Ya'acov Meringer, a procurement mission officer, about contract bidding. US investigators are also probing a number of US companies - notably GE and Pratt and Whitney - to discover to what extent their officers were aware of, or involved in, the corruption. 'There was knowledge of this going up to some level, but how high we don't know,' said one. Investigators suspect that the corruption network may have been used by Israeli intelligence bodies operating in the US to fund covert operations there, but no firm evidence has yet been produced. Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, stated flatly this month that Israel did not spy on the US - at least not since the uncovering of US naval officer Jonathan Pollard, who was caught supplying secret documents to Israel in 1985. Even without that added complication, the corruption scandals have become an embarrassment for Israel. The defence establishment's blushes were deepened last month when, on top of the procurement scams, it was disclosed that the Israeli head of a US-funded programme to produce an 'Arrow' ballistic missile interceptor had been sacked for doing private defence sector consultancy work contrary to his contract terms with Israel Aircraft Industries. Clearly, revelations of serious malpractice in the use of US financial assistance could have a damaging effect on Israel's case for continued US defence and civilian aid worth Dollars 3bn a year and its request for loan guarantees. But an overriding concern is the damage done domestically to the military's hitherto cherished reputation for honesty and integrity. 'That is what has shaken the military establishment,' says Mr Dore Gold, a senior staffer at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies. Mr Arens is balking at allowing US investigators free access to pursue their inquiries in Israel, as the Dingle committee is seeking. But he told the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee this week that the country could not live with corruption in the defence system. He said he was studying recommendations made by two internal investigations on how to stop such things happening. A senior opposition MP, Mr Rafi Edri of the Labour Party, has been pressing in the Knesset for an overhaul of the whole procurement structure, in particular the traditional practice of staffing the New York mission with former military officers augmented by inexperienced Israeli students. The practice of senior military men proceeding immediately from the armed forces to top jobs in military industries has been well established for years, but transparently prone to corruption. Among Mr Edri's suggestions are for much stricter civilian controls over the procurement system, including the stricture that no-one involved in procurement within the armed forces should be able to work in any procurement role for three years after leaving the military. 'Unless the equivalent of root canal work is carried out in terms of an internal investigating effort, (the scandals) will cast a shadow over Israel in the future,' says Mr Gold. But he believes this will be done and does not see lasting damage to Israel's intimate military relationship with the US. US investigators insist that they have no political motive to that end - as some in Israel have suggested. From their point of view the main lesson may turn out to be the inadequate control the US government has exerted over its Israeli aid programme. Unlike other countries, Israel gets its aid up front and is largely free to spend it as it sees fit, beyond strictures on the amount that must be spent in the US. 'There is no doubt the initial finding is the US government's lack of oversight over the money we give to Israel. Its a joke,' declared one congressional official.</p>

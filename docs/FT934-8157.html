			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Close attention key to academic results Charters School in Berkshire (above), the third-placed local authority-maintained comprehensive at A-level in a recent FT survey, thinks close attention is the key to results. The school, sceptical of league tables, concentrates on the National Record of Achievement. This presents pupils with folders in which all their achievements can be assessed. Keeping the folders up to date obliges teachers to meet pupils individually and regularly. St Paul's school in Barnes, west London, uses tutor groups in a similar approach. Every boy keeps the same tutor throughout his career and the school says its teachers can build an enviable ability to spot boys who have the most potential, and those who need the most help.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / This little penny is for childcare: Day care for children need not drain public funds The government should take the lead in expanding the provision of childcare for people at work, according to the 11 UK companies which last week launched Employers for Childcare with the support of the Confederation of British Industry. The companies are large employers, such as Shell UK and British Airways, which have tried to provide childcare for their employees. Their claim that the government needs to do more to help them provide a comprehensive childcare package therefore merits consideration. They say, for example, that even the largest companies cannot provide workplace nurseries in every location. The alternative - forming consortia with other local employers to create shared childcare facilities - can be time-consuming and complex to administer. They point out that workplace childcare is often not the first choice of parents, who are reluctant to drag their children into work every day. Yet, finding suitable childcare close to employees' homes can be difficult, with a limited range of facilities in many parts of the country. What is needed is a marketplace within which employers and parents can more easily purchase high-quality childcare. The first requirement is a national register of childcare providers which would help companies find out what services are available. This should be accompanied by some sort of quality assurance scheme so that employers and parents can be confident of the standard of childcare on offer. And the range of childcare provision needs to be expanded to ensure there is a range of options in every locality, including registered child minders, pre-school nurseries, after-school clubs and holiday play schemes. Some of these developments might be achieved by business initiatives - but only piecemeal and in ways that would duplicate efforts in different parts of the country. It would be more efficient for the government to take the lead in creating such a marketplace. This would not require the exchequer to finance unlimited expansion in childcare. Employers who want to offer childcare to attract and retain the best employees should be prepared to pay for it. So, too, should those employees better able to combine work and a family - currently they may not be asked to pay towards the cost of some forms of pre-school education. But the government may need to fund new agencies and help create new capacity for childcare. A precedent has been set with the Pounds 45m which the Department of Employment is giving Training and Enterprise Councils over the next three years to develop out-of-school facilities. This is a good example of how relatively modest amounts of government money can be used to prime the pump. If the first-year pilot is successful, the programme should be expanded to cover other forms of childcare provision. Funds for such purposes could be found by redirecting the money now spent on tax incentives for workplace nurseries. Employers can claim capital allowances for investment in workplace facilities, which are then tax-free for the employee. Employers for Childcare suggests extending the tax concessions to other forms of support, such as childcare vouchers. This would be costly and would give the greatest benefit to those who paid the highest rates of tax. It would also discriminate against those whose employers give no such help with childcare and must pay for it out of their after-tax income. A fairer and more rational approach would be to make all childcare support a taxable benefit for employees, using the revenue saved to provide better childcare facilities. Creating a comprehensive childcare framework need not add a penny to public expenditure. But it could make a significant supply-side contribution to business success by encouraging the best use of the country's skills and labour force. The market where possible, the state where necessary, as the German theorists of the social market would say.</p>

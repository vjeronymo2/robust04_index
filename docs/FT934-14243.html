			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Boeing 747 production faces cut as orders fall BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, may be forced to shut down one of its two 747 jumbo production lines in the face of the deep recession in the airline business. Although the company has just delivered its thousandth 747, to Singapore Airlines, it has not won a single new order for its jumbos so far this year. Production of 747s at the company's huge Everett facility outside Seattle has already come down from seven a month two years ago to four a month and will go down to three a month in January. Boeing is slashing overall production rates from a peak of 39 1/2 aircraft a month to 21 aircraft a month by the middle of next year. Everett has inventory of Dollars 4bn aircraft, plant and equipment. The Boeing group as a whole is carrying inventory worth between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn. Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, said in an interview at the company's Seattle headquarters that there were no plans at present for any further production cuts but he could not rule these out in the future. Boeing, the European Airbus consortium, and McDonnell Douglas are competing for a Dollars 6bn order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian airline. The deal is likely to be the last big airline order for several months in the deeply depressed market which has taken a heavy toll on all manufacturers. Mr Condit said there were some 'faint, positive signs' with US airlines beginning to show improved profitability and continued growth in the Asia-Pacific region where Boeing is actively seeking to sell its new 777 wide-body to Singapore Airlines. The cut in production rates, which will see Boeing aircraft deliveries fall from 446 airliners last year to about 350 this year and probably 258 next year, coincides with heavy development spending on new products including the wide-body 777 airliner due to fly for the first time next year. Boeing expects to spend about Dollars 1.7bn on research and development this year. Apart from the 777, the company will offer a new family of 737 twin-engine jets and is developing a cargo version of its 767 medium-sized airliner. Boeing is in the throes of extensive restructuring with employment falling from 132,695 at its peak in 1992 to about 116,000 by the end of this year. Tactics for smooth touchdown, Page 16</p>

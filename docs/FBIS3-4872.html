			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by industrial reporter Ichiro Kuwada: "Demands on </F> Too Many Numbers in Automobiles and Auto Parts -- Breakthrough  Not in Sight Because of Poor Demand"; first in a series entitled  "Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S. Friction"; first  paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] After the Japan-U.S. summit ended in failure, the  United States began to signal the possibility of invoking  sanctions against Japan. We have undertaken a study on the  current conditions and problems within the industry in the four  areas of recent friction--automobiles and auto parts,  communications equipment, semiconductors, and  supercomputers--and on the possibility of resolving these  problems.  <H5>  Growing Uneasiness About the Future </H5>   On the evening of 18 February, the Japan Automobile Dealers  Association threw a party in Tokyo. The topic naturally turned  to Japan-U.S. issues. Tatsuro Toyota, president of Toyota Motor  Corporation, remarked: "Japan needs to make efforts to open up  its market, but what about the high yen that has gone far too  high?" Hiroyuki Yoshino, vice president of Honda Motor Company,  said: "We must not become emotional. We must deal with this  situation in a calm manner." The auto industry praises the  Japanese Government for rejecting numerical targets, but without  a lead to resolving the friction, there are growing voices of  uneasiness about the future as well.    The areas in which the United States demands to have  numerical targets set on automobiles and auto parts are the  purchase of auto parts and the expanded sale of U.S.-made  vehicles in the Japanese market. Both entail the basic problem  of "being linked to managed trade." Besides, the given  situation of the industry is that existing business conditions  being so bad, it is simply "impossible to expand the quantity of  imports," according to an officer from Nissan Motor Company.  Another major auto company officer asked: "The Japanese  companies put in so much effort and went through unspeakable  tribulations when they first began operating in the United  States. Are U.S. manufacturers serious about developing markets  in Japan?"  <H5>  U.S. Mistrust in Keiretsu </H5>   What the United States wants for auto part procurements is  for Japan's voluntary plan to "buy $19 billion worth of  U.S.-made goods in 1994" as announced in January 1992 to be  extended in duration and expanded in quantity. The $19 billion  comprises $15 billion in local procurements by  Japanese-affiliated plants in the United States, and $4 billion  in imports to Japan. Purchases in 1990 which were used as the  basis of calculation were $9.1 billion. The growth since then  has been 16 percent in 1991, 29 percent in 1992, and 11 percent  in the first half of 1993. The United States demands growth be  raised by 10 to 30 percent in 1995, and then retain that rate  thereafter.    Toyoshi Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, while speaking in a meeting of the Joint Steering  Committee of the Japanese-U.S. Businessmen's Conference held  shortly after the Japan-U.S. summit stated: "In view of the  current conditions of the Japanese economy, it will be difficult  to fulfill the targets." Tazo Yokoyama, executive director of  Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, noted: "The economic conditions  are different from those when (then) President Bush was in Japan  in January 1992."    Japan's automobile production dropped from 13.50 million  units in 1990 to 10.22 million units in 1993. Given such  conditions, a staff official of the Japanese Automobile  Manufacturers Association said: "Importing auto parts can mean  life or death for Japanese parts manufacturers." Total sales  for the parts industry are said to total about 18 trillion yen a  year. The $4 billion (about 400 billion yen) asked to be  imported into Japan comes to 2 percent of total domestic sales,  and is comparable to the annual sales of Aishin Precision  Machinery Company, Japan's second largest manufacturer (whose  yearly sales up to the first quarter of 1994 are expected to  total 465 billion yen).    Concerning local procurements, the views of the U.S.  private sector are somewhat different from those shown by the  U.S. Government. Joseph Gorman, chairman of the major U.S.  parts manufacturer TRW, declared: "Our company has no complaints  about Japan with respect to business. Over the past two to  three years, U.S. parts manufacturers have gone into a  relationship of cooperating with Japanese auto manufacturers  from the design stage on, and sales of parts for use in local  production of automobiles have risen sharply since last year."  Nonetheless, within the United States there remains a feeling  of mistrust. A top executive of a U.S. parts manufacturer said:  "Japanese auto manufacturers might return to the practice of  buying parts primarily from keiretsu companies once the  numerical targets are removed."  <H5>  Voices Urge "Buying 100,000 Units a Year" </H5>   Regarding imports of finished vehicles, the United States  has  not officially presented any numbers in the negotiation, but in  the U.S. industry there are voices saying Japan should buy at  least 100,000 units a year. According to a survey done by the  Japan Automobile Importers Association, total sales for all U.S.  Big Three vehicles sold in Japan in 1993 totaled only 19,300  units.    Toyota has announced a plan to sell 20,000 units of General  Motors compact cars beginning in 1996. Nissan-affiliated  dealers are due to finish by year's end the groundwork to be  able to sell 3,000 to 4,500 units of Ford passenger cars. The  Big Three themselves are beginning to take the Japanese market  seriously, for instance by announcing plans to introduce  right-hand drive cars. But as one influential Toyota-affiliated  dealer said, there are persistent complaints of "their service  system being inadequate." It will not be easy to accomplish the  target of 100,000 units.    In a news conference on 21 February Keishin Kato, chairman  of  the Automobile Dealers Association, said: "It would be wrong  for the association to advise member dealers to accept U.S.-made  automobiles." He thus declared the association will allow  dealers to decide on whether to handle U.S.-made vehicles. The  association is determined to firmly reject any numerical targets.    But Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and  industry, is himself hopeful the industry will make efforts  toward importation, stating: "I welcome the private sector  taking measures voluntarily to expand imports." More or less in  response to this, and while the government was in process of  negotiating, the auto industry studied formulating the  industry's own programs for international cooperation. Now it  has become difficult for the industry to come up with any  measures. A Toyota official said: "It is meaningless to adopt  such measures now when government-to-government negotiations  have broken down." The industry's own voluntary cooperation  plan, which accepts no administrative guidance, and hence no  numerical targets, remains a subject to be studied. But the  industry insists "the study should be done on a business basis  by all means," and it is unclear whether a compromise can be  reached with the United States.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEZE EXTENDED ON GUAM ABORTION LAW  </P> <P> A federal judge today extended a restraining order against enforcement of the  most restrictive U.S. abortion law.  </P> <P> District Judge Alex Munson had issued a temporary restraining order Friday, a  few hours after a group of Guam residents and medical groups filed a  class-action suit. Today he extended the order until May 8, when a trial on the  suit is scheduled to begin.  </P> <P> The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers the life of the  mother.  </P> <P> It makes it a third-degree felony to perform an abortion or aid in the  procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or have an abortion and a  misdemeanor for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion.  </P> <P> The law is seen by abortion opponents as a potential vehicle to challenge the  U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.  </P></p>

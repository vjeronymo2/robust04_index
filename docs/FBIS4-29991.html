			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 22 (ANTARA) -- The government has  appealed to the farmers not to hold back their rice stocks  because the government is constantly in need of rice in  substantial quantities to maintain stability, State Minister  Ibrahim Hasan told the press here on Wednesday.    The state minister for food affairs /chairman of the  national  logistics agency made these remarks after giving an account of  the development of the national food stock to President Suharto  at the Merdeka [Presidential] Palace.    Minister Ibrahim Hasan said that the food stock controlled  by  the government reached at present 700,000 to 900,000 tonnes, but  it will continue to increase until it reached the safe level of  1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes.    The government will continue to purchase rice not only to  meet the people's demand but also to prevent a negative impact  of the dry season, he added.    The Central Bureau of Statistics has predicted that the dry  season this year will cause a reduction of 2.7 per cent in the  production of rice.    Indonesia's demand for rice each year reaches about 2.5  million tonnes.    The minister said that although rice production declined,  the  government had no intention whatsoever to import this commodity.    Although Indonesia will not commercially import rice, but it  will receive 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of rice in the next few  months as reimbursements of the rice lent by Indonesia to  several countries, including the Philippines.    The minister also reported about the result of the recent  meeting of 16 ministers in the fields of agriculture and food in  Montevideo, Uruguay, discussing the implementation of the  Uruguay Round which was ratified in Morocco recently.    One of the items discussed at the meeting was the  abolishment  of subsidies on agricultural produce which have so far been  provided by advanced as well as developing countries.    Commenting on the result of the meeting, the head of state  said that Indonesia should constantly implement the Uruguay  Round decisions, however with taking the national interest into  consideration.    "We should always give priority to the national production  and imports only as complementary", Minister Ibrahim Hasan said,  quoting the president.    He also stressed that Indonesia would fulfilled its  obligation to import 70,000 tonnes of rice, although it would  only be implemented early in 1995.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Britain and Spain face pressure on EU voting: Paris and Bonn push for quick solution to crisis France and Germany will exert heavy pressure on Britain and Spain today to try to resolve the crisis over voting rights in an enlarged European Union. Neither London nor Madrid appeared ready last night to soften their position at today's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels. The issue may force the EU to delay a decision on new voting arrangements, jeopardising an already tight timetable for the entry of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union by January 1, 1995. The European Parliament further damped hopes of a solution being reached today. The largest group in the Strasbourg assembly, the Socialists, rejected the compromise being offered to Britain and Spain. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said: 'What is at stake is the whole concept of a future Europe.' The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by May 4 to make it possible for the four newcomers to enter by January. But the Strasbourg assembly has said it will withhold assent if Britain and Spain win their demands to retain the 'blocking minority' at 23 votes in the Council of Ministers, allowing one small and two large member states to obstruct decisions. London and Madrid's 10 partners insist that the blocking threshold should rise to 27, since the weighted votes in Council will rise from 76 to 90. But as a compromise, they are prepared to offer a two-month delay on decisions which are opposed by 23 votes, to try to get consensus. Mr Cot said yesterday: 'There is no chance of having any sort of mixed solution go through (the European) Parliament, such as a two-month cooling-off period, which would only exacerbate delays in decision-making.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeated that Britain was determined to keep the weight of voting power with the larger EU states. 'The situation now, where two large and one small country can block a decision, is perfectly satisfactory,' he said in Brussels. 'I am not prepared to see a situation develop where a collection of small states can vote down a collection of bigger ones.' Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was more conciliatory, but indicated that it was unlikely that a solution could be reached today. The Union had to find a way through the voting impasse, he said, during a visit to Dublin. 'We may not do so in Brussels tomorrow (Tuesday), but we will persevere until we do.' In Paris, the French foreign ministry, quoted by Reuter, said France and Germany would still press for a solution at today's meeting:. 'There are ways to take account of some countries' concerns.' Mr Clarke said it was wrong to assume that enlargement automatically meant changes to make decision-making easier at the expense of the minority. But an EU diplomat said all 12 member states, including Britain, had agreed at the EU summit in Lisbon in June 1992 that the admission of the four Nordic and Alpine countries would require a 'mechanical' adjustment in voting weights. A senior Brussels diplomat played down speculation about a special summit to break the impasse. Joe Rogaly, Page 18 Observer, Page 19</p>

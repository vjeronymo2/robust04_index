			<p>BFN     [Text] The Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] fell 26 points  for the first time in 13 days after climbing steadily for more  than 100 points, reflecting a mixture of profit-taking and  growing nervousness about the political situation.    The SET index adjusted downward to 1356.87 on active volume  of BtlO.39 billion. Declines were particularly conspicuous in  the banking, finance and securities and construction materials  sectors.    An analyst at Ekkachat Finance &amp; Securities Co  indicated that  the market fall could be attributed largely to technical reasons  after the index had risen sharply for almost a fortnight on news  of improved corporate earnings.    The analyst said investors are nervously watching the local  political scene, fearing that a spill-over from the hunger  strike of Chalat Worachat and the looming constitutional crisis  might lead to an unforeseen situation.    Foreign investors, who have been a major factor in driving  up  equity prices, have apparently slowed their buying spree but  elected to invest in blue-chip stocks, causing the stock market  to lose its steam.    An analyst from GF &amp; Securities Co. said without  fundamental  support for the market, the finance and securities sector  witnessed the highest volume at Bt2.3 billion out of the total  turnover, followed by the construction materials sector at Bt2.2  billion.    An analyst from Siam City Finance &amp; Securities Co. said  that  technically the SET index attempted to test the 1400 level on  Monday but it could not breach the 1392 level yesterday forcing  the investors to readjust their portfolios.</p>

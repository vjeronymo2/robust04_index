			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin left for Paris today  to attend the opening conference of the European Stability Pact.  In a predeparture statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin  said that the proposal concerning the European Stability Pact  was submitted by the new French Government and was then  transformed into a joint European Union [EU] initiative. Cetin  explained that the guiding idea behind this initiative consists  of resolving the minority and border problems lying at the basis  of the instabilities in Europe through negotiations. He  stressed that some of the Central and East European countries  are still afflicted with minority and border problems.    [Begin Cetin recording] One cannot say that the initiative  was welcomed by the relevant countries. Although this was not  explicitly stated, these countries are being told the following:  You have a European perspective, but we do not want you to bring  your problems into the EU. You must first try to solve these  problems among yourselves. We are willing to assist you to this  end, establish a security system, and support you. First and  foremost, however, you must discuss the minority and border  problems. Conduct bilateral negotiations and reach agreements,  or establish regional and multilateral platforms of negotiation.  [end recording]    The foreign minister explained that an opening document will  be adopted in Paris in connection with this issue. The document  will outline the initiative's philosophy and its principal  parameters, Cetin reported. He added that Turkey is ready to  make every possible constructive contribution to the initiative.</p>

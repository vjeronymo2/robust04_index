Freda, who heads the National Front party, was charged with  spreading racist and fascist ideas following a nine-month  investigation.    The fascist party has been banned in Italy since the end of  World War II.    Freda had previously been charged for his alleged role in a  terrorist attack in Milan on December 12, 1969, in which 16  people died and 107 were injured.    He was acquitted of the charges by an appeals court in 1985.</p>

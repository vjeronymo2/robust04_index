			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Upheaval in Sweden prompts postponement of Eurobond issue THE upheaval in Swedish financial markets yesterday prompted Goldman Sachs to pull a Eurobond issue for a Swedish borrower in what is thought to be the first such delay of its kind to an underwritten issue. The postponement, to a Dollars 384m mortgage-backed issue, left other banks puzzled and concerned that a precedent had been set which could affect future Eurobond offerings. 'As professionals, we carried on underwriting deals through the Gulf war. The state of the market shouldn't make any difference,' said one banker not involved in the transaction. Goldman Sachs said that the deal, for Osprey Mortgage Securities, a special vehicle for a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, had been postponed with the agreement of the borrower. The deal had been underwritten before Tuesday's four point rise in Swedish interest rates, even though it was not announced until later that day, Goldman said. But it added that yesterday's sharp hike in rates had finally persuaded those involved in the deal - both investors and issuer - that it would be better to delay. However, even banks close to the deal remained puzzled by the on-off nature of the launch. 'It's all pretty impenetrable,' one said. 'We didn't know it would be launched yesterday The reasons for doing it then - or pulling it now - are equally puzzling.' The move also left bankers trying to remember when underwritten issues have been pulled in the past. The only transaction of any significance was a proposed launch for BAT, the British tobacco and financial services group, at the time of a proposed break-up bid from Sir James Goldsmith. However, that had been a matter directly related to the company, rather than being a market-related delay. Meanwhile, one of the best-trailed issues for some time - a Dollars 500m 10-year deal for Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB) - received a strong welcome. LKB, the triple-A rated German regional bank backed by the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, is working hard to build its profile in the international capital markets. Along with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German agency, LKB is the only credit available in the Eurobond market which can be viewed as quasi-German government debt. This message had been hammered home to investors in thorough marketing in the run up to the issue, ensuring a good take up by institutions across Europe and Asia Pacific. The bonds were launched at the expected spread of 33 basis points over US Treasuries. LKB has traditionally under-performed comparable credits in the Eurobond market. In the past, its borrowings have been opportunistic, with issues in retail-targeted currencies such as the Australian dollar. However, the need to fund an ambitious expansion programme, partly fuelled by the financing of projects in eastern Germany, has lifted the bank's borrowing programme for next year to as much as DM12bn, of which half will be raised in the international capital markets. In the other big event of the day, Merrill Lynch handled a rare back-to-back deal in the Canadian and Australian dollar markets, though to lukewarm response. The Province of Quebec raised ADollars 235m while SECV of Australia raised CDollars 200m, with the two swapping the proceeds of the respective issues. The back-to-back arrangement would have saved the borrowers 25 to 30 basis points on their joint borrowing costs, one bank estimated. However, the large size of the issues - the ADollars component was said to have been the largest ever Euro-ADollars bond issue - and the fact that neither borrower is a top-rated credit meant that both struggled to find buyers. After the syndicates had been broken, both settled below their issue prices.</p>

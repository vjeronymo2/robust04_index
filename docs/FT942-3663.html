			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Gooda staff 'unaware of risks' Some Gooda Walker staff who spoke to Lloyd's Names were unaware of the full extent of the risks taken by the agency's syndicate 290 which specialised in catastrophe insurance, Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of the Gooda Walker managing agency, agreed in the High Court yesterday, John Mason writes. Giving evidence in the action brought against Gooda Walker by more than 3,000 Names, Mr Walker also agreed that syndicate 290, which he ran personally, was open to criticism that it had too little reinsurance, and that he had told the agency's board that increasing reinsurance could threaten profits. Questioned by Mr Geoffrey Vos QC for the Names, Mr Walker agreed that some staff who spoke to Names had seriously underestimated the risks taken in the market by the syndicate. These included Mr Tony Gooda, the former chairman of the members' agency. Mr Gooda and others thought the exposure of a high-risk syndicate such as 290 would be about 25 per cent of 'stamp' or premium capacity. In fact, under Mr Walker's control, it was up to 200 per cent. Challenged that this might expose Names to liabilities beyond their means, Mr Walker said it was for members' agents to make the 'necessary inquiries' of potential Names. Mr Walker agreed that he took on as much business as possible and then bought what reinsurance he could and that this exposed members to potentially large losses, he agreed.</p>

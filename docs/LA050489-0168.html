			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERHAUL OF GAMBLING LAW SHELVED A YEAR  </P> <P> Senate hearings on a bill that would overhaul the state's century-old gambling  law have been postponed for one year because of continuing disputes between law  enforcement officials and operators of seven Southland card clubs.  </P> <P> An aide to state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) confirmed this week  that any action on the bill, which is in the Senate Governmental Organizational  Committee, has been cancelled. A hearing had been tentatively scheduled for  Tuesday, Beverly aide Josh Pane said.  </P> <P> "We're going to hold it over for next year," Pane said in a telephone  interview. "The opponents just couldn't get it together."  </P> <P> Last month, the bill, which was drafted by lawyers for a coalition of Southland  city managers, appeared destined for passage, Bell Gardens City Manager Claude  Booker said. But a dispute over the legality of playing jackpot poker has since  threatened its passage, he said.  </P> <P> Officials of the California Peace Officers Assn. contend that card club  operators violate the state Lottery law by offering jackpots, which can be as  high as $70,000. Jackpots are offered at the seven card clubs in Bell, Bell  Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce and Gardena.  </P> <P> Sacramento lobbyist Joseph Gonzalvez, who represents the city manager  coalition, said that Beverly has asked a legislative counsel to study the  5-year-old Lottery law and decide whether jackpot poker violates its  provisions. A decision, he said, could come within a month. JAMES M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

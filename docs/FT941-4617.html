			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Portals beats expectations with 22% advance to Pounds 31m Strong overseas demand for banknote paper and a growing appetite for round teabags helped Portals Group report a stronger than expected advance in 1993. Pre-tax profits of the security and specialist papermaker and environmental protection and control products group rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 31m in the year to end-December. That compared with profits of Pounds 25.5m in 1992, when the outcome was depressed by net provisions totalling Pounds 1.84m. Interest costs for 1993 fell to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 617,000) and the group recorded a Pounds 304,000 (Pounds 127,000) profit on the sale of properties. Turnover from continuing operations grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 197.9m (Pounds 178.3m) led by the security and specialist papermaking division which lifted its turnover by 15.2 per cent to Pounds 116m (Pounds 100.7m.) Earnings per share were up 27.6 per cent to 34.55p (27.08p) and a final dividend of 10.75p (9.5p) is recommended making a total for the year of 16p (14.5p.) Buoyed by the higher than expected profits and an upbeat market assessment from Mr John Lloyd, Portals' managing director, the group's shares closed up 29p at 608p. Mr Lloyd said that as a result of increasing demand for Portals' banknote paper, particularly from developing nations and eastern Europe, the group had decided to install a new 4,000 tonne banknote paper machine costing Pounds 19m at its Overton mill, which will come on stream in 1996. Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 28.5m). In the security and specialist papermaking division the increasing demand for round teabags - which now claim two thirds of the marketplace - helped JR Crompton lift output to record levels. After a strong performance in 1992 the protection and control division recorded flat operating profits from continuing operations of Pounds 8.56m (Pounds 8.43m) on turnover up by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 77.7m.) The group ended the year with Pounds 16m of net cash compared with net borrowings of Pounds 2.75m a year earlier. COMMENT Portals' specialist papermaking business used to be viewed as dependable but boring, but this is changing. The market, which historically has grown at a real rate of between 2 and 3 per cent a year, is now growing at between 4 and 5 per cent a year. The banknote market has expanded because of the break-up of the Soviet empire and growth in emerging markets like south-east Asia, and demand for high security paper is growing as governments try to keep one step ahead of the counterfeiters. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 34.5m this year producing 39p of earnings and a prospective p/e of 15.6. Buy this stock.</p>

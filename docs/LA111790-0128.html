			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> ROGER -- OVER AND OUT  </P> <P> Whether you believe that former Mayor Roger Hedgecock got what he deserved  Thursday, the city of San Diego finally has been rewarded for its patience with  the feuding factions at the center of his political and legal melodrama.  </P> <P> Yes, the infamous Hedgecock affair is over, and with its conclusion a turbulent  chapter in the city's political history is winding down. Whether you blame  Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. or Hedgecock for the scandal and bloody  infighting that marred the mid-1980s, you can now look forward to a gradual  diminishing of the fervor of the struggle. Or so everyone hopes.  </P> <P> By 1990, Hedgecock had become less a man on trial than a touchstone, a human  Green Line dividing a city into political and philosophical camps. It's a good  bet that the many people who have migrated here in the years since Hedgecock  was charged in 1984 with campaign-financing crimes can tell you whether they're  "pro-Roger" or "anti-Roger." But they probably can't begin to describe the  crimes of which he was actually accused.  </P> <P> You see, in the modern San Diego lexicon, being "pro-Roger" means being  anti-Establishment, anti-Miller, anti-Mayor Maureen O'Connor and anti-Copley  Press. Roger's legions consist of snarling, long-suffering "little guys," who  want to throw the bums out and who have been waiting for justice for their  hero. It's a civic division that the trial on charges of campaign-law  violations exacerbated and that Hedgecock exploits daily on his local radio  show. But it is a schism that doesn't help San Diego.  </P> <P> Now, with Hedgecock free of the threat of jail and ensconced behind his  microphone -- enjoying considerable clout but forswearing a future bid for  office -- the soap opera has something of an ending. Sure, Hedgecock won't stop  hammering at City Hall and his detractors won't soon forgive him.  </P> <P> But perhaps with the matter settled and O'Connor stepping down in two years,  San Diego is poised to begin a new political era.  </P></p>

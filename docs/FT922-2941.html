			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Major faces a growing clamour on Maastricht MR John Major flies back to Britain today with his pledge to press ahead on ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the autumn under attack from both flanks. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday claimed that the prime minister's commitment to the treaty appeared to be wavering following reports of cabinet splits over how to respond to the Danish referendum 'no' result. But Mr Michael Spicer, Tory MP for South Worcestershire and a leading opponent of the accord, warned that it might be unconstitutional for the government to proceed with ratification. The conflicting views reflected fierce divisions on all sides in the Commons about how Britain should respond to the Danish rejection, both in parliament and in the presidency of the European Community which the UK inherits from Portugal next month. To emphasise the point, a cross-party group including Mr John Biffen, the former Conservative leader of the Commons, and Mr Peter Shore, a former Labour environment secretary, yesterday re-tabled a symbolic bill requiring a statement about the impact of a treaty on citizens' rights to be sent to every household. With Conservative supporters of the treaty unusually taciturn, it was Mr Ashdown who put the case yesterday for a vigorous defence of the accord. He argued that Mr Major should confront 'the whispering campaign of his Tory opponents' directly by tabling a confidence motion on his European policy. Mr Spicer, in a speech outlining a growing school of opinion among Tory MPs, countered government claims of specific gains for Britain in the Maastricht agreement. While the commission's powers had been redefined, the executive had an enhanced role, including a right to propose what powers would be 'handed back' to national parliaments, he said. THE Tory party is seeking a new chief executive as part of its review of Conservative Central Office, its headquarters organisation, Ivo Dawnay writes. The Pounds 90,000 post is open to applicants from both inside and outside the party. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has also announced the appointment of two advisers: Sir Allen Shephard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, and Mr Richard Simmons, a senior partner of Arthur Andersen, the accountants and management consultants.</p>

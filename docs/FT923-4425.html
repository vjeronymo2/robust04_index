			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Personal View: Why German policy hurts at home as well as abroad Is German monetary policy too tight? The casual observer might answer with a re-sounding 'yes' in view of the turmoil in the European Monetary System and the dollar's fall against the D-Mark. It must be remembered, however, that the Bundesbank's mandate is to stabilise the level of German prices. Nonetheless, in terms of this narrowly domestic objective, is the Bundesbank's monetary policy still too restrictive? Without doubt, high German short-term interest rates are putting great pressure on other EMS members. Countries with a tradition of higher inflation, such as Britain and Italy, have seen their currencies fall to the bottom of their EMS bands. The value of the dollar, meanwhile, is being driven well below its purchasing power parity with the EMS bloc. If the dollar falls further, to well below DM1.40, US long-term interest rates could jump. If international investors come to believe that the dollar exchange rate is again heading for a free fall, they will demand a much higher yield on dollar assets, and that would threaten US economic recovery. The Bundesbank does not directly take into consideration such short-run international circumstances. Rather, its priority is to stabilise the D-Mark's future purchasing power. Moreover, containing German price inflation, the Bundesbank would argue, will indirectly benefit the rest of the world. German price stability represents the anchor necessary for the success of the EMS. In addition, maintaining Germany as a beacon of financial rectitude can benefit the world economy - for example, by putting pressure on the improvident US to be less inflationary. The Bundesbank's focus on price stability in Germany is thus here to stay. Consequently, if the German monetary authorities are to ease their policies, they must be convinced that they are violating their own mandate. And that is precisely what I believe the Bundesbank is doing. Present German monetary policy is unnecessarily tight for stabilising domestic prices in the longer term. By implication, the German and world economies are experiencing unnecessary financial trauma. First, consider Germany's rate of price inflation, running at 1 to 2 per cent measured by the producer price index, and at 3.5 to 4 per cent according to the consumer price index. While modest, these numbers are still too high if they continue indefinitely. To be consistent with a fixed exchange rate regime such as the EMS, all participating countries should aim for zero inflation in their producer price indices (ie, the price of tradeable goods). So the German authorities are right to be concerned. In west Germany, however, inflationary pressure has been temporarily increased by the system of collective wage bargaining and inflexible labour markets. Wages in east Germany will continue to rise quickly until 1994 when, in many sectors, they will equal those in the west. Although this wage pressure could explain the modest increases in producer prices now apparent, it need not persist. But wage pressure is not the only problem. Central bankers must divine inflationary pressure in the future by looking at current portents. Since the level of interest rates has proven ambiguous for this purpose, this leaves just two plausible yardsticks: the value of the D-Mark in the foreign exchange markets and growth in the German money supply. At DM1.40 to the dollar, the D-Mark is strong. Purchasing power parity would be about DM1.90 to the dollar. As every tourist knows, the German price level is high relative to the dollar area - and much of world trade is still invoiced in dollar terms. International commodity arbitrage should, therefore, eventually generate downward pressure on the German producer price index. German economists recall that the previous periods of significant D-Mark strength against the dollar - in 1973 and again in 1978 - were followed by substantial worldwide inflation. Yet the previous episodes were different. In the 1970s, inflationary pressure from the US was much higher than in Germany. In contrast, in 1992 inflationary pressure in the US is subdued and lower - both on the producer price (in the US, wholesale price) and consumer price measures. The second monetary indicator available is money growth. The monetary aggregate central to German decision-making is M3 (equivalent to M2 in the US), which is growing at about 9 per cent a year. The Bundesbank believes this portends future inflation. But there is good reason to believe that German M3 is sending out a false signal. In contrast to the US, Germany now faces an inverted yield curve in its bond markets: German short-term interest rates at about 9.75 per cent are considerably higher than long-term bond rates of 8.5 per cent or less. This unusual phenomenon means that German investors have incentives to reduce normal holdings of long-term bonds in favour of short-term bonds and interest-bearing bank deposits, and the last is the largest component of M3. Thus the temporary high growth in M3 in part reflects a shift in demand in German savers' portfolio preferences in favour of time and savings deposits. It need not reflect excess monetary creation. But that is not the end of the story. In the US, the yield curve is sloping upward unusually sharply. Very short-term interest rates of about 3.5 per cent are much less than long interest rates of about 7.5 per cent on safe government bonds. Pensioners and other individuals seeking higher yields are shifting from short-term interest-bearing bank deposits (and bonds) into longer-term bonds and equities. Thus growth in US M2 over the past year has been about zero. But this portfolio shift (which shows up as a rise in the velocity of M2) hardly reflects a tight money policy in the US; US policy has, in fact, been very easy. Because D-Mark assets have long been considered the principal alternative to holding dollars, we must also consider the two countries together. International currency substitution tends to magnify the bogus signals thrown out by the monetary indicators in each country. American investors see what they think is a pitifully low yield on short-term dollar bank deposits. They switch into short-term D-Mark deposits to capture yields that are more than two and a half times as great - perhaps with the help of international money-market funds. And German investors reduce their 'normal' holdings of short-term dollar deposits in favour of higher-yield D-Mark equivalents. International currency substitution, therefore, further magnifies monetary growth in Germany - while reducing it in the US. This is perfectly acceptable, provided neither the US Federal Reserve nor the Bundesbank puts any weight on M2/M3 growth as a monetary indicator of future inflation. Unfortunately, the Bundesbank thinks that its money supply is growing too fast, which explains its unnecessarily tight monetary stance. Very high short-term German interest rates are not only threatening the framework of intra-European and worldwide monetary co-operation. They are also undesirable from a domestic German perspective.

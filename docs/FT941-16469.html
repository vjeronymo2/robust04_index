			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / GM sets US profit target after turnround General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has set the target of achieving a net profit on its North American automotive operations in 1994 after three years of heavy losses, Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said last night. GM, which still lags the financial performance of Ford and Chrysler, its domestic US rivals, had achieved an operating break-even on its North American automotive operations in 1993 before interest and tax, he said. This represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) since 1991 and of Dollars 4.5bn in 1993 alone, Mr Smith said. Mr Smith, who became chief executive in November 1992 after a boardroom coup, warned that GM's North American production costs were still high, and that the group's balance sheet was 'still too weak'. However, GM's Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in Europe had remained 'significantly in the black', said Mr Rick Wagoner, GM finance director. GM Europe was the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe last year, in contrast to the heavy losses suffered by its rivals such as Volkswagen and Ford of Europe. It is understood to have achieved a profit of Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m in 1993, in spite of a fall of around 15 per cent in west European new car sales. Mr Wagoner said GM Europe's financial performance should improve in 1994.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bett Bros rises 36% to Pounds 5.9m Bett Brothers, the Dundee-based housebuilding, property and inns group, lifted pre-tax profits by 36 per cent, from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 5.93m, in the year to August 31. Last time there was a Pounds 2.4m credit from the refinancing of an associate. The improvement reflected increased activity and profit in all three divisions despite the tough trading environment, the directors said. Housebuilding contributed Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 18m) to sales and Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.5m) to operating profits. Property and investment turnover was Pounds 4.32m (Pounds 2.84m) with profits at Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.49m), while in pubs and hotels turnover and profits were Pounds 5.07m (Pounds 4.5m) and Pounds 1m (Pounds 942,000) respectively. Gearing of only 29 per cent formed a basis for expansion, directors said. They intended to invest in each of the operating areas, mainly in extending geographic coverage, particularly in central Scotland where a start had already been made in housing. Earnings per share increased to 32.56p (21.84p) and the dividend is raised from 2p to 4.5p via a proposed final of 3.25p (1.5p).</p>

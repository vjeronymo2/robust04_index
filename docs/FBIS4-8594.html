			<p>BFN     [Text] After a prolonged medical consultation, it was  announced at a news conference at the Council of Ministers that  in the last three to four days an acute illness developed in  Professor Berov's liver. There are tendencies toward  improvement in the clinical and laboratory indices.    The patient has slight hepatitis but with a tendency to heal  within a brief period of time. There are two versions about the  basic cause: Either a mechanical clogging of the gall bladder  vessels, which occurred and passed rapidly, or a light form of  an acute hepatitis virus. This was announced by  gastroenterologist Professor Konstantin Chernev. A specific  blood test of the patient will be carried out abroad. The result  will be known within several days.</p>

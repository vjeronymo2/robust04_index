			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: FOOD SCIENTISTS APPROVE PORK IN OVEN . . . UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS  </P> <P> Is it OK to microwave pork roasts?  </P> <P> In the beginning we were told no, that pork failed to cook evenly or fully in  the microwave and, therefore, might not be safe to eat.  </P> <P> But food scientists have recently announced that pork can be safely microwaved  if each of the following conditions is met:  </P> <P>  -- The container must be tightly covered -- with a lid, not with vented  plastic wrap. Covering pork, researchers have found, means that it will cook  more thoroughly and evenly.  </P> <P>  -- The roast must be begun briefly on HIGH, then finished on MEDIUM, which  ensures a slow, uniform cooking. It also ensures juicier meat.  </P> <P>  -- The roast must be inverted and rotated 180 degrees when half cooked.  </P> <P>  -- The roast must reach an internal temperature of 170 degrees and then be  allowed to stand 10 minutes. Always spot-check the internal temperature in  several areas before removing a pork roast from the microwave, then again after  it has stood 10 minutes. At 170 degrees the meat will be succulent and utterly  safe.  </P> <P> As for which cuts of pork microwave best, top-quality loins about four inches  in diameter, either bone-in or boned and rolled, in the three- to four-pound  category microwave splendidly. To figure the number of servings, allow  one-third to one-half pound boneless pork per serving and one-half to  three-quarters pound of bone-in meat.  </P> <P> ROAST LOIN OF PORK  </P> <P> 1 (3- to 4-pound) pork roast  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> Crushed garlic  </P> <P> Rubbed sage, crumbled leaf marjoram and rosemary or thyme, optional  </P> <P> Trim away all but 1/4 inch exterior fat from roast, then score lightly.  Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and then rub with  crushed garlic and rubbed sage, crumbled leaf marjoram, rosemary or thyme. Let  roast stand 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature before microwaving.  Refrigerator-cold meats are less likely to cook evenly.  </P> <P> Do not salt roast. Salt accelerates heating and can actually toughen meat.  Measure diameter of roast, then weigh to determine precise microwave time.  </P> <P> Place roast, fat side down, on rack in deep casserole. Insert microwave-safe  meat thermometer in center of largest muscle touching neither fat nor bone. Or  use automatic temperature probe according to manufacturer's directions. (Probe  is surest way to tell when pork is done although method is not recommended for  roasts of less than 2 pounds.)  </P> <P> Cover casserole with tight-fitting lid and microwave pork on HIGH (100% power)  5 minutes. Reduce power to MEDIUM (50% power) and continue microwaving,  allowing 14 to 16 minutes per pound for bone-in roasts and 15 to 17 minutes per  pound for boned and rolled.  </P> <P> At half time, turn roast fat side up and rotate casserole 180 degrees. Continue  microwaving on MEDIUM until internal temperature reaches 170 degrees.  </P> <P> Let pork roast stand, still covered, 10 minutes. Test temperature in several  places. If not at least 170 degrees throughout, cover and continue microwaving  on MEDIUM in 5-minute increments.  </P> <P> Variation: For Pineapple Sweet-Sour Pork, microwave pork to 170 degrees as  directed. Drain off drippings and spread 1/2 cup Pineapple Sweet-Sour Sauce  over pork. Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM 5 minutes, basting with additional  sauce at half time. Let roast stand, covered, 10 minutes. Transfer to hot  platter, spoon some casserole sauce on top and serve.  </P> <P> Pineapple Sweet-Sour Sauce  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can crushed pineapple  </P> <P> Pineapple juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup pineapple jam  </P> <P> 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cider vinegar  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 clove garlic, peeled and crushed  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon prepared spicy brown mustard  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cold water  </P> <P> Drain pineapple, reserving liquid. Add enough pineapple juice to equal 1 cup.  Combine pineapple juice, jam, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, mustard  and ginger in 6-cup measure. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 4 1/2  to 5 minutes, stirring at half time, until boiling.  </P> <P> Combine cornstarch with water. Blend into pineapple mixture and microwave,  uncovered, on HIGH 1 minute, stirring at half time, until mixture boils and  thickens. Add pineapple and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-LOW (30% power) 2  minutes. Makes 2 1/2 cups.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

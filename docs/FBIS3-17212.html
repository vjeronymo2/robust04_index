			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Glod and Larisa </F> Lazar: "Belarus: Who Will Be First President"]    [Text] After the Belarus Supreme Soviet approved the  decision of the comptroller's commission on the results of the  deputies' vote on the section of the new draft constitution  providing for the introduction of the institution of the  presidency, no one doubts any longer the fact of the replacement  of the republic's state structure. It is true that the draft of  the new constitution as a whole still has to be adopted. But  everyone understands very well that this is only a formality.    Moreover, it is already known when it will be feasible to  hold nationwide elections of the first president. The deputies  cite the very earliest date -- 26 July this year. The first  president will have great powers. He is the head of state and  of executive power.    Already there are disputes in full swing in the  parliamentary  corridors over the figure of the future president. By law a  candidate president can be nominated only by at least 70  people's deputies or at least 100,000 voters through the  collection of signatures. Political parties and associations do  not have this right. But the most influential political forces  will find the opportunity to use either the former or the latter  option.    The disposition of political forces in Belarus is now as  follows. At one extreme is the People's Movement of Belarus  [PMB] and at the other the Belarusian National Front [BNF]. And  between them is the "Spring-94" association. So far there is  only total clarity about the BNF. This organization is gambling  on its undisputed leader Zenon Poznyak. The PMB -- the most  mass-based movement -- has still not found its bearings.  Perhaps it will support the present premier, Vyacheslav Kebich,  perhaps Aleksandr Lukashenko, who made a name for himself in the  post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet anticorruption commission.    The scenario whereby the Belarus Party of Communists, which  is a collective member of the PMB, will nominate its own  candidate, Viktor Chikin. As for the democratic-centrist  "Spring-94" bloc, it could launch an election campaign in favor  either of Stanislav Shushkevich or Gennadiy Karpenko.    The Belarus Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology has  already conducted the first poll of rural inhabitants. Of those  polled 20.8 percent stated they would vote for Aleksandr  Lukashenko. So far he is the obvious leader in the countryside.  This deputy's rating rose sharply after his speeches in the  Supreme Soviet exposing corruption. By creating the image of a  fighter against the mafia, Aleksandr Lukashenko has been a  crowd-pleaser, as they say, stating that the mafia and its  patrons are to blame for everything.    It is true that so far the only result of his commission's  work has been the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav  Shushkevich, toward whom Lukashenko had a personal antipathy  which he did not hide. But the fighter against the mafia, as he  himself has stated, has a file on two dozen top officials from  the Council of Ministers and structures directly subordinate to  the government. Naturally, having made these facts public  Aleksandr Lukashenko will undoubtedly gain additional points in  the fight for the president's seat.    Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich are almost  equally popular among rural inhabitants. Today 9.3 percent of  those polled are prepared to vote for the former and 8.1 percent  for the latter. It is true that the head of government has gone  for broke, gambling on the unification of the monetary systems  of Belarus and Russia. If the union of this two slav countries  succeed, the moderate politician will of course be riding high.  If not then perhaps only a miracle will save the premier.    Zenon Poznyak was ranked fourth with 6.1 percent by the  Belarusian peasants in their unique popularity rating. But the  BNF leader's recent political actions -- his statements about  wanting Belarus to withdraw from the CIS, his charges of  imperialism against the Russians, and the ban on professions --  will hardly give him any chance of success. Gennadiy Karpenko,  the leader of the Party of National Accord, which is something  like the Russian "Civic Union," and Viktor Chikin close the list  of contenders, with scarcely more than 1 percent of those polled  supporting them.    Of course, these are only the first reports and they will  change with time. It is not ruled out that other contenders  could join in the struggle for the president's seat on the crest  of the wave of general dissatisfaction and lack of confidence in  the authorities. But the overwhelming majority of political  scientists today believe that the real struggle will develop  only between three candidates: Vyacheslav Kebich, Aleksandr  Lukashenko, and Stanislav Shushkevich.  <H5>  Meanwhile.... </H5>   Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the parliamentary opposition,  stated that the introduction of the post of president in Belarus  is one stage in establishing an authoritarian regime and  restoring in full the previous power and previous relations.  "The draft law on the election of the Belarus president is  compiled in such a way that only one candidate could be  nominated -- Kebich. In practice not a single candidate can be  nominated at the Supreme Soviet and not a single one can be  nominated from the people -- according to the draft law.  Because at the Supreme Soviet to nominate a candidate you must  collect 70 signatures (it is virtually ruled out that any deputy  other than Kebich would collect as many). As for signatures  from the people, it is proposed that 100,000 should be collected  in only two weeks. Considering the procedure which is proposed  it is in practice impossible to collect signatures in that time."    Nonetheless the BNF council has examined the question of the  development of the political situation and the prospects of  elections in Belarus. BNF leaders believe that their  organization has real chances of success but only under  conditions where voters are faced with a tough choice: either a  representative of the opposition or a representative of the old  nomenklatura. In their opinion a third candidate and third way  are a threat. Zenon Poznyak said that Stanislav Shushkevich  specifically presents a threat to the BNF's prospects. "There  cannot be a third way," Poznyak said, "either for independence  or against it." The front will no longer support Shushkevich  and it is highly likely it will campaign against it.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo approves imports of rice THE Japanese government yesterday officially approved plans to import rice so as to cope with the worst harvest since 1945, after an unusually cool summer and a spate of typhoons. Mr Eijiro Hata, agriculture minister, yesterday said plans to import 200,000 tonnes of rice by year-end, as an initial instalment, were among the government's emergency measures along with financial relief for farmers. The decision comes ahead of the visit by Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, on October 10-13. The US government is calling for Japan to use the rice shortage as an opportunity to open its rice market. However, Tokyo yesterday stressed that the emergency step would not lead to a liberalisation of the country's rice market. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the emergency imports were separate from the rice issue being discussed within the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The government said the rice harvest index was at a record low of 80, against an annual average of 100. Production for the year is expected to fall to 8m tonnes, from an annual average of 10m. Agriculture Ministry officials have suggested that more than 1m tonnes would be imported.</p>

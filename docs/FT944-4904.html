			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices fall from Friday's highs US Treasury prices fell from Friday's highs yesterday as the yield curve continued to flatten. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 95 3/32 , yielding 7.925 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/4 lower at 99 13/32 , yielding 7.560 per cent. Most analysts attributed yesterday's declines to a slight correction from Friday's highs rather than to a reversal of the more bullish tone the market has adopted of late. On Friday, the long bond price was up more than a point and the yield fell back below 8 per cent. Many economists believe the market has at last accepted the Federal Reserve's promises to take a tough stance against inflation. One sign of this is the steadily flattening yield curve, which is an indication that the market expects an economic slowdown. The difference between the yield on the two-year bond and the 30-year bond held near 36 basis points yesterday morning, down from 120 points in October and 210 points this time last year. News that sales of single-family home sales increased slightly also helped push prices lower mid-morning. The Commerce Department reported sales of such houses increased by 1.3 per cent in October, whereas economists had expected a slight decrease. A report on car sales showed the November figure only slightly above economists' expectations. While long-dated government bonds in many European markets drifted sideways in calm trading, the shorter-dated sectors of their yield curves - notably in the UK and Germany - remained under pressure amid continued talk of monetary tightening. In the UK, the short end of the yield curve was depressed by jitters ahead of today's parliamentary vote on raising VAT on domestic fuel. 'Some people are worried that if the government loses the VAT vote, the lack of fiscal tightening will have to be compensated by monetary tightening,' said Mr Adrian James of NatWest Markets. The proximity of tomorrow's monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, exacerbated fears of an imminent base rate rise, although many dealers do not expect another move until early next year. At the longer end, prices softened ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts due 2005. Dealers reported little investor demand for the issue. 'The market will probably have to cheapen up a bit more to generate any client interest,' said one. The March long gilt futures contract eased by  13/32 to 101 and the March short-sterling future fell 0.16 to 92.63. German bonds closed lower in a session dominated by roll-over activity in the Bund future ahead of the December contract's expiry. The short end was depressed by renewed talk that the interest rate easing cycle has ended, and by forecasts from Salomon Brothers that Germany will start tightening in the first half of 1995. Most dealers are not expecting any monetary policy changes at Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, especially after council member Mr Gerd Haeusler yesterday said that the central bank would stick to fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements in the near term. The March Bund future on Liffe ended around 91.20, down 0.27 on the day. The March three-month euromark future fell by 0.10 to 94.56. French bonds continued their recent out-performance of the German market, with their 10-year yield spread over Bunds narrowing to 49 basis points from 52 on Friday. However, some observers said that trend could be reversed soon. 'We believe that, given the political risk premium associated with French assets, this spread-tightening has been overdone and we look for this to widen over the next few weeks to around 75 basis points,' said analysts at Yamaichi International.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Maxwell schemes offered up to Pounds 300m A group of investment banks and former professional advisers to pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell has offered to pay between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m in a 'global settlement' of all outstanding claims. Yesterday trustees of the schemes and their advisers met Sir Peter Webster of the Maxwell Pensioners Trust who told them of the offers he had received. Sir Peter had set a deadline of November 4 by which time all offers of settlement had to be made. Those which did not make 'credible' offers could expect legal proceedings against them to continue. Trustees had hoped for an offer closer to the Pounds 448m estimated to have disappeared from the schemes. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mirror Group Pension Scheme, the only one of the former Maxwell schemes which still has a solvent sponsor, could scupper the global settlement if an agreement is not reached with the Department of Social Security. The issue is whether the department is prepared to waive the requirement that each scheme repay the government for the portion of State Earnings Related Pensions (Serps) which has been paid through tax receipts since 1992. The department said yesterday: 'We can defer the state scheme premiums but we are not going to write them off.' In order to allow the Maxwell pensioners to receive Serps, each scheme would have had to pay a premium to the government. The aggregate value of these premiums is Pounds 115m. In October 1992 the government said it would defer collection of the premiums in order to allow time for recovery of assets from other sources. It is understood, however, that the department intends to reclaim these payments if the schemes recover assets.</p>

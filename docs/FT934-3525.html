			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Electrolux may sell US subsidiary Electrolux, one of world's leading white goods manufacturers, said yesterday it was considering the sale of Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment, its US subsidiary, as part of a strategy to streamline its structure. The group has decided that the business, which it acquired with its purchase of White Consolidated in March 1986, was not a core activity. White Consolidated, said: 'Electrolux is primarily a consumer goods company and Blaw-Knox does not have any relation to any of our other operations.' Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank has been retained as an adviser. Blaw-Knox is based in Mattoon, Illinois and has 700 employees. Its sales in 1993 are expected to be more than Dollars 80m. The company is the leading manufacturer of asphalt paving machinery in the US and has large European operations based in Rochester in the UK. Electrolux has experienced tough market conditions in 1993, particularly in Europe. But the weaker Swedish krona and restructuring helped drive a 31 per cent increase in profits in the first nine months to SKr961m (Dollars 119m). AEG, the German electronics group, declined to comment on reports that it was planning to sell its household appliances group to Electrolux. AEG's supervisory board meets today. Electrolux last year took a 10 per cent stake in the AEG unit.</p>

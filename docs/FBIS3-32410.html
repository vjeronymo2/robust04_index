Quercia talked with PMDB party president Deputy Luiz  Henrique da Silveira (SC) [Santa Catalina] and with Deputy  Tarciso Delgado (MG) [Minas Gerais], the PMDB leader in the  Chamber of Deputies. He told them that the talks between the  two leaders of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and  PDT [Democratic Workers Party] in search of an alliance are  valid, but argued that the party must have its own candidate.    "If other parties want to support the PMDB candidate, fine,"  the former governor and former PMDB president said.    Quercia said it is important to achieve unity around one  candidate, and without feeling intimidated suggested a PMDB  convention or a primary to chose its candidate, in case someone  else wants to represent the PMDB at the presidential race    He said that he is a PMDB soldier, that he will participate  in an election by the convention and win it. The ideal thing is  to get consensus. He said that if it is not possible we should  have a convention. At a convention, as the saying goes, the  most powerful cries least. He added that whoever has the force  and support will become the candidate. We could also have a  primary. A person who fails to win a primary cannot be any  party's candidate.    Quercia said he has taken the initiative to begin preparing  a  development project for the country. He criticized the PT  [Workers Party] government program, characterizing it as  "outdated," poked fun at Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio  Fleury's ambition to become a PMDB candidate, and again  criticized Itamar Franco's administration characterizing it as  "weak and incompetent."    "The government must have the necessary political force in  Congress to have its programs approved," Quercia said.</p>

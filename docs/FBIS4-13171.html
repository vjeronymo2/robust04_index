			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA) -- The Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators today began a new round of negotiations to overcome  obstacles preventing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement for Palestinian self-rule.    The talks began with a separate meeting between Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser  and head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, and General  Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli  delegation, to draw up the agenda for this round of  negotiations, which is expected to continue until Thursday.    In a statement to correspondents beforehand, Dr. Sha'th  said:  We will do our best to make this round the last. He noted that  they will continue to discuss the topics discussed in previous  rounds, particularly those pertaining to security and water.  Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that agreement will be reached  with the Israeli delegation on these issues.    Regarding the impending meeting between Palestinian  president  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in  Bucharest on Friday, Dr. Sha'th said its original purpose was  not to try to overcome the obstacles in the current negotiations  in Cairo. It will take place on the sidelines of the world  economic conference, which will discuss economic cooperation in  the Middle East in the era of peace.    The Security, Civilian, and Legal Affairs Committees are  expected to meet later today.</p>

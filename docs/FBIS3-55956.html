[Kozyrev] It took a step in the right direction; that is,  the idea of Partnership for Peace has been approved, something  which essentially is based also on our proposals. The effect is  that now, instead of a quantitative membership expansion of NATO  eastward, one should be occupied with the practical aspects of  interaction, both between Russia and NATO, and between the  Central European states and NATO, within the context, say, of  joint maneuvers, practicing peacekeeping operations in areas of  conflicts, programs of converting military production. This is  practical work instead of membership.    Of course, there is a small difference of emphasis. NATO  looks at things from its own viewpoint [NATO smotrit ot sebya]  -- NATO-centrism--and they say this will be a period of  preparation for joining NATO. Perhaps that will be the case.  Let us see at the end of this period, which will be a fairly  long and eventful one. It is perfectly possible that Russia  will also decide, in the end, to join NATO.    Another scenario is possible, that NATO will be modified and  merged into some broader European structure.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NIGHTMARE FLIGHT LEAVES NONSMOKERS FUMING  </P> <P> What could be worse for a nonsmoker than the old days when airlines had no  designated smoking sections?  </P> <P> It's worse when the airline has a smoking section and puts a dozen nonsmokers  in the last two rows of the plane, behind 60 cigarette-puffing die-hards,  including a Middle Eastern trio with foul-smelling brown cigarettes that would  put the fattest cigar to shame on the noxious fumes scale.  </P> <P> Add 10 or 12 smokers from the nonsmoking section who come back at least once an  hour, trade seats with fellow smokers, puff a fast couple of cigarettes and  then head back to their relatively clean-air seating farther forward.  </P> <P> Schedule this punishment on a transatlantic flight from which there is no  escape and be sure the plane is full. In fact, hold the plane an extra 20  minutes at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris to accommodate three standby  passengers who arrived at the last minute.  </P> <P> In doing that, lose the jetliner's place in line and wait on the ground for  another 90 minutes after getting a new takeoff time. That ensures that the poor  smokers will really need a hit once the plane is aloft.  </P> <P> This is not a worst-case scenario, but a real situation aboard a certain  airline's flight from Paris to Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Checked in Early  </P> <P> We had no seat assignments, but we checked in a full two hours ahead of flight  time and were told that there were no seats left in the nonsmoking section. We  were told to go ahead and take a seat assignment in the smoking section to be  assured of getting seats at all, and to ask at the gate about getting our seats  changed.  </P> <P> We asked at the gate as soon as it opened, an hour later. We were told that it  was too late to do anything about it in the terminal and to ask the flight  attendant when we got on board if we could change our seats.  </P> <P> When we boarded the plane we asked the flight attendant for seats in the  nonsmoking section.  </P> <P> She said: "Oh, they've made it our problem, huh?" She said to take our seats  and ask the section attendant for a change. "There's a family of four behind  you who are also nonsmokers," she said. "We've known about this problem since  Geneva."  </P> <P> "So, basically, we're just supposed to keep agitating?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Oh, no!" she said. "Please, that won't get you anywhere."  </P> <P> Nothing got us anywhere except in the seats we were assigned, behind the  smokers. But in front of a Swiss family of four, which included two medium-size  children.  </P> <P> We took our seats and read the fine print on the boarding pass, which declares:  "(This airline) provides smoking and nonsmoking sections aboard flights  scheduled for more than two hours. Assignment of no-smoking area seats to  standby passengers and to passengers who present themselves at the boarding  gates less than 20 minutes before scheduled departure time is subject to  availability."  </P> <P> But on this flight, all no-smoking seats were subject to availability. The  airline did not accommodate nonsmokers who arrived two hours early.  </P> <P> The flight attendants did ask a few people to volunteer to change their seats,  especially for the Swiss family of four with their long, mournful faces, but no  one was willing to budge. In the interests of getting background for this  story, I chatted with a flight attendant while we waited for takeoff.  </P> <P> "It's a mess," she said. "They should take better care of it at the gate. They  should at least move the nonsmokers to the front of the smoking section instead  of putting them way in the rear. On this flight we have several married couples  split up, including a pregnant woman who wanted to sit with her husband. But at  least we were able to find a single seat for her in a nonsmoking section.  </P> <P> "It's a problem in Europe only," she said. "They don't really take it  seriously."  </P> <P> As the flight wore on, people standing in the long lines to use the toilets  were smoking cigarettes. One young woman smoked three in a row, sitting on a  man's lap, before returning to her seat in another section. A flight attendant  finally asked her to trade seats with a complainer in the smoking section. She  left in a huff, only to return within the hour for another cigarette.  </P> <P> We coughed, sneezed and sniffled. As aversion therapy, it worked. I'll never  fly that airline again!  </P> <P> The airline's vice president of public affairs said he is not aware of any such  problems and that this was the first nonsmoker's complaint that had been  brought to his attention. "Normally, we get complaints from smokers who had  their seats taken away," he said. "I've never heard of this problem before."  </P> <P> The airline's policy, he said, is to comply with U.S. law, separating smokers  and nonsmokers on international as well as domestic flights. "Unless you  arrived late or were on standby, there is no reason why you shouldn't have been  given a seat in the no-smoking section.  </P> <P> "This was human error," he said. "Somebody didn't follow procedures."  </P> <P> The attendant at check-in said, "I'll be glad when they make the whole flight  nonsmoking."  </P> <P> I agree. Meanwhile, I would settle for smokers' seat assignments to be given  starting in the back row and going forward instead of trying to mystically  divine how many smokers there will be and piling in the nonsmokers behind them.  </P> <P> And while we're at it, smoking privileges should be limited to those who asked  for assigned seats in the smoking section. People who want to sit in clean air  should not be allowed to add to the pollution elsewhere.  </P></p>

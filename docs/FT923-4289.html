			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Ambulance trust bid wins backing PROPOSALS by Durham ambulance service to become a self-governing trust next April won the backing of the Northern Regional Health Authority yesterday even though the Northumbria service, already a trust, had proposed a merger with the Durham and Cleveland services. The health authority, which described the Durham application as sound from a financial and management point of view, was also influenced by strong support during the public consultation for Durham's proposal. A spokesman for the authority said that it did not feel this was an appropriate time to consider merger plans, although it could not rule out such a move in the future. It said it did not have the information to comment on the validity of Northumbria Ambulance Service's claim that its proposed merger with Durham and Cleveland would save Pounds 2.4m a year without cuts in provision. Durham's application was among 11 approved by the authority yesterday; all will go to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, for her endorsement. Cumbria ambulance service was another of the 11. The Durham decision follows more than a year's speculation over the service's future.</p>

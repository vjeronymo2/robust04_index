			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Car output declines by 1% CAR PRODUCTION in October fell 1 per cent from the same month a year before as declining sales of new cars in continental Europe affected UK output for export markets. Export production in October fell 20.6 per cent to 55,001 while output for the domestic market rose 27 per cent to 61,425 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Overall, UK car output in October totalled 116,426 compared with 117,647 in the same month a year before. Production of commercial vehicles, still depressed, fell 4.1 per cent in October to 18,687 from 19,486 a year before. Commercial vehicle production in the first 10 months of the year has fallen by 25.2 per cent to 160,218. UK carmakers continue to perform much more strongly than most of Europe. Output in the first 10 months of the year, at 1,160,193, was 7.5 per cent higher than a year before compared with steep falls in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. UK car output is being increased by production at the new plants under development by Honda and Toyota. Recovery in domestic new-car demand has also helped. UK sales of new cars have risen 12.1 per cent in the first 10 months of the year compared with a 15.3 per cent decline in the overall west European market.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Serif makes progress with losses cut to Pounds 1.2m Serif, the USM-quoted specialist printing and packaging group which in November launched a Pounds 4.9m rights issue, yesterday reported a cut in pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 1.23m for 1993. The company said at the time of the cash call that without the rights, its ability to trade would depend on the support of its bankers, which might not be forthcoming. Serif said yesterday that the proceeds had been utilised to reduce creditors and provide additional working capital. Turnover totalled Pounds 18.8m, a decline of Pounds 2.6m, of which Pounds 2m was due to the disposal of the bingo activity in 1992. Losses per share came out at 3.9p (6.2p). Comparisons have been restated for FRS 3. Sales at Spottiswoode Ballantyne were affected by lower than expected demand in the first part of the year, but margins improved in the second half and benefit was gained from the new web press commissioned in June. Although sales of security products and packaging at Cowells increased during the year, margins were hit by production disruption, caused by difficulties in commissioning new machinery for print-ing and plastic card production.</p>

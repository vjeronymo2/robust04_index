			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Director Alan Parker, who has two Golden Globe award nominations for  "Mississippi Burning," has signed a three-year production and development  agreement with Tri-Star Pictures. Tri-Star will have exclusive, first-look  rights to film projects that Parker develops. The deal also enables Parker to  undertake "personal projects at modest budgets," Tri-Star said Wednesday.  Although "Mississippi Burning" is an Orion release, Tri-Star distributed  Parker's controversial 1987 film "Angel Heart." Parker also has plans to direct  a film version of "Les Miserables" for the studio. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

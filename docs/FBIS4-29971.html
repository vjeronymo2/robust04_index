			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- A  two-day-long conference of the largest public and political  organization of the Mongolian Democratic Union [name of  organization as received] has been finished here and heated  debates being launched but the conference has not resulted in  great changes in the composition of the leadership.    Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union has remained T.  Elbegdorj who has been relieved recently of the duties of a  member of the parliament according to his own request. After  April's political hunger strike being arranged with the purpose  of having the government (?resign) according to a number of  members of the union, the prestige of the organization has  undermined and there is necessity for renewing the activities of  the organization. For this aim there has been set up a group  for renovation of the activities of the Mongolian Democratic  Union. Apparently the initiative group and its supporters  failed to have T. Elbegdorj and some other members of the board  having been viewed to be the major instigators of the hunger  strike entailing the undermining of the authority of the  Mongolian Democratic Union, replaced during the work of the  conference.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once properly calibrated, the transducers should continue to perform accurately unless the equipment malfunctions or breaks down. However, the bin sensors can be recalibrated at any time to provide either more or less accurate readings. NMFS does not intend to monitor the use of bin sensors by requiring that only observers have access to the control panel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Representatives of a bin-sensor manufacturer suggested that each bin should contain five transducers, each of which would take an individual reading of the height of fish in the bin directly below the transducer. Transducers can be calibrated individually. Therefore, in order to verify that all transducers are reading accurately, hatches would have to be placed in the overhead of the bin next to each transducer so that the observer could drop a tape measure and check the distance against that recorded by the bin sensor. NMFS believes that this procedure would be burdensome to the processor vessel operator because of the necessity to place up to five hatches in each bin to verify transducer readings, and that it would be time-consuming and difficult for the observer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manufacturer's representative also suggested that the information from the initial calibration of the system, such as the distance from each transducer to the bottom of the bin, could be used to determine whether the system had been recalibrated. NMFS is concerned that the bin sensors could be recalibrated, and then changed back to the original calibration without the knowledge of the observer. Although NMFS believes that bin sensors could accurately estimate the height of fish in a bin, NMFS is not satisfied that observers have the capability or the time to monitor the system to assure accurate information about the volume of fish in enclosed and inaccessible bins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An opening in the top or overhead of a bin through which a tape measure could be lowered into the bin should be considered as an alternative method for determining the average height of fish in bins that are not visually accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS believes that reliable estimates of the volume of fish in a fish bin must be determined from averaging the height of fish in a bin from several locations in the bin. A single reading at the center of the bin may not provide accurate information if the fish are unevenly distributed throughout the bin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A narrow vertical window extending the full height of one wall of the bin with marks on the outside of the bin should be considered as an alternative method for determining the average height of fish in bins that are not visually accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This suggestion would provide the observer with a height reading at only one location in the bin which, for reasons discussed above, is not sufficient to determine the average height of fish in the bin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The use of scales to weigh groundfish harvests is a costly alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS recognizes that a marine scale capable of accurately weighing groundfish harvests will cost between $30,000 and $50,000 per scale. This does not include the cost of installation and maintenance. This rule allows processors to choose either modification of their bins to accommodate volumetric estimates or scales to weigh groundfish harvests in the CDQ fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is not feasible for processor vessel operators to weigh each species or species group of fish separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule does not require weight by species or species group for management of the CDQ pollock fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that this rule is necessary for the conservation and management of the groundfish fisheries off Alaska and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

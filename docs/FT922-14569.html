			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Black plans more TV investment MR CONRAD Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group, is planning to make further investments in television. The newspaper group was a member of the losing Daybreak consortium for the commercial breakfast television franchise last year, but has a 5 per cent stake in Carlton Television which won the London weekday franchise. In the Daily Telegraph's annual report, Mr Black said: 'The possibility of further investment in television will be pursued.' The Daily Telegraph has had talks with a number of potential bidders for Channel 5, the new television channel capable of reaching three quarters of the UK population. These include Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian businessman. The invitation to bid and the precise terms of the Channel 5 licence will be published by the Independent Television Commission later this month. Mr Black has had talks with Mr Moses Znaimer, the Canadian broadcaster who set up City TV in Toronto. Mr Znaimer is to be chief executive of Five TV, a bidder for the Channel 5 franchise planning to specialise in local news, films and music. However there is still a considerable degree of scepticism in the Daily Telegraph about whether Channel 5 is a viable financial prospect because the winner will have to pay for the retuning of millions of video recorders and satellite receivers. At present they use the frequencies that Channel 5 will broadcast on and the new channel will cause considerable interference.</p>

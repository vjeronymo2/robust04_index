			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iran-Azerbaijan: New Contracts"] </F>   [Text] Negotiations conducted in Tehran among  representatives of oil companies of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and Azerbaijan Republic ended with the signing of two contracts.  According to them, Azerbaijan oil producers must perform  engineering-research and seismographic-exploratory work in the  southeastern part of the Caspian Sea valued at a total of more  than $3 million.    As Azerbaijan State Petroleum Company Vice President  Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, Doctor of Geological-Mineralogical  Sciences, announced, business relations with the National  Petroleum Company of the neighboring state began to develop at  the end of the 1960's when Azerbaijani geophysicists did  research needed by the Iranians for studying the geological  structure of minerals in the southern part of the Caspian Sea.    The Azerbaijani special ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans,  which are equipped with everything necessary for performing the  entire complex of work under the new contracts between the oil  companies of the two neighboring Caspian states, will soon  depart for the southern shores of the Caspian Sea.</p>

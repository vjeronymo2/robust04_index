			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo to write off losses at finance unit SUMITOMO Corporation, the Japanese trading house, is to write off unspecified securities losses incurred by a financial subsidiary which had invested Y80bn (Dollars 741m) through special trading accounts to supplement core profits. Many Japanese companies, including trading houses, had come to regard stock investment as a 'new profit centre' during the late 1980s, but have since suffered bruising losses, most often on tokkin, or specified money trusts. Tokkin became popular during the 1980s, as capital gains could be converted to income, prompting some companies to use the trusts for investment in risky stocks. However, the fall of Tokyo stock prices in 1990 meant that investors suffered large losses. Sumitomo said the subsidiary, SC Finance, had appraisal losses of about Y20bn at the end of March, when the Nikkei index closed at 18,591, far below the market peak of 38,915.87 of late December 1989. The index closed at 20,105.71 yesterday. The move by Sumitomo follows Mitsubishi Corporation's rescue earlier this year of a subsidiary, MC Finance, which had accumulated losses of Y28bn on securities investments of about Y70bn. Mitsubishi established MC Finance to act as a banker for subsidiaries, borrowing large sums from banks at discount rates and passing on the savings to smaller members of the group. The company was later encouraged to generate income through stock investment. Sumitomo did not say what impact the write-off would have on pre-tax profit for the first half, which ended yesterday, but the company is expected to sell other stocks to cover the losses incurred. In the year ended in March, Sumitomo reported an appraisal loss on securities holdings of Y18.7bn and had a special profit of Y12.9bn on a property sale.</p>

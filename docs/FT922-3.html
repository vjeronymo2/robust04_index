			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading DEALERS in the derivatives reported a volatile session in which stock index futures relinquished earlier gains due to a lack of features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was recorded at 2,588, a premium of 14, which dealers took to be a sign of a strong session ahead and helped send the underlying cash market higher. The positive mood, however, did not last as independent traders turned sellers, causing a reversal in the September future - although there were few takers after the first of the sell orders. The contract continued its downward direction throughout the afternoon, once again becoming a factor in the reversed direction of the cash market. Not even the early rally on Wall Street could lift September from its retreat and it reached a low of 2,542 just before the close. A slight bounce helped September end at 2,553, down 25 from the previous session and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover, at around 7,000 lots, was poor. Traded options also experienced a poor day, with a meagre 25,834 contracts dealt. There were 8,435 lots transacted in the FT-SE option. Among stock options, BP saw 2,892 contracts traded and British Steel 1,979.</p>

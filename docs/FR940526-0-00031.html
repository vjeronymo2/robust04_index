This action requires a visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment, and adjustments, if necessary; and a visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by reports of smoke emanating from the lavatory due to overheating of the fan venturi motor. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;69&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., 3 Bishops Square, St. Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE, United Kingdom.

The CAA advises it has received reports of smoke emanating from the lavatory in the rear of the cabin while several airplanes were being prepared for departure. Investigation revealed that the venturi fan motor overheated due to insufficient clearance between the motor and the adjacent sound insulation and wiring. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin SB 21&hyph;A150, dated February 22, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms) and adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This alert service bulletin also describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The CAA classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory and issued a British airworthiness directive in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These airplane models are manufactured in the United Kingdom and are type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. This AD requires a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms) and adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This AD also requires a one-time visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

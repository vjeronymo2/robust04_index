			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Aitken Hume chief executive resigns Ziad Idilby, the chairman and chief executive of Aitken Hume who was appointed three years ago to resolve boardroom dissention, is to resign from the banking group next month. Idilby, aged 57, insisted his parting from Aitken Hume was entirely amicable, and is based on the fact that the tasks he took on when he was appointed have now been satisfactorily completed. Over the past three years he has masterminded a wide-ranging rationalisation programme which left the former international financial services group with an indepenently chaired banking operation in the UK and Guernsey. 'I am pleased to say I have worked myself out of a job,' he said yesterday. Aitken Hume has raised an estimated Pounds 26m net cash through disposals including the US fund management subsidiary, National Securities &amp; Research Corporation, and the financial services group Bachmann. It is now likely the group will seek to return that cash to shareholders rather than use it for acquisition or expansion. Aitken Hume is more than 60 per cent controlled by the Said Trust, owned by Syrian-born businessman, Mr Wafic Said, and Allied Group, a Hong Kong financial conglomerate. Both shareholders are represented on the board, although there has been speculation over the fate of two directors connected to Allied following criticism of that company by Hong Kong regulators.</p>

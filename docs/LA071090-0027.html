			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Days of Thunderous Hype: Tom Cruise isn't slowing down in his quest to pump  some box-office gas into his "Days of Thunder" film. He appeared Sunday on  "Hangin' With Hollywood," a national teen radio show on KIIS-FM (102.7) hosted  by Hollywood Hamilton.  </P> <P> Cruise, who reportedly had not done many radio interviews in hyping his  previous films, is turning to the medium more and more to publicize the film,  which is receiving a less-than-thunderous reception from audiences and critics.  The star talked extensively with Hamilton, but refused to discuss his breakup  with wife Mimi Rogers or his current involvement with "Days" co-star Nicole  Kidman. Cruise told how he deals with fans who follow him around while he's  driving in his black Porsche: "I either pull over and give them the autograph,  or I lose them." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

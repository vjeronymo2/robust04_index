			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the end of the Russian Foreign Minister talks in  Prague, our correspondent David Stahlavsky obtained Andrey  Kozyrev's exclusive answer to the following question:    [Stahlavsky] I asked the Russian foreign minister about the  assumption voiced by some Western newspapers that the division  of the world into two blocs or, in other words, the former  Soviet and the Western bloc, is not over yet because Russia has  failed to support the decision of the NATO Council to use force  in the Bosnian conflict. The problem exists, and its essence is  that NATO adopted this decision without consulting us, the  foreign minister of the Russian Federation said in response to a  question from Czech radio.    [Begin recording; Kozyrev in Russian fading into  superimposed  Czech translation] Thus the ball is in their court. We favor a  joint course of action and our choice [volba] is thus absolutely  clear. But this has nothing to do with the lasting East-West  division. I think that the concept of all spheres of influence  in the sense of superpowers enjoying a dominant position is a  remnant of the past. If we talk about spheres of interests, I  do not conceal the fact that we have an interest in having good  relations with the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia and that  we perhaps even have special interests. But we respect all  countries. You certainly understand that distant countries,  with which we have never had close contacts, are one thing; but  our contacts with the Czech lands are the closest possible.    When I was speaking today to a professor of Russian at  Charles University, he confirmed to me that there were so many  people interested in studying it that students had to compete  for places. We are pleased about this, and this is that special  interest I spoke about--to preserve our cultural and spiritual  relations. [end recording]    However, the interpretation of some people, who say that  Russia intends to dominate, dictate, and issue permission or  bans, is absurd. This all is the past, Andrey Kozyrev stressed  in his interview with Czech Radio. He went on to say:    [Begin Kozyrev recording] The division of the world into  blocs, the West and the East, is also the past. This is why I  am striving to search for ways that would not preserve this  division. The unification of Europe is the CSCE's final aim,  expressed in every [CSCE] document, involving both us and you.  And it is necessary to make further progress. I discussed this  with the [Czech] president and the [Czech] foreign minister. It  is necessary to think in specific terms. To be more specific, a  CSCE meeting at the highest level will take place at the end of  this year.    In my view, this is the forum where decisions aimed at  achieving this target should be made--instead of going the  opposite way, toward some sort of crusade. The truth is that  some demons, smelling of mothballs and emerging from graves,  have been attacking us in an attempt to gain power over us.  Some people speak about crusades, now at the end of the 20th  century. Others speculate about a division of the world, for  various reasons, into East and West. [end recording]    In reality, we are living at the end of the 20th century,  when the topical issue is a united Europe, the Russian foreign  minister repeated and stressed.    [Begin Kozyrev recording] This is a specific job. I am aware  of the fact that many people do not like this because it  involves ideas and day-to-day work. This is the most difficult  process of dialogues, talks, and consultative meetings,  acceptance of other views. You want one thing and your partner  proposes something a bit different. Such day-to-day work is  something you have to take into account. On the other hand,  single-minded judges do not need to listen to anybody; they say  what they want. This is why, for many cheap politicians, this  is the activity they like most from a psychological point of  view. On one side you have a concept, on the other a  declaration. I am in favor of the former variant and this is  also the purpose of my visit: not to look for disputed points  and subjects but, instead, to look for progress towards a  united Europe. As far as this is concerned, my talks with  President Havel were very constructive indeed. He is a man who  is also searching. He is prepared to listen and formulate  ideas. To make statements to the media about insuperable  differences is something different; it is a way to score  political points on the domestic political scene. [end  recording]</p>

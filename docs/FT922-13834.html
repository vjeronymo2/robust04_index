			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / FT Election Share Index AS THE campaign ended yesterday, those shares that might benefit from a Conservative victory moved upwards, against the trend. This last-minute recovery of confidence in Tory prospects was only a slight one, however: less than a tenth of a point. Shares that might benefit from a Labour win dropped, by two tenths of a point. Both parts of the FT Election Share Index did better than than the FT-SE index. During the campaign, 'Labour gainers' dropped by just under 4 per cent; 'Tory gainers' dropped 12 per cent; and the FT-SE index dropped 5 per cent. The biggest changes during the campaign came on the Conservative side of the index, where five shares dropped by 10 per cent or more. The biggest loser was BET, which lost 30.1 per cent of its value - for reasons which mostly revolved around the company itself. On the Labour side, only two shares dropped by 10 per cent or more. One, Land Securities, the UK's biggest property company, fell 11.4 per cent, affected mainly by the shadows cast by the problems of Olympia &amp; York and Heron. The only two gainers came on the Labour side: Rolls-Royce and BAT, up 3.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. In the money markets, sterling has steadied this week as investors reasoned that a Labour government would be unlikely to devalue the pound from its central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95. Last night in London, sterling closed at DM2.8425, unchanged on the day and up from DM2.835 on Friday night. Unless Labour chose to devalue, the Bank of England and other European central banks would be forced, under the system's rules, to support the pound. As a result, at a point close to the lower limit, the pound would look undervalued, and would be bought by investors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LABOUR WIN/TORY DEFEAT STOCKS (% change since March 11)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

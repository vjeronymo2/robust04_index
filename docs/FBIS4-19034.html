			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Answers for Employment"] </F>   [Text] "The most important task of future economic policy  is to find answers to the problem of decreasing employment in  industry." This was stressed by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on  Monday [11 April] at a conference of the Social Democratic Group  of the Trade Union for Metal Workers, Miners, and Workers in the  Energy Sector in Bad Hofgastein.    According to one of the objectives that the chancellor  defined in an eight-point program before the Social Democratic  metal workers, "Austria must not stop focusing on industry. For  our export-oriented industry, membership in the European Union  [EU] will make free access to the European Union, the largest  market of the world, possible. In addition, however, new  opportunities, particularly in the markets of dynamic growth --  that is, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and China --  have to be pursued." There are already tendencies of success  that have to be strengthened now, "so that real economic growth  will again be greater than the increase in productivity." Only  then will the unemployment figures strongly decrease again, he  said.    Economic growth could above all be considerably increased by  a more ambitious infrastructure policy, the chancellor stated,  who mentioned as examples, among others, the development of the  railroad and the improvement of telecommunications.    In concrete terms, Vranitzky outlined an eight-point  program.  It contains the following proposals: First, the improvment of  industrial location; second, the promotion of regional  industrial bases; third, improved training; fourth, intensified  export promotion; fifth, improved research and development;  sixth, entry into the European Union in order to ensure access  to the EU market and to be better able to protect our interests  against other economic blocs; seventh, acceleration of the  process for offering investors increased protection; eighth,  making population more "industry-focused."</p>

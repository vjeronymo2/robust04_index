			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Management: Take the high road - James Buxton and Lisa Wood assess whether Tecs should have a Scottish-style central body While English and Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils ponder whether to press the government to create a new central body to co-ordinate and support them, they are directing their eyes northwards to Scotland. In Scotland the equivalent of Tecs, the Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs), were born at the same time as their umbrella organisations. Outside the Highlands the Lecs come under Scottish Enterprise, while in the Highlands their parent body is Highlands and Islands Enterprise. These bodies have their own strategic development function and also act as a useful buffer between the Lecs and central government. It may be partly because of this difference with England  - where Tecs contract directly with the government  - that the Lecs appear more successful than the Tecs and on the whole have looked happier than their southern counterparts. In Scotland the creation of Lecs was part of a drastic reorganisation of two long-established bodies, the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board. Their successors, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, devolved many economic development powers to the new enterprise companies, which also took over training functions from the Training Agency. So although both Tecs and Lecs have responsibility for training and business development, the 13 Lecs under Scottish Enterprise in lowland Scotland have a much stronger development function than do the Tecs and they resemble mini-development agencies. The Scottish Lecs have larger budgets in relation to their populations than the Tecs. While nearly half their funds go on training, they also have substantial budgets for environmental improvement work (including property development) and business development. Whereas in England some of the Tecs have had difficulty making themselves known both to the business community and the public, in Scotland the public sector has a higher profile, and the SDA and HIDB were already well known. The creation of Scottish Enterprise's network of Lecs has released a great deal of human energy into economic development. In Edinburgh, for example, responsibility for development was devolved by Scottish Enterprise to Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (known as LEEL), a free-standing body with a budget of Pounds 45m. LEEL has made an impact by backing projects which required pulling together other bodies such as Edinburgh district council and Lothian regional council. Under its chairman Sir Charles Fraser, an energetic Edinburgh solicitor with legendary contacts, it has brought Edinburgh's long nurtured dream of creating an opera house closer to reality. In Lanarkshire, south-east of Glasgow, the Lanarkshire Development Agency has been given the task of regenerating the local economy after the closure of British Steel's Ravenscraig plant. In Ayrshire, to the south-west of Glasgow, Enterprise Ayrshire is drawing attention to an area of Scotland which the SDA tended to neglect. Some critics argue training is becoming a poor relation of high profile environmental/property projects. The criticism does not apply to all Lecs: several have made an attempt to integrate training with enterprise development. At Enterprise Ayrshire training and business development are interwoven in the management structure. Under John Lord, its chief executive, Enterprise Ayrshire is trying to escape the straitjacket of the official training programmes YT and ET, whose names have been abandoned in favour of Ayrshire Skills Training. The aim is to use knowledge of local companies to tailor training to their specific needs. Other critics fear that a development effort in lowland Scotland which was formerly closely co-ordinated is being diffused or 'balkanised' as Lecs pursue their own strategies, some of which may conflict with other Lecs. Several of the Lecs, on the other hand, complain that they are excessively constrained by Scottish Enterprise National (as the parent body, is now known). At Scottish Enterprise National, Crawford Beveridge, the chief executive, says that the loose network is 'fulfilling the aim of applying local solutions to local problems. Solutions are being found that would have been unthinkable under the old monolithic structure.' In reply to critics who argue that the network is too loose and that Lecs are inclined to spend on the easy options such as environmental improvements, he says that Lecs' budget requests are scrutinised to make sure that they are in line with Scottish Enterprise's overall plan Strategies for the 1990s. In the 1992/93 bidding round for Scottish Enterprise's Pounds 400m budget for the Lecs, the local enterprise companies overbid on property schemes and underbid on projects to develop tourism and to 'internationalise' Scottish business. Mr Beveridge says the Scottish Enterprise network has 'a much more pragmatic relationship with the Scottish Office than the Tecs have with the Training, Enterprise and Education Division (TEED) of the Department of Employment'. Many of the Tecs' dealings with TEED are very legalistic and they are related to their contracts, he says, whereas the Lec chairmen only refer to their contracts 'as a last resort'. He also says that Scottish Enterprise's ability to get the 13 Lec chief executives 'in a room together once every three months is a very powerful management tool'. As for the counter-criticism that Scottish Enterprise National, which itself has a budget of Pounds 65m and employs 390 people, exercises too much control over the Lecs, Beveridge replies: 'The Lecs are ambivalent about this. When we ask them 'What should we be doing?' we get a longer list than the list of what we actually do at the moment. 'We look at our support services and ask whether they should be here in Glasgow or out at the Lecs. Three months ago I offered to split up our legal department but the Lecs refused  - it would have put their costs up. But I've promised I will go through all the support services function by function to make sure that the services are being provided in the right place.'</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Unilever edges ahead by 4% to Pounds 1.06bn  -Persil increases market share and overtakes Ariel in 'soap wars' Unilever has increased its share of the washing powder market in the UK and France in spite of the 'soap wars' raging over its newly-launched Persil/Omo Power detergent. The Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group announced this yesterday while revealing better than expected second quarter pre-tax profits up 4 per cent from Pounds 590 to Pounds 611m. That took the figure for the first half to end-June to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 1.03bn) The shares jumped 55p to Pounds 10.97p. Figures from Nielsen, the market research group, showed that the group's Persil brand had increased its overall UK market share from 27 per cent to 28.2 per cent since the launch of Persil Power - known as Omo Power outside the UK and France - in April. The market share of rival group Procter &amp; Gamble's soap powder Ariel had fallen from 29 to 26.4 per cent in the same period. Ariel retained the lead in the concentrated powder market with 10 per cent, but Persil's share had increased from 6 to 9 per cent. Unilever has been engaged in a propaganda battle with Procter &amp; Gamble over the latter's claims that Persil/Omo Power could damage garments. The controversy meant sales of the new product had been disappointing in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Unilever said, however, that sales were now improving in the Netherlands. Sales had been stronger in the UK and France. The group stressed that concentrated soap powder accounted for only 2 per cent of worldwide turnover, which had been boosted by strong performances in several markets. Group sales for the second quarter and half year respectively were Pounds 7.67bn (Pounds 7.08bn) and Pounds 14.4bn (Pounds 13.5bn). Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said he expected 'a continuing improvement in trading conditions in our principal markets will lead to some further strengthening of our results'. In Europe, half-year operating profits increased from Pounds 654m to Pounds 685m on turnover of Pounds 7.84bn (Pounds 7.58bn). Sales of oil- and dairy-based foods declined, but sales of ice cream and Liptonice, the ready-to-drink tea product, were strong. Sales and profits increased in the speciality chemicals business - supplying products such as flavourings, fragrances and adhesives to third parties  suggesting a pick-up in the economy. North American turnover increased from Pounds 2.61bn to Pounds 2.8bn, with profits up from Pounds 100m to Pounds 104m. The food business improved, with stronger sales in oil- and dairy-based foods and pasta sauces. Sales of ice cream increased significantly after Unilever acquired Kraft General Foods' ice cream business last year, but the price war continued to make conditions tough in detergents. Profits outside Europe and North America were Pounds 346m (Pounds 318m) on sales of Pounds 3.72bn (Pounds 3.32bn), with strong performances in Brazil and India. Earnings per share for the half year, at current exchange rates, were 36.13p (36.38p). The interim dividend will be declared with the third quarter results in November. See Lex</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / C&amp;G bid faces statute challenge As 'creatures of statute', building societies could do only what legislation expressly or implicitly allowed, the High Court heard yesterday. Opening the argument for the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, Mr Phillip Heslop QC, told Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that the court should approach the Building Societies Act 1986 on that basis, rather than on the basis that what was not expressly forbidden was permissible. The commission is challenging the agreed Pounds 1.8bn offer by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. It argues it is unlawful for anyone except a society and its successor company to be party to a transfer agreement; that a payment in respect of a transfer is unlawful except where expressly permitted by the act; and that the act does not allow payments to members of less than two years' standing. The court heard that 27 per cent of C&amp;G shareholding members are of less than two years' standing. Their votes could be critical for the high thresholds of members' consent which would be required. The regime in the 1986 act for transferring the business of a society either to a specially formed or existing company was complete and comprehensive, he said. There was no suggestion the government intended to extend the arrangements for transferring a society's business - which it was putting forward as an exception to the previous ban - to societies' entering agreements with third parties. The transfer proposed was really an attempt by Lloyds to acquire C&amp;G by a route outside the regulatory regime, which could not have been the intention, he said. Judgment is being considered.</p>

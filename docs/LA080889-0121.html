			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: TANDON LOSES $1.99 MILLION IN QUARTER, BLAMES DOLLAR  </P> <P> Tandon Corp., a Moorpark maker of personal computers, reported a loss of $1.99  million for the second quarter ended June 30, compared to a $6-million profit a  year earlier. Revenue in the latest quarter increased 20% to $97.7 million from  $81.1 million.  </P> <P> The company blamed the loss on the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, which  has made overseas sales more difficult. About 86% of Tandon's sales are in  Europe. Tandon said it is taking steps to make its European operations more  self-sufficient, which should lessen its vulnerability to exchange-rate  fluctuations.  </P> <P> For the six months ended in June, Tandon lost $11.9 million, compared to $13.2  million in net income a year earlier. Revenue increased 18% to $190.4 million  from $161.5 million.  </P></p>

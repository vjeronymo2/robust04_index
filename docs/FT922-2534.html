			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lloyd's agency poised for big expansion move HAYTER BROCKBANK, the rapidly growing Lloyd's agency group which trades in London on a matched bargain basis, is set for substantial expansion in 1993, according to Mr Mark Brockbank, group managing underwriter. Mr Brockbank made the prediction, as Hayter reported that all four of its syndicates had made profits in the 1989 year. Lloyd's is expected to make a loss equivalent to Pounds 2bn, or nearly 20 per cent of its capital base, when it reports its global results later this month. By contrast Hayter syndicates 253, 588, 861 and 929 all reported profits ranging from 2.69 per cent to 8.95 per cent of premium income. The group's capacity (the amount of premium income it can accept according to Lloyd's rules) increased by 40 per cent for the 1992 year of account and now stands at Pounds 245m.</p>

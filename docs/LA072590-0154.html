			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRYSLER TO SHIFT JEEP PRODUCTION TO OHIO  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. and local and state officials announced today an agreement to  bring more Jeep production and possibly hundreds of jobs to Toledo.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Michael Glusac said Chrysler will move production of the  Wrangler YJ from Brampton, Ontario, to Toledo starting Jan. 1, 1993.  </P> <P> The company also said that if it decides to build the new JJ model, it will be  produced in Toledo by 1993.  </P> <P> In return, the city and state will provide an incentive package that could  total $22.5 million over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> "The agreement meets Chrysler's needs as well as the needs of the city and  state for a framework for determining the future of Jeep in Toledo," Glusac  said at a news conference.  </P> <P> "Market conditions must ultimately govern our decisions about what vehicles we  make, where we make them and in what volume. However, the agreement being  announced gives us assurances about what Chrysler can expect in the years  ahead," he said.  </P> <P> The company already makes the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer in Toledo.  </P> <P> Mayor John McHugh said he would ask the City Council to grant Chrysler a  10-year tax abatement on personal property taxes on an estimated $75-million  worth of equipment the company expects to install at its two Toledo plants. The  equipment would be for production of both vehicles.  </P> <P> Toledo agreed to provide up to $500,000 a year for seven years starting in 1991  for improvements to the plants.  </P> <P> The state agreed to provide up to $5 million for retraining workers.  </P> <P> The agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to move Jeep  Wrangler production to Toledo from Brampton and keep the two local plants  operating beyond 1992. The plants employ 5,300 people.  </P></p>

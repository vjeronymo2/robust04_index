			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Crest wins excess of financial support The Bank of England said yesterday there had been substantial oversubscription by institutions committed to supporting its proposed Crest paperless share settlement system. It said 74 firms and institutions had expressed willingness to be shareholders by the end of May, the closing date for subscriptions to raise the Pounds 12m for the 'building' phase of Crest, which is due to be completed by the end of next year. Commitments will be scaled back pro rata in accordance with the four tiers of support, from Pounds 375,000 for those in tier 1 to Pounds 30,000 for those in tier 4. Crestco, a new company, will be formed by October using the share subscriptions. It will own and run Crest, while the Bank will build the core system and provide legal and business support - for fees of Pounds 10m - until the end of next year. The prospective shareholders include 21 of the 28 marketmakers, 28 firms specialising in retail broking and a number of custodians, payment providers and institutional fund managers.</p>

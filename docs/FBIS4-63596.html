			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Spirin and Vyacheslav </F> Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing May 24 TASS -- "The present difficulties in  Sino-Russian relations are temporary, of course," Geng Xuncai, a  representative from the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and  Foreign Economic Cooperation, said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    The high-ranking official pins great hopes for their  solution  on the second meeting of the bilateral intergovernment  commission on trade, economic, scientific and technical  cooperation, which will open here on Wednesday, on the eve of  the visit by Russian Premier Viktor Chrnomyrdin to China.    Its participants led by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr  Shokhin who will come to Beijing on Wednesday, and Chinese  Vice-Premier Li Lanqing will discuss prospects for transition to  new forms of trade and methods of regulating border trade  turnover and cooperation in agriculture and the transfer of  technologies.    "The two partners should advance major companies to forward  positions in trade and investment," Geng claimed. This is  necessary to avoid barter which is responsible for 65 per cent  of Chinese- Russian trade turnover up to this time as well as to  escape a drop in bilateral trade relations which took place in  the first quarter, he added.    According to Geng, China is interested in establishing full-  fledged business realations in such priority areas as the  aerospace industry, chemistry, machine-building and  pharmaceutics.    Experts will also concentrate on the transport problem  containing the growth of Russian-Chinese trade relations.    Russian enterprises have good prospects for participating in  the construction of a mammoth hydropower development, "Sanxia",  on the Jangtze River, which is called here "the most spectacular  project after the Great Chinese Wall".    Russian trade representative in China Aleksandr Kachanov is  also optimistic about prospects for cooperation. "The order book  of Russian enterprises for the delivery of complete plant to  China up to the year 2000 is worth 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for  signed contracts alone," he said in an exclusive interview with  ITAR-TASS later in the day.    Russia is among leading suppliers of machinery to the  Chinese  market. It helps to retool several industrial enterprises,  including major fuelled power plants and participates in  designing a nuclear power station with a capacity of two million  kw in the Liaoning Province.    "It is self-evident that support from state bodies of the  two  countries is necessary to realise the potential of our  relations. We pin great hopes on the meeting of the  intergovernment commission," Kachanov stressed.    Many Chinese businessmen engaged in operations with Russian  partners have got reasons to review their calcualtions and  plans. President Boris Yeltsin's decree on repealing quotas on  and licencing of exports, the text of which has just been  circulated by the XINHUA news agency, makes a new ten-billion  barrier in bilateral trade turnover possible.</p>

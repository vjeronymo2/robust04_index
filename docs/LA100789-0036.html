			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY'S 24-7 LOSS TO TAFT IS NO MYSTERY  </P> <P> It wouldn't take Sherlock Holmes and his big magnifying glass to deduce what is  killing the Kennedy High football team this season.  </P> <P> It's as elementary as 2-5-4 (as in 254 yards allowed rushing), and as  predictable as Taft Coach Tom Stevenson wearing shorts to the game.  </P> <P> The Golden Cougars have no defense against the run.  </P> <P> Taft made that fact perfectly clear once again Friday night in a 24-7 Northwest  Valley Conference game at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Kennedy also had its share of problems on offense after losing star tailback  Ontiwaun Carter on the final play of the first period.  </P> <P> Carter, who rushed for 267 yards and four touchdowns last week against  Crenshaw, was hit on the thigh by a Taft player's helmet and suffered a severe  bruise that kept him out for the remainder of the game. He finished with 46  yards in seven carries.  </P> <P> Carter's backup, 5-foot-6, 145-pound sophomore Eli Raphael, gained 35 yards in  10 carries as Taft held the Golden Cougars to 64 rushing yards and 124 total  yards.  </P> <P> "You can't win without defense, and you can't win without Ontiwaun," Kennedy  assistant coach Tom Sams said.  </P> <P> Kennedy (1-3, 0-1 in conference play), which has allowed 1,040 rushing yards,  certainly was at a loss as to how to stop the Taft running game. The Toreadors  (2-1, 1-0) punted only once, and that was because of a holding penalty.  </P> <P> "I'd have to say our offensive line and our running backs really jelled as a  unit tonight and played the type of football we've been playing the last six  years. It was great to see," Stevenson said. "I was very disappointed Ontiwaun  got hurt. He's a great athlete. It took a little edge off the game for me  personally."  </P> <P> Stevenson's players didn't seem to mind.  </P> <P> Taft led, 10-7, at halftime and scored second-half touchdowns on a 13-yard run  by Steve Lockridge in the third period and a seven-yard run by quarterback  Edwin Velasco.  </P> <P> Lockridge finished with 58 yards in 11 carries. Taft was led by fullback  Gregory Bernard, who gained 84 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> Four Taft ballcarriers rushed for 30 yards or more, and the Toreadors  accumulated 311 total yards.  </P> <P> The Toreadors drove 90 yards to a touchdown on their first possession, staying  on the ground for 15 of the 16 plays.  </P> <P> Wolfgang von Aspe scored the touchdown on a six-yard run, dragging Keith West  into the end zone. Carlos Lopez added the kick, and Taft led, 7-0, with 45  seconds left in the first period.  </P> <P> Kennedy countered on the ensuing possession, going 74 yards.  </P> <P> The Golden Cougars moved to the Taft 14 in 12 plays, and on third and 10,  quarterback Tony Vazquez passed to West in the end zone. Kicker Jason Rosen  tied the score, 7-7, with 7:47 remaining in the first half.  </P> <P> On the last offensive series of a first half dominated by time-consuming  drives, Taft marched from its 32 to the Kennedy three, where Velasco's  third-down pass fell incomplete in the end zone six seconds before  intermission.  </P> <P> The Toreadors settled for a 21-yard field goal by Lopez to take a 10-7 lead at  the half.  </P> <P> Kennedy had 115 yards in offense in the first half.  </P></p>

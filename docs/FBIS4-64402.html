			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Three Parties Forced Into Single </F> Parliamentary Caucus"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- Three smaller parties that  do not have enough seats in the Lower House to form separate  groups will be forced to join a single so-called mixed group  because the speaker's office on Thursday [28 April] turned down  their applications to form separate ones.    The Socialist and Democratic Alliance parties each have 15  Lower House deputies while the Pact for Italy has 13, all below  the 20-member floor limit for the formation of a separate group  under the current rules.    The three parties ran separately in the March elections (in  some constituencies with the progressives) and are not keen to  be forced into a single caucus and risk being seen by public  opinion as interchangeable.</p>

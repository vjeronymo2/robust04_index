			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan should step up its  economic cooperation to other Asian countries as a way to help  revitalize the global economy, the fiscal 1994 white paper on  economic cooperation released Friday [3 June] said.    Japan has a responsibility to activate the world economy by  supporting ongoing self-help efforts among Asian economies to  maintain and expand their "growth dynamism," said the annual  report.    To that aim, an international division of roles needs to be  promoted on the investment and trade fronts, the white paper  said, calling for Japan to expand direct investment in and  imports from Asia.    The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and  Industry Ministry, described the newly industrializing economies  (NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development."    "Such a dynamism in the areas has resulted from an effective  use of market mechanism and an increased linkage with the rest  of the world in trade and investment," said the white paper.    This year's white paper paid particular attention to China,  Vietnam and India, devoting much space to analyzing various  problems involved in economic reform efforts in these countries.    China, touted as having the biggest growth potential in the  world, scored a significant real economic growth of a 13.4  percent in 1993 thanks to the increased use of market mechanism.    But the paper cited the need for infrastructure improvement  in the country, especially in the inland area, in order to  correct its economic gap with the rapidly growing coastal area.    The white paper said Vietnam should effectively use aid  funds  extended by Japan and other countries for improvement in  economic infrastructure, and lagging legal and administrative  systems.    The Vietnamese Government also needs to make further efforts  in placing economically inefficient state-owned corporations  into private management, it said.    As for India, the white paper said its legal system has been  upgraded under the ongoing reform program. But further efforts,  particularly deregulation, need to be done in financial and farm  sectors, it said.    The paper also sees the need for India to improve its  infrastructure in utilities, traffic systems and  telecommunications networks.    These efforts would help rectify an inadequate allocation of  wealth among the Indian people, eventually contributing to  higher productivity, the white paper said.    Japan should formulate economic cooperation programs for  other Asian countries while clarifying problems these countries  are facing domestically, it said.    Assistance to them also should be made in a manner that  ensures harmonization with global trade accords recently  concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations, the paper said.    The paper noted that Japan's economic assistance in 1992  decreased 36.3 percent to 15,944 million dollars, with a smooth  growth in official development assistance (ODA) more than offset  by a substantial drop in private-sector aid.    Japan's ODA for the year increased 2.7 percent to 11,332  million dollars. The sum was the largest in the world,  accounting for 18.5 percent of the global ODA.</p>

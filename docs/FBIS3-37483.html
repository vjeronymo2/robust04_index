Kobelev was the chief sensation at the plenary session  of the State Duma 16 February. The deputy demanded that he be  allowed to read out a statement that he and party colleague A.  Pronin were quitting the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR] faction. Since the author of the statement was the  "number two man" in Zhirinovskiy's party, observers believe that  it is valid to talk about the possibility of a serious split in  this large faction.    Clearly, these considerations also influenced the speech of  the LDPR leader and intensified his traditional stridency.  Zhirinovskiy told participants in the session that V. Kobelev  cannot be considered either a member of the LDPR or a deputy  since he has been excluded "by a party decision" from its ranks  "for actions incompatible with the status of a deputy and a  member of the LDPR." We will strip them of their mandate,  Zhirinovskiy stressed, and promised to institute criminal  proceedings against the renegades for improper actions allegedly  committed by them in the past.    In conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Deputy  Kobelev in turn termed Zhirinovskiy's accusations against him a  lie and recalled that the LDPR leader is fond of insulting  people. He also did not confirm the information about his  expulsion from the party.    "I have left Zhirinovskiy's faction, not the LDPR, because I  consider myself a representative in the Duma of the LDPR and not  of one man's party," Kobelev stated.    In his opinion, Zhirinovskiy should be condemned for all his  actions at the party congress because they are not commensurate  with the LDPR program, which envisages neither extremism nor  interference in the affairs of other countries. In conclusion,  Kobelev promised Zhirinovskiy that if the latter continued his  hostile actions against him he would fight fire with fire.    Meanwhile the situation which has developed within the LDPR  faction as a result of this goes beyond the bounds of internal  factional disputes. After all, the Duma standing orders have  yet to be ratified and, consequently, one of the main questions  has yet to be resolved, which is: Does a parliamentary faction  have the right to recall deputies who entered parliament on the  party lists if they "betray" the interests of the faction. It  is possible that the scandal within the LDPR faction will  influence the solution of this problem in such a way that the  recall of deputies will be banned, because there is quite a  large number of legislators who have an interest in a split in  the ranks of Zhirinovskiy's supporters.</p>

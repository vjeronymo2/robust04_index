			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> VOICES;  </P> <P> 'PROTECT THE PEOPLE FROM (NO) CRIME'  </P> <P> Gabriel Paislaru, 38, is a translator and a journalist for the Romanian state  news agency, Agerpres. Part of his job is guiding English-speaking foreign  journalists around the country.  </P> <P> Paislaru is a devoted believer in the Romanian system, described in the West as  a combined Byzantine dictatorship and Stalinist-model police state. He sees his  country through a rosier lens.  </P> <P> When a visitor asks why armed police are on practically every street corner of  Bucharest, Paislaru explains patiently: "They are to protect the people from  crime."  </P> <P> "But, according to the government," responds the visitor, "there is no crime in  Bucharest."  </P> <P> "That's why," Paislaru says.  </P></p>

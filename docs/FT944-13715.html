			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: CFTC to relax rules on futures The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has agreed to relax some of its rules governing US futures exchanges on an experimental basis. The move, which had been expected, came in response to requests by the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to have the same regulatory relief granted to over-the-counter derivatives traders in 1993. The agency prescribed a three-year pilot programme with specific limitations. The proposed regulatory exemptions will not apply to any existing exchange-listed products, with the exception of the CME's 'rolling spot' foreign currency products. Only clearly defined groups of 'professional' traders will be allowed to participate in the new, exempt markets, and the agency will require all pilot contracts, which are expected to look like over-the-counter derivatives, to be cleared through a clearing-house. Recognising the controversial aspects of the plan, the CFTC is delaying implementation for 45 days while it seeks public comment. Derivatives dealers expect the programme to undergo substantial modifications as a result of the public comment process. The agency, in an unexpectedly forceful move, also said it would use the period to determine if the exemptions granted to unlisted derivatives markets in 1993 went too far. Ms Mary Schapiro, the CFTC chairwoman, said: 'I believe that removing necessary and appropriate safeguards and protections is not the answer to complaints that there is an uneven regulatory playing field between otherwise comparable OTC and exchange instruments. In this regard, re-evaluation of the pilot programme should include scrutiny of the current swaps exemption, in conjunction with other financial regulators.' The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said it needed to study the CFTC proposal before commenting. The CBoT said it was 'disappointed' the exemptions were so limited and threatened to do battle with the CFTC over the issue when the agency's reauthorisations comes before congress. The CME, in contrast, said it was 'delighted' that much of its exemption request had been granted.</p>

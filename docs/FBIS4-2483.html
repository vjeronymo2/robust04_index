			<p>BFN     [Text] The Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee called a  provincial conference of leading cadres in Guiyang yesterday  morning. The conference summed up the province's anticorruption  work over the past year and made anticorruption work  arrangements for this year.    Chen Shineng, provincial party committee deputy secretary  and  provincial governor, presided over the conference. Xia Guohua,  provincial party committee standing committee member and  discipline inspection commission secretary, relayed General  Secretary Jiang emin's address to the recently concluded Third  Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee.    Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a  speech in which he put forth the following four requirements on  the ongoing anticorruption struggle across the province:    1. To correctly view the ongoing anticorruption struggle  across the province. Secretary Liu Fangren stated: Guizhou has  scored marked results in fighting corruption over the past year.  Nevertheless, the province's anticorruption struggle has been  plagued by unbalanced growth, unsustained progress, and some  other problems. We should know that corrupt phenomena have now  multiplied to a serious extent, posing a real threat to Guizhou.  Therefore, we should be fully aware of the arduousness and  protractedness of the ongoing anticorruption struggle.    2. The main tasks of and principles for the province's  anticorruption struggle in 1994. Secretary Liu Fangren noted:  This year, Guizhou's anticorruption struggle should be  continually focused on party and government leaders at and above  the county or provincial department section level. To this end,  we should see to it that all party and government cadres at and  above county or provincial department section level remain  honest in performing official duties and abide by the party and  government disciplines. We should work hard and strive for more  progress in this regard. Moreover, we should make redoubled  efforts to investigate and handle all major and serious cases,  strictly enforce party discipline and state laws, straighten out  departmental or professional malpractices in real earnest, and  strive to make the province's anticorruption struggle submit to  and serve the CPC's overall interests.    3. The party committees and governments at all levels across  the province should strengthen leadership over the ongoing  anticorruption struggle.    4. To forge and maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the broad  masses of people and strengthen the effectiveness of the  anticorruption struggle. Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: The  mass viewpoint and mass line have remained the CPC's cherished  traditions, they are the basis upon which the party and  government can survive, and are the source of force with which  we can overcome all sorts of hardships and difficulties.  Improving party style and building a clean government are, in a  nutshell, aimed at maintaining long-term flesh-and-blood ties  between the party and government on the one hand and the broad  masses of people on the other. We should always bear this point  in mind.    The conference was attended by provincial leaders, including  Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui,  Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, and Huang Yao; retired veteran leaders  at and above deputy provincial level; leading cadres at the  deputy provincial department director level; provincial  discipline inspection commission members; prefectural,  autonomous prefectural, city, and county discipline inspection  commissions secretaries; prefectural, autonomous prefectural,  city, and county supervision bureaus chiefs; as well as  discipline inspection groups leaders and supervision offices  directors from various provincial departments.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Fashion: Inspired by her memories of the Caspian Sea - Lucia van der Post on the sheer elegance of Shirin Guild All summer, the suit I have worn most often - the one I have reached for when wanting to be well-dressed enough to face the frock-fancying world without feeling all trussed up - has been a relaxed number I found by chance in Browns of South Molton Street, London W1. Attracted at once by its air of off-hand chic, its great comfort (the skirt has a full-length flap that gives it a bit of dash and an elasticated band to accommodate lunch at the Caprice) and its excellent price, I did not know then how often I would wear it. Judged by that old fashioned editor's adage that the true cost of a garment is the price divided by the number of times you wear it, the suit has cost little more than a row of beans and I have only had it since April. Who designed this marvel, then? An elegantly thin and talented Iranian called Shirin Guild, who now lives in London and is married to Robin Guild, (an interior design consultant once married to Tricia Guild of Designers' Guild who, it so happens, wears Shirin Guild's clothes much of the time). Her autumn range is as distinctive a collection of clothes as I have seen in a long time. Most of her fans first become addicted to her clothes after buying one of her sweaters. You may think that a sweater is a sweater is a sweater . . . until you see Shirin Guild's sweaters. They are voluminous and dramatic - great square shapes with hemlines that dip and sleeves that start somewhere around the elbow. I have never yet worn one without those who have come upon them saying: 'Aha, I see you are wearing a Shirin Guild sweater,' and those not in the know wanting to know where they can buy one like it. I think they work best with her own ethnically-inspired trousers - slightly square-cut, often cropped above the ankle, sometimes capaciously-cut rather like baggy Kurdish trousers, but they can as easily be worn with jeans or leggings. Like Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons and Issey Miyake, Shirin Guild derives much of her inspiration from the traditional indigenous clothing she saw all around her as a child. 'I always think,' she says, 'of those scarecrows by the Caspian Sea wearing great black square coats.' She uses the bold shapes and strong lines ('often peasants simply cut and fold the fabric and then cut holes in the middle for the head') that are the hallmark of the clothing worn by the working people of Iran and this gives her pieces both a strong identity and great comfort. Though Guild herself wears her own clothes to perfection and she is so thin that she was busy downing pints of creamy milk to fatten up when we met, they are particularly kind to larger women; capacious but having considerable pizzazz. The collection has a strong hand-writing but the pieces do not have to be bought as a package or outfit. Issey Miyake once said: 'I love to see people make the clothes belong to them, make them no longer mine, but their own.' It could also apply to Guild, for her clothes demand a complicity with the customer. They, too are 'not a finished piece of design until the wearer has made her contribution'. At Browns, Guild's clothes are sold mainly as separate pieces. 'The women who buy Shirin Guild's designs tend to have a great deal of personal style and they are confident about mixing her pieces with the clothes they already have,' says Francoise Tessier, chief buyer and a director of Browns. Kate Bush, the singer, is a fan, so is the designer Maryse Boxer and a TV anchorwoman from Washington DC who buys the entire collection each season by telephone.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney's 110p share price values company at Pounds 26m SHARES in Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and passenger car dealer which is coming to market through a full placing and public offer, were priced at 110p each yesterday valuing the group at Pounds 26m. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is divesting Charles Sidney as part of a strategy to refocus the group on its core activities. Albert Fisher is selling 20m shares as part of the placing and public offer and will use the proceeds to reduce debt. The offer will also raise about Pounds 3.6m, net of expenses, for Charles Sidney which plans to use the funds to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. Charles Sidney reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 1.7m) in the year to August 31 on turnover of Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 41.3m). Earnings per share increased to 7.9p (5.6p) and the notional dividend is 3.5p. Although the group has not produced any profits forecasts for the current year, the prospectus says that the directors believe Charles Sidney is 'well placed to benefit from the recent increase in Mercedes-Benz's market share in the commercial vehicle sector,' and that they expect a 'significant improvement' in Mercedes-Benz car sales following the recent launch of its new range of cars. The placing and public offer is sponsored by Schroders and dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on November 10. COMMENT Charles Sidney is coming to market at an opportune time. The recovery in the luxury car sector appears to have arrived along with Mercedes-Benz's new models. Meanwhile the group's long-term profitability is underpinned by its solid commercial vehicle operations. At the offer price the stock would be trading on a historic multiple of 14 - a reasonable discount to some of its more established quoted counterparts.</p>

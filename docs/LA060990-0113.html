			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETROVIC AND DIVAC WOULD PREFER TO SIT OUT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> Drazen Petrovic, a reserve guard for the Portland Trail Blazers and a former  member of the Yugoslav national team, said his country's basketball federation  wants him and Laker center Vlade Divac, another Yugoslav, to play in the World  Championships in Argentina in August.  </P> <P> "They want me to play in the Goodwill (Games, in July) and the championships,"  Petrovic said.  </P> <P> "They want Divac to play, too. But we play double the number of games here, and  I need a rest. I get a little tired. I'd like to stay (in Portland) because I  want to play in rookie camp in July."  </P> <P> After the Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs, Divac said he did not want  to play for the Yugoslav national team this summer because he was tired.  Petrovic said he hasn't spoken to Divac since the playoffs began, but the Trail  Blazer guard said Yugoslav officials may hold up Divac's military deferment  should he balk at playing in the World Championships.

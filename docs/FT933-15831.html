			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Funding set for shift to rural areas A SUBSTANTIAL shift in government support for local councils, away from inner cities and towards rural areas, will take place next spring, unless ministers act to mitigate its effect. The review of the basis on which the government allocates grant, together with the use of the full information from the 1991 census, suggests that some urban councils could lose up to 20 per cent of their grant. Ministers acknowledge that such a stark change could not be allowed to happen in a single year. Apart from the sheer difficulty for local authorities of such a large adjustment, the London local elections in May next year provide a further reason to soften the impact. Simply updating the formula by which the government decides how much it thinks councils should spend, recent government figures indicate that some inner London boroughs, including the flagship Tory councils in Westminster and Wandsworth, would lose between 10 per cent and 14 per cent of their standard spending assessments. On the same basis, more remote - mainly rural - districts could gain by just over 13 per cent in their SSAs. The review of SSAs is set to intensify this shift. Less weight is expected to be given in the system to factors such as ethnicity. Double-counting is also expected to be cut: at present, for example, there are separate factors for the number of lone parents in an area and the number of people on income support, even though the two groups over-lap. The Department of the Environment admits that these figures will not be reflected in the grant settlement for next year. Instead, ministers are likely to agree on some form of separate grant, similar to the one operating this year. That grant compensates councils which lost more than 5 per cent of their grant because of the fall in population revealed by use of the basic 1991 census data.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Europe faces Ecu225m bank charge - The cost may be only one of many disruptions caused by a move to monetary union The possibility that a move to European monetary union (Emu) could cost large European banks up to Ecu225m (Dollars 278m) each is the most daunting conclusion of research carried out by the Ecu Banking Association. But the cost is only one of many disruptions faced by banks moving to Emu. As the study points out, the effect on banks of moving to monetary union is comparable to large scale deregulation. It will involve massive technical changes, elimination of some markets and the growth of others, and large changes to banks' funding methods and strategy for European operations. Furthermore, banks in the core group of European countries that move to monetary union by the turn of the century may be in a better position than those outside. Exclusion from Emu could raise funding costs, lower credit ratings and form a large hurdle to operating efficiency. Given this large list of obstacles, it appears surprising at first that bankers involved in the study group should have emphasised their enthusiasm for the idea yesterday. But the report concludes that banks could gain comparative advantage by embracing the idea quickly and comprehensively. A move to monetary union could challenge traditional methods of banking in Europe in a number of ways: Foreign exchange trading among different European countries will disappear, wiping out an important source of income not only from cash markets but also sales of financial derivatives to hedge currency risks. In their place will be put a larger market for exchange of Ecu with dollars and yen. Correspondent banking - in which banks have partners in other countries to perform payment transactions in local currency - will be replaced by bilateral or multilateral payment arrangements in Ecu. This could affect traditional profits from fees, and 'float' income on cash sums. Local money markets, bond markets and credit markets, which are supported by local payment and settlement services will be replaced by an Emu-sized market, bound by one currency. This will change the scale at which many banks operate, forcing them to re-define operations. Retail banks will have to re-state historical data on customer accounts in Ecu after monetary union, as well as altering technology and producing new transfer forms and cheque books. They will also have to make big changes to comply with alterations in clearing systems. The transition costs will be higher if governments avoid a 'big bang' approach in which currencies within monetary union disappear - perhaps over a weekend. If they choose to allow a 'dual currency' system with local currencies running alongside the Ecu for a time, costs would be higher. Bankers yesterday pointed out that costs of transition could vary considerably depending on the legislative approach. For example, if European legislation allows all outstanding loans to be re-stated in Ecu rather than being individually re-negotiated, it avoids large one-off costs. Yet the banks within monetary union will at least be able to comfort themselves that most costs are transitional, and that they may be able to exert a competitive advantage on outsiders after union. The most worrying fate faces banks whose currency is excluded from the union. A study of the impact on banks in countries outside Emu, prepared by Mr Jaun Moro of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, argues that such banks will suffer competitive disadvantage in lacking a stable Ecu funding base. This will compress their margins if they lend at similar spreads to Emu-based banks. Mr Moro argued that banks from non-integrated countries risk being downgraded by credit rating agencies because they are exposed to 'second tier currencies'. They will also have to use 'massive amounts of hard currency' as an alternative to their domestic currency, so raising their costs. This could have considerable implications for large banks in countries such as the UK, Ireland and Denmark which could be left behind in the initial move to monetary union. UK banks with large cross-border businesses, such as NatWest and Barclays, could be severely affected. Mr Olivier Mas, chairman of the association, emphasised that banks are likely to be impelled to start thinking of the Ecu area as their domestic market. This is likely to lead to a re-consideration of cross-border partnerships, particularly on payment systems. As Mr Mas said, London is the leading centre for Ecu clearing in Europe despite the UK government's attitude to monetary union. Yet UK banks could face difficulties in maintaining their grip on Ecu clearing and financial markets if they were operating sterling as a dual currency. This could lead to Emu changing the balance of power among banks that want to be forces in Europe. Those from non-Emu countries would have to fight harder against those which would gain funding advantages, and the backing of the hardest currency.</p>

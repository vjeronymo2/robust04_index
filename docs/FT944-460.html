			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investment group buys Adidas A group of international investors has taken control of Adidas AG, the German sports equipment company, according to Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank which sold a 20 per cent stake in the group. Under the terms of the deal, a consortium of investors including Mr Robert-Louis Dreyfus, the chairman of Adidas AG, will acquire Adidas International Holding, which controls the company. The amount of the transaction is thought to value Adidas at about DM1.4bn (Dollars 887m). The deal marks the latest in a series of ownership changes in the company and reflects the desire by Credit Lyonnais to dispose of assets to reduce debts. The loss-making bank said it has sold assets worth almost FFr10bn this year as part of a rescue plan. The group of international investors, joined in a newly-created company called Sogedim, also bought stakes in Adidas International Holding from Assurances Generales de France, the insurer, and several investment funds. In addition to Mr Dreyfus, a former chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi, Sogedim includes Mr David Bromelow, a British publisher, Mr Christian Tourres and two US shareholders, Mr Tom Russell and Ms Mary Friday. Adidas said 1994 profits would confirm the recovery begun in 1993 after losses of DM150m in 1992. It said pre-tax profits would be significantly higher than DM100m, compared with DM34m in 1993.</p>

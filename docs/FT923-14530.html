			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Digital waves clear the air - Michiyo Nakamoto reports on a new type of radio giving CD-like clarity Imagine having a radio in your home that would allow you to choose from hundreds of music stations and then to make your own high quality digital recordings, much like a personalised compact disk. The radio, more like a record library than conventional broadcasting, would have a small screen attached, providing information on the kind of music available and on which station. The 'armchair record store', as it is called by Mr Michael Tyler, a partner at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, the market consultancy, and an active proponent of the concept, would provide the consumer with 'the functional equivalent of records'. Recordable MiniDiscs, like small CDs or digital cassette tapes - both due to appear on the market later this year - might be used to make near perfect copies of crisp, clear CD-like quality sound at home. It would mean music enthusiasts would no longer need to go to a record store to buy a CD, unless they wanted to browse through the collections to look at the cover designs. Such a futuristic vision may become a reality soon with the advent of digital audio broadcasting, the broadcasting of radio programs in digital, rather than analogue, form. DAB offers the same high quality sound as CDs. DAB has several other advantages over conventional analogue broadcasting. The main benefit is that the high quality sound of DAB is effectively free from interference. Unlike FM radio, which provides high quality sound but is flawed by poor reception, fading and distortions, particularly on portable receivers, DAB is practically free from interference and it provides excellent reception even when the receiver is mobile. FM is particularly frustrating in built-up areas where obstacles to transmission, such as towers and buildings, produce what are known as multipath distortion. When signals from the transmitter arrive at the receiver along different paths as a result of reflection from buildings and other obstructions, the result is hissing and other sound distortions in conventional analogue broadcasts. Simply switching from analogue to digital signals would not solve the problem, but a digital broadcasting scheme developed in Europe by a team led by Centre Commun d'Etudes de Telediffusion et Telecommunications, the French broadcast and telecommunications research body, and funded through the EC's Eureka project, overcomes multipath signal interference. The system uses low data rate signals that are less susceptible to multipath interference and boosts sound quality by sending hundreds of copies of the signal simultaneously. Even if parts of one signal are lost, there are plenty more copies to replace them. Mr Henry Price, head of engineering information at the British Broadcasting Corporation offers the analogy of a garbled written message. Even if the sentence is partially illegible, if enough of the information can be read it is possible to work out what is missing from the overall sense of the sentence. DAB also eliminates the problem of having to retune car radios. Long-distance drivers listening to an FM station on the radio are forced to retune as they move away from the area covered by one transmitter into that of another. The problem arises because, with analogue broadcasting, two separate transmitters cannot send signals on the same frequency. With DAB, this is possible. As a result a car radio does not need to be retuned, since the same radio station will be on the same frequency wherever the car is, at least within a national or regional service area. This also means tuning becomes unnecessary. The radio can be pre-set to the different stations, allowing the listener to select channels by push-button. A further important advantage of DAB is that it occupies relatively little of the radio spectrum. Although DAB does send a lot of information at once, the information is packed closely enough to create a six-fold improvement in spectrum efficiency over FM, according to Mr Price. That means it is possible to increase the number of radio stations without congesting the radio waves. While each FM network needs 2.2 megahertz of spectrum to provide coverage to 98 per cent of the UK population, a DAB service could pack five national stereo channels in 1.75 MHz. To use DBA, consumers will need to buy a new type of programmable digital radio built on computer chip technology. The cost of these, although initially higher than conventional receivers, is expected to drop sharply as manufacturing volumes increase. With an estimated 2bn radios currently in use around the world, electronics manufacturers look forward to a huge new market for digital replacements. Digital audio is being enthusiastically embraced in Europe, where the BBC and Germany's Institut fur Rundfunktechnik are conducting tests, in addition to the French work. Prospects seem less bright in the US, however, where small regional radio stations are resisting the introduction of expensive new technology. At an international conference in Montreux last month organised by the European Broadcasting Union and the National Association of Broadcasters of the US, a speaker from NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, hailed the European DAB system as 'the best system for terrestrial DAB'. Digital radio has been given added impetus by the allocation of frequency for satellite sound broadcasting by the World Administrative Radio Conference (Warc-92) held in Torremolinos earlier this year. The frequency band that was allocated by the WARC is particularly well suited to satellite DAB. However, the bands allocated are currently in use in many countries and are not expected to be entirely free until 2007. Meanwhile, discussions are being held between several countries on agreeing a frequency range for terrestrial services. In Europe, it is likely that frequency bands generally used by television will be opened up as 'parking' bands for DAB services to be run in parallel with FM until sufficient receivers have been installed to make a switch from FM to DAB possible, says Mr Price. As for the arm-chair record store, the vast amount of information involved would require transmission via cable systems rather than broadcasting. Such services are already being offered in the US by several television cable operators. The thorny issue of copyright protection for music distributed over cable or digital broadcast systems and then copied on to tape or disk by subscribers has yet to be addressed. However, since TV viewers are free to record programmes, it seems likely that arm-chair record store services will emerge in time.</p>

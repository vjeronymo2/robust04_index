			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL COURT CLERK WINS SETTLEMENT OVER ENGLISH-ONLY ORDER  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Claims Board on Friday approved a settlement of $85,000  to a Latino court clerk who filed a discrimination lawsuit suit saying that  three Huntington Park Municipal Court judges forced her to speak only in  English while on the job.  </P> <P> County attorneys recommended the settlement for Alva Gutierrez, saying the cost  of defending the lawsuit would far exceed the settlement amount. The case has  been moving through federal courts for the last four years. Last November, the  U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld another court's decision that threw  out the English-only ruling.  </P> <P> The settlement must still be approved by a U.S. District Court judge.  Gutierrez's attorney, Gloria Allred, said the three judges who issued the order  to Gutierrez were still opposed to a settlement and wanted to appeal the case  to the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The claims board award comes nearly five years after Gutierrez filed suit  against the county after the three judges ordered employees to speak English  except on breaks and during lunch. The judges said they acted in response to  complaints from several clerks who said Gutierrez had used insulting remarks  about them while speaking in Spanish.  </P> <P> Soon after the judges issued their English-only order, Gutierrez went on  medical leave. After suing the judges, she also filed a separate action with  the county Civil Service Commission alleging discrimination. The commission  ruled that the English-only rule violated Civil Service guidelines prohibiting  discrimination against county employees but stopped short of trying to reverse  the judges' order.  </P> <P> "From what the attorneys said it seems like it is definitely in the best  interest of the county to settle," said claims board member Nancy Singer. The  board approved the settlement 3 to 0.  </P> <P> Gutierrez could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> In the decision dismissing the English-only rule, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge  Stephen Reinhardt wrote that such directives "generally have an adverse impact  on protected groups" and can "create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation  and intimidation." Reinhardt also ruled that the Municipal Court judges would  have to answer pretrial questions about their decision to adopt the rule.  </P></p>

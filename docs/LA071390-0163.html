			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA TO THIN SHEEP HERD  </P> <P> Two million older sheep will be killed in controlled shootings around the  country to thin out the country's sheep population estimated at a record 175  million head, officials said today.  </P> <P> Farmers said they will begin the mass shootings as early as next week because  many old ewes, held over when wool prices were higher, are now being sold for  as little as 10 cents each.  </P> <P> "It's sad, but some of the sheep aren't worth as much as a bullet," said one  farmer. Earth movers will likely be used to dig trenches to bury the sheep,  other farmers said.  </P></p>

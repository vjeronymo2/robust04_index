			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters Holdings Few companies are robust enough these days to increase their capital expenditure and dividends by a quarter and still be left with increased cash at the year-end. But with a rating topping those of the giant drugs companies, Reuters has to move at the speed of light. Its fortunes depend on smoothly rolling out a stream of blockbusting products which are both tricky and costly to develop and market. Once successfully launched, they produce an embarrassment of riches. But that leaves Reuters looking slightly uncomfortable with its Pounds 710m cash pile. The more generous dividend policy is one way of disbursing the money. A special one-off payment remains a possibility. But Reuters appears intent on investing most of the cash in new activities. The speed and success of this investment will largely determine whether it can retain its premium rating. Reuters has a host of options; the concern is that few appear to offer the same returns as its core business. The company's interest in Visnews and ITN highlights its ambitions in television but rewards will be slow in coming. With the core dealing services experiencing more intense competition and with the pipeline of new products progressing more slowly than the company would like, Reuters may come under some short-term pressure. Like the drugs stocks, Reuters may be heading for a rerating.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anne Segall and Christopher Lockwood report: "Tax Rises </F> Will Put Brake on Britain's Recovery, Says EC"]    [Text] Last month's tax increases will depress consumer  spending causing the economy to falter next year just as the  rest of Europe accelerates out of recession, the European  Commission claimed yesterday.    Mr Henning Christophersen, Commission vice president, said  that after leading Europe in 1994 Britain was likely to  underperform its main Continental rivals in 1995.    The commission has raised its expectations for Europe and is  now looking for overall growth of 16 per cent this year and 2.5  per cent in 1995. The new forecasts came as the German  Bundesbank announced an unexpected half point cut -- to 4 per  cent -- in its key discount rate, thereby underpinning the  optimism about European growth.    The forecast for the British economy is being cut to 2.3 per  cent next year, down from an original 2.7 per cent and below  Government projection for this year of 2.5 per cent growth.    However, the commission's pessimism is not shared by the  majority of independent economists in Britain. They believe  that as consumer spending slows, the momentum of the economy  will be maintained through higher exports and rising levels of  investment.    This view is supported by a Confederation of British  Industry  survey which yesterday revealed that exports have become a key  factor in the revival of industry.    All eleven regions of the country are now benefiting from  higher order levels, the first time this has happened for five  years, the survey reveals.    A slowdown in consumption would not be unwelcome to the  authorities. Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of  England, said last night that steady and sustained growth would  be preferable to the kind of booms of the past which would lead  to an inevitable bust.    Speaking in the City, Mr George said: "If we are patient, we  now have the best opportunity that I can recall to achieve  continuing, steady expansion that can be sustained through much  of the rest of the decade. Now I know that some people say,  `That's all very well, but it still doesn't feel much like a  recovery. Demand is not like it was in the boom; house prices  are not going up much; and I still don't feel much better off.'    "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid the  excesses of the late 1980s, which felt wonderfully good in the  short-term, but which were the root cause of the misery that  followed."    A survey from the Institute of Directors, due out today,  will  also report the most significant increase in orders, business  volume and profits since the start of the recovery. The picture  of an economy which is still gathering momentum was underlined  yesterday by figures showing an increase in manufacturing output  of 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year -- the fastest  quarterly growth rate since 1989.    Recovery in Europe would be welcomed by British businesses  which have been struggling to increase sales on the Continent  despite a competitive pound. Surveys suggest that the  improvement in the European economy has already had a beneficial  impact on export orders in Britain.    The commission's forecasts are not all negative. Britain's  borrowing requirement is expected to go on falling, to well  below the EC average next year, as will its unemployment rate.  It calculates that unemployment in Britain will fall to 9.3 per  cent in 1995, compared to 9.5 per cent in Germany, 11.4 per cent  in France and 11.7 per cent in Italy.    Mr Christophersen said: "The recovery in all EC countries is  stronger than we had thought... the only exception is the UK."</p>

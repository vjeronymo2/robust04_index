			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLYWOOD PLANT SLATED TO SHUT TEMPORARILY  </P> <P> Champion International Corp. will temporarily close its Roseburg plywood plant  Friday for at least two to four weeks due to market conditions, officials said.  </P> <P> The 400 employees of the company's only Oregon facility were notified of the  closing this week, said Tucker Hill, a Western regional spokesman for Champion  in Missoula, Mont.  </P> <P> "The price of logs has been going up substantially more than the increase in  the price of products, so the gap is widening," Hill said. "We'd like to see  two to four weeks to see how things stabilize."  </P></p>

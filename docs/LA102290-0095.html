			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT RESCUED FROM FREEWAY LEDGE  </P> <P> A 21-year-old man fleeing police jumped over a freeway guardrail early Sunday  morning and then clung to a ledge above a 100-foot drop while officers pulled  him to safety.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol and Santa Ana police officers were pursuing a suspect  in a stolen car southbound on the Costa Mesa Freeway about 2:30 a.m. At the  point where the freeway merges with the southbound San Diego Freeway, the car  crashed into a guardrail and the driver, Erik Aquino of Santa Ana, jumped over  it, Police Sgt. Bob Ensley said.  </P> <P> Aquino apparently did not realize that the rail was 100 feet above ground,  Ensley said.  </P> <P> Aquino somehow managed to grab onto a four-inch concrete ledge about three feet  down. Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dan Beaumarchais hung over the railing, his legs  held by CHP officers Al Montoya and Barry Batsford, and pulled Aquino back up.  </P> <P> Ensley said Aquino clung to the ledge for several minutes before officers were  able to rescue him. He was uninjured.  </P> <P> "He was quite lucky to get out of that alive," Ensley said.  </P> <P> Aquino was arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle. His three  passengers were detained for questioning.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Beijing and London near HK airport accord An extraordinary week of Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong's future was capped yesterday when leaders of the British and Chinese teams instructed subordinates to prepare a draft agreement on the financing of the colony's multi-billion dollar airport. The UK and China have been arguing about how to finance the HKDollars 158bn (Pounds 13.3bn) project for the past two years. Yesterday's comments amounted to the most positive sign to date that an agreement is in the offing. The intensive negotiations come ahead of the Hong Kong's Legislative Council's vote next Wednesday on Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation. Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's senior representative to the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which oversees the transfer of sovereignty, said he hoped an agreement could be reached by Thursday or earlier. On Friday the Hong Kong government plans to ask the Legislative Council (LegCo) for HKDollars 15bn to start work on construction of the airport terminal and runway. Mr Guo Fengmin, his Chinese counterpart, said the two had decided to entrust to experts the writing of 'a draft agreement of the important points for representatives of the two sides to sign, making an agreement between the two sides.' There was optimism in the UK camp that the two would reach an agreement. 'I think we will get there in the end,' an official said, 'but we have gone into drafting and this takes time.' The UK wants as detailed a statement as possible, while China prefers to keep it general, and officials concede that that provides plenty of room for cavilling. In particular, the UK wants a deal which bankers will lend against and this will require 'clear evidence of China's support' for the project. The airport and its connecting railway will cost about HKDollars 83bn, HKDollars 23bn of which has to be borrowed in international markets. To satisfy China's concerns the agreement is also likely to contain a limitation on the aggregate borrowings of the corporations building the airport and its railway as well as enhanced oversight of the project's cost effectiveness. No one is sure how long the drafting of the agreement will take although some officials suggested it could take longer than usual. Drafting of the airport agreement is proceeding in parallel with attempts to bridge the gap dividing the UK and China on the issue of military land in Hong Kong. In a surprise move on Thursday the JLG was suspended to allow experts to thrash out details of an agreement. The UK has already conceded that the People's Liberation Army will be stationed in Hong Kong's business district and has agreed to build the Chinese navy a new port on Stonecutters Island in Victoria harbour. The Hong Kong government will pay for work - estimated at HKDollars 3.5bn - done on these facilities before 1997. But because the UK is unable to guarantee that LegCo will approve this sum China has asked London to indemnify the work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The 11th conference of the  Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] foreign ministers concluded its  sessions in Cairo today and issued a final document that  included NAM's stand on political and economic developments and  changes in the international situation.    The document included NAM's stand on issues of disarmament,  international security and economic cooperation, the  environment, development, South-South cooperation, human rights,  social developments, regional issues, resolving conflicts, and  UN reform.    The document stressed that the international situation  remains "extremely fluid," shrouded in confusion, and  characterized by a growing tendency toward focusing primarily on  the interests and concerns of a limited number of advanced  countries.    The NAM foreign ministers called in their final document for  defining new priorities in the world order and for paying more  attention to the principal development requirements and the need  for reconciling the new criteria created in international  relations to the cultural characters of developing countries.    The ministers stressed that the continuation of the problems  connected with poverty, unemployment, developmental  backwardness, illiteracy, environmental deterioration,  terrorism, and the drug trade will result in political and  social tensions and this in turn will negatively affect  international peace and security.    The final document stressed the need for the contribution of  the regional economic groupings to the achievement of the free  flow of trade, investments, and technology across international  borders and integrated commercial blocs. They expressed hope  that these groupings will help establish and strengthen an open  and energetic international trade order.    The ministers underlined the importance of the contacts that  NAM has with all the advanced industrialized countries in order  to expand the North-South dialogue while simultaneously  strengthening South-South cooperation.    Regarding regional conflicts, the NAM foreign ministers  stressed the need to strengthen the existing international  mechanisms for resolving conflicts that have remained without a  solution so far. The final document noted that the NAM  Coordination Bureau [words indistinct]. It underlined the need  to unify efforts for the sake of upholding tolerance as a solid  concept in conducting international relations and as an  indispensable factor in international behavior, in addition to  being a principal concept in the UN Charter.    The document reaffirmed the importance of not marginalizing  the role of countries that are continuing their endeavors to  play a principal role in international affairs. It noted the  need for the international organizations to effect fundamental  changes in their structures so that they can react to the  arising challenges that are imposed by the new international  state of affairs. The NAM foreign ministers decided to boost  their efforts to attain this objective.    The final document said the NAM foreign ministers discussed  during their conference the role of their movement in light of  changes that have recently taken place on international  relations.    They confirmed once again the importance of enabling the  continued operation of the movement and its follow-up of new  international circumstances.    The final document clarified the concept of nonalignment  which has embodied the hopes of mankind for comprehensive  disarmament and the right to self-determination; guaranteed  human rights, man's basic freedoms, and economic development;  established an international economic system; and developed  human resources and coexistence among the various regimes,  cultures, and societies.    The document said that this is why the ministers decided to  continue making efforts to give NAM greater effectiveness.    In this regard, the ministers welcomed the increase in the  number of members in the Movement. They believe that this  indicates there is continued interest in the role of NAM.    They affirmed that NAM should adopt a program that would  enable it to absorb the wide-ranging interests of its members  and the amendments that need to be introduced into the structure  and methods of the movement.    The ministers recommended that relations between NAM and the  Group of 77 should be strengthened. The developing countries'  stands should also be advanced as a whole with the objective of  bolstering their negotiations' strength with the progressive  industrial states.    The ministers affirmed once again their firm belief that the  United Nations is the most appropriate international authority  for preserving international peace and security and for  cooperation for development purposes. They praised the role of  the team working on reorganizing and reforming the United  Nations which was formed by the Jakarta summit. They stressed  that the process of reforming the United Nations should take  into consideration the important changes in international  relations and should re-activate the role and duties of the  General Assembly.    The ministers see a need for discussing the process of  reforming the UN Security Council, modifying its structure, and  increasing its members on democratic and geographic basis. NAM  representation among the permanent members of the Security  Council should be increased.    The ministers once again affirmed the need to conduct the  Security Council's decision-making process more openly. In  order to realize this objective, they urged the Security Council  to convene a larger number of official and open sessions when  discussing any issue and before making any decision. This would  allow greater participation on the largest scale possible.    The ministers urged the Security Council to establish a  basic  system for regular and direct consultations with those countries  contributing forces [to the United Nations] during the  decision-making process with respect to setting up and  administering the peacekeeping process. The ministers called  for taking the appropriate measures that allow the non-members  who are interested in participating in any mechanism, such as  any special sub-committee the Council might form, to participate.    Affirming the importance of the UN peacekeeping operations,  the ministers called on NAM to participate in drawing up guiding  principles for the peacekeeping operations that would conform to  the UN Charter and enable the United Nations to contribute more  effectively toward consolidating world peace and security. The  ministers demanded that all peacekeeping operations adhere to  the principles of the UN Charter, have a non-interventionist  character, and be negotiated at the request of the concerned  member states.    The ministers affirmed the need for the peacekeeping  operations to be non-discriminatory in character. They also  demanded that complete openness and constant consultations be a  main factor in the formation of the peacekeeping operations,  which must have a clear mandate, a specific time frame, and  guaranteed financing. Resolutions on the formation of these  operations must include clauses pertaining to the safety of  personnel. The ministers demanded equal opportunity to  facilitate the widest possible participation of the member  states, particularly the developing states, in the peacekeeping  operations.    Regarding NAM's position on decolonization, the ministers  reaffirmed the right of peoples in regions that do not enjoy  autonomy to self-determination and independence, in accordance  with UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 of 14 September 1961.  They affirmed their absolute support for the work of the UN  Decolonization Committee and its effective contribution to the  implementation of the declaration on granting independence to  colonized states and peoples.    Regarding disarmament and world security, the ministers  reaffirmed the stand adopted by NAM in the final document of the  Jakarta summit. They expressed the belief that total  disarmament under effective international supervision remains a  noble goal which must be achieved. They called for clearing the  world of nuclear weapons and urged the disarmament conference to  give priority to negotiations on an international agreement  banning the use of nuclear weapons or the threat to use them.  They urged the disarmament conference to work to conclude a  comprehensive international treaty banning nuclear tests. They  called on states that possess nuclear weapons to stop all  experimental detonation of nuclear weapons until this treaty is  concluded.    The ministers stressed that the creation of nuclear-free  zones is a first necessary step to achieve the goal of  eliminating the weapons of mass destruction. They welcomed UN  General Assembly Resolution 48/71, adopted without a vote and  dated 16 December 1993, calling for the creation of a  nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. This ideas was first  proposed by Egypt and Iran. The ministers praised and called  for the implementation of President Husni Mubarak's initiative  declaring the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass  destruction. They expressed the belief that the removal of  nuclear weapons from the region will lead to the removal of  weapons of mass destruction. They urged Israel to get rid of  its nuclear weapons, to join the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty, and to subject all its nuclear installations to the  comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy  Agency. The ministers welcomed the progress made in drafting a  treaty or agreement declaring Africa a nuclear-free zone. They  also welcomed Mongolia's 1992 declaration making its territory  free of nuclear weapons.    On NAM's position on international economic cooperation, the  ministers expressed the belief that it is necessary to  adequately treat the usual problems of the world economy. The  nonaligned states and other developing countries must contribute  toward the formation of a new world economic order. They noted  the low growth rate in the developing countries, the debt  burdens, and the low prices of basic commodities.    The ministers stressed the need for coordination between the  Caracas working program of the Group of 77 and NAM's working  program for economic cooperation. A joint coordinating  committee must consolidate relations between the two groups.    The ministers affirmed the importance of South-South  cooperation as a basic factor in the efforts to reorganize  international relations and as a vital tool to expedite  development in the developing states. They asked the  ministerial economic cooperation committee to give priority to  discussing this issue and to submit its recommendations in this  regard to NAM's 11th Summit Conference, which will discuss these  recommendations and issue the appropriate resolutions.    The ministers called on the nonaligned countries and other  developing countries to intensify and strengthen current efforts  for South-South cooperation, to use new tangible forms and  priorities for cooperation, and to adopt practical methods to  implement this cooperation.    Concerning the GATT, the ministers stressed that developing  nations should be accorded the benefits spelled out by  preferential agreements and that they must be given appropriate  financial and technological aid to be able to diversify their  exports and compensate the direct losses they will suffer as a  result of the liberalization of world trade.    The ministers announced that the agreements, rules, and new  structures agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting must yield  greater opportunities to the countries of the world,  particularly developing countries, to reach new markets, expand  world trade, raise incomes, and provide more jobs.    The ministers voiced concern about certain parties' tendency  to circumvent the multinational structures for liberalizing  trade which were agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting. They  said this is done by exploiting environmental and social issues  as pretexts for new forms of protectionism.    The ministers urged the developed countries to limit their  coercive and unilateral economic measures against developing  countries for political purposes. They also asked them not to  impose political conditions on international cooperation. They  called on the world community to adopt firm and effective  measures to end such practices.    The ministers underlined their belief in facilitating and  encouraging private sector business activities in view of the  private sector's major role in promoting cooperation among the  countries of the South. They expressed satisfaction at the  implementation of the constituent treaty of the African economic  group, seeing it as a step toward greater South-South  cooperation.    The ministers again asserted that the international trade  preferential system is an important method of strengthening and  expanding trade among developing countries and urged the  countries that have not yet signed this agreement to do so.    The ministers emphasized the United Nations' major role in  promoting international cooperation for the sake of economic and  social development. They welcomed the UN General Assembly's  resolution calling for renewed dialogue among the world's  nations to encourage development through partnership. They said  that this dialogue is important for mutual interests and benefit.    The ministers called for canceling or at least reducing  debts  stemming from the developing countries' official debts and urged  the prompt adoption of measures on the issue of the commercial  debts that these countries owe. They urged multinational  financial institutions to continue their current backing for the  reduction of debts and the costs of servicing them and called  for solutions to this problem that would help the economic  development of countries that are facing tremendous difficulties  in servicing their debt.    They called on creditor countries, private banks, and  multinational financial institutions to extend new and suitable  financial aid to developing debtor countries, particularly those  with low or medium revenues that are burdened with debt.    The ministers urged holding a new international conference  to  finance development projects and expressed their worry about the  low levels of financing offered for the economic development of  poor countries. They called on the developed nations to allot  0.7 percent of their gross national product for this type of  financing.    The ministers stressed the importance of linkage between  trade and currency issues and the need to improve the trade  environment so that the developing nations can carry out their  development plans.    They welcomed the Moroccan king's proposal to establish a  high-level inter-governmental team to study new mechanisms for  international economic negotiations and to promote greater  cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade  Organization.    The ministers called on the United Nations to assume a major  role in backing the developing nations' efforts to build up  scientific and technological capabilities and said more  opportunities must be given for them to acquire new technology  with favorable conditions. They demanded that developed,  industrial nations stop resorting to the restrictions they now  use to limit the export of technology to developing countries.    The ministers welcomed the expanded cooperation program,  adopted by the Nonaligned Movement's presidency, which will help  organize a UN conference on human settlements in Turkey in 1996.    The ministers voiced grave concern over the continuing  deterioration in global food and agricultural supplies,  particularly in the developing world. They emphasized the  Nonaligned Movement's advocacy of a prompt and concerted effort  to solve the problem of hunger in the world. In this connection  they welcomed the formation of an advisory team of experts on  food security and approved the recommendations that this team  made during its meeting in Jakarta in January 1994.    The ministers stressed the need to attach special attention  to the critical economic conditions in Africa and voiced grave  concern about the fact that numerous agreements on ways of  handling this issue that were agreed upon at several  international forums were not implemented.    The ministers voiced satisfaction with the immense progress  made by some developing Asian and Pacific economies and the  existing cooperation between those countries and other regional  partners.    Concerning the Nonaligned Movement's stance on the  environment and development problems, the ministers called for  intense efforts to preserve the environment and reiterated their  adherence to a balanced, integrated approach to development such  as that which appeared in the Rio Declaration on the environment  and development. They also stressed that states have a  sovereign right to utilize their intrinsic resources according  to their environmental and developmental policies and that these  states should take care that their activities do not harm the  environment of other countries or areas beyond their national  jurisdiction.    The ministers expressed the hope that commitments to  implementing the 21st century agenda concerning new and  supplementary financial resources and technology transfer  easily, as indicated by the Rio Declaration, will be honored.    The ministers also expressed the belief that the developing  countries' financial and technological resources should be  commensurate with their actual requirements.    The ministers emphasized the importance of the current  negotiations to devise an international agreement to combat  desertification, especially in Africa, and reiterated the G-77's  stand on the need to set up a fund to implement the agreement.    The ministers approved the resolution adopted at the second  conference of the Basel Accord, under which any cross-border  transportation of toxic waste undertaken to get rid of such  waste by the countries of the cooperation and economic  development organization by dumping it in other countries that  are not member states of that organization should be banned by  1997. They also stressed the importance of devising new  charters [word indistinct] to preserve and run fish stocks in  overlapping areas and stocks of fish on the high seas.    The ministers noted that the developing countries' lack of  adequate basic structures to prevent disasters and minimize  their effects and the lack of relief structures made them the  countries most affected by these disasters and they recommended  that the nonaligned countries intensify cooperation in this  field.    The ministers reaffirmed the importance of the UN Maritime  Law Agreement to the [word indistinct] of the member states and  stressed the need to ratify the agreement worldwide.    The ministers renewed their countries' commitment to their  pledges to consolidate world respect, care, and protection of  all human rights and everyone's basic freedoms according to the  UN Charter. They emphasized that democracy provides an open  system to protect and enhance human rights and expressed their  deep concern about random massacres perpetrated in areas of  armed conflict.    As regards human rights, the ministers reaffirmed that,  although human rights are of a universal nature, they should be  viewed by considering the importance of various national and  regional characteristics and historical, cultural, and religious  backgrounds.    The ministers reiterated that all forms of racism, social  discrimination, new forms of racism, and hatred of foreigners  constitute a grave violation of human rights and should be  combated with all means. They expressed their profound concern  over the emergence of stringent immigration policies in many  developed countries imposing firm restrictions on people's  movement and leading to hatred of foreigners.    The ministers affirmed that the right to development is  universal and that the international community should support  collective cooperation the achievement of which requires  devising new, suitable development policies.    The ministers emphasized that terrorism is a violation of  human rights and openly condemned all forms of terrorism. They  stressed that sponsoring terrorism, allowing the use of a  particular country for planning, organizing, provoking, or  committing terrorist acts against other countries is a breach of  the principles of the UN Charter. They urged the international  community to enhance cooperation in combating the danger of  terrorism anywhere, no matter who perpetrates such an act or who  is subjected to it at national, regional, and world levels.    The ministers discussed the status of human rights in the  provinces of the former Yugoslavia and stated that ethnic  cleansing was the direct cause of the bulk of the grave and  organized violations of human rights and that their primary  victims are the Muslims who are threatened with  near-annihilation. They urged all countries to adopt immediate  measures to combat this odious practice and expressed concern at  the continued violation of Muslims' human rights in Sanjaq and  Kosovo.    As regards social development, the ministers reiterated that  structural adjustment programs and foreign debts should not be  allowed to have a negative effect on human development programs.  They also affirmed the Nonaligned Movement's commitment to  enhancing international cooperation in social development and  stressed the need for national efforts and international  cooperation to give priority to eliminating poverty, increasing  productive labor, creating a suitable international social and  economic climate to overcome the obstacles blocking economic and  social development.    The ministers renewed the Movement's support for holding the  fourth women's labor conference for equality, development, and  peace, due to be held in Beijing in 1995. They decided to  coordinate their efforts to devise a working program to expedite  the removal of impediments blocking women's full participation  in various fields.    The ministers reiterated that child rights require more  protection and improvement. They called for consolidated  efforts to improve conditions for children all over the world  and expressed concern at critical conditions for children in  many parts of the world as a result of improper social and  economic circumstances, natural disasters, armed disputes,  illiteracy, hunger, and disability. They condemned the  exploitation of children in armed disputes and called on all NAM  governments that have not as yet ratified the child rights  agreement to do so as soon as possible.    The ministers suggested that member governments allocate 20  percent of their budgets to human development, particularly to  children, and called for urgent measures to prevent the  exploitation of children in prostitution and the distribution of  pornography, as well as the illicit trade in children, all of  which are poisons that affect children, particularly in  developing states.    The ministers noted that the heads of states and governments  addressed an appeal during the Jakarta summit to all competent  UN agencies to intensify efforts to work out a practical plan to  develop youth. They called for setting a date to hold the UN  General Assembly meeting on youth issues in 1995.    The foreign ministers voiced their deep concern at the risks  involved in the abuse of and trade in drugs and at the mental  influence of drugs that still undermines society's ethical and  physical aspects and the life and future of new generations,  particularly in view of the growing demand for drugs in  developing countries. They drew attention to the growing links  between drug traffickers and terrorists, which left a negative  impact on peace and stability in different corners of the world.  They called for coordinated and exhaustive international action  that addresses the various aspects of the problem, including  efforts to curb poverty and increase development aid to  developing states to allow their inhabitants, particularly  farmers and their families, to break free from the circle of  drug dealing.    The NAM foreign ministers reiterated support for the  principles of national sovereignty and noninterference in the  internal affairs of other states. They noted that the issue of  drug trafficking should not be turned into an instrument for the  pursuit of political goals. They appealed to nonaligned and  developing states to enhance cooperation in fighting drugs.    Touching on general political issues, the foreign ministers  reiterated their support for the peace process that started with  the Madrid conference to achieve a just, lasting, and  all-embracing peace in the Middle East on the basis of UN  Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle. They  recognized the significance of the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September and the  agreement signed in Cairo on 4 May, which represents a first  step toward implementing that declaration. They also recognized  the importance of the Jordanian-Israeli joint agenda, hoping to  see urgent progress along the other tracks through Israel's  compliance with the basic prerequisites of peace in the Middle  East.    The NAM ministers reiterated that comprehensive peace in the  Middle East must result in Israel's full withdrawal from all the  Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, from the Syrian  Golan, from the Jordan territories occupied since 1967, and from  the occupied Lebanese territories. They stressed that this  peace should also result in endorsing the lawful national rights  of the Palestinian people, primarily their right to  self-determination on their national soil; providing guarantees  for peace for all regional states within safe and  internationally-recognized borders; and solving the problems of  Palestinian refugees and Israeli settlements. The Iranian  delegation objected to these two paragraphs.    Referring to UN Security Council Resolution 252, which calls  on Israel to revoke all the measures that changed the legal  status of the city of Jerusalem, the ministers reiterated that  all the legislative and administrative measures Israel adopted  as an occupation authority, particularly announcing Jerusalem as  the capital of Israel, are null and void. They affirmed that  the issue of Jerusalem cannot be resolved by unilateral measures.    The foreign ministers reiterated that the Israeli  settlements  in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since  1967 are illegal, constitute a hurdle on the road to peace, and  should be dismantled.    They once again emphasized the need to take sufficient  measures to guarantee peace and protection for the Palestinians  in the occupied territories. They called on Israel to take  measures to facilitate the return of Palestinians deported since  1967, to speed up the release of detained Palestinians, and to  respect the basic freedoms of the Palestinian people. They  stressed that all the measures Israel took to change the  features and legal status of Syria's occupied Golan Heights are  null and void and constitute a blatant violation of  international law.    The ministers praised the recent positive developments in  Lebanon represented by the continuing progress in the process of  national reconciliation. They called for respect for Lebanon's  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. They  condemned the continuing Israeli occupation of parts of southern  Lebanon and western al-Biqa' Valley. They affirmed the need for  the reconstruction of Lebanon.    The ministers reviewed the situation between Iraq and Kuwait  and stressed that all NAM member states are committed to respect  the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of both  Kuwait and Iraq. They also emphasized that the full  implementation of all the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions constitutes the means of establishing peace,  security, and stability in the region. They urged Iraq to  confirm its recognition, clearly and unequivocally, of Kuwait's  sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and demarcated  international borders by accepting Resolution 833, in order to  create a positive climate, leading to security and stability in  the region.    The ministers urged Iraq to complete the implementation of  the relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the release of  Kuwaiti detainees and the settlement of the issue of missing  persons. The Iraqi delegation objected to this paragraph.    The ministers noticed the progress in the ongoing contacts  between Iraq on the one hand and the Special Committee and the  IAEA on the other with a view to implementing Paragraph C of  Security Council Resolution 687. The ministers called for an  end to human suffering in accordance with the relevant Security  Council resolutions. The Iraqi delegation demanded that the  words "of the Iraqi people" be entered after the words "human  suffering."    Regarding Yemen, the ministers expressed their support for  the ongoing efforts to solve the conflict through peaceful  means, establish peace and stability, and resume the dialogue  among the Yemeni parties, particularly Security Council  Resolution 924/1994, including an immediate cessation of  fighting, an end to supplies of arms and other military hardware  which could contribute to continued fighting, and the dispatch  of a fact-finding mission to the area, as soon as possible, to  help resume the dialogue among the Yemeni parties.    The ministers affirmed that political differences cannot be  settled by the use of arms. They urged all Yemeni parties to  return immediately to the negotiating table so as to allow a  peaceful resolution of their disputes, the restoration of peace  and stability, and the safeguarding of the interests of the  Yemeni people. This will positively contribute to maintaining  peace in the whole region. The Yemeni delegation objected to  this paragraph's non-mention of Yemeni unity.    Regarding Libya, the ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance  of  Security Council Resolution 731. They reaffirmed their hope  that the concerned parties will find a peaceful and just  settlement that will secure the interests and rights of all  parties in accordance with international law and the principles  of the UN Charter. They expressed their concern over the  negative consequences of the continuation of the crisis on the  Libyan people, the neighboring countries, and the whole region.    The ministers urged the parties concerned to refrain from  any  action that would result in escalation and to settle the crisis  in a peaceful and speedy manner in accordance with Chapter 6 of  the UN Charter. They welcomed Arab League Resolution 5373  issued on 27 March 1994 and urged the Security Council to take  into consideration the new proposal this resolution contains  with a view to finding a peaceful and fair solution.    Regarding African issues, the ministers welcomed the OAU's  establishment of a mechanism for the prevention, management, and  resolution of conflicts in accordance with a resolution issued  by the conference of the African heads of state and government  held in Cairo in June 1993. They expressed the hope that the  establishment of this pioneer mechanism would bring a new  institutional dynamism to deal with conflicts in Africa.    The ministers welcomed South Africa's membership in the OAU  and NAM. They wished the new republic a successful and  prosperous future. They paid special tribute to President  Nelson Mandela as a leader of stature commanding the respect of  the international community and the confidence of the people of  South Africa. They welcomed the UN Security Council resolution  lifting the economic sanctions against South Africa.    The ministers welcomed the Addis Ababa agreement signed by  all Somali factions on 27 March 1993. They praised the efforts  of President Husni Mubarak in his capacity as OAU chairman and  the efforts of Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi on behalf of the  OAU to achieve national reconciliation in Somalia. The  ministers agreed to explore the possibility of holding an  international conference on Somalia. They urged the  international community to adopt an effective and large-scale  program for reconstruction and development in Somalia.    The ministers voiced extreme concern over the tragic  conditions facing the Angolan people as a consequence of UNITA's  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] refusal to  accept the results of the September 1992 elections and its  resumption of military actions, causing grievous loss of life  and property damage. The ministers urged UNITA to accept  unconditionally the results of the country's democratic  elections and to negotiate with the government in good faith so  that the current negotiations in Lusaka would produce an  agreement capable of maintaining a lasting peace in Angola.  They appealed to the world community to send prompt  humanitarian aid to the residents of Angolan areas that have  suffered war damage.    Regarding the Rwandan crisis, the ministers expressed  profound regret over the tragic events there which have  displaced or killed hundreds of thousands of people and created  huge numbers of refugees. They urged an immediate halt to the  violence and killings ravaging that country and called on the  concerned parties to adopt a spirit of national reconciliation,  end the violence, and form a new government.    The ministers appealed to the world community to send  generous relief supplies and other humanitarian aid to the  Rwandan people and refugees. They also called for additional  economic, financial, and technical assistance to rebuild that  country.    The ministers expressed their appreciation to the Burundian  Government and people for their commitment to national  reconciliation. They welcomed the formation of a state council  and a new transitional government in Liberia on 7 March 1994,  regarding this as a positive step toward stability in Liberia.    The ministers expressed solidarity with the Sierra Leonean  Government's efforts to repulse the raids and rebellion of the  United Revolutionary Front. They urged this government to  continue its efforts to put a quick end to the rebellion.    The ministers praised the recent positive achievements in  Mozambique illustrated by the implementation of the peace  agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance].    They also welcomed the Libyan-Chadian agreement to adhere to  [the international ruling on] the Aouzou Strip.    They reiterated the Nonaligned Movement's support for the UN  efforts to organize a referendum in the Western Sahara.    As for the Korean crisis, the ministers expressed concern  over the continued partition of the Korean peninsula and voiced  support for the Korean people's efforts to reunite their  country. They noted the importance of maintaining peace and  security in the peninsula for the sake of the Korean nation's  prosperity. They expressed hope that the Korean nuclear issue  would be settled peacefully by way of negotiations and dialogue.    Concerning Afghanistan, the ministers expressed concern over  the fighting there and appealed to the Afghan leaders to observe  an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, settle their  differences by peaceful dialogue, and form a stable government  on the basis of free and fair elections.    As to the Latin American region, the ministers acknowledged  that this region has effectively participated in nonaligned  activities and that its contributions to the shaping of a new  world order are indispensable.    Regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina the ministers welcomed the  agreements recently signed in Washington between the Bosnian and  Croatian leaders and expressed hope that further positive steps  will be made. They voiced concern over the acts of  extermination and ethnic cleansing against the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirmed that the UN Security Council  should impose a total halt to fighting all over that country.    The conference adopted a resolution calling for respect for  Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The  resolution called for holding a UN-sponsored international  conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to attain a cease-fire and  declare the entire country a safe haven.</p>

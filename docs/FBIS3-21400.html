			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Hamas' Admission of Killing </F> DFLP Member Kindles Political Dispute, Could Lead to Worse"]    [Text] Escalation between the Islamic Resistance Movement  (Hamas) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah, continued on 24 February to an  extent that threatens continuation of the alliance that exists  between the two groups, within the framework of the alliance of  Palestinian forces opposed to the self-government agreement  between Israel and the PLO.    Perhaps the most prominent development, which appeared on 24  February, was Hamas' admission of responsibility by its military  wing--the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions--for the murder of  DFLP member Yusuf 'Abu-Lafi on 15 February. The secretary  general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqqaqi,  told AL-HAYAH that this development "could negatively influence  the alliance's continuation." He added: "Continued escalation  between the two groups could affect the alliance but will not  destroy it. As for the matter of killing Abu-Lafi, that is most  serious. Therefore, we have agreed that it is a private matter  among ourselves."    The case of Abu-Lafi's murder, after having been abducted  for  three days, increased tension at the meeting of the 10 factions'  leaders at the beginning of this week, although Hamas did not  claim responsibility for the murder during that meeting. It  asked that it be referred to the leadership to make a final  decision. However, the DFLP stated that Hamas was responsible,  pointing out that the posters hanging in the streets of Khan  Yunis were signed by Hamas. This led to tension in the meeting,  and a committee was formed, chaired by Talal Naji, a leader of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command [PFLP-GC] (led by Ahmad Jibril). Each faction is to  submit an official report, in which it will clearly state its  views. An internal memorandum will be issued with the  investigation's results.    Hamas' representative in Damascus, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa,  confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas was responsible for Abu-Lafi's  death, "because he was an agent of the Israeli occupation  forces. He was killed after his dealings with them were  confirmed." He stated that he had personally given Mr. Naji a  detailed report "exposing Abu-Lafi's activities. A video  cassette accompanied the report with pictures confirming our  opinion, stressing that he deserved to die."    DFLP sources, for their part, told AL-HAYAH that "Abu-Lafi's  blood will not be shed in vain. The hands of Red Star battalions  (the front's military wing) will reach out for those who  committed this crime." The sources stated: "Abu-Lafi was a noble  fighter. Representatives from the National Action Committee and  prominent national figures, except for Hamas representatives,  participated in his funeral."    The sources added: "No one has the right to judge people."  Abu-Muhammad Mustafa replied vehemently to the accusations that  Hamas bears responsibility for hindering the course of the  alliance. He stressed to AL-HAYAH that the movement was not  backing away from the step it had taken. The first step back  must be taken by them (the DFLP)."    Mustafa added that Hamas refuses to enter a unified slate  with the DFLP in future professional and medical elections,  "because of obstacles that would prevent that. First, there is  the mistrust between the factions in the occupied territories,  as a result of the DFLP's claiming credit for four military  operations that we carried out, and their demands for more seats  than the votes they won." He pointed out that, in the Engineers  Union elections in the Gaza Strip, the DFLP demanded more votes  than they had, and made that a condition before entering a  unified slate with Hamas. "We refused to give them more than  they won. For their part, they refused to enter any future  slate. They lost and did not win any seats; we won six seats."    The Hamas representative in Damascus added that this matter  was nearly repeated in the Doctors' Union elections. "Certain  DFLP and PFLP cadres voted for Fatah, rejecting the alliance  with us. Some others were reluctant, and some were lightweights.  As a result, we entered with the Islamic Jihad in a bloc. The  PFLP and the DFLP were in a bloc, and Fatah was allied with  independents. 'Arafat's group won 11 seats, and we lost."    Abu-Muhammad indicated that the DFLP and the PFLP had  demanded more than their share. "The proof is that they won only  13 percent of the vote compared to our 33 percent. Furthermore,  the largest number of votes went to Muhammad al-'Akluk, Hamas'  candidate, who won 370 votes, compared to 157 votes for the PFLP  candidate, Rabbah Mahna'. The two fronts bear responsibility for  giving in to Fatah because of factionalism. This is one of the  reasons for the mistrust."    Regarding the DFLP's accusing Hamas of fationalism for not  joining with it in a single slate in the Islamic University  elections, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa stressed that "there was no  reason for us to join in a unified slate, because it was  completely decided for us, just like their position in Bayt  Sahur (Gaza) in the Orthodox Club. Consequently, any success for  us or for them was success for the alliance. There was no reason  for us to be on a single slate."    Regarding the question of forming the National and Islamic  Command for the Intifadah, Abu-Muhammad stated that Hamas  rejects forming this command at the present time. He said: "To  form a command like this, everyone must be equal in effective  military action at home. However, Hamas carries out all the  military action and bears all the daily consequences alone.  Forming a command will never suit us, so long as our  demand--that the standing in the alliance and command be in  comparison to the size of each faction and its weight--is  rejected. There must be equality in military fighting, so that  our doubts are not confirmed that they want to profit from our  efforts, Hamas' efforts." He indicated that there was the  possibility of continuing present coordination on the political  level, since political action was different from military and  security action, and because "forming the unified command would  threaten our security. It would be easy to strike at us,  especially after a security agreement is signed between the PLO  and Israel."    In response to the DFLP's charge that Hamas is the faction  that is backing away from the alliance, Abu-Muhammad said: "They  are the ones who began to back away. When we agreed to form a  national, Islamic alliance, they backed away from it, deleting  the word `Islamic.' When they were asked for the reason, they  said that this was their right." He added that the second  retreat was when they did not commit themselves to the  alliance's political program agreed to on 9 October 1993. He  said that "so long as they have not committed themselves to  everything, it is our right not to be obligated when we believe  that our interests would be damaged, because they want to hide  behind Hamas. They don't want confrontation. This is another  indication of mistrust."    With regard to the charge that Hamas has backed away from  holding popular conferences, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa said: "We have  not backed away from this, not for a moment. We understand the  conferences to be political mobilization and instigation and  nothing more. If they want elections, then let the DFLP and the  PFLP be wherever possible in Syria and Lebanon."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the honorable  leader of the Islamic revolution and the guardian of the cause  of Muslims, today in a decree appointed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, the  minister of culture and Islamic guidance, as the head of the  Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and as a member of the Supreme Council of the Cultural  Revolution for a term of five years. The full text of the  eminent leader's decree is as follows:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Now  that through divine blessing the people of Iran are celebrating  the 15th anniversary of the glorious revolution with pride and a  sense of victory; now that the people and the government --  united and steadfast -- have surpassed a long, adventurous march  full of victories as well as difficulties; now that the serving  government, through a great struggle and by taking the  initiative, has removed the major obstacles in the face of  economic progress and national growth and development -- thereby  paving the way toward construction and general welfare with a  speed suited to the conditions of the revolution, the general  conditions of the country require the publicity mechanism of the  Voice and Vision to take on new policies in line with the  nation's progress in all fields in order to balance the cultural  climate of the nation and the accelerating trend of construction  and general growth and development with the bases of the  revolution and the fundamental principles of Islam. Furthermore,  in order to confront the propaganda and cultural onslaught of  arrogance and its lackeys, the new policies should widen the  scope of the media's struggle in the trench of explaining,  deepening, and honoring the glorious principles of the Islamic  revolution, as well as in the trench of explaining the  self-sacrificing efforts of the country's officials, the three  branches of the state, judiciary, executive, legislative,  especially the hard working and relentless judicial branch, with  new, progressive, and rational methods and through a great and  vigilant jihad.    Taking into account the aforementioned, and expressing my  thanks and gratitude for the relentless and continuous efforts  of the esteemed Mohammad Hashemi, who during his term as the  official in charge of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran -- particularly during the imposed Iran-Iraq  war -- carried out great and all-encompassing efforts in  administrating this sensitive and important institution, I  appoint the esteemed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, who is one of the  outstanding scientific and cultural figures of the country and  who has a proud, revolutionary background, as well as a  background of cabinet responsibilities -- and an individual  known for his devotion, piety, and cultural and artistic  experiences -- as the head of the Voice and Vision, as well as a  member of the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution for a term  of five years.    It is expected that he will receive the cooperation of  intelligent colleagues and revolutionary innovators from within  the organization and attract prominent personalities from  outside to produce a new plan and a productive agenda to utilize  the organization's vast resources, turn it into a base for the  development of ideas, culture, and art, and a center for the  guidance of Iran's Muslim people and others who are eager to  hear the voice of revolutionary Iran. A place for the  presentation of the nation's achievements in different fields of  life, science, politics, art, education, and other fields.    Here I deem it necessary to thank the esteemed Supervisory  Council of the IRIB, comprising representatives from the three  powers of judicial, legislative, and executive for their  valuable efforts, and while wishing its scholarly and worthy  members to cooperate with the management of the Voice and  Vision, announce the termination of the Council.    The salient points, which should be observed in the great  new  plan are as follows:    The operation of the Voice and Vision organization should be  aimed at achieving better quality in all its programs. The  quantitative expansion should be put in second place.  Nevertheless, the necessary nationwide transmission to all  corners and rural areas of the country should be given priority.    The structure of the organization should be reviewed and the  necessary changes should be made to its style and productivity.    Cooperation with university scholars and scholastic circles  should be used to raise scientific and social issues and present  new ideas to the public.    In Islamic discussions, attention should be paid to the  quality, depth, and excellence of the issues. Weak and  ambiguous issues and personal tastes should be avoided. In  order to achieve this, wise and calculated cooperation should be  made with religious seminaries and scholars, particularly the  esteemed and prominent scholars of the Qom Seminary.    In general, Voice and Vision should become an open school  for  the presentation of the realities of pure Muhammadan Islam,  peace be upon him and his scion, and the instructions of the Ahl  al-Beit [family of the prophet], peace be upon them, in a noble  and proper way.    In the production of artistic programs, cooperation should  be  made with the country's cultural foundations, such as the  Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Islamic publicity  organization, and artistic circles, in order to make the most  use of them.    The dissemination of information, which is one of the most  important tasks of the Voice and Vision, should find a better  system, better speed, better editorial judgement, as well as  intelligible and correct language, more than before. The Voice  and Vision must use correct Persian, and its language should set  standards. Mispronunciation and misreading must be eliminated  immediately. The Voice and Vision must be the teacher of the  sweet, clear, and powerful Persian language. A number of steps  have been taken in his context, but they should be complemented.    Artistic programs on the Voice and Vision should become  sweet and attractive, with the most sumptuous theatrical arts  containing social, political, and ethical messages in this  all-encompassing medium. Light, empty, and misleading programs  lacking in artistic quality, which are sometimes very expensive  to produce, must be banned forthwith.    The broadcast of banal and sensual music, especially those  types of music that in this branch of the arts lack national  identity and Iranian principles, must be avoided. Music can be  both permitted [halal] and banned [haram]. Its permitted type  should be recognized and used correctly following the clear  instructions of the late Imam [Khomeyni], sanctified be his  dust. Genuine Iranian arts, which suit the spiritual make up  and instincts of our people, should be used more in this context.    In all the programs, the general trend should be toward  confronting the propaganda, cultural and news onslaught of  arrogance. This important principle must be adhered to not only  in news and reports, but also in scientific, social, and  political programs -- especially in artistic and entertaining  programs such as plays, one-off dramas, and serials. This point  should be correctly clarified to all the employees of radio and  television. The alien, attacking culture affects the mind and  actions of the people more through plays and entertaining  programs than through face-to-face talks. This unwanted effect  must be vigilantly and rationally stopped.    On the whole, the Voice and Vision, as the great late Imam,  may he be admitted to God's paradise, had highlighted, should be  a university for all in which religion, ethics, Islamic values,  and the ways and methods of life, as well as new developments in  the world of science and politics -- and new and pioneering  thoughts -- are taught in a clear language comprehensible to all  sectors of society, so that every one, from those with simple  minds to great thinkers and outstanding individuals, can manage  to benefit from the radio and television programs to the best of  their ability, and so that everyone can become fulfilled by the  programs' great bounty.    Programs must be understandable and useful for all people,  but must not, in any way, be banal and frivolous. A Voice and  Vision suitable for Islamic Iran should gradually take shape in  which intelligence, ability, and a general leaning toward  culture, politics, and science exists side by side with  subtlety, taste, and talent, and be accompanied by a spirit of  reconstruction and recreation of a great and proud Iran, natural  to this ancient, yet young nation.    Apart from all that, the share of listeners beyond the  borders -- millions of people who in various states and from  various nations have set their sights to Iran and the voice of  the Islamic revolution -- should be prominently considered.  External programs should be completely free from banality,  repetitiveness, and frivolity and truly depict the Islamic Iran.  The carrying out of this heavy duty -- some of whose  preliminaries have been prepared by the former hardworking  management and officials, and some other sections of which must  be prepared by the current wise and intellectual manager -- no  doubt requires the cooperation of all the connected  establishments, especially the cabinet and the Islamic  Consultative Majles.    I call upon the respected deputies of the Islamic  Consultative Majles and respected cabinet members, especially  the president who is a man of knowledge and is an expert in  Islamic lore, to offer any assistance regarding the budget and  other resources for the move that the Voice and Vision needs  today. I expect the scholars, experts, artists, and other  strata, which are capable of somehow getting this crucial  organization to its deserved place, to cooperate with its  management. Undoubtedly such progress cannot be achieved  overnight. The important thing is that such a direction is  pursued. I beseech God Almighty success and guidance for the  respected head of the organization and the others involved, and  hope that all come under the auspices of the pure prayers of  God's supreme deputy [Vali al-Allah al-'Azam], may our souls be  sacrificed for him, and the assistance of that great one.    Peace be upon all the believing brothers.    [Signed] Sayyed Ali Khamene'i    [Dated] 12 February 1994</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Billy Idol, Dwight Yoakam and others will perform Sunday in a concert to  support Teen Canteen, a Hollywood shelter for teen-age runaways and homeless  youths. The rock concert, sponsored by Paul Mitchell Systems, will be held at  Victoria Station in Universal City, and will feature several local bands as  well. Roy Sciacca, of the band Sciacca who will open the show, said he's  performing in the benefit because he had been a teen runaway himself and "the  teen-age runaway situation is a major problem and we hope that our  participation will draw attention and raise the consciousness of people and  organizations who can help."

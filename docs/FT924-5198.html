			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A BIG mid-morning buy order from a leading house sent Footsie futures sharply forward to trade at the higher levels, although turnover remained dull, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the December contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,728, some 4 points above Wednesday's close and moved to trade in a range of 2,730 and 2,740 for the first part of the trading session. It was however the large buy order from a leading house which sent December powering ahead, moving from 2,731 to 2,755 within a short period. But for an occasional flurry which saw the contract touch the day's high of 2,762 twice, December traded in a tight range of 2,750 to 2,758 for the rest of the day. A noteable feature was the absence of some US houses in the market due to Thanksgiving Day in the US. December closed at 2,763, up 39 points on the previous close and around 17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 9. Turnover was however once again low reaching only 5,672 contracts. Traded options were dull with volume falling to 25,536 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option was more active than in the last two sessions and saw its turnover reach 7,284 lots. Asda was the most actively dealt stock option. It traded 4,643 contracts, with the January 30 calls attracting nearly half of that total.</p>

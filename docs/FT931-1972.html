			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Goal advances to Pounds 7m GOAL PETROLEUM, the oil exploration and production company, reported a 6 per cent rise in after-tax profit to Pounds 7m for 1992 after a reduction in its tax charge. Mr David Boyd, managing director, said the company would be better off in the short term from the overhaul to the Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget. He said the move would contribute Pounds 5m in additional cash flow from Goal's share in the onshore Wytch Farm development and the Magnus field in the North Sea. However, he said the changes would accelerate plans the company had in place to move its exploration efforts overseas. It is looking at making a further shift from the British to the Netherlands sector of the North Sea. Oil production was steady at 115,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (which includes gas). It is set to dip slightly this year and almost double in 1995 when offshore production from Wytch Farm comes on stream. Turnover was steady at Pounds 44.2m. Earnings per share rose to 5.23p (4.92p) and the single dividend is 1.4p (1.25p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the 27th </F> general meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Kuala  Lumpur; date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: First, I would like to  express my sincere thanks to His Excellency Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad, a very close friend of mine and the Pacific  Basin Economic Cooperation Council [PBEC], for having provided  me with the opportunity to attend this important forum and  exchange views with all of you who have contributed to the  dynamic economic growth in the Pacific region.    We Vietnamese often liken our country to a balcony that  faces  the Pacific Ocean and enjoys the fresh air and also bears the  brunt of all the storms from the sea. Therefore, we attach  great importance to all developments in the Pacific Basin.    Speaking of the Pacific Basin, especially the eastern rim,  people think not only of devastating earthquakes and storms but  also of protracted and fierce wars that lead to consequences  that were far more serious than natural disasters and that set  up barriers among regional countries.    Over the past centuries, many nations in the eastern rim of  the Pacific Basin were colonial or semicolonial countries and  served as suppliers of raw materials and labor to metropolitan  countries. Meanwhile, except for Japan, the economies of the  aforementioned nations were seriously affected by slow  development and backwardness. The situation has basically  changed now. All of those nations have regained independence,  and wars have ended. Confrontation has been eliminated, and the  trend for peace and cooperation has been established and  developed with each passing day. People are surprised at and  admire the marvelous economic achievements of many countries in  this region where repeated waves of development have given birth  to many rising dragons that are making their presence felt  strongly in the world market, thus heralding the start of the  Pacific era.    The role of the Pacific region in the world economy has been  consolidated with each passsing day, and as His Excellency Prime  Minister Mahathir predicted at last year's conference in Seoul,  by the year 2020, the Pacific economies will be 2.5 times  greater than that of Western Europe, provided that the Pacific  Basin countries do not shoot themselves in the foot.    The dynamic development of the Pacific economies has not  only  brought about well-being for the regional people but also  created favorable opportunities for the business circle all over  the world. With a population of billions, East Asia and  Southeast Asia form a large market and a big source of labor.  Especially, the people in the region have a tradition of  diligence, education, and skill. Many regional countries have a  substantial need for capital, technology, and management  experiences and as such, create a booming market for investment  and trade.    Located at the intersection of the world's busiest sea and  air transportation networks and due to their development needs,  regional countries give top priority to infrastructure  development. This move creates no insignificant investment and  business opportunities. Furthermore, the abundance of rich  natural resources in the region is also an important factor for  development and business attractiveness. The social and  political stability in each country and the trend for peace and  cooperation in the region created a reliable environment for  business. The trend for regionalization in combination with  that for globalization is developing, including Malaysia's  initiative on the East Asia Economic Cooperation Forum. This  has further strengthened the business opportunities in the  Pacific. It is our hope and belief that this trend would not  lead to confrontation between the economic blocs and closed  trade, but step up the broadening of regionalization through  efforts to further explore the agenda of discussions of the  previous conference, thus contributing to increasing business  opportunities to a significant degree.    The vitality of the Pacific region, therefore, is creating  important opportunities that should not be missed. The Pacific  Basin, however, is very large and not a homogeneous entity. The  countries in the region are at different economic development  levels and sociopolitical structures. They experience different  historical circumstances and cultural traditions. Besides,  there are still latent sources of possible significant  confrontation in the region. Though peace and cooperation for  the sake of development is becoming the prevalent trend, the  region has not been perfectly peaceful at all times and in all  places. Moreover, while cooperation is often coupled with  competition, the only way to suppress any possibility of  confrontation is dialogue for the sake of enhancing mutual  understanding and trust, thus further developing cooperation  both inside and out of the region for peace, stability, and  prosperity of the region and each of the countries.    The undeniable conditions to ensure the basic interests are  mutual respect, understanding of one's national self esteem and  cultural traditions, avoidance of coercive imposition, and  politicalization and ideologicalization of trade ties and  cooperation. In other words, the principle of diversity in  unity will help us reduce confrontation and increase  opportunity. I strongly trust that dynamic development coupled  with sincere cooperation among the countries, politicians, and  businessmen will open promising potential for prosperity for us.    Ladies and gentlemen, like other countries in the region,  our  country also has favorable geographic location, diversified  natural resources, and especially the industrious, curious, and  skillful people who can adjust quickly to the new environment.  Recognizing the opportunity and challenge facing the developing  countries including Vietnam, we have been persistent in the past  several years in our renovation policy, in the development of  the market-oriented economy, and the expansion of international  cooperation. Achievements reached during the renovation process  help us to gradually settle our economic development and to  create new opportunity for domestic and foreign businessmen.  The Vietnamese economy nowadays is developing, inflation has  been repressed, export and foreign investment are on the rise at  fast speed. The sociopolitical stability further improves the  favorable environment for foreign and domestic investors.    We are ushering our country into a new development stage in  which we will gradually practice industrialization and  modernization. We have great demand in industrial capital and  business and management expertise. This is a new opportunity  for foreign investors and businessmen.    It is true that the infrastructure of Vietnam is still  inadequate. It is quite understandable in the case of a  backward agriculture country that had been seriously devastated  by long wars. We are concentrating our energy to resolve the  situation by reserving most of development aid for construction  and upgrading public roads, ports, airports, and power and water  supply networks. Many opportunities are widely open for  businessmen to participate in the development process in such  forms like bidding, joining investment capital, including the  formula of construct-operate- transfer.    It is also true that our legal system is imperfect. It still  allows annoying procedures. We are well aware of this weakness  and are trying to overcome it. We also trust that the  international cooperation will help us with valuable experiences  and opportunities to train our staff and improve our management  style.    One great favorable element for both us and foreign  businessmen is that Vietnam's foreign relations are expanding  quickly. Nowadays Vietnam has fine relations with all  neighboring countries, is actively preparing to join ASEAN with  full membership, and is participating in other institutions in  the Asia Pacific region.    Vietnam has established normal cooperative relationship with  international organizations, improved its relations with most  Asian, European, Middle East, African, and American countries.  A vivid example of cooperation opportunity with Vietnam is the  developing relations between Malaysia and Vietnam. The fine  relations reflect not only the warm and trustful atmosphere  between the leaders and peoples of the two countries, but also  the ever-increasing cooperative relations on culture, economy,  science, and technology. The Vietnamese-Malaysian cooperation is  an indication of the South- South cooperation and the regional  cooperation developing in Southeast Asia.    Ladies and gentlemen, the new vitality of the Vietnam's  economy is encouraged by the vitality of the Pacific region and  by the open door policy of diversification and multidirection  that Vietnam has been pursuing persistently. I am delighted at  the knowledge of future visits to Vietnam of many distinguished  guests who are present here today. The door to Vietnam is  always open wide to welcome you. You will have a chance to know  the traditional hospitability of Vietnamese people and witness  potential of our country and business opportunities that will  bring benefit for both sides.    I thank you and wish you a successful conference.</p>

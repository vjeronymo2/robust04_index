			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG CANCER PATIENTS DELIVER 'GLAD TIDINGS'  </P> <P> Stacie Smith looks like a typical 9-year-old. She wears fashionable clothing  and a smile from ear to ear that could make any Christmas Grinch smirk.  </P> <P> But at her young age, Stacie has endured three years of cancer treatment.  </P> <P> With her illness diagnosed as acute lymphocytic leukemia, Stacie has received  chemotherapy, undergone bone-marrow spinal-tap aspirations and had a tube  inserted in her chest to receive her medicine. Having completed her treatment,  Stacie is now in remission. The pretty girl with long, shiny hair now enjoys  horseback riding, swimming, soccer and softball.  </P> <P> A cancer diagnosis can be devastating, not only for the victim but also for the  entire family. This is where the Kids Cancer Connection Inc. steps in to help.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based program, founded by parents whose children have suffered  cancer, helps families deal with the pain of the disease, assists children  returning to school during and after treatments, provides scholarships for  children requiring continuing education and supports cancer research.  </P> <P> The Kids Cancer Connection's primary fund-raising program, the "Glad Tidings"  holiday greeting-card program, is currently under way.  </P> <P> The program is now in its second year of operation, and this year's cards have  been colorfully designed by Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles County children  being treated for cancer. The cards contain original inscriptions.  </P> <P> Stacie's greeting card features a fluffy lamb looking hopefully at the North  Star. The sentiment inside says, "Do you hear what I hear . . .?" This is the  second year Stacie has contributed artwork to the fund-raiser.  </P> <P> "Last year we did about $220,000 worth in sales," said Michele Massey,  executive director of the Kids Cancer Connection. "Last month alone we sold  $65,000."  </P> <P> A committee chooses artwork. The prospective artists are sent instructions, and  when all the artwork is received, Massey and a group of volunteers select the  ones that will be printed.  </P> <P> Massey has already received letters inquiring about submitting designs for next  year's cards. A letter from a parent in San Marcos read: "My son has cancer. He  wanted to know maybe next year if he could send in a design."  </P> <P> The cards are available at the Orange County Marketplace, on the Orange County  Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa; I. Magnin and Bernans, both in South Coast Plaza in  Costa Mesa; and South County Re/Max offices. Orders can also be sent directly  to the Kids Cancer Connection.  </P> <P> For more information, call (714) 851-7774.  </P> <P> The Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation in Orange also offers holiday greeting  cards created by children with cancer. Funds from the cards are used for  research conducted at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory at Children's  Hospital of Orange County.  </P> <P> Co-chairwoman Bonnie Dankberg thinks the foundation, now in its fourth year of  greeting-card sales, will sell 145,000 cards this year.  </P> <P> Cards are available at Nordstrom and Vons Pavilion stores throughout Orange and  Los Angeles counties and at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory office on  the second floor of CHOC Tower in Orange.  </P> <P> To inquire about the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation, call (714) 532-8692.  </P></p>

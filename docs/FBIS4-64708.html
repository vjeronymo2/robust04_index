			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Activity in the foreign currency markets  intensified with Standard and Poor's decision to reduce Turkey's  credibility rating for the third time. Standard and Poor's  reduction of Turkey's credibility rating from BB to B Plus  stirred the dollar value in the banks and on the black market.  The value of the dollar varied from 34,200 to 35,150 Turkish  lira in the interbank markets when the market opened yesterday.  However, the Central Bank's decision to have the Turkish  currency bought and sold with an interest of 400 and 600 percent  respectively reduced the value of the dollar. The dollar ended  up dropping only 150-200 Turkish lira.    By yesterday evening the banks were in short supply of  Turkish lira, forcing them to sell some of their accumulated  dollars. Consequently, the value of the dollar decreased to  34,400 Turkish lira when the money markets closed for the day.  Compared with the previous day, the value of the dollar still  increased by 400 Turkish lira. Meanwhile, the interest on the  Turkish lira fell from 400 to 375 percent.    The situation on the black market was no different from that  in the banks yesterday. The fall in Turkey's credibility rating  in the international money markets increased the demand for  foreign currency. The value of the dollar was 33,300 Turkish  lira on the black market early the day before yesterday. It  increased by 1,200 Turkish lira to 34,500 by noon. But the  balances changed by the evening and sales increased.  Consequently, the increase in the value of the dollar was only  100 Turkish lira when the markets closed. The dollar was worth  33,400 Turkish lira.    The German mark was in a similar situation. It rose from  19,900 to 20,300 Turkish lira.    Experts have predicted that foreign currencies will continue  to fluctuate over the next few days. [passage omitted]</p>

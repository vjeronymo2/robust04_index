			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Red tape 'slows genetic research' EXCESSIVE regulations covering genetic engineering are handicapping the biotechnology industry, the Lords science and technology committee says today. The committee's report on biotechnology says the regulatory regime is based on an 'obsolete' view of the hazards of genetic engineering. It calls for urgent government action to streamline the UK regulations and to relax the European Community directives on which the regulations are based. The report says the rules are 'bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming and is an unnecessary burden to academic researchers and industry alike'. The Lords found that regulations were simpler and less demanding in some Continental countries, notably France and Belgium, which interpreted the EC directives less stringently, and the US and Japan. The report says that whatever the nature of a genetically modified organism  -be it a lethal virus or a harmless plant - a UK researcher faces a 'bureaucratic nightmare', and has to answer 89 standard questions and pay Pounds 1,800 for each release. US researchers face nine questions, no fee and a faster procedure, said Lord Howie of Troon, who chaired the subcommittee that drew up the biotechnology report. The BioIndustry Association, the trade body for UK biotechnology companies, welcomed the report and urged the government to implement its recommendations. Dr Peter Doyle, research director of bioscience company Zeneca, agreed that 'the current regulatory regime is outdated, unscientific, fails to discriminate in terms of the level of real risk, and is an unnecessary burden to academic researchers and industry alike'. But the industry's opponents expressed outrage. Dr David King of the Genetics Forum, an environmental pressure group, said: 'It is completely irresponsible to say that the current regulatory regime needs to be relaxed.' He added: 'We have no hard evidence that regulation is affecting the competitiveness of the biotechnology industry - just unsupported assertions.' Ms Sue Mayer, science director of Greenpeace UK, said: 'It is rather alarming that the environment has been set aside in the interests of the industry.' Regulation of the UK Biotechnology Industry.

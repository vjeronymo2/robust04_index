			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, it is not apparent that the Department of Justice conducted a thorough review of the existing operating, technical, and financial requirements that restrict third party processors' access to the network, or the pricing mechanisms governing such access, to ensure that the order truly provides third party processors with meaningful, non-discriminatory access to the network. As discussed in Comments 3 and 4, below, the operating, technical and financial regulations, and the complex pricing structure imposed by MAC and other networks, have the potential to pose a mine field, severely restraining third party entry to the processing market. Those regulations and pricing must be examined carefully and safeguards need to be put in place to assure future compliance with the judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, in order for the judgment to meet the Department's goal of eliminating MAC's monopoly power in card processing in the affected region, the proposed Final Judgment must (1) extend to ATMs owned by non-depository institutions; (2) encompass the debit POS network; (3) require the Department of Justice to review operating, technical, and financial restrictions placed on third party processors by the ATM and debit networks and put related safeguards into place to ensure that the networks provide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> meaningful <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  access by third party processors; and (4) require the Department of Justice to examine the pricing structure of the networks, and put certain safeguards into place, to be certain that the costs assessed to third party processors are truly non-discriminatory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the following modifications must be made to the proposed Final Judgment: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Comment No. 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Final Judgment should be clarified to include ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions, as well as those owned and deployed by depository institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section II.B of the proposed Final Judgment defines ``ATM'' as a machine ``typically owned and deployed by a depository institution.'' The first sentence of section II.H defines depository institution as ``a bank, saving bank, savings and loan association, credit union or other institution authorized by federal or state law to take deposits.'' In a second sentence, Section II.H of the judgment goes on to state that, for purposes of the Final Judgment, depository institution includes ``any other member of a branded ATM network operated by defendant that also deploys ATMs within that network.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

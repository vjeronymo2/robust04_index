			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOOKSTEIN BALANCES OLD WITH THE NEW  </P> <P> At Thursday evening's premiere performance of Ronn Yedidia's Concerto for Piano  and Electronic Instruments, pianist Kenneth Bookstein shook the Sherwood  Auditorium rafters, sending a few patrons scurrying for the exits. In this  context, where experiment is all too rare, it was a welcome sight.  </P> <P> Monday's concert inaugurated the Athenaeum's weeklong series of arts events,  celebrating the move into newly renovated quarters for La Jolla's unique music  and fine arts library.  </P> <P> Bookstein, a former La Jollan who now lives in New York, chose a program that  balanced the hallowed keyboard repertory of Bach, Schumann and Chopin with  Yedidia's newly completed opus, a signal that the Athenaeum is striving to be  more than just a museum preoccupied with past achievement.  </P> <P> Yedidia's expansive, single movement concerto recast the Lisztian, virtuoso  piano concerto in the contemporary medium of piano and computer-controlled  electronic instruments. From the standpoint of structure, the young Israeli  composer broke no new ground; he relied on the skillful alternation and  juxtaposition of his two instruments.  </P> <P> The Concerto lasted just under 30 minutes, but Yedidia's wealth of invention  and compact construction justified the duration. Although he favored dense,  complex textures, he did not eschew thematic development.  </P> <P> Bookstein confidently projected the work's bold piano part. Although it is  tempting to compare Yedidia's keyboard idiom with the restless Expressionism of  early Schoenberg or late Scriabin, the composer has his own voice. His writing  for the electronic component was less convincing, however. Naive, synthetic,  the sounds too frequently brought to mind the onerous moan of an electronic  organ.  </P> <P> Chopin's B Minor Sonata proved an apt showcase for Bookstein's solid technique,  although the treacherous descending flourishes in the blazing finale exceeded  his otherwise unfailing grasp. Bookstein brought ample brilliance and agility  to the familiar work, which he shaped with a perceptive, analytical eye and  ear. No sentiment clouded his Apollonian vision of the Sonata.  </P> <P> Bookstein is a fluent, serious performer, although he makes his case with  relentless ardor. He appears to need some reassurance that he will not lose his  audience if he lingers over a phrase or indulges in an occasional rubato.  </P> <P> It was difficult to warm to Bookstein's pair of Robert Schumann selections from  "Phantasie-stucke," Op. 12, although they were performed with frenetic  dispatch. His Schumann was all inflamed passion, but without the mystery and  intimacy, that "Des Abends" requires.  </P> <P> Bookstein opened his program with an intense and slightly larger than life  Prelude and Fugue in D Minor from the second volume of J. S. Bach's  "Well-Tempered Clavier."  </P></p>

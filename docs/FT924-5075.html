			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Automagic in black after Pounds 880,000 loss Automagic Holdings, the USM-quoted operator of shoe repairing and key cutting sites, finished with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 880,000 for the year ended June 27 1992, but is now trading profitability. Sales were well above budget and recent trading had been more favourable. Cost reductions will save about Pounds 500,000 in a full year, certain branches had and were being closed, and the dry cleaning and laundry business ceased to trade in September. The loss, up from Pounds 436,000 at halfway, included Pounds 31,000 exceptional charges; it compared with Pounds 96,000 in the previous 61 weeks which took account of Pounds 216,000 exceptionals. Turnover was Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 14.5m) and generated an operating loss of Pounds 572,000 (profit Pounds 475,000). Losses per share were 13p (3.8p). Extraordinary provisions of Pounds 402,000 have been made against the closure of the dry cleaning and laundry business.</p>

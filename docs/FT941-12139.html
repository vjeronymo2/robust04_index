			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: All a matter of taste Sir, I was intrigued to read in Antony Thorncroft's article on choc art ('Arts: The sickly sweet smell of success', January 29/30) that Karsten Schubert is offering to sell for Pounds 5,000 a certificate which purports to entitle the buyer to 'decorate a room to a specified height with plain chocolate applied with a brush in three layers'. It may be that you number among your readers those who consider themselves to be at the cutting edge of contemporary art and who might be chewing over the purchase of a piece of choc art. Here in Belgium, eating chocolate is thought to provide a more satisfying experience than daubing it on one's walls, but this may simply be a reflection on the relative merits of British and Belgian chocolate. Some time ago, I conceived the idea of painting the walls of my living room, not with chocolate, but with white paint, applied with a roller in three layers. May I, through the good offices of your letters column, inform your readers that as an incentive to buying my artwork rather then Mr Schubert's, I am prepared to allow readers of the FT to acquire my latest ouevre for only Pounds 4,999. While I fear that some of your more hard-headed readers will be aware of the old copyright lawyer's adage that there is no copyright in ideas, only in the form in which they are expressed, I believe that the Cork Street area contains a gratifying number of people who have white painted gallery walls and who possess money and credulity in equal quantities. I would be grateful if you would forward any cheques received. Nicholas Khan, 58 rue de la Brasserie, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

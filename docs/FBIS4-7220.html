			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- A report on the conditions  of foreign residents in Tokyo presented to the Tokyo Municipal  Government on Wednesday [27 April] calls for greater human  rights guarantees for illegal foreign workers living in the city.    The report, drawn up by a committee under the chairmanship  of  Yoshio Okawara, a special adviser to the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) and a former ambassador to the United  States, was handed to Tokyo Gov. Shunichi Suzuki. The municipal  government will use the report as a basis for its  recommendations to all its administrative bureaus.    Over the past decade, the number of foreigners registering  as  residents in Tokyo has virtually doubled as the city has played  host to an increasing number of foreign corporations, foreign  students and foreign workers. The number of foreigners in Tokyo  had risen to about 270,000 by late 1993, or about one in 40 of  the city's residents.    The report notes that many illegal workers avoid contact  with  administrative officials because they fear it will lead to  detection and subsequent deportation. The report says that as a  result, poverty and unemployment among foreign workers is  becoming a serious problem.    It recommends that while directing companies to prevent  illegal employment, the community must face the reality that  illegal workers are living in the community and should frame  policies accordingly. It says such policies should take into  account problems like the abuse of workers' rights when they are  not paid wages.    It also recommends increased support for citizens' groups  working against human rights abuses among women engaged in  prostitution and calls for adequate education and health care  for children of illegal workers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 24 Apr (EFE)--Nine Venezuelan Air Forces  officers who participated in the attempted coup on 27 November  1992 were released Saturday and will return to their duties.  Charges against the nine officers, who took asylum in Peru after  the second military coup attempt, were dismissed by a decree  issued by President Rafael Caldera.    The officers are Captains Senibaldo Palacios, Wilfredo  Santiago Sanchez Trujillo, Wilson Marin Leal, Luis Antonio  Romero, Daniel Pereira, Jean Luis Duran Siso, and Sanchez  Trujillo. Charges were also dismissed against Lieutenants Fidias  Garrido and Alexis Montilla.    Only three of the officers who returned to Venezuela to  surrender to justice continue to be detained at the San Carlos  prison in northern Caracas. There are still 13 coupist officers  in Peru, including General Visconti Osorio, one of the leaders  of the 27 November 1992 military insurrection.    In Venezuela, 21 soldiers are still being held for  rebellion.  The soldiers are headed by Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, who is  held at the San Carlos prison together with 13 officers and a  soldier.    Virginia Contreras, the defense lawyer of the coupist  soldiers, said to reporters that the cases against the officers  who are still under arrest should also be dismissed and that  they should be allowed to return to the National Armed Forces.</p>

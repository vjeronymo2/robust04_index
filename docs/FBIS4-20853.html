			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin report: "For Civilized Countries </F> Missiles Are Not a Bargaining Chip"]    [Text] Two missile regiments stationed on Belorussian  [Belarusian] territory in Mozyr and Lida have started to  withdraw their weapons and military hardware to Russian  territory.    A grouping of Strategic Missile Forces comprising two  missile  divisions is currently stationed on Belorussian territory. They  include 8 missile regiments armed with RS-12M Topol road-mobile  missile complexes. The total number of missile launchers is 72.    Under this year's jointly agreed timetable, one-half of  these  will be withdrawn from Belorussia [Belarus] to Russia, and the  rest will follow by the end of next year. By the middle of 1996  the Mozyr and Lida Divisions will be completely disbanded. All  the missile troops' military bases and housing compounds will be  handed over to the Belorussian side. We already have experience  of this work. Last summer nine missile launchers were withdrawn  from Postavy to Russia following close cooperation between the  Russian and Belorussian sides.    What will happen to the "Belorussian" nuclear weapons next?  The weapons and military hardware that are being withdrawn will  be held at Strategic Missile Forces arsenals in Russia, where  they will subsequently be used as an exchange fund to replace  weapons that have reached the end of their service life in  missile regiments on combat alert in Russia.    What does the future hold for the missile troops themselves?  Lieutenant General Viktor Yesyan, chief of the Strategic Missile  Forces Headquarters Operations Directorate, said that they would  serve in Russian units that are currently undermanned. Officers  and warrant officers who have expressed a desire to remain in  Belorussia will be discharged from the ranks of the Russian  Armed Forces. Their status has been defined by a special  agreement between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and  the Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense regarding the  procedure for performance of military service by officers,  ensigns, and warrant officers. This agreement has been approved  by the Russian and Belarusian Governments and is being  rigorously implemented. Officers and warrant officers who used  to serve in the Strategic Missile Forces and who remain in  Belorussia will enjoy all the rights of citizens of this  republic. There have been no cases of encroachment on these  rights.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: DIFFORD AND TILBROOK SQUEEZE OUT CHARM  </P> <P> Doin' their third-ever acoustic show, Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook --  better-known as the singing/songwriting minds behind England's stately pop  group Squeeze -- proved every charming lil' bit as simultaneously dour, dulcet  and endlessly self-deprecating as they do on their day jobs.  </P> <P> Along with sparkling renditions of Squeeze's most-beloved material, Saturday's  hour-long, first-of-two shows at McCabe's ranged from three tunes off the  group's strong, just-released "Frank" album to a not 'alf bad take on Stick  McGhee's vintage 1949 kozmik blues "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee"  </P> <P> Powered by Tilbrook's magnificent, sweet and soulful vocals and Difford's  vivid, detail-encrusted lyrics, this was POP! music at its finest, never losing  the ethereal beauty of the melody even when engaging such resolutely earthbound  subjects as alcoholism ("Labeled With Love") menstruation ("She Doesn't Have To  Shave"), seaside holidays ("Pulling Mussels From A Shell") and divorce ("Up the  Junction").

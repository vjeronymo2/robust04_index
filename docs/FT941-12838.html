			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Labour increases ABC support A MORI poll today puts Labour level with the Tories among the upper, professional and middle classes for the first time since the organisation started polling in the 1970s. Both parties were on 37 per cent among the so-called ABCs, traditionally rich Tory pickings, according to the poll in The Times. The poll also showed that Tory support may have bottomed out at about 28 per cent - the same as last month. Labour was well in front on 48 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent.</p>

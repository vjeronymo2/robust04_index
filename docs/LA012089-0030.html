			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 50% PAY RAISE FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS  </P> <P> It is ludicrous for Congress to ask for a 50% raise. This is the Congress which  has refused for eight years to raise the minimum wage from $3.35. This is the  Congress, which in the name of tackling the deficit, has cut the pay of  Medicare workers and has cut back in other areas. This is the Congress which  must make hard decisions in the future about the financial future of many.  </P> <P> They look stupid to the average American family making $29,000 a year for  tacking on such a huge pay increase for themselves, and it is insidious that  they should do it in such a way. If there is a problem with some members taking  unwarranted speaking fees, they should simply prohibit those speaking  engagements.  </P> <P> CAROL TSUCHIDA  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- China plans to send a  high-level delegation to North Korea for the 82nd birthday of  President Kim Il-song on April 15 that will urge resolution of  the nuclear dispute through dialogue, a Seoul government  official said Sunday.    The Chinese delegates will reportedly brief Pyongyang on the  recent summit between South Korean and Chinese Presidents Kim  Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin and explain Beijing's position in  approving a United Nations Security Council statement calling on  the Stalinist country to meet with the United States and  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    They are to highlight Kim Yong-sam's assurances that South  Korea has neither the intention nor ability to absorb the North  and will support Pyongyang vis-a-vis the United States and Japan  when the nuclear problem is resolved, as well as emphasizing the  need for inter-Korean dialogue.    Beijing promised efforts, albeit limited, to lure Pyongyang  to the negotiating table during Kim's visit to China last week.    The Chinese delegation to Pyongyang is likely to be led by a  senior official who will congratulate Kim Il-song on his 82nd  birthday, the Seoul official said.    The visiting delegates are expected to advocate peaceful  resolution of the nuclear problem in meetings with high-level  North Korean officials, he said. The Chinese will pay a courtesy  call on President Kim Il-song and explain South Korean President  Kim's thoughts on North Korea set forth in his summit with  Jiang, the official said.    North Korea and the United States will resume contact in one  way or another, the official said, probably later in the month  after Kim's birthday.</p>

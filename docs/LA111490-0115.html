			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV OKS COALITION RULE, YELTSIN ASSERTS  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian Federation, said  Tuesday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed in principle to  the formation of "a coalition government of national unity," including Yeltsin  nominees, as a way of sharing power and ending the country's political  paralysis.  </P> <P> Yeltsin said he told Gorbachev that Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's  15 constituent republics, would want the right to name the prime minister of  the central government as well as its defense and finance ministers.  </P> <P> Recounting his five-hour Sunday meeting with Gorbachev, Yeltsin told members of  the Russian legislature that he had proposed "a complete new system of state  power -- the formation of a coalition government of national unity" -- and that  Gorbachev "in principle supported the line."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, addressing military officers on Tuesday, did not respond directly to  Yeltsin's proposal but said, "There were no differences with the head of the  Russian Parliament on the need to create a united but renewed union of  sovereign states.  </P> <P> "I consider that the conversation was responsible, serious and constructive,"  the Soviet president said, letting stand without demur the Russian leader's  assertion that they had agreed both on a division of power between the central  government and the republics and the formation of the proposed coalition  Cabinet.  </P> <P> "And after such a fundamental exchange of opinion on this question, I think I  have the confidence that we here in the center and the leadership of Russia  will act in a spirit that corresponds to the interests of our national state  and all its peoples."  </P> <P> Vitaly N. Ignatenko, the president's press secretary, said later that some  descriptions of the Gorbachev-Yeltsin talks were "a bit sensational," but he  refused the opportunity to deny that the two leaders had, in fact, reached an  agreement on a sharing of power and establishment of a coalition government.  </P> <P> "The discussion was very acute -- polemical, I would say -- but constructive,"  Ignatenko said. "There were no real differences between the president and  Yeltsin."  </P> <P> The political and personal rivalry between Gorbachev and Yeltsin has sharpened  the country's political crisis in recent months. Gorbachev found that Yeltsin's  proposals commanded popular support where his own reforms drew increasing  criticism. But Yeltsin discovered that he had little hope of implementing any  of his ideas without Gorbachev's power.  </P> <P> Each, however, has a sharply different vision of the country's future and a  strategy on how to get there. That difference plus old quarrels have kept them  apart as the Soviet economy has continued to disintegrate, ethnic unrest has  grown and social discontent deepened.  </P> <P> As outlined by Yeltsin, the agreement would appear to doom the moderate  government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who has strongly resisted the  radical economic reforms favored by Yeltsin and who had persuaded Gorbachev  only last month to pursue narrower reforms at a slower pace.  </P> <P> "I did not claim many posts before consulting with you," Yeltsin told the  Russian deputies, "but I did express the wish for three -- prime minister,  finance and defense."  </P> <P> But the next step in cementing the new alliance between the country's most  powerful leaders was unclear.  </P> <P> Until now, Gorbachev has defended the increasingly unpopular Ryzhkov, leading  many Soviet political observers to believe that the president needs the backing  of the country's vast military-industrial complex not only to pursue his  reforms but even to remain in office himself.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, moreover, has no established political or constitutional  mechanism to implement the agreement outlined by Yeltsin. Nominated by the  president, the country's prime minister must be elected by the Congress of  People's Deputies, the national Parliament, and his ministers confirmed by the  Supreme Soviet, the legislature.  </P> <P> The agreement, as sketched by Yeltsin and partially confirmed by Gorbachev,  goes far beyond establishing a coalition government, however, and looks toward  an entirely new political system in which the republics will have far greater  authority on their own territory as well as a larger voice in the formulation  of national policy.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said that a draft of the new treaty reconstituting the Soviet Union  as a much looser federation will be published in about a week and that this  will form the basis for further discussions on the division of political and  economic power in the country.  </P> <P> Without an "active, constructive and responsible" role for Russia, now led by  Yeltsin and other radical reformers, Gorbachev acknowledged that it would be  impossible to conclude the new union treaty -- and that this could plunge the  country into chaos and even civil conflict. Russia is home to half the Soviet  Union's 290 million people and makes up two-thirds of its territory.  </P> <P> "This union of sovereign states is, to use a military term, the last ditch," he  told the officers. "Beyond that, the collapse of the state begins. Attempts to  divide peoples who have lived together for centuries could end in a blood bath.  And it is necessary to recall that the country's economy is based on a unitary  state.  </P> <P> "If no account is taken of this, the situation will be worse than during the  Cultural Revolution in China," Gorbachev warned.  </P> <P> Yeltsin said, however, that he had told Gorbachev that all questions of the  ownership of natural resources, of economic management and fiscal controls, of  foreign trade and similar issues, would have to be resolved before the union  treaty is signed.  </P> <P> He and Gorbachev established parallel commissions to examine the issues and  then draft agreements that will form the basis for amending the proposed union  treaty.  </P> <P> Opening the Kremlin meeting, their first extended discussion since a similar  session in early August, Yeltsin said he had told Gorbachev that the central  authorities had blocked and delayed the establishment of Russia's sovereignty  at every point.  </P> <P> "You did not officially recognize our declaration of sovereignty," Yeltsin  said, recounting his conversation with Gorbachev. "You did not officially  recognize (the need for) a division of functions between the center and Russia.  You are still conducting a policy of diktat from the center. And you even  violate the current constitution."  </P> <P> Yeltsin's bill of complaints extended to foreign policy, including the recent  signing of treaties with Germany, and to the use of conscripted Russian youths  in quelling civil unrest outside the Russian Federation.  </P> <P> The outcome of the struggle between Gorbachev and Yeltsin is certain to have  wide significance for other republics seeking to establish their sovereignty  and for the survival, in whatever form it takes, of the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A report released by the Presidency of the Republic  of Somaliland today has disclosed that Awil Haji Omar has been  appointed treasurer for national reserves and Mohamed Haji Ahmed  Il Dab has been appointed as national finance officer.  Answering a question on these appointments at a news conference  held at the Presidency today, Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, the  president of the Republic of Somaliland, said this system was  similar to the U.S. type of government. For this reason it had  become necessary to divide the Finance Ministry into two  sections: the Treasury and the National Budget section.  Likewise, the president clarified at the news conference that  the ministry had not been abolished, but that it had been  divided into two. In the same vein, he said the finance  minister had not been sacked but that his resignation had been  accepted.    Speaking about the disarmament campaign, the president said  the program was proceeding in all regions of the country and the  capital was the one place in which the government had put  pressure for the program to be carried out. It was proceeding  well despite snags in some areas.    On the event which took place at the general command  headquarters, Egal said no order was given by the government to  fight the group stationed there, but that the national Army was  defending itself after it came under fire and its food was  looted. The president also said the people were expressing their  feelings about disarmament and that they should choose in the  interests of the country and the people. Lastly, the president  spoke about the situation in the country.    On the conference to be held in Mogadishu on 15 April, the  president said there was no framework whatsoever for Somaliland  participation. He also said he had met the leaders of most of  the organizations attending the meeting. He made it clear that  the position of the Republic of Somaliland was based on the  wishes of the Somaliland people and the decision had been made  at the conferences of Burco and Boorama.</p>

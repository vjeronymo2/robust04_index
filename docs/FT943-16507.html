			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mexico in telephone liberalisation Mexico's government has proposed a sweeping liberalisation of its long-distance telephone market from January 1997, promising to remove the most important barriers to competition. The ministry of communications and transport has agreed not to limit the number of carriers that can offer long-distance services from 1997, after the exclusive concession enjoyed by Telefonos de Mexico, the monopoly provider, expires. Any carrier that complies with government-established requirements will be granted a licence. Long-distance carriers will be allowed to establish their own local networks that will enable them to bypass Telmex altogether when offering long-distance telephone service. Telmex had strongly opposed this. 'The Mexican government has come down on the side of competition,' said Bette Massick, an analyst with SG Warburg 'Telmex did not get what it wanted.' Telmex earned Dollars 4.23bn from long distance and international calls last year, over half its revenues. It is by far Mexico's largest quoted company, with investors acutely concerned about the impact of competition on revenues, says Ricardo Peon of Baring Securities. In recent months MCI/Banamex, Iusacell/Bell Atlantic, Motorola/Protexa, Grupo Domos, and Alfa among others have announced plans to offer long-distance services in Mexico. The requirements for carriers to obtain long-distance licences have yet to be established, and officials predicted tough negotiations. Over the next few months it will be decided whether carriers will pay a fee for the licence, whether they will have any non-commercial obligations, and what if any regulations will govern tariffs. The prerequisites for domestic long-distance and international long-distance concessions are likely to be different, with Telmex fighting for tougher conditions for concessions to international services. 'The core issues are decided,' says Mr Santiago Levy, head of the government competition commission 'We have a good start to constructing a competitive telecommunications market in Mexico.' Under the proposed interconnection plan: Telmex will initially have to permit interconnection between long-distance and its local service in 60 of the country's largest cities, and in 200 by 1999. Telmex will set interconnection fees according to the cost of providing the service, not discriminate against competitive carriers and separate the accounting of its long-distance arm from its local service unit. Users will be able to pre-subscribe to any long-distance telephone service, rather than choosing one by dialing a specified code, as Telmex had proposed. Allowing pre-subscription will enable Telmex's competitors to build up a solid client base, and establish a reputation for service, according to Mr Levy.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A competitive defence base From the British Ministry of Defence comes the sound of arms being heavily twisted. Both British Aerospace and GEC are lobbying hard for their respective bids for the VSEL submarine yard in Barrow to receive official backing. BAe's case is that, since it does not currently own a shipyard, its bid presents no competition difficulties. However, it thinks that GEC's bid would generate an unnecessary monopoly, since GEC owns Yarrow on the Clyde, the only other big warship yard in the UK. GEC argues that, in practice, the pattern of warship orders likely over the next 10 years means that there would be little competition even if the two yards were owned by different companies. It therefore makes little difference if the two yards are owned by one company. The ministry of defence's position is disturbingly obscure. It has quite rightly championed the cause of competition in defence procurement for the past decade, saying that the policy is 'fundamental to achieving value for money'. Until recently it was also saying privately that it would not look favourably on a GEC bid for VSEL for precisely those reasons. As soon as the bids appeared, however, the ministry became coy. All it will say is that the issue will be decided by the competition authorities - in this case the Office of Fair Trading - and that its submissions to the OFT will be confidential. Yet since the MoD is the only UK defence customer, its view will decide the issue. So, unhappily, secret submissions to the OFT may, or may not, mask a policy shift on competition in procurement. Monopoly supplier In deciding its position the ministry will have to weigh the extent to which the necessary consolidation of the defence industry following the end of the cold war should be balanced against maintaining as much competition as possible. In the narrow case of the bids for VSEL, the case for a reduction in competition is not obvious. Since GEC will undoubtedly have to guarantee the future of both yards, creating a monopoly supplier will not lead to rationalisation and cost savings. The MoD thus has little reason to upend its arguments in favour of maintaining competition by allowing the GEC bid to proceed. The underlying problem is that the MoD, rather than seizing the initiative, is allowing defence competition policy to evolve in a purely reactive fashion. The rapid decline in US and European defence spending requires a drastic change in the structure of defence industries. This is already happening in the US, but is proving regrettably slow to materialise in Europe, largely because European governments are reluctant to allow cross-border rationalisation. Uniquely placed The UK is uniquely well placed to influence this process. If it chose, it could argue strongly with other EU governments for a more open market for Europe's defence manufacturers, giving them the freedom to choose how to rationalise in a market almost as large as that of the US. Instead, the MoD has sat back and argued that the market should decide. The trouble is that the market in defence procurement is far from free. If it were, many companies would probably opt to rationalise within business sectors. That might produce fewer, Europe-wide missile, aircraft and electronics manufacturers, rather than thinly-spread national companies. Provided such specialist companies were prepared to follow commercial logic in their rationalisation, as opposed to political pressure, they could operate at lower cost than national defence champions. They might also become genuinely competitive against the giant US firms now emerging, in contrast with the current situation in which uncompetitive and under-resourced national companies are awarded contracts for purely political ends. The MoD's competition policy over the past 10 years points clearly towards a rationalised European defence industry with increasing two-way competition between US and European products. The risk of the current drift in UK policy is that ad hoc decisions on specific cases will give rise to an ill-conceived, nationally-based industrial structure. This will neither give the MoD best value for money nor be able to compete successfully on the world stage.</p>

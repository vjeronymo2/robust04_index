			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Voters seize the opportunity to make their presence felt / Assessment of the outcome of the referendum A RECORD eight simultaneous referendum proposals, presented in the worst of bureaucratic language, have failed to deter the Italian electorate from making an unequivocal choice in favour of change. The final referendum results, announced yesterday, have given the clearest possible signal to Italy's discredited political establishment that politicians will have to operate by new rules in a less centralised state. The main political winner is Mr Mario Segni, who founded the referendum movement three years ago, and who courageously split from the Christian Democrat Party to boost his reformist credentials in the run-up to these referendums. Although he has yet to form his own party, He has emerged with strong moral authority to appeal to a broad cross-section of the electorate. Other beneficiaries of the voting are Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lombard League; Mr Achille Occhetto, head of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), who withstood considerable internal criticism for supporting the referendum movement; and Mr Marco Panella, the maverick leader of the small Radical Party. However, both the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the main partners in the four-party coalition, managed to avoid the vote being turned into a referendum on the government by discreetly supporting the key proposal for reforming the Senate electoral system. Voters distinguished subtly in their preferences for the different referendum proposals. The highest vote of 90.3 percent was cast to end public funding of the political parties. This was a predictable reaction against the way the parties have built up bloated, expensive organisations feeding off public funds and illicit money collected from kick-backs on contracts now being exposed in the corruption scandals. Significantly, a referendum in 1978 to cut state funding of the parties failed, garnering only 43 per cent of the vote. The lowest vote - 55 per cent - was for the most controversial and overtly moral of the proposals: depenalising personal use of drugs. The voters' stance on the drugs issue, promoted in large measure to reduce pressure on prisons and keep drug-addicts out of jail, suggests the country is still cautious on moral issues. In between these extremes, the powerful agricultural lobby managed to raise a sizeable vote - 30 per cent - against the proposal to abolish the Ministry of Agriculture. This has long been a key source of Christian Democrat patronage and votes, controlling Coldiretti, the Catholic association of small farmers. The voting pattern once again revealed the difference between the more civic minded north and centre of Italy, and the south where voter turn-out was 20 points less. Nevertheless, the vital referendum proposal, introducing a system of majority voting, was approved by an average 82 per cent. Proportional representation has encouraged the existence of small parties which, in turn, has fostered unstable coalition governments. The proposal, championed by Mr Segni, is for the 315-seat Senate to be elected by a majority vote for all save 77 seats, which will retain proportional representation. He was only opposed by three minority groups: the neo-fascist MSI, the hardline Reconstructed Communism, and La Rete, the Sicily-based clean government movement headed by Mr Leoluca Orlando. (In Sicily, on this issue, the No vote averaged 32 per cent and in Mr Orlando's base of Palermo it topped 41 per cent). The size of the Yes vote on majority voting increases the pressure for a complete overhaul of the electoral system and the extension of the same, or similar, principle to the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies. But sharp disagreements have to be overcome on whether to adopt a single round, or two as in France. Mr Segni himself has been ambiguous about which of these alternatives he favours. All matters relating to electoral reform will now have to be taken up by the joint-parliamentary constitutional reform commission created six months ago and which has been marking time while awaiting the referendum result. Abolition of state funding of political parties worth some L82bn (Pounds 34m) a year could spell the death of several small parties - particularly in the light of the magistrates' investigations into corruption which have helped cut illicit sources. In future, parties will have to finance themselves through voluntary contributions. These will probably be tax deductable up to a certain level and paid into foundations. The closure of the three ministries - agriculture, state shareholdings and tourism - along with the removal of environmental issues from the control of local health authorities, will force a considerable shake-up of ministerial activity. The State Shareholdings Ministry has been effectively defunct since the Amato government took office last June, but efforts to create a Privatisation Ministry, to wind up and assume some of the latter's functions, have been blocked in parliament. The referendum vote could now speed up the definition of this privatisation ministerial portfolio. On agriculture, the authorities will be obliged to devolve many of the existing ministry's functions to the regions, 10 of which pressed for the change. But a new co-ordinating body will have to be created to deal with Italy's EC obligations. In the case of tourism, which includes sport and entertainment, a similar co-ordinating structure will be needed. As for ending political control of savings banks nominations (instituted by Mussolini in 1938), this will be one further nail in the coffin of political patronage and interference in the economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             ITALY'S REFERENDUMS - FINAL RESULTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The eight issues Voters 48m                                              Turnout percent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Voting yes (percent)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To reform the senate electoral system                            82.7 To end state funding of political parties                        90.3 To abolish the agricultural ministry                             70.1 To depenalise personal drug use                                  55.3 To end political control of savings banks                        89.8 To abolish the state shareholding ministry                       90.1 To abolish the tourism ministry                                  82.2 To remove environmental issues from local health authorities     82.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     The       The      The      The                                     North     Centre   South    Islands  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Voters                              21.6m      9.3m    11.4m      5.6m Turnout                             84.9%     81.2%    64.3%     64.7%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To reform the senate    electoral system %               87.4      81.8     76.5      72.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To end state funding    of political parties %           92.9      90.2     85.5      85.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To abolish the    agricultural ministry %          75.0      66.3     62.0      68.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- To depenalise personal drug use %   54.8      57.2     53.4      56.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: TV's ice queens - Olympics CBS Television in particular, not to mention US sportswriting in general, really owes a lot to Tonya Harding. The venerable network, in the dumps after it was outbid by Rupert Murdoch's Fox for the contract to cover American football, cannot have had many hopes that the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer would be its salvation. America has nothing against Norway and loves skiing. But a two-week diet of luge and biathlon never looked likely to quicken the pulse of the great American viewing public. Tonya, the brat from the wrong side of the tracks, changed all this, because she is the melodramatic queen of the moment. It matters not a whit if she wins a skating medal, which she probably will not, nor even if her great rival Nancy Kerrigan does, which she may, thus warming a few hearts. The mere fact that Lillehammer brings the two together after all the charges that Tonya conspired to cripple Nancy is enough: it is soap opera incarnate. This alone has justified the CBS approach to the Winter Olympics, which is designed to overcome a particular problem: that, because of the time difference, the results of almost every event are known even as Americans eat breakfast. Thus the Games have been treated less as a sporting spectacle, and more as a melodrama on the hypothesis that behind each competitor must lie a human interest story. Now, some human interest stories are more interesting than others. There is only so much that can be extracted from the nobility of Norwegian speedskaters, even one as seriously noble as Johann Olav Koss. US competitors are better material, especially when they win - Tommy Moe, naturally of Norwegian extraction, and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, in skiing and, after another tug-at-the-heartstrings failure, Dan Jansen in speedskating. But Tonya is in a league of her own and the ratings have soared. The US writing press has occasionally taken refuge in non-Tonya subjects. Take Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post on 'the single dumbest Winter Olympic medal sport,' mogul skiing. 'Each run takes about 30 seconds, a perfect length of time for the audience they're aiming at - someone with the attention span of a barn owl.' Or Dave Barry, the syndicated columnist, on the news that some bobsledders took dope. 'This is extremely alarming news, because it seems to suggest that there are bobsled competitors here who are not on dope. Let me just state that I, personally, would not consider going down a bobsled run unless huge quantities of narcotics were coursing through my bloodstream.' But even Barry has to come back to Tonya. 'I want to stress, however, that I am not putting dangerous substances of any kind into my body, other than mass quantities of Norwegian beer, because I want to remain alert now that Tonya Harding is finally here. We in the American news media are so happy about this we want to hurl our hats in the air, but of course we don't, because our hair would freeze solid and break off like Number 8 spaghetti.'</p>

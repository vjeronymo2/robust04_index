			<p>BFN     [Text] Two more top communist leaders in Mindanao were  expelled from the underground movement for their refusal to  recognize Jose Maria Sison as the chair of the Communist Party  of the Philippines (CPP), reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo said  yesterday.    Col. Angelo Reyes, commanding officer of the Civil Relations  Service (CRS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said the  CPP "faces more serious crises" due to the worsening rift within  the movement." Reyes identified those expelled as Timoteo Pupa,  Central Mindanao Regional Committee (CMRC) secretary and Ike de  los Reyes, Pupa's deputy.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Italy's fast track to jobs THE Italian government is considering accelerating work on the country's ambitious new high-speed train project to stimulate the faltering economy and create up to 50,000 new jobs. The proposal to begin construction by the end of this year was raised at a meeting in Rome yesterday between Mr Raffaele Costa, the transport minister, and representatives of the principal companies involved in the L28,000bn (Pounds 11.7bn) plan to link Italy's main cities with new super-fast trains. The proposals come just before today's planned meeting between Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and senior ministers to consider the increasingly gloomy economic outlook when most factories re-open after the summer holiday break next week. The economy has been hit by a steep fall in output and demand this year because of the recession. Contrary to expectations, higher exports thanks to the lower lira have failed to offset the impact of the domestic slowdown. Some economists expect Italy's unemployment rate to exceed 12 per cent by December, as more companies, particularly in manufacturing, cut their workforces. Italy now has almost 3m people either out of work or on government-subsidised redundancy schemes. Unemployment levels range from almost 8 per cent in the north and centre of Italy to more than 21 per cent in the economically-depressed south. In the first half of this year, the number of idle hours spent by temporarily laid-off workers in special short-term redundancy schemes soared by 26 per cent. The downturn has triggered increasingly pessimistic forecasts for unemployment and warnings that rising jobless queues could affect public order. This week, Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, warned of rising social tensions in cities such as Genoa, Naples, Rome, Milan and Reggio Calabria, where further job losses loomed. However, the Confindustria employers' association yesterday sought to play down gloomy forecasts that a further 750,000 jobs are at risk. According to Mr Stefano Micossi, Confindustria's head of research, the increase in unemployment for the whole of this year is unlikely to exceed 200,000, the same as in 1992</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEANWHILE BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> Alexei Belov, the blond lead guitarist for the Soviet rock group Gorky Park,  got up early enough on his first morning home in months to make the 45-minute  drive from his parents' apartment to Lenin Stadium by 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Belov, who speaks English well, seemed a bit self-conscious when he found  himself almost alone in the huge, 100,000-capacity stadium, which was built in  1955 and upgraded for the 1980 Olympics. The first sound check for the Moscow  Music Peace Festival wasn't scheduled for another four hours.  </P> <P> When asked about his early arrival, the somewhat shy, 31-year-old musician  mentioned something about wanting to make sure that the band's equipment had  arrived safely from the United States, where Gorky Park had spent the last  several months recording an album that was just released by PolyGram Records.  </P> <P> After a few minutes, however, it became clear that the real reason Belov had  come early to the stadium was that he wanted to savor every minute of what he  felt was an historic weekend.  </P> <P> To Belov, the festival -- starring Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and other rockers in  the most ambitious display of Western hard-rock ever staged in the Soviet Union  -- was more than just the East/West cultural breakthrough that was being hailed  in the media. It was the most graphic and emotional sign yet of change in his  country: a change that had helped renew his long submerged rock 'n' roll  dreams.  </P> <P> Belov's story offers a compact guide to the obscure workings of Russian rock.  For years, Belov was a "forbidden" musician here, unable to perform on radio,  television or on records -- not because of anything politically subversive in  the lyrics of his old band, he said, but because the group, Moscow, was causing  its young fans to become too excited.  </P> <P> "That band was a very exciting time for us," said Belov, whose long black coat,  black shirt and black pants gave him a stark, aristocratic aura. "I had been in  other bands, but they were 'approved' pop bands . . . not really the music I  loved.  </P> <P> "Moscow was a band that played music like we heard from the West. And it was  wonderful to have the audience screaming and excited, but the officials said it  was too wild . . . too passionate and we had to stop. I think they thought it  was too Western . . . thus anti-Communist."  </P> <P> Heartbroken and frustrated, Belov was forced for the next few years to play  "wild clubs" -- the Soviet equivalent of the "buckets of blood" dives in the  United States. They were clubs where people come more to fight and drink than  to hear music -- places that authorities apparently didn't take time to  monitor.  </P> <P> Finally unable to take the violent environment, Belov turned his back on rock  'n' roll. He put down his guitar and began working in recording studios,  helping other bands on arrangements and concepts.  </P> <P> Then came Gorbachev and perestroika and glasnost, and Belov thought again about  making music. Just as things started loosening up in other areas of Soviet  life, musicians were given more freedom and, eventually, allowed access to the  West.  </P> <P> The band Gorky Park was pieced together by Stas Namin, an early Russian rock  performer and the grandson of a former chairman of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium. Thanks to some contacts he had made in the West, Namin got Gorky  Park a U.S. recording contract with PolyGram and helped put together the Moscow  Music Peace Festival where the band and two other Namin-connected Soviet groups  shared the bill with five Western entries: Bon Jovi, Osbourne, Motley Crue, the  Scorpions and Skid Row.  </P> <P> After the years of disillusionment and doubt, Belov seemed awed by the dramatic  changes in his life.  </P> <P> Standing on the field in the vast, empty stadium, he said, "This is  unbelievable. This is a place for the Olympics . . . for soccer. Who ever  thought there would also be rock 'n' roll here?  </P> <P> "We played in Leningrad with the Scorpions last year, but they wouldn't allow  the show in Moscow. Officials were scared. They thought something bad might  happen if this many young people got together. Now, they realize that things  must change . . . that you can't deny people things that are important to them,  like music, forever. I'm just glad it came in time for me."  </P> <P> Alexley (Kozlov), Andrei (Makarevich), Stas (Namin) and Alexander (Gradsky) are  some of the famous first names from the early days of Russian rock, but the  most important rock names to Russian fans have always been John, Paul, George  and Ringo.  </P> <P> Like their counterparts around the world, Soviet teen-agers were caught up in  the fresh, exuberant sounds of the Beatles in the '60s. They tried their best,  within the limits of available clothing and social pressure, to look like the  Fab Four, and they cherished tapes or records smuggled into the country by  friends and soldiers after visits to the West.  </P> <P> Stas Namin, grandson of Anastas Mikoyan, Presidium chairman in 1964 and 1965,  was among those enthralled with the sounds of records like "A Hard Day's Night"  and "I Want to Hold Your Hand."  </P> <P> "I heard them on tapes and on the radio and I immediately wanted to play the  guitar," said Namin, who operates a recording studio and stages concerts at his  own theater in Gorky Park, an area of Moscow described as roughly the  equivalent of Griffith Park in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Namin, who also speaks English, formed his first group in 1965 and became part  of the first wave of rock in Russia.  </P> <P> "The music was officially 'forbidden' because it was thought of as rebellious,"  he said, sitting in a production office at Lenin Stadium on the morning of the  first day of the festival. "They thought it would drive the young people too  wild and make them (identify) too strongly with the West.  </P> <P> "But you could still play it in little clubs . . . underground rooms. We  weren't (frustrated) because it was impossible to imagine that rock 'n' roll  would ever be official in this country. We didn't think about ever playing in  the U.S. or Britain or have those bands come here because we didn't think  (personally) about going to Venus or Mars either. It was just a different  world."  </P> <P> Namin, who is now in his early 40s, built a considerable following, moving back  and forth between the two categories in the country's complicated -- and now  apparently less pervasive -- system of "amateur bands" and "professional  bands."  </P> <P> In his book "Back in the USSR," Artemy Troitsky describes the difference  between the two kinds of groups. Members of the "amateur" groups are not  allowed (officially, at least) to earn money. They are expected to have regular  day jobs and receive no state support, and in turn don't have to deal with  official cultural agencies.  </P> <P> With "professionals," music is their main job. They belong to an official,  state-affiliated concert organization that books shows for them throughout the  Soviet Union. The group must present itself to an artistic council for  approval. This council can cancel an act's approved status, thus rendering the  band "forbidden."  </P> <P> Professionals, Troitsky writes, enjoy several advantages, including wages, the  opportunity to tour and play large venues, free musical equipment and the right  to appear on radio, TV and records. The amateur groups have just one advantage:  greater freedom in expressing themselves. Authorities, Namin said, didn't seem  to worry about the latter groups because their shows were fairly underground,  restricted to small rooms rather than large halls.  </P> <P> Like Belov, Namin was eventually declared "forbidden" after forming a band,  Flowers, that also seemed to stir too many Western-style passions. Besides,  Namin said, the cultural officials thought the group's name was too closely  identified with drugs and American flower-power sentiments.  </P> <P> But Namin -- under the name Stas Namin Group -- continued to perform and by the  '80s was granted "approved" status again. Soon after the arrival of glasnost,  Namin accepted an invitation to do some shows in the U.S. and, later, Japan.  </P> <P> He returned home and began building a music organization that manages bands and  sponsors concerts.  </P> <P> Namin works with some 40 bands, representing styles ranging from new wave and  hard rock to jazz-rock. He said he chose Belov's group, Gorky Park, to promote  first in the West because he thinks the first "Soviet super group" -- as he  terms it -- should be "a positive band with classic rock overtones, strong  masculine voices and vibrations of the land."  </P> <P> But, he says, he has many bands of equal quality in the wings. "Gorky Park is  just the beginning," he said. "You will be hearing a lot in the '90s from our  bands."  </P> <P> Belov was born in the center of Moscow, right behind the Pushkin Museum of Fine  Arts. He remembers hearing his parents' recordings by Bill Haley and other '50s  stars of rock as a child, but it was the Beatles who first made him want to be  a musician.  </P> <P> "I couldn't understand any of the words, but I didn't care," he said, sitting  with the four other members of the band in a stadium dressing room the day  before the festival. "I just loved the sound.  </P> <P> "The funny thing is we had no idea that they were popular all around the world.  We just loved the music. All of a sudden, a lot of people my age were playing  guitars. We all wanted to be the Beatles. I saved some money and bought an  acoustic guitar and taught myself how to play."  </P> <P> While attending architecture college, Belov played in amateur bands, performing  original tunes and versions of songs by such groups as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin  and Deep Purple.  </P> <P> The records by these bands weren't sold in the state shops because the  government frowned on rock and because the state label, Melodiya, wasn't  willing to pay royalties to the Western artists. Still, he said, it was easy to  acquire them through friends who traveled to the West and in "unofficial" stops  that were apparently allowed to operate on a sort of black market basis by the  government.  </P> <P> Despite a promising future in architecture, Belov opted for music -- even  though he realized that in Russia he would probably never be able to enjoy  either the financial or artistic rewards rockers in the West received.  </P> <P> Belov joined a "professional" band when he was 18, earning the equivalent of  $100 to $200 a month -- roughly the average salary in the Soviet Union at the  time. Though the first group sometimes played before crowds as large as 15,000  to 30,000, Belov eventually became frustrated because the music was more  pop-oriented than the rock he loved.  </P> <P> The group, Belov said, played each night from a list of songs filed with the  state cultural committee. Though tempted, the band never tried to sneak in  other favorites because there was always the fear that "someone could be around  and you could be suddenly stopped one day and not allowed to play any more."  </P> <P> The guitarist then formed Moscow, a band that leaned more toward rock. He was  thrilled -- until the band got so popular that the government closed it down.  Recalling the period, he said, "When they declared us 'forbidden,' I felt like  I had almost been killed . . . that I was dying."  </P> <P> Belov had offers to play in several pop-oriented, state-sponsored bands, but he  described them as "very, polite, very safe, very boring." He opted for the  nerve-wracking "wild clubs" until he was drained.  </P> <P> The road to Gorky Park began when Namin returned from performing in the U.S.  and began assembling his new band, which also includes singer Nikolai Noskov,  bassist Sasha Minkov, drummer Sasha Lvov and guitarist Jan Ianenkov. With their  previous groups, the musicians had collectively sold more than 10 million  albums in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Able to operate outside of the old "approved/forbidden" system, Belov declares  the band as absolutely independent.  </P> <P> "Being in this band is like being reborn," he said. "We were playing real rock  'n' roll again, and kids liked it very much. We played festivals for 25,000  people almost immediately and then we began thinking about America."  </P> <P> The bridge to America and PolyGram Records came through Namin's link with New  Jersey-based manager Dennis Berardi. With the help of a good word from Bon Jovi  guitarist Richie Sambora, a long-time friend of Berardi, Gorky Park got signed  by PolyGram Records. The group, which is expected to tour here late this year,  is already getting exposure on MTV.  </P> <P> "We realize the Russian thing is going to get the band a lot of attention in  the beginning, but that only lasts for a couple of weeks," Berardi said  backstage at Lenin Stadium. "After that, the band will have to prove itself."  </P> <P> The Moscow Music Peace Festival, which was given extensive coverage by MTV and  was shown on a pay-per-view basis in the United States, was Gorky Park's first  big chance to state its case -- at least electronically -- to a Western  audience.  </P> <P> Though the Western acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, drew the most cheers, the  Soviet bands, too, were warmly received. Dozens of fans waved Soviet flags as  Gorky Park went through some of its own songs in English and topped its  50-minute set both days with a version of the Who's "My Generation."  </P> <P> But the group's performance was shaky during the first day of the festival.  Though the music has some bite on record, it seemed rather dated live -- much  like a replay of the "corporate rock" sound of such '70s best-sellers as  Journey.  </P> <P> Lead singer Noskov didn't help by wearing lace pants that made him look more  like Lita Ford than a rock hero. Things were sharper musically the second day,  but the band's movements still seemed stiff and a bit old-fashioned.  </P> <P> Belov acknowledged before going on stage here that most Russian bands are way  behind the times, but he feels that greater exposure to the Western rock world  will help the groups update their presentations.  </P> <P> The atmosphere at the festival was loose and relaxed, much the way the city  itself seemed. Visiting here 10 years ago, a reporter was struck by the way  people on the street seemed uncomfortable when approached, and especially when  an interview was attempted.  </P> <P> But now they tended to speak much more generously, seeming even eager to  express their feelings to visiting reporters about the changes in their country  and the changes they feel are still needed.  </P> <P> Both Western and local participants in the concert -- including Bon Jovi  manager Doc McGhee and Stas Namin -- spoke of the festival as a sort of Soviet  Woodstock. But fans, too, spoke in terms of a cultural breakthrough. Some in  the crowd had traveled as long as four days by train from Siberia to be on  hand.  </P> <P> The biggest prizes of the day were concert T-shirts, which were sold from the  back of two giant trucks just inside the stadium's outer gates. The festival  sponsors had flown in 30,000 T-shirts and they were reportedly all sold  (despite a fairly hefty $40 price tag) within 90 minutes. Fans lined up 10 and  12 deep the entire time at the rear of the truck.  </P> <P> The enthusiasm wasn't all out of love for rock 'n' roll, pointed out one local  resident, who said he runs a one-man black market operation. He said the  T-shirts -- like the much-publicized Paul McCartney album of oldies that was  released only in the Soviet Union -- are like currency. The man, who appeared  to be in his early 20s, said he somehow got 1,000 of the McCartney albums  straight from the factory and now trades to Soviet citizens or sells them to  tourists for much valued U.S. dollars.  </P> <P> After Gorky Park's set, Belov and the other members of the band walked out  among the crowd. This was no time to stay isolated in the dressing room. Just  as he had been moved by the empty stadium a few days before, he again seemed  moved by seeing it filled with rock fans.  </P> <P> "For years, people here thought about the day when things would be better, but  finally it got to a point where they no longer believed it," he said during the  festival weekend. "I think Gorbachev realized there was no way we could live  like that any more. It was time to give people more freedom and, for me and all  the people here, part of that freedom was rock 'n' roll."  </P></p>

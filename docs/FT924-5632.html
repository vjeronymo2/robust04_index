			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ciments Francais faces fresh allegations A FRESH controversy yesterday broke over Ciments Francais, the French cement producer, when the Paris stock market watchdog, the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) accused it of breaching takeover rules. The COB said it had sent a report to the public prosecutor indicating that Ciments Francais had obtained control of more than one-third of Guintoli, an Arles-based construction group, without launching a takeover bid as demanded by stock exchange rules. This is the second scandal to surround the cement group after the disclosure last month of FFr655m (Dollars 120.3m) of exceptional losses on off-balance sheet dealings. As a result, Mr Pierre Conso, its former chairman, was forced to stand down. He bought FFr1.4bn of shares off the balance sheet, including FFr350m worth of Guintoli shares, according to Mr Bernard Laplace, the new Ciments Francais chairman. Ciments Francais declared a 32.9 per cent stake in Guintoli last June, says the the COB report, the result of a two-month inquiry. However, the COB believes Ciments Francais really controlled more than that through an agreement it signed in 1989 with Prigest, a management company, to buy Guintoli shares. This accord covered 17.9 per cent of Guintoli's capital at its most recent renewal date, two months ago.</p>

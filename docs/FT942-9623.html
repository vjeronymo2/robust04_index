			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Oppenheimer leads Russia team Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers, will head a team to meet Russian officials in Moscow next week. It comes as the South African group's Dollars 5bn diamond marketing contract with Russia appears to be under strain. Among the Russian negotiators will be Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond and precious stones committee, who is demanding that Russia keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade rather than the 5 per cent agreed under the terms of the contract with De Beers. Mr Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of Komdragmet, told Diamantaire, a subscription-only newsletter published by the CRU International consultancy group, that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, had authorised a government committee to meet Mr Oppenheimer, making this the highest level of official negotiations for De Beers in Russia since it concluded its five-year contract in 1990. De Beers controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds and Russia supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De Beers sells. Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamantaire, said the sudden decision of Mr Oppenheimer to leave for Moscow 'underlines the predicament facing De Beers over what strategy to adopt with Russia'. He said Komdragmet officials had shown a preference for dealing directly with members of the Oppenheimer family rather than with Mr Gary Ralfe, managing director of De Beers central selling organisation. Mr Ralfe recently criticised Russia for selling diamonds in breach of the contract.</p>

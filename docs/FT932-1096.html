			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World growth to hit 1.5% WORLD economic growth will continue sluggish this year, running at 1.5 per cent, but should double next year to 3 per cent, according to a UN survey published yesterday, reports Michael Littlejohns, from New York. The Russian and other economies in transition following the collapse of the communist system are forecast to record a further 10 per cent fall in output after last year's 17 per cent decline. Continued strong economic growth - 5.5 to 6 per cent - is projected for most Asian countries with China registering a remarkable 11 per cent increase following last year's rise of almost 13 per cent. UN forecasters, who claim a better track record than the World Bank and the IMF warned the Chinese economy was in danger of over-heating because of rapid growth in money supply and inadequate government revenues. The report said a hesitant recovery appeared under way in the US, Britain and Canada. However, Japan's output would grow only slightly - 1.5 per cent against 1.3 per cent in 1992 - while Germany's would decline by 0.5 per cent, and French and Italian output would slow.</p>

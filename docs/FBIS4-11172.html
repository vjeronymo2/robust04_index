Thursday night, the EZLN Command reported that  a portion of its members would return to their places of origin.  Moreover, the EZLN will continue with its consultation process  to return to the reconciliation dialogue. Camacho Solis said the  EZLN is responding to the messages for peace made by the  government and the civilian society.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I believe it is good news  for  the country to know the EZLN is responding to these actions with  actions that set a very clear course in favor of the resumption  of the talks.

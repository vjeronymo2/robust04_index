			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Downturn pushes Japan's unemployment to 2.4% JAPAN'S unemployment rate rose to 2.4 per cent in December as the downturn in the economy began to take its toll upon the jobs market. Most Tokyo economists expect the official unemployment rate will rise in the course of the year to nearly 3 per cent, the peak it reached during the downturn of the mid-1980s. The main cause of the rise from 2.3 per cent in November is the virtual evaporation of private sector job offers, in both manufacturing and services, as companies freeze recruitment to cut costs. The ratio of job offers to job applicants stayed at 0.93 in December, the same rate as November, which means there are 93 job offers for every 100 applicants. This ratio's stability was mainly due to a surge of job offers from the construction sector fuelled by expanded public works programmes. Government ministers and business leaders used the weak unemployment data to renew their calls for an early cut in interest rates. The official unemployment rate is an underestimate of the extent of unemployment in Japan. Job losses among self-employed and mainly women part-time workers who do not register for unemployment benefit have already risen sharply. Japan's lifetime employment system means that thousands of workers are being kept on company payrolls even though they have no work to do. Some financial analysts estimate this so called in-company unemployment amounts to about 6 per cent of the industrial workforce. The rise in unemployment is one of the main factors depressing consumer confidence, which fell by 3.2 per cent to 38.2 per cent in the final quarter of last year according to the official index published yesterday by the Economic Planning Agency. Consumer sentiment about the employment outlook fell 8.6 per cent to 27 per cent in the last quarter of the year, fuelling growing pessimism among consumers about the outlook for their standard of living. As private investment is deeply depressed a revival in personal consumption is seen as essential to reigniting economic growth. Business confidence remains depressed, but not as depressed as the end of last year, according to a separate report by the EPA. Its index of business sentiment for the first three months of this year stood at minus 24, compared with minus 32 in the final quarter of last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- Taiwan has decided to  resume importing apples and pears from South Korea, which they  stopped buying in 1992 in a protest over Seoul's cutoff of  diplomatic ties with Taipei.    At a private-level Korea-Taiwan meeting held in Seoul on  Tuesday and Wednesday, the two sides agreed on a barter trade  involving fruits and vegetables.    Under the agreement, South Korea will export 5,500 tons of  apples and 2,000 tons of pears to Taiwan in the 1993-`94 period  while importing from Taiwan 11,000 tons of Taiwanese bananas,  5,000 tons of onions and 2,800 tons of garlic, all in an amount  equivalent to the value of the apple and pear exports.    Besides, Taiwan promised to import 4,000 tons of South  Korean  apples separate from the barter trade.    This means that Taiwan will import 11,500 tons of South  Korean fruits in the current year, which compares with 8,516  tons they imported in the 1991-92 period immediately before the  breakup of formal relations.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / IBM claims breakthrough in use of CDs to store data Scientists in the US are claiming a breakthrough in recording technology which makes it possible to store several movies, 12 hours of music or 1m pages of printed text on a single compact disc. The breakthrough could markedly influence the development of the 'multimedia' revolution which promises to deliver new, interactive varieties of entertainment and information to television screens in the home and office. It could also revolutionise the storage and retrieval of business information. At present, companies store regularly used information in magnetic disc drives or 'jukeboxes' of optical compact discs. The new technique, developed by researchers at International Business Machines' Almaden research centre in San Jose, California, will multiply tenfold the amount of data that can be stored in a given space. Any item can be retrieved within 10 seconds, the researchers say. Video games, training programmes and other multimedia applications should benefit from the enhanced quality of image and sound made possible by the IBM technique. The essence of multimedia technology is the transformation of information of all kinds - video images, music, text and so on - into the digital computer language of bits and bytes in which it can be manipulated by computer and transmitted over telecommunications lines. Storage of bits is expensive. Optical disc technology, in which lasers 'read' marks on the metallised surface of a compact disc, has so far proved the most cost-effective solution. The IBM breakthrough has been to glue together individual discs without the metal coating to form layered, three-dimensional stacks. Information anywhere in the stack can be read by focusing the laser beam on the appropriate layer. A 10-layer disc could store more than 1m pages of text. One application could be the storage of millions of movies in digital form for video-on-demand services. The new disc will not work in today's compact disc drives, and multi-layer CDs will inevitably be more expensive to make than single-layer discs.</p>

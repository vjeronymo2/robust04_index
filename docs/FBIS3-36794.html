During the meeting, the premier expressed concern over  recent  events in Abkhazia. The Abkhaz side has for a fourth time  violated the Geneva agreement. On 6 February groups of armed  militants attacked the Georgian population, killing 60 people  and taking many people prisoner. Villlages were burned down.  Militants also attacked a village in Tsalenjikha Rayon, killing  five people.    About 3,000 people, including children and women, are  sheltering in a gorge. It is difficult to evacuate them from  there due to thick snow. The premier said that everything is  being done to evacuate the population.    Heavy equipment, including 15 tanks, has been used to  eliminate the Georgian population. Militants of Chechen,  Cossack, and other nationalities had been brought to the area on  Ikarus buses.    The premier stressed that the authorities of the Republic of  Georgia have been doing everything to achieve a political  settlement of the conflict. Not a single armed Georgian fighter  is in the area.    The premier asked Mr. Starcevic to convey to the United  Nations full information on the current situation in Abkhazia  and force the separatists to observe the Geneva agreement.</p>

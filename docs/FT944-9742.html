			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (1): Smiles that may be a little bit forced - Prospects are starting to look up for the economy but the forthcoming presidential elections may affect the mood of investors and the stock market is yielding disappointing results It is easy to understand why Credit Lyonnais, the embattled state-controlled banking group, felt the need to give staff a piece of advice last month as they discussed with clients its legacy of past financial problems. Maintain the official line, it said, 'but always with a smile'. A few weeks after the bank reported losses for the first half of the year of FFr4.5bn (Pounds 534m or Dollars 856m) on top of 1993 losses of FFr6.9bn, that smile might finally be starting to seem justified. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman, has claimed that the cost of its history of reckless loans is firmly behind it. In the same way, prospects are beginning to look up for the French economy as a whole. Observers of the French scene are feeling more optimistic. 'All the figures are starting to show quite a strong recovery,' says Mr Piers Butler, head of French equity sales for Smith New Court. Job creation is rising and other indicators such as business confidence, investment and consumer spending are looking positive. Insee, the official statistics agency, recently raised its growth forecast for this year to 2.2 per cent, and to 3.1 per cent for 1995. Equally, analysts predict that the CAC-40, the index of leading quoted companies on the Paris Bourse, is set to start rising again after languishing for more than two years. Performance for smaller and more entrepreneurial companies may look more promising still. Matif, the French financial futures exchange, has continued to develop new products and report substantially increased volumes in derivative trades, much of it coming from business in other countries. The government's privatisation programme has been proceeding well, with a sharp rise in the number of private investors and both personal and institutional over-subscription for shares in formerly state-controlled giants such as Renault, the motor group so symbolic of the nation. In the wake of the success of the 'Balladur bonds' issued last year, take-up figures are looking promising for the FFr20bn in government bonds announced over the summer which are geared for the first time at the retail sector. One element of uncertainty likely to affect the mood of investors in France is the forthcoming presidential election. The race for the Elysee Palace is scheduled for next May, although illness or political tactics from Mr Francois Mitterrand may bring the date forward. Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris and head of the Gaullist RPR Party, became the first serious politician to declare his candidacy at the start of November. The move is likely to trigger a divisive struggle on the political right against Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. This in turn may boost further the prospects for Mr Jacques Delors, the socialist whose term as president of the European Commission ends in December, and who looks likely to declare his candidature. He is already neck-and-neck with Mr Balladur in the polls. Nevertheless, Mr Edmond Alphandery, economics minister, argues that the markets should not be affected by the election because it is unlikely that any of these candidates would change the fundamental direction of economic policy. 'It would be absolutely irresponsible and would damage their credibility to do so,' he says. More generally, the future challenges for the French economy are far from over. While there is optimism for the future on equities, current performance still leaves much to be desired with the stock market yielding disappointing results since late 1992. Privatisation has so far generated some FFr103bn for the French government. But the remaining potential candidates include some state-controlled companies - such as Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the insurance group, and Seita, the tobacco monopoly - which could prove far more complex and less remunerative to sell. While job creation in France has been rising, new job seekers and other factors wiped out any gains. After a temporary dip over the summer, the September jobless figures showed unemployment at a record high of 3.35m or 12.7 per cent of the labour force. Mr Gwinn Hacche, an economist with James Capel, says unemployment during recessions has been proportionately much higher in France than other countries and seems to continue to ratchet up while the government's investment in training seems to have had little effect. Mr Chirac has already made the problem of employment, which he said threatens the destruction of society, a central theme of his election campaign. He is reflecting a widespread fear, which is set to make unemployment a centrepoint of the political debate over the next few months. Mr Alphandery concedes that labour market inflexibility is one of the most important challenges for the French economy over the coming months. He rejects as 'neo-classical' suggestions that the minimum wage presents a problem. He calls instead for greater investment in training, reform of the education system, and the possible lessening of social security charges on companies. He highlights two other significant problems. The first is the budget deficit, which the government is forecasting at FFr301bn for this year and FFr275bn for 1995, or 4.6 per cent of GDP. Most analysts expect it to end up being nearer to 5 per cent. The second is the funding shortfall of the social security system, which could trigger tax increases next year. Mr Alphandery says there is a need to reform the retirement system, pensions and the costs of health care provision. Pensions reform is set to be one of the key debates over the next few years. The economics minister does not expect any legislative proposals before the next presidential election, but the development of funds will radically change the shape of the financial sector. French business will face a broader range of increasingly tough challenges. Deregulation and privatisation are introducing more competition to the domestic market. The influence of the European Union will also intensify. European court challenges to the restricted access to Orly airport outside Paris and to state financial support to Air France are just two recent examples. Meanwhile, there are factors which will strike home in particular business sectors. For instance, the banks are likely to need to cut staffing considerably from current levels, in a delicate process to weave their way through employment legislation and the fear of strikes. Insurers will have to face up to the growing tensions between their tied agents around the country, and lower-cost alternative forms of distribution system, such as insurance by telephone, which are spreading rapidly across Europe. There may also be growing pressure on some of the more distinctive characteristics of capitalism French-style. The rise of the power of institutional investors accompanying the growth of pension funds could reduce the need for the noyaux durs network of cross-shareholdings between different companies. Many are questioning the extent to which French state- controlled companies and even those in the private sector hold large equity stakes and exert management influence in businesses in sectors entirely unrelated to their own. For instance, several of the largest insurance companies control banks, the bad property loans of which have dragged down results substantially. Institutional pressure - from abroad as well as within the country - may also help trigger a far broader debate on corporate governance within the country. Traditionally many French companies have tended to be extremely hierarchical and run like personal fiefdoms, with a close-knit network of directors under the control of a single all-too-powerful chairman-chief executive. One illustration cited by Mr Butler of Smith New Court is the fact that many French chief executives refer in their companies' annual reports to what 'je' did and not - as they would in Anglo-Saxon enterprises - what 'we' did. He also highlights the continuing and controversial role of the tightly-networked French intellectual elite in rotating between the boards of companies: individuals who have graduated with top academic marks from the top colleges and administrative corps, rather than rising through the ranks based on management ability and knowledge of their business. Meanwhile, there are still pressures for further reforms to improve the rights of minority shareholders. In spite of new regulations, takeover conditions in practice seem all too often to give too much power to dominant shareholders and leave little voice to their smaller brethren. While the French may be content as they reflect on the renewed expansion of the economy, they ought perhaps to admit that their smile is still just a little bit forced.</p>

(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to amend its original listing fees for stock issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34133 (May 31, 1994), 59 FR 29308 (June 6, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex is amending Section 140 of its Listing Standards and Requirements relating to the fees charged to listed companies for the original listing of common stock. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee applicable to the original listing of stock issues on the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the listing fee for stock issues ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares to more than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already have securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers listed on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50 percent of the rates for U.S. companies, including the $5,000 one-time charge, with a maximum of $30,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee of $45,000 ($50,000 inclusive of the one-time charge of $5,000) for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares. In addition, the Exchange is reducing the maximum listing fee for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from $30,000 to $25,000, inclusive of the one-time charge. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 140 is amended to require the following fees: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Less than 1 million shares_$5,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;1+&hyph;&blank;2 million shares_$10,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;2+&hyph;&blank;3 million shares_$15,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;3+&hyph;&blank;4 million shares_$17,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;4+&hyph;&blank;5 million shares_$20,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;5+&hyph;&blank;6 million shares_$22,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;6+&hyph;&blank;7 million shares_$25,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;7+&hyph;&blank;8 million shares_$27,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;8+&hyph;&blank;9 million shares_$30,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;9+&hyph;10 million shares_$32,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10+&hyph;15 million shares_$37,500 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15+&blank;&blank;&blank; million shares_$45,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above per-share fee, there is a one-time charge of $5,000 for companies that do not have a stock or warrant issue listed on the Exchange. (The one-time charge of $5,000 does not apply to any company which previously paid the one-time charge in connection with the listing of a debt issue.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges, the fee, including the one-time charge, is 50% of the rates set forth above, with a maximum fee of $25,000. Where the original listing of more than one class of stock is included in the same application, the fee is based on the aggregate number of shares of all such classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes, based upon discussions with prospect companies, that each year several large companies elect not to list on the Amex due to the expense of the Exchange's listing fee at the upper end of the fee schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements of Section 6 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission believes that the reduced original listing fees for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares are not unfairly discriminatory as proscribed by Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that adopting a maximum original listing fee for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in attracting large companies for listing with its regulatory interests in listing only bona fide companies on the Exchange. For example, although decreasing listing fees for issues over 15 million shares should attract additional larger issuers to its market, as well as provide an incentive for current Exchange issuers to list their new issues on the Amex, the fee amendment will not affect the Amex's quantitative criteria for listing stock on the Exchange. Moreover, the adoption of a maximum fee provides for a more equitable allocation of listing fees among issuers and should eliminate any disincentive for large issuers to list on the Amex. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that reducing the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock for non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges from $30,000 to $25,000 (inclusive of the $5,000 one-time charge) is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in view of the reduction in fees for U.S. companies with issues exceeding 15 million shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approved the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;12) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-MORTICIAN GETS 23 YEARS FOR 18 ROBBERIES  </P> <P> A former mortician convicted of robbing 18 small businesses and fast-food  restaurants in the Antelope Valley was sentenced Wednesday in San Fernando  Superior Court to more than 23 years in state prison.  </P> <P> Judge Meredith C. Taylor sentenced Jimmy Thomas, 38, of Compton to 23 years and  eight months in prison.  </P> <P> He was convicted in January of 18 counts of robbery, including special  allegations that he used a firearm while committing the crimes.  </P> <P> During the robberies, which occurred in the Lancaster and Palmdale areas  between December, 1988, and February, 1989, Thomas approached store counters,  showed a gun or simulated one and demanded money, prosecutors said. He usually  ordered store clerks to retreat to back rooms, bathrooms or closets before  making his getaway.  </P> <P> The amount of cash taken in each robbery ranged from $35 to $475, authorities  said. A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigator said he believed  that Thomas used the money to support a cocaine habit.  </P> <P> Thomas, who was arrested after one of his victims recognized him, denied  committing the robberies. During court proceedings, a man claiming to be the  real robber stood up and confessed, but authorities later determined that  Thomas had offered the man $10,000 for the admission, court records show.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ITALY'S TRACK AND FIELD CHIEF QUITS  </P> <P> Primo Nebiolo resigned Saturday as chairman of Italy's track federation after a  series of scandals and subsequent criticism of his leadership.  </P> <P> Federation spokesman Augusto Frasca said the resignation was expected and would  take effect Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Nebiolo, 64, is also president of the International Amateur Athletic  Federation, track and field's world governing body. His resignation had no  immediate effect on that position.  </P> <P> Nebiolo has been hailed for his success in promoting the sport internationally.  He was re-elected to a 4-year term as the Italian organization's chairman Dec.  11.  </P> <P> However, calls for his resignation came after it was revealed that the men's  long jump result at the 1987 World Championships at Rome was fixed and grew  louder during an investigation of alleged financial wrongdoings involving  federation officials.  </P> <P> An independent panel found that officials fixed the results so that an Italian,  Giovanni Evangelisti, got the bronze medal instead of American Larry Myricks.  Nebiolo was not named among the conspirators, but he was criticized for not  taking quicker action on the matter. Evangelisti later surrendered his medal,  and it was given to Myricks.  </P> <P> The federation ruling council will reportedly meet on or before May 7 to choose  a new chairman.  </P></p>

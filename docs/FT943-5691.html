			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Restructuring behind rise to IPounds 5m at Waterford Wedgwood Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and tableware group, yesterday announced figures described by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, as its 'best first-half results since 1987'. Mr O'Reilly said the increase in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 400,000 to IPounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.04m), 'fully justifies the actions, initiatives and strategies implemented in the past two years'. Sales rose IPounds 13.9m to IPounds 149m, while profits before interest more than doubled to IPounds 7.9m (IPounds 3.6m). Lower interest charges of IPounds 2.8m (IPounds 3.2m) and a higher tax charge of IPounds 800,000 (IPounds 300,000) left retained profits of IPounds 4.3m. The group has taken a charge of IPounds 1.8m for restructuring in both the crystal and china divisions. Wedgwood sales were up 8 per cent to IPounds 104m, while operating profits more than doubled to IPounds 4.5m - the first increase in profits at Wedgwood in three years. Wedgwood's earthenware pottery subsidiary, Johnson Brothers, continued to perform badly,with sales reduced by stiff competition. The improved operating profits at Wedgwood reflected last year's restructuring and improved sales in the US and UK. Sales in Japan remained steady following price reductions, the company said. Sales of crystal rose 16 per cent to IPounds 44.9m and operating profits more than doubled to IPounds 3.4m due to strong sales in the US and Ireland. However, sales growth of Waterford's mid-market Marquis range tapered off after two years of strong growth. Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p (0.02p). COMMENT Mr O'Reilly hinted strongly at a resumed dividend payment at Waterford Wedgwood's annual meeting earlier this year. On the basis of these interims, a nominal but welcome dividend of about 0.5p looks on the cards. The reduction in debt to Pounds 58m puts gearing at 48 per cent. The company is not fully out of the woods, however, as shown by the Pounds 1.8m restructuring charge, and analysts are expected to leave their forecasts unchanged at this stage. Most are opting for full-year pre-tax profits of between IPounds 22m and IPounds 23m, equivalent to earnings of just under 3p  -a prospective p/e of 23.5, reflecting recovery prospects.</p>

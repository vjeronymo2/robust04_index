			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Between a rock and a hard place: Fiscal policy alone may not be enough to revive the French economy Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the finance committee in the French National Assembly, puts it simply. 'If you are trying to lift a heavy rock, then you need to use both hands.' The rock, for Mr Barrot and his countrymen, is the longest recession to afflict their economy since the 1970s. With unemployment at 11.7 per cent and rising, and with gross domestic product forecast to contract by almost 1 per cent this year, it is a heavy burden. The stakes are high. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has described the fight against unemployment as the government's top priority. With presidential elections just 18 months away, the fortunes of Mr Balladur's RPR party and its UDF coalition partner will depend on how the administration wields its fiscal and monetary tools, and whether they act fast enough for the French electorate. The government will declare its fiscal hand when it unveils its 1994 budget in cabinet today. Acknowledging that he initially erred too far on the side of austerity in this year's budget, Mr Balladur has struck a median course for the future, using the proceeds of privatisation and related borrowing to finance tax cuts and consumption incentives within a tight limit on overall public spending. But how the government will use its monetary powers is less clear. After losing its bearings in the August crisis of the European currency system, the French government is still groping its way towards a new European policy. Today's budget plan demonstrates the government's desire to stimulate demand in the economy, but also the constraints it faces in doing so. The principal elements of the budget comprise a FFr19bn (Pounds 2.2bn) reduction in income taxes, chiefly to the benefit of the ruling conservatives' middle-class constituency, and a number of measures aimed at drawing French savings into housing and consumption. In particular, the government is expected to allow savers to withdraw early from eight-year saving plans while maintaining the tax advantages and interest payments of the schemes. Tax relief on Sicav money market funds may also be reduced in an attempt to encourage consumption and investment in the housing sector. Those selling money market fund certificates to buy property could be exempted from capital gains tax. Such measures alone do not represent a significant fiscal stimulus. This is partly because the government is now giving with one hand what it took away through tax increases earlier this year. The rise in the Contribution Socialisee Generale, a tax on all income, from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent from the beginning of July, and higher levies on petrol and alcohol, will not be offset by the budgetary measures. 'We have to maintain the health of public finances,' says one French economic official, referring to the tax measures in the budget. He cites the government's budget deficit targets of FFr317bn this year and FFr300bn next year as the constraints on the package. Instead, the real fiscal boost is coming from borrowing. The proceeds of the Balladur Bond, raising FFr110bn in July and covered by privatisation sales of the same amount over the next 18 months, will help to fund public works and housing and to improve companies' cash flow. One measure hit its target. The decision to accelerate infrastructure spending in May gave public contractors, intensive users of local labour but little imported material, a better month in June. But overall, the economy has not lifted itself off the floor. GDP recovered from its first-quarter fall of 0.7 per cent to show zero growth in April-June. But a 'double dip', with a drop in GDP in the current third quarter, is not ruled out by most economists, who believe that fiscal policy alone is not enough to lift the economy out of recession. 'They must add a monetary stimulus to their fiscal stance,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, currency economist at UBS, the securities house, in London. On monetary policy, however, 'there is a fog surrounding policy', says Mr Barrot, 'and when there is a fog it is necessary to move step by step'. So far, these steps have involved a series of gradual interest rate cuts and a policy of shadowing the D-Mark. But the reductions in borrowing costs have only brought official interest rates down to pre-crisis levels and the most important rate, the intervention rate, which sets a floor for money market rates, has been left untouched at 6.75 per cent. As a result the franc is now trading just a few per cent below its previous ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. This caution is curious, given that on August 2 it was France that insisted EC currencies should be allowed to fluctuate by up to 15 per cent around each other, not by 10 per cent as other countries were ready to agree to. But there are several reasons why the French authorities have not so far used their exchange rate freedom. To do so would highlight the loss of face for Mr Balladur, who portrayed himself as defender of the franc fort. The RPR Gaullist prime minister also has to take account of the atavistic attachment within his UDF coalition partner to the old-style European Monetary System. Ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a founding father of the EMS and leader of the UDF, has called for the EMS to return to its old 'wide' bands of 6 per cent by January 1994 and its old 'narrow' bands of 2.25 per cent by January 1995. Technically, too, the Bank of France needs to rebuild its currency reserves  -exhausted by the unsuccessful defence of the franc - and to repay its consequent debts to the Bundesbank: tasks most cheaply accomplished if the franc stays fairly strong relative to the D-Mark. The government's problem is that its policy of shadowing the D-Mark is reaching its limits. 'There is no room left any more for French rates to decrease with respect to German rates,' says Mr Bernard Godement, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute in Paris. According to this argument, the current gap between short-term French and German interest rates - about 50 basis points higher for French official rates - is necessary to maintain the franc's stability. Further cuts in French rates, therefore, require further action from the Bundesbank. Few expect big cuts in German borrowing costs over the next few months. Yet early action to trim French interest rates, with the inevitable risk for the exchange rate, may be unavoidable. In nominal terms, French long-term interest rates, at just over 6 per cent, are among the lowest in Europe and about the same level as in Germany. But their real level is high. With annualised inflation of just 2.2 per cent, French industry faces correspondingly higher real borrowing costs than Germany's. Small and medium-sized companies, which are more dependent on short-term financing, are worst placed, and are starting to make the politicians feel the heat. 'There is not a small company in the country which can find credit at less than 9 per cent,' complained a UDF deputy this week. Moreover, the currency markets appear to have anticipated a reduction of a few percentage points in the intervention rate by this time next year. Given that the high level of French interest rates at a time of recession and soaring unemployment helped prompt the currency crisis, keeping interest rates at their current level could lead to a fresh assault on the franc. It also seems to be dawning on France's policymakers, just as the markets earlier realised, that 'real' factors of growth and jobs need to be as much part of the convergence between European economies as the 'nominal' factors like interest rate/inflation differentials, written into the Maastricht treaty. The first sign of this wider interpretation of convergence may come later this autumn when France and Germany make a joint presentation of their medium-term economic plans for discussion with other EC ministers. For the moment, the debate inside France's ruling majority over interest and exchange rate policy has subsided. But that is because those who want a monetary relaxation expect Mr Balladur to move in their direction. If he does not, both the prime minister and the French economy may find themselves between a rock and a hard place.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Industrialists from Belarus and Ukraine do not raise  the issue of restoring the former political union. However, to  normalize the (?functioning) of the two states' economies,  industrialists consider it necessary to restore the former  economic relations. The monetary merger agreement between  Belarus and Russia is a key factor for the establishment of our  relations with Ukraine. In this case, Belarusian enterprises  will receive the opportunity to settle their accounts with their  Ukrainian partners -- who buy raw materials from Russia -- in  Russian rubles, which will naturally have a positive impact on  the work of Belarusian enterprises. In general, in the opinion  of experts, the preservation of close partnership-like relations  will impart a vital impulse to the stabilization of the economic  situation.</p>

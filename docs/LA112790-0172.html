			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MICHEAL RICHARDSON DRAWS SUSPENSION FOR ITALY BRAWL;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: FEDERATION PENALIZES FORMER NBA GUARD FOR INSTIGATING VIOLENCE THAT  LED TO A RECORD 19 EJECTIONS.  </P> <P> The Italian basketball federation today suspended former NBA guard Micheal Ray  Richardson for five games for instigating a brawl leading to a record 19  ejections.  </P> <P> Three other players, Americans Clemon Johnson and Frank Johnson and Italian  Stefano Rusconi, were each suspended for two games for their part in Sunday's  fight, which occurred during the closing minutes of Ranger Varese's 91-73  victory over Knorr Bologna.  </P> <P> Richardson, who plays for Knorr, started the melee by punching Rusconi of  Ranger. Frank Johnson of Ranger and Clemon Johnson of Knorr joined in, while  other players, coaches and assistants rushed onto the floor.  </P> <P> After riot police restored calm, referees ejected 12 players and seven team  officials. Knorr was left with only three players to finish the game.  </P> <P> The disciplinary committee of the Rome-based federation said Richardson was  suspended for punching Rusconi in the eye, triggering a brawl and repeatedly  trying to hit Frank Johnson.  </P> <P> "This is a black page for basketball, maybe the worst I've seen in my 40 years  in the sport," said Cesare Rubini, an official of the Italian national team.  </P> <P> The brawl was the latest controversy involving Richardson, who played eight  years in the NBA with the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets before being  banned from the league in 1986 for drug use.  </P> <P> Richardson's right to play in the NBA was restored in 1988 but he has been  playing in Italy for three years.  </P> <P> In 1988, Richardson was suspended for two games for fighting and last year drew  a one-game penalty for another skirmish.  </P> <P> Richardson, 35, caused a sensation last week when he threatened to break his  contract with Knorr and join the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA.  </P></p>

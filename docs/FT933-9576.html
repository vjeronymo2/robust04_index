			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / French decline takes toll on tills GALERIES Lafayette, La Redoute and a number of other leading French retail groups have highlighted the depressed state of the retail sector by announcing falls in sales for the first half of the year. French retailing has come under intense pressure in recent months as the economy has slid into recession. The reductions in interest rates since the March parliamentary elections have so far failed to stimulate consumer spending. Confidence is still weak because of the continuing rise in unemployment. As a result, many large retail groups saw sales fall in the first six months of the year. Galeries Lafayette, the department store concern, reported a 7 per cent reduction in sales from FFr14.87bn in the first half of 1992 to FFr13.8bn in the same period of this year. The group has been affected not only by the French recession but also by problems at its flagship store in New York. Monoprix, the chain of mixed merchandise stores belonging to the Galeries Lafayette group, also registered a fall in interim sales. Its turnover slipped by 5.7 per cent from FFr4.97bn to FFr4.68bn. La Redoute, the dominant player in the French mail order market, saw its sales decline by 3.6 per cent from FFr8.91bn in the first six months of last year to FFr8.58bn. BHV, one of whose best known interests is a department store beside the Hotel de Ville in Paris, suffered a reduction in first-half sales of 6.7 per cent to FFr1.75bn from FFr1.88bn. The news of these falls in sales, which reflects the generally gloomy trend in the French industrial and service sectors, comes at a turbulent time for French retailing. The strains on the sector have triggered a stream of takeover activity. Concentration of ownership has increased as large groups, such as Pinault-Printemps, Carrefour and Galeries Lafayette, have expanded by acquisition. Similarly, a number of new players have surfaced in French retailing, notably Tesco, the UK food retailer which took over Catteau supermarkets, and Kingfisher, the UK group that now owns the Darty electricals chain.</p>

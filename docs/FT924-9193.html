			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Motors hit by cost rises MITSUBISHI Motors, the Japanese car maker, yesterday reported a fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September due to higher costs, foreign exchange losses and losses on long-term stock holdings. Pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent to Y18.3bn (Dollars 149m) on a 1.6 per cent rise in sales to Y1,237.0bn. Net profits fell 26.5 per cent to Y10.7bn. The company said domestic sales, which rose 0.9 per cent to Y656bn, were supported by the popularity of recreational vehicles. Exports also rose 2.4 per cent to Y581bn. The slump in the Tokyo stock market hurt Mitsubishi's stock portfolio, and the company incurred evaluation losses of Y1.8bn. The company's cash on hand and deposits at banks at the end of September fell 42 per cent to Y49.2bn. For the year to March, Mitsubishi expects pre-tax profits to fall 7.9 per cent to Y46.5bn. The company had previously forecast Y51bn in pre-tax profits for the year, but was forced into the downward revision by an expected Y1.8bn in stock evaluation losses and Y2.5bn in foreign exchange losses.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Quotes of the day 'I know it is fashionable in the States for children to divorce their parents, but this party is not going that way.' Rodney Bickerstaffe NUPE, on union links 'As anyone with kids will know, dinosaurs are very popular these days.' Jill Murdoch, TSSA 'The local vicar tried for five years to join the party - but he wasn't a member of a union. There are not that many trade union leaders who can negotiate with God.' Jaqueline Abbott Hammersmith CLP 'Privatisation is not about better services, it is about cheaper services.' Anna McGonigle NUPE 'In January the prime minister said 'We have stopped, if you recall, the repossessions before Christmas.' That was a lie, John Major, and you know it.' Jack Straw shadow environment secretary 'Who would have thought that even home ownership would become an impossible dream for so many and an impossible nightmare for even more.' Bryan Gould 'None of us can feel happy about a Labour party that on average has less than 400 members per constituency; that's less than 2 per cent of the Labour vote.' Diana Jeuda NEC member</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen Foreign Ministry called on the Russian  Transportation Ministry to resume flights from Moscow to Groznyy  that were suspended ostensibly for security considerations.    The ministry's letter emphasized that the situation was  quiet  in Groznyy.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry described the unilateral  suspension of flights by Moscow as a violation of international  law which does serious harm to bilateral relations.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAGLIABUE TO MEET WITH NFL OWNERS  </P> <P> Paul Tagliabue, the new NFL commissioner, will hold a three-day series of  executive sessions with club presidents in Dallas early next month to discuss  the player-owner impasse and other issues.  </P> <P> Meetings are planned with owners representing two divisions each day on the  following schedule:  </P> <P> Dec. 5 -- NFC West, AFC East.  </P> <P> Dec. 6 -- Both Central divisions.  </P> <P> Dec. 7 -- NFC East, AFC West.  </P> <P> Raider owner Al Davis and two or three other presidents favor some form of free  agency.  </P> <P> Other owners have discussed a salary cap combined with a player wage scale.  </P> <P> In former years, NFL meetings have normally involved all 28 clubs. Tagliabue  said that in sessions with small groups of owners, more of them may feel like  participating.  </P> <P> "This is an imaginative way to get into some tricky issues," a club executive  said. "I hope some of the ideas proposed will be equally so."  </P> <P> Other subjects on Tagliabue's agenda are television, international plans and a  review of NFL office procedures. BOB OATES  </P></p>

N.  Kazimirov, a special envoy of the president of the Russian  Federation and ambassador for special commissions, and persons  accompanying him were subjected to intensive fire from the  Armenian side while crossing the Azeri-Armenian border in the  vicinity of the city of Kazakh on the basis of an agreement with  the administration of the president of Armenia. One vehicle was  hit and burned. Two Azeri servicemen providing security to the  Russian envoy were wounded.    The government of the Russian Federation decisively condemns  this unprecedented action grossly violating the rules of  international law, and demands and immediate public apology from  the supreme leadership of Armenia and a guarantee of unwavering  provision of security in the future to Russian envoys on  official missions. The government of the Russian Federation  firmly expects that the culprits in this malicious act will be  tried, and reserves the right to take the most decisive steps in  order to preclude repetition of such incidents.</p>

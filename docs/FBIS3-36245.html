			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen </F> Ivanov]    [Excerpt] Moscow, 3 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Experts from Russia  and Kazakhstan completed their consultations on the status and  use of the Baykonur space launch site today with virtually no  result. They merely adopted a protocol on the meeting, which  stated a mutual wish of the two sides to hold another meeting in  mid-February.    The Kazakh side did not submit any documents to be discussed  during the consultations but focussed on criticizing the  projects drawn up by the Russian delegation. According to some  experts, this is the reason why the two sides failed to arrive  at a compromise solution concerning Baykonur's future. [passage  omitted]</p>

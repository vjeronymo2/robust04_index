			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Not so comic capers - A disappointing adaption of an Ostrovsky play the season of new and modern opera put on at the Almeida Theatre in London by ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio - is an Ostrovsky adaptation. Nick Dear's racy, free-wheeling translation of the first full-length Ostrovsky play, A Family Affair (1850), was a hit when the theatre company Cheek by Jowl revealed it to London a few years ago. The composer Julian Grant, in search of a subject that would (in his words) mix 'sophistication and ding-dong humour', lighted on the Dear text for his Almeida Opera commission; and this eight-hander in three rather ill-proportioned acts is the result. To the number of Ostrovsky-based operas already in existence - Janacek's Katya Kabanova and Rimsky-Korsakov's Snow Maiden the best-known - this Family Affair is, I fear, an insubstantial addition. The play, an angry satire on bourgeois greed (given a scabrously upbeat topicality in Dear's modern argot), would hardly seem to need music in the first place; and the kind of music Grant has chosen for its operatic embodiment, though it manhandles the subject with boundless energy, ends up by underlining that point with wearying insistence. London audiences have learned to recognise (and wring hands over) new operas that were no more than musicked plays, or fey private rituals, or radio-plays manques; but this is a rare example of what I can only call the Cartoon Opera. Grant reveals a Loonie-Toons-and-Merrie-Melodies approach to operatic comedy, that trickiest of genres, exhibiting speed, force and hammer-blows of expressive device as his trademarks (in the tiny Almeida Theatre the level of volume achieved on Thursday by the 12-person orchestra often crossed the pain threshold). The musical idiom, with chug-a-chug strings, wah-wah brass, pell-mell screeches of woodwind and all manner of exclamation-mark punctuation, proves itself kin to the classic cartoon-studio accompaniment. I know what Grant means about ding-dong humour - but sophistication? The set-pieces - aria, ensemble - arrive with clear and not unskilful dramatic signposting; yet, since in the orchestral and vocal invention the distinction between straight and parodied tones of dramatic voice is blurred to the point of non-existence, the 'operatic' necessity of these formal arrangements seems no more than gestural. The really curious thing is that, while all the performers are worked at full stretch, an impression of dramatic speed is an illusion increasingly dispelled during an ever more spirit-clogging evening. Martin Duncan, a producer who has more than once shown a nimble hand with operatic hand, here delivers a coarse, blaring show - one can hardly blame him for not rising above the base-level of the material, but he and the conductor, Nicholas Kok, might at least have tried to vary vocal and orchestral volume a bit more. The cast contains three of the most accomplished operatic character-actors in the land - Geoffrey Dolton (Lazar), John Graham-Hall (Rispolozhensky), Richard Suart (Bolshov) - and several other pleasing young talents besides. All eight work with unceasing vigour to give the opera real 'go'. They fail, but that is hardly their fault. Almeida Theatre, London N1: in repertory until July 17</p>

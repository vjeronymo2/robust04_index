			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erna van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho April 9 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk said  on Saturday [9 April] that the SA [South African] Government  could not take over kwaZulu as had happened in Bophuthatswana.  He said at a news conference in Mmabatho that fundamentally  different situations prevailed in the two territories. The  president was speaking after talks with Bophuthatswana's two  joint administrators, Mr Job Mokgoro and Prof Tjaart van der  Walt.    Mr de Klerk said the de facto situation in Bophuthatswana  before the takeover was that former President Lucas Mangope was  no longer in charge. This was not the situation in kwaZulu. He  said the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal had no political or  constitutional aim but was intended to ensure stability and  create a climate conducive to free and fair elections.    He said no comparison should be drawn between Bophuthatswana  and kwaZulu. If Mr Mangope had acted differently he would still  have been in power and would have handed over that power on May  1, when the Legislative Assembly for the new provinces would  meet for the first time.    Mr de Klerk said the talks with the two administrators had  been to iron out "hitches". He said it was important that what  had been built up in Bophuthatswana should not be put at risk  because the territory would soon become part of the South Africa  again. It was important that tension should be overcome so that  things could normalise and return to stability. Both  administrators had informed him that they were cooperating well.  "Things go relatively well here," Mr de Klerk said.</p>

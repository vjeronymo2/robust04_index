			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Electricity liberalisation plea rejected Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday angered large electricity users by turning down proposals to liberalise the electricity market. He said that no case had been made for significant changes to the rules for the pool, the wholesale market for electricity, which have been blamed for pushing up prices. The pool arrangements 'have worked well', he said in a long-awaited report, and claims that security of supply would be threatened and competition would not work 'have been proved wrong'. In particular, Prof Littlechild said there was no case for allowing generators and consumers to bypass the pool and trade directly with each other. Under current rules large generators are obliged to sell all their output through the pool. Intensive energy users, which have criticised the sharp rise in electricity prices, have been pressing for liberalisation of pool trading. Earlier this week the Chemical Industries Association put outside-pool trading forward as a means of increasing competition among generators. Mr Doug Roger, one of the association's executive directors, said yesterday that he was 'amazed' that the regulator should have turned the proposal down. However, Mr Peter Rost of the Major Energy Users Association said that while some big industries would be disappointed, smaller companies would welcome the news because they lacked sufficient bargaining power to strike one-to-one deals directly with the generators. Prof Littlechild said there was little tangible evidence of the likely gains that trading outside the pool could bring, and it would be costly to make the necessary arrangements. It might also damage volume and transparency in the pool, which would place smaller competitors and new entrants at a disadvantage. But he said he wanted further improvements to the pool, although his research had shown opposition to a suggestion that generators should be paid their bid prices. At present generators receive the price bid by the most expensive plant needed to satisfy demand at a particular time of day, regardless of what they bid themselves. The regulator's views were laid out in a report produced in response to a request last year from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. In parallel with his inquiry the pool management has been preparing its own recommendations, which will be put forward later this year. London Docklands Development Corporation is inviting 16 companies to bid to participate in a project to supply heat and power to the Royal Docks. The project would supply power directly, bypassing the local electricity company. Trading outside the Pool. Offer, Hagley House, Hagley Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B16 8QG. Tel (021) 456 2100.</p>

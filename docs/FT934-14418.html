			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Star turn for the BES ACTRESS Serena Scott Thomas, known best for her recent portrayal of the princess of Wales in Diana: Her True Story, is expected to take the role of a drug-addicted aristocrat pursued by a baseball bat-wielding gangster in a new film to be financed by a business expansion scheme. Moor Street Films is seeking to raise Pounds 750,000 from private investors to make the film, which has a total budget of Pounds 1.2m and is to be promoted by Movie Screen Entertainment. The company hopes to generate extra money by making an original soundtrack album, to be released through PolyGram. There is no guarantee or cash backing attached to the scheme; once the net revenue is sufficient to cover investors' original subscription, revenue will be used to make deferred payments for expenses incurred during the production process. Once these have been met, investors will receive 35 per cent of further net revenue. The directors intend to wind up the company after five years and distribute its assets. The offer closes on November 12 and the minimum investment is Pounds 500. Those who invest at least Pounds 1,000 will be invited to a special screening of the film and a VIP reception. Johnson Fry is sponsoring another entrepreneurial assured tenancy BES - Capital Prime Properties Plus II, which aims to raise Pounds 5m to invest in residential property in central London. Johnson Fry estimates that the gross annual yield on the property portfolio should be more than 11 per cent. There is no arranged exit; alternative exit routes may be selling the company as a going concern, amalgamating it with other companies, or liquidating its assets. Those who invest before October 29 can buy shares at 96p, while those who get in before November 30 will pay 98p. Thereafter, purchasers must pay the full price of 100p. The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. Cavendish Kerrington is a similar assured tenancy BES, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson Securities, using the Kerrington Team of property managers which has been involved in four other BES companies. The new scheme aims to raise up to Pounds 5m to buy and refurbish small blocks of residential properties, mainly in the north and west of London, to be let under assured tenancies. There is no arranged exit. Subscribers before October 29 will pay 96p per share rather than 100p. The minimum investment is for 1,000 shares. Nucare is a trading company BES which is trying to raise Pounds 750,000 to establish itself as a support company to help independent pharmacies in bulk buying, marketing and developing own-brand products. It will be on similar lines to organisations such as NISA and Costcutter, which operate in the independent grocery market. There is no arranged exit and the minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng told  visiting Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans that China and  Australia, bound by extensive common interests, should work to  further their friendly and cooperative relations.    In a meeting with Evans today, Li noted that there is no  conflict of fundamental interests between the two countries,  which actually share interests in upholding peace and stability  in the Asia-Pacific region, promoting regional cooperation and  developing their own economies.    He continued that in the current international relations,  the  economic factor plays an increasingly important role.    The China-Australia cooperation in iron and steel, energy,  transportation and communications has a sound foundation and  holds great potentials for expansion, Li said.    Evans told Li that Australia is also pleased to see the big  momentum of its trade and economic cooperation with China.    Discussing the human rights issue, both Li and Evans voiced  support to the Vienna declaration and program of action, with Li  adding that China made big efforts in drafting the declaration.    Li continued that the declaration has reflected the  developing countries' basic position and demands, namely the  right to development is an inalienable part of the basic human  rights.    The declaration, while affirming the universality of human  rights, says that people should not neglect the actual  conditions of different countries and regions such as history,  culture and religion or confine human rights to only one mold,  Li noted.    He stressed that the right to development is an undeprivable  human right, because the declaration states that poverty and  debt are big obstacles to human rights.    Li Peng further stated that the latest resolution adopted at  the recent U.N. Commission on Human Rights shows that it would  not do to impose one country's views on human rights onto others.    The only correct way is to conduct friendly discussions on  the basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground while  reserving differences, Li added.</p>

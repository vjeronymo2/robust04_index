			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Birmingham joins talks on grants for council estates THE Department of the Environment has started negotiations with Birmingham City Council over a Pounds 100m grant to improve accommodation and living standards on the troubled Castle Vale council estate. The estate has the largest concentration of high-rise blocks in the city. The grant would be made through a Housing Action Trust (HAT), a government method of taking control of a rundown estate away from a local authority, with the approval of the tenants, at least while it is being renovated. Negotiations are also taking place with the councils of Liverpool and the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Brent to set up HATs. These talks provide evidence of the changing political atmosphere between the Conservative government and Labour local authorities. Some Labour councils are also applying for City Challenge funds for urban regeneration, showing a greater readiness to work with the government. During the Thatcher years, the government's attempts from 1988 onwards to organise HATs in the London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Tower Hamlets, and in Leeds, Sandwell in West Midlands, and Sunderland all foundered. Councillor Stan Austin, chairman of Birmingham's housing committee, said his authority became interested in HATs when the government changed the rules for their application. Instead of remaining permanently outside local authority control, tenants on an estate where there is a HAT may now select, by ballot, their new landlord after a HAT has completed its work. Mr Austin said: 'The DoE is prepared to talk in terms of Pounds 100m over five years. You can do a lot with that kind of money.' Other means of raising money for housing improvements, such as the government's Estate Action programme, would mean council borrowing. Under existing policy the government reserves HAT funds for council estates where expenditure on housing improvement is outside the capacity of the local authority. Two have been agreed in the past year: one in north Hull, where spending will be Pounds 50m over up to seven years and another in Waltham Forest, north-east London, where spending will be Pounds 170m over eight years. About 11,000 people live in Castle Vale in north-east Birmingham. The estate was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Much of the construction is poured concrete, which has caused damp and cold. The underfloor heating system could lead to bills of Pounds 500 a quarter, said Mr Austin.</p>

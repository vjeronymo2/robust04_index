			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Mongolia's  leading political parties today signed a conciliation document  aimed at overcoming the acute political crisis in the country  which is in its second week. In the presence of President  Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, leaders of the three parliamentary  parties -- the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the  Mongolian National Democratic Party, and the Mongolian Social  Democratic Party -- signed the document.    The document, called `Political Consensus', stipulates in  particular that at its spring and fall sessions parliament  should adopt laws on public rallies and demonstrations, on free  speech, freedom of the media, on the moral code of officials,  and on fighting corruption.    The present crisis broke out 13 April after the Mongolian  Democratic Union and a number of other opposition parties  started mass actions in support of their demands for the  government's resignation. They insisted that its socioeconomic  program has failed and that it is unable to lead the country out  of the crisis. They also called on the law enforcement agencies  to urgently investigate all the accusations of corruption and  abuse of power made against top officials.    Representatives of the opposition continue their hunger  strike on the capital's central square until their demands are  met. Supporters of the present government have also staged their  own hunger strike. They have already refused food for six days  now and state that they will end their hunger strike only after  the opposition does the same.    At the same time, the conflicting sides continue their mass  rallies. `Free microphones' are installed in the public places  for all those wishing to express their opinions on the issues  they are concerned about.</p>

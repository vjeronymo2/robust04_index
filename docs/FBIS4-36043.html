			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hanan </F> al-Badri, and Salih Qallab: "Massacre in Aden, Emigration From  Sanaa, and Accusations of Use of Chemical Weapons"]    [Excerpts] London, New York, Amman, Aden, Sanaa, AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT -- Fierce fighting continued yesterday in numerous  areas in Lahij Government, north of Aden. Meanwhile the Yemeni  Government in Sanaa announced its acceptance of Security Council  Resolution 924 calling for a cease-fire between northern and  southern forces. [passage omitted]    Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  fierce fighting in Tawr al-Bahah, Lahij Governorate, is  attributable to the attempt by four northern battalions to  advance toward Aden through al-Hawtah, led by Colonel 'Ali  Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Tank Division and  half-brother of the Yemeni president. So southern forces worked  to encircle these units in a bid to capture 'Ali Muhsin  al-Ahmar, especially as reports had said that a number of  northern commanders who are the Yemeni president's uncles were  with him.    These developments coincided with accusations exchanged  between the northern and southern leaderships about the use of  banned weapons. The accusations included a statement by Judge  Hammud al-Hattar in Sanaa that southern forces are using napalm  bombs in their attacks on northern units. He said that there  "is irrefutable evidence of that." Meanwhile Southern Defense  Minister Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir expressed his suspicions  that northern forces are using chemical weapons. He added that  "these suspicions are justifiable."    Brig. Haytham said that "our suspicions are reinforced by  the  distinct and special relationship between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who used these weapons  against the Kurds in 1988." [passage omitted]    High-ranking southern leaders have denied reports which have  aroused alarm among some circles about an advance by northern  forces toward the Dar Sa'd area. They told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  over the telephone: "How can that happen, when Democratic Yemen  formed its new government yesterday -- a proof that matters are  stable," despite the ongoing fighting there.    Southern officials said that some northern militias  belonging  to the Yemeni Reform Grouping have stormed Sabr prison in the  Tawr al-Bahah area and freed some prisoners. They added that  Aden forces clashed with them. They confirmed that conditions  are now calm there. [passage omitted]</p>

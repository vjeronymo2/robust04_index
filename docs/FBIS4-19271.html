			<p>BFN     [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, deputy under secretary of the  Turkish Foreign Ministry, conferred with Robert Lamb, U.S. State  Department special coordinator on Cyprus, this morning. The  meeting, which continued for nearly two hours, was held in the  Turkish Embassy in Nicosia. Ulucevik said after the meeting  that he and Lamb were in Cyprus at the same time by coincidence.  He also said that he exchanged views with Lamb, with whom he  has been constantly in touch. Ulucevik stated the following:    [Begin Ulucevik recording] I have found an opportunity to  bring to Ambassador Lamb's attention the significant changes  that have been made between the original package of  confidence-building measures and the package that is on the  negotiating table at the present time. As far as I am  concerned, our talks have been useful. Yes, that is how we have  benefited from the courtesy meeting we had. [end recording]    A correspondent asked Ulucevik the following question:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Claims have  been made to the effect that the bargaining talks on Maras  [Varosha] will be used on matters related to the economic crisis  in Turkey. Can you comment on that matter?    [Ulucevik] I do not even wish to regard what you have said  as  a question. I cannot accept that as a concept. Turkey is well  aware of its historic responsibilities and obligations toward  our brethren and kinsmen in Cyprus. That awareness is  strengthening every day. As I have already said, that cannot be  accepted as a concept. Nor can any question that is related to  what you have said be regarded as a proper question. [end  recording]</p>

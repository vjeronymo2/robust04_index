			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Turkey plans big state sell-off Turkey yesterday unveiled an ambitious privatisation programme, aiming to sell Dollars 20bn of state companies in the next two years. The programme, announced by Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, new head of the Public Participation Administration, the government's privatisation authority, envisages proceeds of Dollars 2.6bn this year and Dollars 18bn in 1995 - much of that from the disposal of the state PTT telephone monopoly. In addition, the closure of loss-making industries is estimated to create savings of a further Dollars 7.3bn. Since 1985, hindered by legal wrangles and parliamentary and labour opposition, the PPA has raised just Dollars 1.7bn. Hitherto most sales have been of minority stakes, often in private companies, such as the current issue of Tofas, which assembles Fiat cars, where the global offering next month of the PPA's 21 per cent is expected to realise Dollars 500m. The new urgency reflects the need to close the budget gap, and restore policy credibility, amid worries that Turkey could lose out if a spate of asset sales across Europe soaks up international investor demand. Turkey is set to sign an Dollars 84m technical assistance credit with the World Bank next week. In an unusual move the Bank, worried the programme could falter, has set performance conditions, which require Turkey to meet an agreed timetable on asset sales. The loan will finance a feasibility study for the Zonguldak region, looking at retraining schemes in the event of closure of the loss-making coal mines corporation, as envisaged in the PPA's new programme. The loan will also cover the cost of foreign advisers, public relations and legal expenses. Chase Manhattan is leading an advisory consortium, including the UK bank Kleinwort Benson, on the sales of Tupras, the refineries concern and Petrol Ofisi, the petrol retailer. The PPA's ambition is to complete the sales this year. The programme for 1995 looks even more ambitious. The PTT disposal will account for the bulk of the 1995 revenues. However, court action currently blocks all government efforts to prepare the company for sale.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Tokyo to lend China Y580bn Japan yesterday pledged Y580bn (Pounds 3.7bn) of soft government loans for China and sent a visiting Chinese delegation home with a lecture against nuclear testing. The cash, to be disbursed over the three fiscal years starting in April 1996, is to help China reduce the prosperity gap between poor central regions and fast industrialising coastal cities. It is far less than the Y700bn the Chinese government was asking for in the two days of negotiations which ended yesterday. But it represents an increase, per year, over official aid under Japan's current five-year Y810bn programme for China, ending in April 1996. China wanted another five-year package this time, rather than a three-year one. The Japanese government cited the fall in its budget revenues as the reason for being unable to comply. Yet this reflects a growing body of opinion in Tokyo for fresh loans to China to be conditional on clearer information about its military spending and an end to nuclear testing. Two Chinese underground nuclear tests over the past year have alarmed Tokyo. Mr Hiroshi Hirabayashi, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's economic co-operation (aid) bureau, reminded Chinese officials that the aid rules oblige Japan to take account of recipient countries' military trends. More nuclear tests could 'negatively affect' Japanese public support for loans to China, he warned. The Chinese delegation understood Japan's sensitivities but said it opposed making aid subject to political conditions. Loans for the following two years will be decided in another set of negotiations. The latest loans are repayable over 30 years, with a 10-year grace-period and an annual 2.6 per cent interest rate. The loan package, the fourth since Japan reopened diplomatic relations with China in 1972, is to fund 40 projects, stipulated in the aid agreement signed yesterday. They include measures against air pollution, a problem that affects Japan in the form of acid rain from Chinese coal-fired power stations. Improvements to Chinese water supplies and rural infrastructure are also stipulated. This environmental slant marks a change from Japan's previous aid policy for China, which focused on improving industrial infrastructure such as ports and dams - a job now largely completed in the rich southern coastal areas.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY TO GAIN WIDER ROAD, CAR-POOLING  </P> <P> The city has been given permission to relocate 34 parking spaces in front of  City Hall in exchange for starting a car-pooling program for city employees.  </P> <P> The spaces will be shifted to nearby Villa Way and the employee parking lot  behind City Hall.  </P> <P> The relocation is part of a road-widening project scheduled for this summer,  during which another northbound lane will be added to Newport Boulevard from  32nd Street to Via Lido and across the channel bridge.  </P> <P> The new city program will allow employees to car-pool using city vehicles,  Public Works Director Benjamin Nolan said. "We'll be ready to put (car-pooling)  into place concurrently with construction of the Newport Boulevard project," he  added.  </P> <P> The program is expected to reduce the city's parking needs by 12 spaces, Nolan  said.  </P> <P> Originally, the city planned to move the parking places closer to City Hall to  make way for the widening, which would have meant losing a slice of landscape  in front of the building. However, some City Council members asked that another  plan be created that would preserve the greenery.  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission this week approved the relocation of the parking  spaces and the retention of the landscaping.  </P> <P> Newport officials are also considering the possibility of building a parking  structure to meet the city's long-term needs, Nolan said. Such a project could  involve adding double-deck parking to the existing lot behind City Hall or a  cooperative project with the Pavillions market next door, he said. LESLIE  EARNEST  </P></p>

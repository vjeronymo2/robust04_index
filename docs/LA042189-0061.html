			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER SUSPECT SALCIDO IS FLOWN BACK TO CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Accused wine country killer Ramon Salcido was returned to California Thursday  night on a private jet, escorted by U.S. law enforcement officials who took him  into custody in Mexico City more than 24 hours after his arrest by Mexican  police near his grandmother's home.  </P> <P> The jet landed about 9:15 p.m. at Brown Field in San Diego and was immediately  surrounded by 20 law enforcement officials from the Drug Enforcement  Administration, U.S. Customs, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and  San Diego Police Department. The plane cleared customs, refueled and flew on to  Santa Rosa where Salcido was taken to the Sonoma County Jail.  </P> <P> Outside the jail, a crowd of about 150 people chanted "Kill him! Kill him!" A  number were carrying crudely lettered placards, one of which said, "Salcido  doesn't deserve to live."  </P> <P> Salcido was handed over to U.S. authorities in the culmination of an impromptu,  three-day cooperative effort between Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officials  that was cleared at the highest levels in Mexico City and Washington.  </P> <P> "It was a cliff-hanger right up to the end," a U.S. source said. "What made  this happen is the president of Mexico (Carlos Salinas de Gortari) wanted it to  happen. . . . The man said cooperate, find a way."  </P> <P> With the bureaucratic stops removed, Salcido, 28, was captured less than a week  after the killing rampage in Sonoma County. Six members of Salcido's family and  his winery supervisor were shot or knifed to death, and Salcido's 3-year-old  daughter and a co-worker were attacked but survived. Police suspect Salcido  made his way to Calexico shortly after the murders.  </P> <P> A U.S. source familiar with the events that led to Salcido's arrest said  officials now believe that he took the bus across the border into Mexico from  Calexico, in Imperial County. He rode the bus south to within two miles of his  hometown of Los Mochis, an agricultural and seafood-processing city near the  Gulf of California in Sinaloa state, and got off the bus along a main road. He  walked the last two miles into town, the U.S. source said.  </P> <P> Authorities are not sure which day he arrived, the source said, but it may have  been as early as last weekend.  </P> <P> At dusk Monday, Salcido walked up to a country store in Bamoa, a village where  his aunt and grandmother live about 55 miles south of Los Mochis. Teresa Leyva  did not know who he was but said Thursday the unshaven man with matted hair and  well-worn clothes looked menacing.  </P> <P> He scared her, she recalled Thursday as she sold sweets and tortillas from her  one-room shop.  </P> <P> "He was acting nervous, like he was afraid someone would recognize him. . . . I  thought he was going to rob the store. I was frightened," she said.  </P> <P> Authorities picked up his trail when Sonoma County authorities received  telephone calls from his sister and brother-in-law in Guasave, about 20 miles  southwest of Bamoa, the U.S. source said.  </P> <P> At first, Sonoma County officials were not sure what to make of the phone  calls. But their phone number was eventually passed to U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agents in Mazatlan, the seaside resort south of Guasave, the  U.S. source said.  </P> <P> DEA agents made contact with Salcido's sister and brother-in-law on Monday,  three days after the killing rampage, and U.S. officials notified Mexican  authorities that Salcido was back in Mexico, the source said. The Americans and  Mexicans decided to work together.  </P> <P> "They were interested; they reacted; they supported us 100%," the U.S. source  said.  </P> <P> Assistant Atty. Gen. Javier Coello Trejo, head of the Mexican anti-narcotics  division, ordered one of his chief commandants to join the operation. He  arrived in Sinaloa Tuesday morning, the U.S. source said.  </P> <P> Agents stayed in contact with Salcido's sister throughout the day Tuesday and  learned that Salcido had visited family members, perhaps first in Los Mochis --  where his mother lives -- and later in Bamoa.  </P> <P> The farming area around Bamoa was good territory for hiding out, with broad  fields of corn and wheat, criss-crossed by dirt roads and canals cut from the  Sinaloa River. Salcido kept out of sight and may have been hiding at the home  of his grandmother, Jesus Armendariz.  </P> <P> The impromptu task force used the sister to begin corralling Salcido. Despite  her help, the arrest almost did not occur.  </P> <P> The U.S. source said Salcido had learned an American journalist was nearby and  believed authorities were close on his tail. Patrick McDonnell of the Los  Angeles Times was the first American journalist to interview Salcido's friends  and relatives, including his mother, in Los Mochis Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> "When your reporter showed up, Salcido thought you were on to him, that you'd  identified that he was there. We were half a step behind (the reporter) and we  were going to lose Salcido."  </P> <P> Salcido's sister helped the authorities trace his movements, telling agents  late Tuesday that he was either at his mother's house or his aunt's house.  </P> <P> "She checked out both places, and when she got to the aunt's house (near his  grandmother's home in Bamoa) she found out his uncle (Camilo Gutierrez Galvez)  had just taken him to the train stop" about two miles away, the source said.  </P> <P> Witnesses in Bamoa told a somewhat different story Thursday. They said that at  about 1 a.m. Wednesday, a squad of Mexican soldiers and federal police arrived  in four or five trucks and surrounded the house of the Moreno family, across  the street from Salcido's grandmother's house.  </P> <P> The witnesses said plainclothes officers awoke the Moreno family, identified  themselves, entered the dwelling and began asking, "Where is Ramon?"  </P> <P> Luis Enrique Moreno, 18, said an officer aimed a flashlight into his mouth to  determine if he had any gold fillings.  </P> <P> "They said Ramon had gold teeth," Moreno said Thursday.  </P> <P> Convinced they had raided the wrong home, the agents crossed to the home of  Salcido's grandmother, witnesses said. The neighbors reported the police took  Gutierrez, who some neighbors said is not Salcido's uncle, into custody there  and began beating him with fists and a flashlight.  </P> <P> The trucks than raced off to the small train depot and found Salcido about 1:30  a.m., half an hour before the next train south was due to arrive.  </P> <P> "Salcido was waiting for the train to Guadalajara. He was going to go get lost  in the big city. If we had been there 30 minutes later, we would have missed  him," the U.S. source said.  </P> <P> Salcido was not armed and offered no resistance, the source said.  </P> <P> Salcido and Gutierrez were driven to the federal prosecutor's office in  Mazatlan, and the source said Salcido promptly admitted who he was and that he  committed the crimes.  </P> <P> Plans to fly the pair to Mexico City late Wednesday night fell through when a  Mexicana Airlines flight was canceled. It was not until Thursday afternoon that  Salcido was flown to Mexico City on a different Mexicana Airlines flight. It  was unclear whether Gutierrez was aboard, although authorities said he would be  released from custody.  </P> <P> In police custody, Salcido confessed to the killings on Mexican television.  </P> <P> "I'm guilty. I killed them in the United States, and I expect to be tried  there," he said.  </P> <P> On board the flight from Mazatlan to Mexico City, Salcido chewed gum and seemed  calm when he said, "No, not really," when a reporter for San Francisco  television station KRON asked him during the flight if he had any remorse for  the crime spree.  </P> <P> When the flight landed in Mexico City, Salcido was hustled into a van and  driven from the main terminal to a private plane hangar across the airfield. He  then was walked to a waiting jet loaned to Sonoma County officials by "Peanuts"  cartoonist Charles Schulz.  </P> <P> Forty-five minutes after landing in Mexico City, Salcido was on his way back to  California.  </P> <P> The official Mexican government communique said Salcido "accepted that he was a  U.S. citizen and asked to be sent to the United States to be tried for the  homicides he committed."  </P> <P> But U.S. sources said the transfer of custody was accomplished through informal  negotiations between U.S. and Mexican officials. Although Salcido was born in  Mexico and was granted permanent residence in the United States, the Mexican  authorities pushed the American officials to smooth the legal process and say  he was a U.S. citizen, sources said.  </P> <P> Sonoma County officials had brought along positive identification of Salcido,  death certificates for his suspected victims, a report on his immigration  status and a copy of the charges to help smooth the way, U.S. sources said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, a U.S. source said, the American position was that "he had the full  rights of a U.S. citizen under the Constitution, was a U.S. resident married to  an American, with American kids, that he had a Social Security card and a  driver's license, that he worked there openly . . . If it walks like a duck and  talks like a duck. . . ."  </P> <P> A U.S. source said also that color photographs of the savagely mutilated  victims helped the process along.  </P> <P> "This gets to the fiber of the Mexican family. You don't kill your kids. . . ."  the source said.  </P> <P> The informal "deportation" was not universally supported in the Mexican  government. Some Foreign Ministry sources believed it was improper to send  Salcido back to stand trial in California, in part, because Mexico has no death  penalty and California law allows for capital punishment.  </P> <P> "I don't see how the Mexican government can hand over a Mexican citizen to be  killed, no matter how much of a criminal he is," one Foreign Ministry source  said.  </P> <P> Gene Tunney, district attorney in Sonoma County, where the killings occurred,  has said he will seek the death penalty for Salcido. So far, Salcido faces four  murder charges there in the deaths of his wife, Angela, 24; daughters, Sofia,  4, and Teresa, 1, and his boss at Grand Cru Vineyards, Tracey Toovey, 35. He  faces two other charges of attempted murder in attacks on his daughter Carmina,  3, and another co-worker, Kenneth Butti, 33.  </P> <P> Authorities in Sonoma County said Salcido will also be charged with the  slayings of his mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards, 42, and Angela's two  sisters, Ruth, 12, and Maria, 8.  </P> <P> Miller reported from Mexico City, Roderick from Los Angeles.

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: Lightweight tribute to Sir Henry - Prom When, over 80 years ago, Sir Henry Wood confronted an unsuspecting Prom audience with the world premiere of Schoenberg's five orchestral pieces, its reaction was decidely frosty. Even today one can well sympathise: Schoenberg's Expressionist masterwork has lost none of its explosive force and capacity to unnerve. Indeed, he might well have subtitled it 'Fantasia on themes by Freud', such is the unswerving accuracy with which he translated modern man's deepest anxieties into vivid musical images. Its reception at last Friday's BBC Symphony orchestra Prom, designed as a 50th anniversary tribute to Sir Henry, proved, however, to be a much more sanguine affair. No doubt Andrew Davis's rather lightweight direction, a model of misplaced propriety, had something to do with it, minimising Schoenberg's abrupt juxtapositions and some eruptions of some unmotivated violence and bringing consolation, where, none, surely, is meant. At times, one could even detect affinities with Elgar's funeral march from 'Grania and Diarmid' which began the concert. Unsurprisingly, such affinities are hardly to be found in Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music, that great celebration of Shakespeare, music and the cream of Britain's inter-war singing talent. If one can never hope to recapture the unique, irreplaceable qualities of Sir Henry's original cast recording, Davis and his chosen 12 were still able to let Vaughan Williams' luminous music weave its spell, with each little solo beautifully etched yet subservient to the glowing colours to the whole. Given the right soloists and a sympathetic conductor, the Vaughan Williams more or less plays itself. That is probably less true of Beethoven, whose seventh symphony was selected for the concert's second half. Maybe in his choice of ultra brisk tempi, Davis was aiming for some of the fiery brilliance with which the infirm Sir Henry, at the last concert he ever conducted, was reported to have imbued the work. Davis turned the symphony into a remorseless Totentanz, more an apocalypse than the 'apotheosis of the dance' which Wagner dubbed it. This is one view of the work, I suppose, but one which robbed it of its internal tensions and releases. It was an interpretation not enhanced by Davis's unsettling habit of raising imploring eyes aloft, as if offering up prayers for a safe deliverance. Luckily, one duly occured: Sir Henry's grandiloquent orchestration of Rachmaninov's C sharp minor Prelude, complete with organ and five percussionists, a bizarre exercise perhaps, but further testimony to the versatility of a man whose vision and practicality we all have much to be grateful for.</p>

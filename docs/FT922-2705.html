			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: The Merry Wives of Windsor - Opera It would doubtless have brought a smile to Shakespeare's face if he knew that two comic operas based on The Merry Wives of Windsor would be playing in London at the same time. While English National Opera is performing Verdi's Falstaff, the students at the Guildhall School of Music have turned to another, less well-known adaptation, Otto Nicolai's Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor. Whether this production would have made him smile is less certain. Where Verdi's Falstaff takes the stage with a scintillating lightness of touch, Nicolai keeps him the rumbustious figure of fun, a ludicrous philanderer in whom nobody could see much dignity or nobility of heart. The romantic warmth of the music is reserved for the other characters - a contrast nicely caught when the Guildhall last put on the opera in 1983. For this new production Tim Coleman and his designer Isabella Bywater have tried something different. One might even have said 'original' if it did not so neatly combine the main features of both ENO's Falstaff and the Royal Shakespeare Company's Merry Wives, set in 1950s suburbia. For this show opens in a launderette of that period and slowly progresses backwards in time to the formal ruffs and tightly-pinched waists of the Elizabethan era. Unfortunately the idea is not taken far beyond the obvious jokes. Edward Hands's spiv of a Fenton sports a garish floral tie and purple socks to woo his Anne Page, a tart-in-the-making with a beehive hair-do, played by Liza Pulman. Her lower-middle class mannerisms come from Mrs Page, the incisive young mezzo Joanna Vincent-Campion, while Elvia Sanchez's light lyric Alice Ford was left to sing her aria while painting her toenails. I caught the second cast on Friday, which had fewer obviously bright vocal talents than are remembered from 1983. Nevertheless, Rene Linnenbank managed to turn his lanky figure into a Falstaff of convincing girth and there was a pair of strong voices in Laurent Naouri's Mr Ford and Nathan Berg's Mr Page, the former forcefully extrovert, the latter relaxed and firm. None made the impression that he might. There was too much crude knockabout humour for that. Some untidy playing from the orchestra under Clive Timms was not enough to disturb the stage action, but this in any case did not rank among the Guildhall's finer efforts. Nicolai's Shakespearian comic opera has not previously seemed so inferior to that of his Italian counterpart.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand approves postings THE BOARD of representatives of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, yesterday unanimously approved the appointment of Mr Anders Echoff as new board chairman and Mr Rune Brandinger, a former Skandia Forsakrings employee, as a new member. Mr Jan Erik Langangen, former president and chief executive at Uni, resigned last month amid sharp criticism of the company's NKr4.7bn (Dollars 814m) acquisition of Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. The board tendered its resignation at the same time. Uni's board of representatives also approved the reinstatement of Uni's four other board members - Mr Torvild Aakvaag, Mr Finn Jebsen, Mr Jan Wibe and Mr Erik Toenseth. Mr Echoff is a partner in the Oslo law firm Bugge, Arentz-Hansen &amp; Rasmussen and a member of other boards, including that of Elkem, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, Statkraft, the Norwegian utility, and Kvaerneland, a company which produces farm equipment. He is also widely considered to be a 'clean up' man - a title he disdains - because of the many reorganisations he has been instrumental in. Mr Echoff yesterday had little to say about a strategy which he will implement to restore confidence in Uni. That confidence has decreased significantly since the company acquired its 28.6 per cent shareholding in Skandia Forsakrings. Mr Echoff replaces Mr Thorleif Borge who will remain as president and chief executive of the Uni Foundation, the company's biggest shareholder with a 26.6 per cent stake in the company.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Strong first quarter at KLM KLM Royal Dutch Airlines posted a strong increase in net profit in the first quarter of 1994-95, reflecting good demand for air travel sparked by general economic recovery as well as the company's cost-cutting efforts Net profit surged to Fl 122m (Dollars 69.3m) in the three months to June from Fl 40m a year earlier. Per-share profits were up 82 per cent at Fl 1.31 after the 60 per cent rise in ordinary share capital in early 1994. KLM said part of the profit increase was due to its partnership with Northwest Airlines of the US, including the two companies' recent joint launch of a new business class. The Dutch national carrier said it was 'cautiously optimistic' for the rest of the year but it made no specific forecast. Total traffic, comprising passengers, mail as well as cargo, was up 12 per cent. But yields were down 3 per cent, due to the relatively stronger growth of cargo traffic and the continued trend among passengers towards seeking out cheaper seats and lower fares. Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Fl 2.26bn, while costs were up 5 per cent at Fl 2.05bn. Unit costs fell 6 per cent. KLM said the reduction of financial expenses by Fl 14m to Fl 92 was due to a rise in interest income.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 31 January issue of the Split daily  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA on page 4 reports that, in the event of NATO  air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, there is no doubt that  the majority of entrenched Serb batteries would be erased in a  few minutes. However, the paper adds, Serb reinforcements and  reserves massed in the vicinity of Tuzla (for example around  Bijeljina) and Srebrenica (where the so-called Drina Corps with  six brigades is operating) are sufficient to continue to hinder  the deblocking of both Srebrenica and Dubrava. NATO would then  certainly have to repeat and expand the air strikes to the  Bosnian Serbs' "remaining strategic centers." The action would  have to be on at least the scale of the several consecutive,  mass attacks on Iraq in the first half of last year, the paper  notes, adding that the Serbs believe that they would be able to  survive the "first, selective attack from the sky, and then,  while they still have the upper hand on the land, they would  begin conducting what they have been announcing for a long time:  an all-out war against all UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  combining the experience of the Vietnam guerrillas with the  tactics that the Blue Helmets have already felt themselves in  Somalia."</p>

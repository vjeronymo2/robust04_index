			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPRAYING SHOULDN'T BE DONE WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING  </P> <P> According to the only notice we have received from the state Department of  Agriculture, our neighborhood was to be sprayed with malathion on Monday, Jan.  22.  </P> <P> We heard on the radio and television that our area would be sprayed every three  weeks on a Monday.  </P> <P> Our area was not sprayed due to high winds. Then, without any warning, we were  hit -- no time to find the cat, cover the car or bring in the patio furniture.  </P> <P> It is bad enough to be sprayed against our will with a toxic chemical whose  impact on human health is hotly disputed and whose effectiveness in actually  eradicating the Medfly is still unknown.  </P> <P> However, it is far worse to be sprayed in the dead of night (12:15 a.m.) with  no advance notice whatsoever. Such utter lack of responsibility on the part of  our government is appalling.  </P> <P> VICTORIA BERRY  </P> <P> JILL G. BERRY  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

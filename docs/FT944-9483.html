			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel support Caught up in first day euphoria - direct running between London and the Continent started officially yesterday - Eurotunnel jumped 17 to 270p amid heavy buying from Paris and on talk that several big US hedge funds which target high risk/high reward issues have been chasing the shares. Their recent performance has led to head scratching among London analysts, with the group looking increas-ingly set to miss its own severely downgraded revenues forecast for this year. The investment approach in France has been less fundamentally based, however. Turnover in Paris yesterday was 3.75m shares, more than double the London volume. Eurotunnel, under 200p less than five weeks ago, is now 5 in excess of this year's rights issue price.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / White paper offers multiple choice DENMARK'S white paper on its relationship with the European Community, published yesterday, sketches several ways to solve the difficulties caused by the No vote in its Maastricht referendum in June. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, warned that Denmark still faces difficulties in trying to reach accord with the other EC members in a way which will be palatable to the Danes. However, he said he could see the outlines of a deal, which should be feasible with a little goodwill. The opposition Social Democratic party's spokesman on market affairs, Mr Bjorn Westh, said he was satisfied with the white paper. The 251-page document outlines eight options for Denmark and its EC partners, although it steers clear of recommending which would be best for Denmark. The minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government and the other parties in the Folketing (parliament) will try to hammer out an agreed position over the coming weeks for presentation to the other countries in time for the Edinburgh summit of the EC in December. The eight options are: The Treaty of Rome is maintained as the basis for co-operation between the member states and the problems which the Maastricht treaty aims to solve are tackled another way. The Maastricht treaty enters into force for the other 11 member states, while Denmark joins the European Economic Area, under the agreement concluded earlier this year between the EC and the members of the European Free Trade Association. The disadvantage for Denmark of this option is that Denmark would cease to be a participant in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, the white paper points out, and Denmark receives more in direct support from the CAP - some DKr1,728 (Pounds 186) per capita last year - than any other country except Ireland. Denmark would also lose any influence over future EC policies. Changes are made in the Maastricht treaty, effective for all 12 member-states. This option has already been ruled out by the other EC countries. The Maastricht treaty enters into force for the other 11 while in Denmark the Rome treaty applies. The white paper concludes this would only be possible if Denmark accepted the Maastricht treaty's amendments to the Rome treaty. 'It is difficult to imagine that it would be practicable or legally feasible to apply the new basis for co-operation (the Maastricht treaty) to some states and the old basis (the Rome treaty) to others.' This option implies that Denmark would cease to participate in the further process of European integration, such as negotiations with applicant members or future government conferences. The 11 put the treaty into force and Denmark negotiates a special arrangement. One objection to this is that it would involve a second ratification process in many member countries. Denmark agrees a limited ratification of the treaty, enabling it to withdraw if it feels the Community is developing in ways not compatible with Danish interests. Riders to the Maastricht treaty are introduced which are effective for all 12 members. These riders could be given the legal form which seemed most appropriate in each particular case. The Maastricht treaty comes into force with special status for Denmark. The two latter options come closest to the ideas that Danish politicians have aired since the referendum, allowing Denmark some special opt-outs and, for example, a text which spells out how some treaty obligations are to be interpreted.</p>

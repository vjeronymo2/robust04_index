			<p>BFN     [Text] In Belfast the Ulster Unionist leader James  Molyneaux said he regretted what had happened [attack on Dublin  pub on Saturday], but it was the inevitable result of the fears  loyalists had over the Downing Street declaration. He spoke to  Brendan Wright of our northern staff [in Belfast]:    [Begin recording] Molyneaux: I regret that [words  indistinct] of the warning, the caution which I gave to the  prime minister when he met the other three party leaders along  with me way back three years ago, when I said that as long as  there is ambiguity and uncertainty over the constitutional  future of Northern Ireland there will be attempts to achieve a  balance of terror. Very regrettably, that is what is now coming  about.    Wright: Are you saying that you always thought  there was a certain inevitability about loyalist paramilitary  attacks in the south?    Molyneaux: Well, in the south and in Northern  Ireland, too, I mean, the weight of their attacks, let's face  it, has been in Northern Ireland, not in the south. They've  only had one attack in Dublin in the recent years, but look how  many you've had in Northern Ireland within the last month. So  it's a far, far bigger problem in Northern Ireland.    Wright: Now, of course, you don't speak for the  loyalist paramilitaries, but do you have any view as to why the  UDF [Ulster Defense Force] should have carried out this attack?    Molyneaux: Well, I don't know, but it's been that  pattern, what I say, a balance of terror. It's part of the  pattern of the attacks in Northern Ireland. It can't be  separated from that. It's all of a piece.    Wright: And what do you think will be the effect  of the attack in Dublin?    Molyneaux: Well, I think that probably they are  bound to be worried, as we all are worried in Belfast, by what  has been going on up here in this end of the island, for all of  these recent weeks particularly. I think that probably in the  minds of people in Whitehall, the draughtsmen of various  documents and so forth, they don't really understand the feeling  of exclusion, alienation if you like, of people in Northern  Ireland and they look at various documents which have been  drafted by -- and I'm being racist here -- by Englishmen who  don't have a feel for the situation, and when they're read over  here in the Shankill Road they look like a sellout and then  certain people tell them it's a sellout and that doesn't help,  either.    Wright: And do you think part of the reasoning  behind carrying out this attack might well be to try and force  the Dublin government to change their attitude towards Sinn Fein  and the IRA? I mean, some people in the loyalist quarters  consider the Dublin goverment to be nothing more than messenger  boys for Sinn Fein.    Molyneaux: Well, it's -- yes, it's not just what I  think about it, but they actually have said that that is the  position. I mean, those who have carried out the attacks have  said that actually in their statements when they claimed  responsibility, if you like -- I think that's the term they tend  to use -- but they have said that that's the object of it, and  who are we to dispute that?    Wright: At the weekend, on Friday, you called on  loyalist paramilitaries to cease their violence. It's only been  a matter of a few days, but do you think your message will get  through to them?    Molyneaux: Well, I think the fact that -- and  despite what has happened and all the regrettable things have  happened including the bombing in Dublin -- I think despite all  of that it is very encouraging that even as recently as this  morning they are saying now that -- and letting it be known --  that their combined leadership, whatever structure it may be,  are going to this week to be considering more carefully the  statement I made and what lies behind that statement, namely,  the routes which were slightly obscure in the declaration which  have been more clearly signposted in the clarification document,  and it's now easier to point out to people and easier to make  them understand that that route always was there, that it's now  much more clearly identified.

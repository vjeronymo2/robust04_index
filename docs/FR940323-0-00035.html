			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed concern that not treating all participants the same in terms of educational awards might be a disadvantage in the selection process. The commenter suggested that it should not be a selection criterion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the limited amount of funding available for program assistance, the Corporation anticipates that in some cases programs (especially existing programs) may not apply for or receive adequate support for all participants enrolled in the program, and the potential thus may arise for some participants (who are serving in approved AmeriCorps positions) to receive AmeriCorps educational awards while other similar participants do not. The Corporation is therefore requiring every applicant to describe the rationale for its distribution of educational awards to program participants in those cases where distinctions among participants are necessary. In general, this distribution should treat equally all participants doing the same or essentially similar work. This reflects a matter of principle as well as a pragmatic concern for the equal treatment of participants within a single program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation recognizes that equal treatment may not be feasible or desirable in some instances. For example, an intergenerational program or a program with a specialized component or division assigned special projects may make distinctions among participants that justify the provision of educational awards to some but not to others. An example of the latter of these is a corps where team leaders receive AmeriCorps education awards whereas regular corps participants do not. Similarly, a program may choose to offer alternative post-service benefits to participants in lieu of the AmeriCorps educational awards provided by the Corporation. AmeriCorps programs are strongly encouraged to offer alternative post-service benefits from non-Corporation funds to participants who will not receive AmeriCorps educational awards. The Corporation will evaluate on a case-by-case basis the rationales of programs that do not plan to provide all participants with educational awards. However, the Corporation will not approve rationales based solely on a determination of economic need of participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existence of a reasonable method of allocating educational awards will still be a selection criterion; however, in cases where programs have legitimate reasons for not offering educational awards to all participants, those programs will not be disadvantaged in any way in the selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> AmeriCorps Priorities for Existing Grantees and for Programs Targeting Participants with College Experience <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters suggested that programs involving college-educated participants should not be given priority for funding in the national direct competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although current grantees of the Commission on National and Community Service_which have a high percentage of participants without college experience_are not guaranteed funding, they receive a priority for funding. The special consideration for programs involving individuals with college experience was provided in order to achieve the overall goal of diversity across programs based on many factors. An alternative would be to drop both the priority for existing grantees and the special consideration for programs involving individuals with college experience. However, given the need to include a base of experienced programs and the advisability of completing the third year of programs that received three-year grants from the Commission, the applications retain the first alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential applicants should be aware that special consideration is not the same as an absolute preference. Nor does it mean that every participant must be college-educated in order for a program to receive special consideration, or that no programs involving youth who have not attended college will be funded in the national direct competition. Rather, the purpose of the special consideration is to ensure that participants with and without college experience are both represented in National service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Small State Priority in the AmeriCorps State Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested that the regulations be revised to increase from 20 to 50 both the recommended minimum number of participants in a program and the priority for small states in the State competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful consideration, the Corporation has not changed these policies. Because there are many high-quality programs with between 20 and 50 participants, and because the Corporation does not want to send the message that these programs should consider expanding to 50 participants, the recommended minimum size of a program has not been raised to 50. Similarly, the Corporation chose not to raise the small State priority to 50 participants because it would have resulted in approximately half the States receiving the priority. States with widely disparate populations thus would be treated equally. This is not only unfair to the larger of these States but undermines Congress' intent of distributing these AmeriCorps funds in proportion to population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Relocation Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble to the January 7 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Corporation stated that it would pay for the relocation expenses of participants who are recruited by the Corporation or the State Commissions and need to move in order to participate. One commenter argued that this is a poor use of scarce resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation has revised this policy such that the Corporation will only pay reasonable relocation expenses in instances where participants would not be able to participate without this support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) New and Updated AmeriCorps Tables <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum Number of Programs in the AmeriCorps Competitive State Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the Corporation revisit whether any restrictions should be placed on how many AmeriCorps programs may be submitted in a State competitive application. The Corporation has limited the number of programs a State may include in its application for competitive funding to three plus an additional program for each full percentage point of the total State population (rounded to the nearest full percentage point) that State contains. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation is not changing this policy for a number of reasons. First, from a purely pragmatic standpoint, some sort of limitation must be placed on the overall number of applications. If the Corporation is inundated with applications it will be difficult to ensure that each application is properly reviewed. Second, the Corporation wants to encourage States to submit only their very best programs. Finally, it is likely that with the restriction now in place only about one in five programs submitted will actually be funded. It would be unfair to programs to allow a significantly larger number of submissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin stressed on Thursday [24 February] that Russia  should occupy a "worthy place" in the changing world.    Addressing the parliament on Thursday morning, Yeltsin said  Russia's foreign policy will be firmly based on the universally  acknowledged principles and norms of international law.    "For Russia to occupy a worthy place in a changing world, it  must have a strong state," the Russian president pointed out in  his first-ever state of nation message delivered to the  lawmakers.    Yeltsin said: "Russia respects the sovereignty, territorial  integrity and independence of other nations including naturally  its neighbors, and demands that they do the same."    "The consistent advancement of national interests through  openness and cooperation, the provision of favorable conditions  for the internal development and continuing reforms are the main  objectives of the foreign policy of the Russian state in 1994,"  the president said in his 110-page address.    He devoted part of the message to relations with the new  independent states including three Baltic nations which border  Russia and the cooperation within the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS).    He said: "Experiences show that no other country besides  Russia can shoulder the burden of peacekeeping in the former  Soviet space. Russia does not have the right to scale down its  activity in protecting minority rights in the CIS and Baltic  states."    The Russian president also stressed the need to further  expand the economic cooperation within the CIS.    On relations with the West and other regions' countries,  Yeltsin said: "Partnership has become a key characteristic of  Russia's relations with other states. The new character of  relations with the West provides favorable opportunities for a  more effective pursuit of Russia's interests in the fields of  security, economy, trade and business."</p>

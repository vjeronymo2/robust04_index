			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / EC energy reforms may be diluted CONTROVERSIAL plans to open up access to European Community energy networks and increase competition between suppliers could be watered down after intense opposition from most EC governments. Mr Abel Matutes, the energy commissioner, favours amending existing much-criticised draft legislation so that member states will no longer be obliged to grant access to the electricity and gas networks. Mr Matutes' predecessor, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, had proposed that large consumers - for example, steel, chemicals and fertiliser companies - should be granted access to energy networks this year. If successful, the right to buy electricity and gas anywhere in Europe would have been extended to smaller consumers from 1996. Instead, it is now suggested that users who want to buy energy across EC borders would negotiate access to other networks, signing individual contracts. Member states and operators would have to justify any decision to refuse a request - for example, on the grounds that there was insufficient capacity, the negotiated price was too low, or there was a risk that domestic energy companies would be unable to meet their obligations to existing clients. Launching the original measures last January, Mr Cardoso e Cunha said a single market in energy could save consumers 'tens of millions of Ecus'. Only Britain, which has liberalised its own energy network, was wholly in favour of the proposals. Other member states expressed cautious approval for related measures, aimed at introducing more transparency into energy companies' accounts and ending monopolies over electricity production. But Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Luxembourg and - on gas - the Netherlands, are still strongly opposed to 'third party access'. 'The directives as they stand now are completely unacceptable so we are working on the assumption that they will be amended or watered down substantially,' said one Commission official.</p>

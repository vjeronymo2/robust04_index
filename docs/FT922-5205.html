			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Germany breaks link of pollutants and growth DRAMATIC reductions in pollutant emissions in western Germany demonstrate clearly that 'consistent policies can break the link between economic growth and environmental damage', Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister said yesterday. As delegations converged on Rio de Janeiro for the start tomorrow of the Earth Summit, West Germany revealed that between 1970 and 1989, when its gross domestic product rose 56 per cent, emissions of sulphur dioxide, dust and carbon monoxide had fallen 73 per cent, 75 per cent and 43 per cent respectively. Despite the inclusion of the former East Germany in the latest reckonings, output of carbon dioxide had continued to fall: from 1,064m tonnes in 1987 to 997m tonnes in 1990 and 980m tonnes in 1991, the minister added. Speaking at the launch of the first environmental audit of united Germany, Mr Topfer attributed improvements in the east to the prompt closure of outdated factories. However, he said, there was still room for improvement. Increasing road traffic had led to a 12.5 per cent increase in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Difficulties were emerging as more east Germans bought cars and as improved roads in the east prompted industry to switch from rail and river transport to lorries. Backed by Mr Heinrich von Lersner, president of the federal environment office, he proposed stricter monitoring of lorry speeds on German roads. Heavy fuel consumption in trucks was tending to cancel out advantages won by installing 'scrubbers' on power stations and catalysers on cars. Family cars were also still using too much petrol - an average of more than 10 litres per 100km - and Mr Topfer called on manufacturers to reduce this to around 6 litres by 2005. He refused to comment on proposals that vehicle fuel consumption and pollution could be greatly reduced by imposing a motorway speed limit of 130kmph. However, while the sulphur dioxide content of the air in the heavily-industrialised Ruhr region in the west had fallen from 250 micrograms per cubic metre to less than 50 in the past 20 years, in Leipzig, in the east, it was still as bad as in the Ruhr 30 years ago, he said. East Germany's obsolescent chemicals industry, one of the largest employers in the region, has been granted more than DM600m (Pounds 204m) by the Treuhand agency as part of a DM2bn programme this year to clean up the massively-polluted production sites, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. The Treuhand hopes the investments of DM338m in the Buna company and DM293m in the Leuna company will improve chances of attracting wary western investors. Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, an agency spokesman, said the money would be used to clean up environmental damage caused by the previous use of brown coal as a feedstock, as well as for water purification and repairs to machinery. A French-German consortium of Elf Acquitaine and Thyssen Handelsunion is to build a refinery at the Leuna site near Leipzig, but no investors have been found for its chemicals production.</p>

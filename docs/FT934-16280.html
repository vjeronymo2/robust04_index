			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Business registrations rise sharply HOPES that the recovery is becoming better established have been bolstered by a sharp rise in registrations of new companies. On the basis of the figures for the year so far, 1993 is likely to see the sharpest rise in company starts since 1987, according to Jordans, a Bristol-based business information company. Registrations in the third quarter were up 8.4 per cent on the corresponding period last year. In the period between January and the end of September, starts were 6.1 per cent higher than the same time 12 months ago. The data, based on registrations at Companies House, apply to the UK outside Northern Ireland. They suggest that entrepreneurial activity is increasing and that banks and other financial groups are becoming keener to support new enterprises after the recession. Jordans said the figures showed a 'sustained growth' in new companies with each month showing a rise on the corresponding month last year. After a quiet period in June and July, August and September have been particularly strong months. So far this year an average of about 600 more companies a month have been formed compared with last year. Assuming the trend continues in the fourth quarter, this year will see the strongest growth in company registrations since 1987, which recorded a 9.2 per cent increase on the previous year. That happened after several years of strong growth in new companies, a phenomenon linked to the economic expansion of the early- to mid-1980s. However, in both 1988 and 1989, company formations rose by only about 1 per cent, while during each of the three succeeding years registrations dropped as the recession took its toll. The figures have to be treated with caution, because many new registrations may be for 'shell' companies or subsidiaries of existing ones which do not contribute significantly to economic output. However new company starts are believed to be a useful indicator of future levels of economic activity. In the third quarter, 27,867 companies were registered, compared with 25,688 last year. The figure for the first nine months was 86,714, com-pared with 81,692 last year. In both August and September, company formations were up by about 11 per cent on the corresponding months last year. Last year saw 108,295 registrations, the smallest total since the 104,665 in 1985. The peak year was 1989, with 130,478. In 1990, the first year of recession, company starts were down 7.1 per cent on the previous year, while the corresponding falls for 1991 and last year were 9.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.</p>

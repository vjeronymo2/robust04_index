			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that the Index is a Stock Index Option under Amex Rule 901C(a) and a Broad Stock Index Group under Amex Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Amex Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within ten points above or below the current index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise) price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant to Amex Rule 904C(b), a position limit of 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more than 30,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In anticipation of substantial customer activity in the options on this Index (including institutional activity), the Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts. Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Exchange believes that the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with deep, liquid markets, as well as expeditious executions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding, or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

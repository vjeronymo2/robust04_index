Box 728, 1220 St. Francis Drive, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87504&hyph;0728 (Telephone: 505&hyph;988&hyph;1876). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub. L. 90&hyph;542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Arkansas, a 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in Arkansas are hereby designated as state-administered components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretarial designation covers that part of the Cossatot and Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot River Sate Park-Natural Area in Polk and Howard Counties. This action is based on the designation of the river by the State of Arkansas and the protection offered this river and its immediate environment by and pursuant to applicable State laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 3, 1990, President Clinton, then the Governor of Arkansas, petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add the above described segments of the Cossatot River to the National System. On April 22, 1992, Congress added the Cossatot to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (Pub. L. 102&hyph;275). However, the State is pursuing its original request for Secretarial designation for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To officially classify the State-managed river segments as ``Scenic.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To recognize the State Management Plan for the Cossatot River State Park and Natural Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To refine the current definition of the State's portion of the scenic river corridor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary, through the National Park Service conducted a complete review of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that review, the Secretary has determined that the 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in the State's application should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Arkansas has fulfilled the requirements of the Act by designating these segments as components of the Arkansas System of Natural and Scenic Rivers and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the river from adverse State actions. The National Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the Cossatot River and Brushy Creek meet the criteria for the scenic classification under the Act. Accordingly, the following river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the Act to be administered by State government: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cossatot River: Scenic_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area just above the State Highway 246 crossing, at the Ouachita National Forest boundary in Polk County to the crossing at State Highway 4 in Howard County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brushy Creek: Scenic_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area in Polk County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy, Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulation Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as required by section 4(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A 45-day period for public comment on the State's application and river management plan and on the environmental assessment of the proposed national designation was provided from April 15, 1991, to May 31, 1991. All comments received have been carefully considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that effective upon this date, the above-described river segments are approved for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the State of Arkansas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bruce Babbitt, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of the Interior. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2287 Filed 2&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

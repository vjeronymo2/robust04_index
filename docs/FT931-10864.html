			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Bundesbank move calms pound: Lower rates bring hope of EMS stability - Continental European markets rally THE GERMAN Bundesbank yesterday brought surprise and relief around Europe by cutting its leading interest rates to stave off speculative attacks against weaker currencies. The Bundesbank, which effectively sets the direction of interest rates around Europe, lowered its discount rate by 0.25 of a point to 8 per cent. It cut the internationally sensitive Lombard rate by 0.5 of a point to 9 per cent. The move to reduce the main interest rates at which the Bundesbank provides funds to the banks helped to stem sterling's relentless fall over the past few days and rally stock and bond markets in continental Europe. The FT-SE 100, however, fell 7.9 to close at 2,865.9. The Bundesbank's move followed the Bank of Japan's decision earlier in the day to cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. In a separate but related development to the Bundesbank's decision, Germany's public sector workers yesterday accepted a pay increase of just 3 per cent, well below the current rate of inflation. The deal will be seen as an indicator for the whole wages round in Germany this year, and could open the way for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates further. The wages commission of the DAG, the white-collar public sector union, and the oTV, the larger public sector union, both accepted what the government said was its final offer. The Bundesbank had seen such a wage agreement as vital to its strategy for containing inflation and had been loath to cut rates until such a deal was achieved. Yesterday Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, interpreted the German rate cut as a clear attempt to preserve Franco-German monetary co-operation. He called the cut a 'good political signal at a time when one was entitled to worry about the long-term stability of the European Monetary System'. The French finance ministry, which has been pressing Germany to lower rates to help the franc, said: 'This is the kind of gesture that should help the EMS get some stability back.' Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, underlined the importance of the cuts for the EMS. 'We hope this unfriendly game sometimes called dominoes, in which speculators pick on one currency after another, has finally come to an end,' he told a news conference. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish National Bank, which has had to intervene heavily to support the krone this week, said the German cuts were sufficient to head off a krone devaluation. But German industrialists said the move bowed to foreign pressure to ease German credit costs. The Federation of German Chambers of Commerce said the timing was 'unfortunate' and said 'pressure to bring wage and fiscal policy back to a stability orientated track is now smaller'. On Monday, Mr Schlesinger appeared to oppose short-term interest rate cuts by saying only 'ignoramuses' were saying German interest rates were persistently high. German long-term interest rates rose slightly as capital market dealers worried about the persistence of German inflationary pressures. Ms Alison Cottrell, an economist at London-based Midland Global Markets said: 'It is a complete about-turn for Schlesinger. The move was forced on him by both international and domestic considerations. Had he done nothing today the ERM would have fallen apart disastrously. 'But a quarter point off the discount rate is not the end of the road. The Bundesbank is buying itself time through to the French elections.' The central banks of the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, which closely align their monetary policy to Germany's, reacted by cutting some of their own key lending rates. The Dutch central bank lowered its special advances rate by 0.1 of a point to 8.3 per cent. Austria cut its discount rate to 7.5 per cent from 7.875 per cent and the Lombard rate to 8.75 from 9.25 per cent. The Belgian National Bank cut the central rate for primary dealers to 8.3 per cent from 8.4 per cent and the emergency lending rate to 9.75 per cent from 10.0 per cent. Some German economists were disappointed that yesterday's announcement gave no indication of further possible reductions in the Bundesbank's money market dealing rates. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, interpreted yesterday's modest concessions as an indication of 'deep divisions' within the Bundesbank's governing central council. Hardliners on the council were likely to have struggled to keep rates up until there were sure signs that inflation, money supply, wages and government spending were under control. However, regional council members' arguments for some relief to help offset the impact of recession, combined with renewed ERM turbulence and speculative attacks on the Danish krone, won the day. Germany's deepening economic crisis was highlighted again yesterday by statistics showing that incoming manufacturing orders at the end of last year had fallen by 8 per cent.

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Swiss bankers hurry to prop up their image - The way squeezed margins are forcing a radical shake-out in the sector The image of Swiss banks being as solid as the Matterhorn has taken a bit of a beating lately, but the country's hyper-sensitive bankers are already taking steps to prevent any further erosion. Last October, a sizeable Swiss bank was closed without warning by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. Last week, Credit Suisse, the country's third largest bank, was stripped of its triple A rating by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. And this week, two regional banks have been rescued by other banks. In comparison with the havoc being wrought on the banking sector in some other countries - notably Japan and the US - this is minor stuff. And no one familiar with the structure and supervision of Swiss banks would suggest there is cause for major concern. But Switzerland is a tiny country with few natural assets. The country's image as a secure haven for capital has been a major source of economic growth, so the country's bankers are understandably eager to preserve that image. The problems in the Swiss banking sector today are not dissimilar from those in other industrialised countries. Some banks expanded their loans too rapidly in the booming 1980s, others spent too much on automating their processes. And in the tougher climate of today, these excesses cannot easily be corrected. In addition, protectionism and cartels in the Swiss banking sector supported an excessive number of banks for a long time. There are still over 600 banks in the country and a shake-out has long been expected. In the late 1970s, the last time there was a squeeze in the Swiss banking sector, the big banks eagerly snapped up small banks to expand their retail networks. That is not an option today, partly because the big banks are trimming branches and partly because there was a lot of resentment about their barging in to local markets. 'We would prefer that local solutions be found for local problems,' an official of Credit Suisse, the third largest bank, said. However, until the forced closure of Spar und Leihkasse Thun last October, no one noticed the big banks' implicit safety net had developed some big holes. Since then, bankers have been working overtime to put a new safety net in place and this week they unveiled a two-layer system designed to prevent any more forced closures. First, the Union of Swiss Regional Banks, which represents the smaller local banks that are in the greatest difficulties, has formed an examining board to discover problem cases and try to solve them. Union officials say about a dozen of their 185 member banks are now being examined. Ideally, another bank will be found to take on the problem bank or its assets, as in the cases this week of Union Bank of Switzerland rescuing Bank EvK in the Bern region and Banque de l'Etat de Fribourg taking over Banque de la Glane et de la Gruyere. If a problem bank refuses to co-operate, the Federal Banking Commission will apply pressure. If no bank can be found that is willing to take over the troubled bank, a working group within the Swiss Bankers Association will move in to make sure that creditors are protected as far as possible.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Fickleness and frenzy in Shanghai: The surge in the value of shares in China after announcements to bolster investor confidence China's fledgling stock markets have proved themselves among the world's most volatile, but analysts were not prepared for yesterday's extraordinary bounce in the value of the country's A-shares for local investors. After the markets had appeared to be in free fall for months, the Shanghai index's astonishing 36 per cent rise demonstrated the fickleness of sentiment among Chinese stock punters. Starved of good news since the markets began their protracted decline last year - the A-share market is down 80 per cent - investors have for the moment grasped a glimmer of promise provided in the announcement that new share listings would be suspended for this year and possibly next. With investors stampeding back into a market they had deserted in droves, there can hardly have been a better example of the herd mentality, but analysts believe the rally in A-shares will be shortlived. Mr John Crossman, of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said: 'I don't think it will hold very well because the fundamentals are simply not there.' In Beijing, China's hard-pressed stock regulators are finding it difficult to believe that a simple package of announcements would have galvanised the market quite so dramatically. After coming under heavy pressure to take measures to boost the markets, officials of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced at the weekend that, apart from suspending new issues, they would allow the establishment of Sino-foreign joint ventures to trade in A-shares and would also pump money into 'selected securities institutions to enliven trading'. Mr Gao Xiqing, general counsel to the CSRC, was a 'little surprised' at the magnitude of yesterday's surge, but he also noted that China was making progress in its efforts to build confidence in the markets by strengthening regulation. He observed that one of the most positive developments was the decision to allow foreigners to trade A-shares through joint venture securities houses. This was a step towards combining the A and B-share markets. B-shares for foreigners are denominated in yuan but are traded in US and Hong Kong dollars. The eventual formal amalgamation of the A and B-share markets will depend, however, on the yuan becoming freely convertible. Chinese officials are vague about the timing of such a move, saying merely they expect it will happen 'within five years'. In contrast to the surge in the A-share market yesterday, B-shares registered modest gains. The Shanghai index was up just 1.31 points or 1.83 per cent. Shanghai securities analysts say that after being in the doldrums for much of the year, B-shares had begun to attract support among 'bargain hunters' in the past few weeks with Japanese securities houses believed to have entered the market. They saw no reason why B-shares should not continue to strengthen. Price/earnings ratios had come down to multiples in the low teens from the high teens early in the year. Some quality companies' price/earnings ratios were below 10 ,which had rekindled investor interest. Mr Crossman also noted that H-shares - mainland companies listed in Hong Kong - had been strongly traded in the past few weeks. 'Local players have been punching up H-shares,' he said. 'Now you're getting a wash of enthusiasm for China-related plays.' He expected that B-shares, which were down this year by some 40 per cent at their low point - the index has appreciated by about 10 per cent since June  -would continue to strengthen. 'We're looking for a good sustainable rally from October through the early part of next year,' he said. Among factors that are helping to feed a slight improvement in investor confidence are signs that China's economic austerity measures are beginning to bear fruit with unsustainable rates of growth coming down and inflation showing signs of abating. Investors may be betting on the government easing credit restrictions in the latter part of the year. Indeed, there are already indications that the central bank selectively is loosening the purse strings to assist faltering state enterprises. Chinese securities regulators argue that lack of institutional investors - most investors are individuals - is one of the main causes of market volatility, but analysts cite other causes such as the relatively small percentage of shares in a particular company on offer in the market. Under the Chinese system less than a third of a company's shares are traded and these are held mainly by individuals. Other shares are vested in the state or held by 'legal persons' such as institutions, corporations and quasi-government bodies. This structure is aimed at preserving state control as more than 50 per cent of shares are reserved for the state, but analysts argue that if the authorities allowed 'legal person' shares to be traded freely this would 'make for a healthier market'. A 36 per cent rise in one day would not seem to be evidence of a market's good health: rather it indicates inherent instability. China's stock markets are destined for a continuing rollercoaster ride as investors' febrile sentiment ebbs and flows. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Business confidence at 16-year low, report shows THE Japanese economy is facing its most critical period for almost two decades, according to a Bank of Japan report published yesterday which shows business confidence at a 16-year low, Charles Leadbeater writes. The survey, which will fuel speculation that interest rates will soon be cut, shows the downturn is spreading into non-manufacturing sectors such as retailing. Manufacturers expect profits this year to be 25 per cent down on last year and investment to fall by close to 14 per cent, while the labour oversupply is growing. The Bank of Japan's survey of 6,874 businesses, including 680 big companies, found that confidence among manufacturers had fallen to minus 44, its lowest level since 1976, and down from minus 27 three months earlier. Among non-manufacturing companies it had worsened to minus 27 from minus 13 in August. The index measures the balance of companies reporting economic conditions as favourable minus those reporting unfavourable conditions. Companies believe there is little prospect of an early recovery. Small companies are being particularly hard hit.</p>

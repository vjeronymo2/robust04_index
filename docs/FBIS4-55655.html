			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Krno: "Preferences for Possible </F> Coalitions"]    [Text] Yesterday we managed to obtain the fresh results of  a representative survey of preelection preferences conducted by  Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department from 2 to 10  May 1994. A total of 1,065 respondents were asked to reply to  several questions, of which the following attracted our  attention: "Several parties and movements consider forming  coalitions for the parliamentary elections. How would you vote  if the parties and movements contested the elections grouped  together in the following coalitions....?"    Three political groupings would acquire more votes than if  its individual components went into the elections independently.  The coalition of right-wing and liberal parties--Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH], Democratic Party [DS], National  Democratic Party [NDS], Democratic Union [DU], and Party of  Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen [SPZ]--would receive 13 percent of  the votes of all respondents (15.7 percent of the votes of those  who are determined to vote). The coalition of left-wing and  social democratic parties--Party of the Democratic Left [SDL],  Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], Green Party in  Slovakia [SZS], and Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic [HP  SR]--would receive 15.1 percent (18.2). And the coalition of  ethnic Hungarian parties--Coexistence, Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement [MKDH], and Hungarian Civic Party  [MOS]--would receive 7.5 percent (9.1). The bloc of nationally  oriented parties--Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS],  Slovak National Party [SNS], and Christian Social Union  [KSU]--on the other hand, would receive 19.9 percent of the vote  (24.1 percent); that is less than if the HZDS, the formerly  ruling movement, opted for an independent ticket. Some "other  coalition or party" was preferred by 4.7 percent of respondents.    As many as 22.5 percent of respondents were unable to state  their preferences. Obviously, a fierce preelection struggle  will be waged for this more than one-fifth of undecided voters.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Preferences for Possible Coalitions(in percent)                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Right-wing coalition                  |13.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Left-wing coalition                   |15.1                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National bloc                         |19.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ethnic Hungarians                     |7.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other                                 |4.7                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Would not vote                        |8.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will not state their preferences      |9.3                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                             |22.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Survey conducted by Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department  |  |from 2 to 10 May 1994                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals trim Avon Rubber 2% to Pounds 4.9m Avon Rubber yesterday sought to offer shareholders the tantalising prospect of a dividend increase for the first time in four years as it revealed lower interim profits due to further restructuring charges. Mr Tony Mitchard, the chief executive who retires in December, said a dividend increase would be 'a very live consideration in December. We are more optimistic than we have been for a long time'. The decline in pre-tax profits for the six months to April 2 was from Pounds 5m to Pounds 4.9m after taking account of Pounds 1.3m in charges due to restructuring and the loss on disposal of a subsidiary. Sales were 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 137.2m. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p, payable from earnings down from 15.1p to 10.6p. Mr Mitchard was optimistic about the full year, saying underlying trading was improving in all but the inflatables business and France. Although he refused to comment on the future of the inflatables business - which lost Pounds 544,000 in the first half - he has described it as non-core. Avon is widely expected to sell it this year. The automotive components business more than doubled operating profits to Pounds 3.8m on sales ahead 24 per cent to Pounds 60m. Mr Mitchard said Avon had 'learned to live' with the price pressures imposed by larger US manufacturers such as General Motors. Cadillac Automotive, the US subsidiary, improved profits by 40 per cent. Europe had also been more lucrative than was expected, with the exception of France which continued to incur losses. The tyre business had suffered in the first quarter, due to lower new vehicle production and price increases in October. Operating profits fell 42 per cent to Pounds 1.6m, on sales 10 per cent lower at Pounds 37.1m. Technical products operating profits fell by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.3m, against a good first half in 1993, on a 9 per cent decline in sales to Pounds 33.8m. COMMENT Investors who have backed Avon's struggle over recent years will have greeted the news of yet more exceptional charges with a certain weariness. Yet even those looking to sell have been forced to a holding position by a better than expected performance from Europe and prospects of a sale of the inflatables business. Forecasts were upgraded from Pounds 13m to Pounds 14.5m for this year, leaving the shares on a prospective p/e of 14. In the shorter term, the shares are up with events. On an 18-month view, they become more attractive - assuming, that is, there are no more hefty charges.</p>

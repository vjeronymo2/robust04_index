			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray, who is  responsible in the Russian government for ethnic policies, has  granted an exclusive interview to the Interfax correspondent  Vitaliy Djibuti.    IF: The media carry much information about the possible  settlement of relationships between Russia and Chechnya. Some  Chechen politicians even began to flare up passions speaking  about the possible "local nuclear explosion" in Chechnya,  allegedly organized by the Russian side. What is behind the  incessant political interest and the hysteria of the "official  Grozny" in connection of the current bilateral talks?    SHAKHRAY: There are at least three reasons. The first  reason is in the political course of the official Chechen  leadership aimed at the republic's economic self-isolation. The  result is that today all political forces in the republic are  facing the need to find prompt solutions to pull the republic  out of the economic crisis. The second reason is the  uncontrolled growth of crime and the danger to people's  security. The third reason is in the growing political  competition inside the republic among several political figures.    Also troublesome is the threat of smuggling fire arms and  drugs and uncontrolled duty-free cargo transportation. The  growing crime in the Chechen republic prevents from the safety  of cargoes which pass along the republic. This forces the  Russian Government to think about the construction of a  68-kilometer railway section which will go round the Chechen  republic.    The destruction of "fuel arteries", the violation of  activities of the republic's oil-processing complex, the losses  sustained by the republic's neighbors make the Russian  government to boost the construction of an oil-processing  factory in Daghestan.    In addition, numerous "shuttle" flights of the Chechen  planes  to Turkey, the Middle East and other regions, which are  violating international safety flight norms have put under  threat the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who are  forced to earn their living by going abroad and buying goods  there to sell them in their country.    The Russian Federation receives notes of protest from  foreign  countries which say about the violation of the international  norms of flight safety.    The unsettled economic contacts between Chechnya and the  Russian Federation, without any artificial blockades and  sanctions, lead to the economic self-isolation of the Chechen  Republic. Representatives of the financial and industrial  quarters of the Chechen Republic will hardly see what is going  on without taking appropriate measures. This forces both sides  to look for the way out of the deadlock.    IF: It was reported earlier that the Russian government is  concerned over the situation in terms of pensions payment to the  people living in the Chechen Republic.    SHAKHRAY: Unfortunately, the non-payment of pensions to the  people who earned them by their hard work, is a common practice  in the Chechen Republic. Given that the pensioners, the  Chechens, the Russians, and Ingushis and other nationalities are  not to blame for the non-payment, the Russian government decided  to pay pensions to them. But there are no guarantees that  common people will get them because the money may be plundered  even before the distribution.    IF: Will the signing of a bilateral agreement between the  Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation be interpreted as  the refusal of Chechnya from its course for independence and  sovereignty?    SHAKHRAY: Independence is to dispose freely and voluntarily  of one's possibilities and resources. That is why the mutual  delegation of powers is a practical form for the materialization  of independence and sovereignty. And to settle economic  problems and combat crime is the top priority issue.    IF: It seems that the lack of settlement of the Chechen  issue is also due to the difference in the approaches to the  political framing of Russian-Chechen relations displayed by  certain Russian leaders.    SHAKHRAY: I do not understand from what angle this issue can  be discussed. Politically, the issue has been solved. The  president's message to the parliament clearly said that the  talks could be based on free elections in Chechnya and  negotiations on power-sharing with the federal bodies. The  State Duma has stated an analogous position. The formula on  free elections is not an ultimatum or a pre-condition. This is  a question of legalization of the reached agreements and of the  package of economic agreements with no preliminary specific term  for the elections must be set. This is not at all a question of  political situation or one's personal predilections. That is  why today discussion between the federal powers on this subject  will be out of place.    IF: How are the bilateral talks between the Russian and the  Chechen power bodies going now?    SHAKHRAY: Currently, there are consultations in the Russian  government. The ministries and departments concerned and the  governmental commission which I head are working on economic and  juridical matters related to all the issues. This must result  in a draft bilateral treaty and a package of necessary economic  agreements.    IF: Is it possible that President Yeltsin and President  Dudayev will have a personal meeting within the scope of the  talks?    SHAKHRAY: The Chechen president has repeatedly addressed the  Russian president asking for a personal meeting and for  discussion of the problems concerning settlement of the  conflict. If properly prepared for, such a meeting can play an  important role.    IF: Certain experts consider it quite possible that two well  known Chechen politicians -- Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan  Khasbulatov will agree on division of "spheres of influence" in  domestic political affairs. Will this have an impact on the  position of the federal power towards Chechnya?    SHAKHRAY: It may happen that Ruslan Khasbulatov and Dzhokhar  Dudayev agree on a formula in accordance with which Dudayev will  sign an agreement with Russia and elections to the Federation  Council will be held on its basis. In this case there would be  no reasons for doubting Khasbulatov's victory. It can be  prognosticated that then the interests of the two politicians  will really be placed to different spheres.    [IF Note: The Chechen authorities deprived Russian Supreme  Soviet ex-speaker Khasbulatov of the right for living on Chechen  territory. The government, the parliament and the Security  Council held a joint meeting on Sunday and decided to put an end  to illegal activities of some Chechen opposition leaders by the  same way. Among those accused of activities against the Chechen  people and of a plot with Russian imperial forces, there were  mentioned: Doku Zavgayev (the last Chechen-Ingush Communist  leader currently living in Moscow) and Yaragi Mamadayev who  leads the government of people's confidence which he had  established himself.]    SHAKHRAY: One point is obvious -- only that Chechen  politician will be capable of ensuring his political future and  do good to his people, who will hold talks and normalize  relations with Russia.    Specific names or family names do not matter. The reality is  that innocent people, numerous refugees fled from their houses  are suffering. Only gradual, careful and attentive work during  negotiations will help to resolve this problem.    Consultations between the federal power and Chechen  different  political forces will help to consolidate the society within the  Chechen Republic. All Chechen politicians will soon ascertain  that the subject of the talks -- the economic issues and  struggle with crime -- is important for different political  groups. The main point is that they be guided just by one  aspiration -- to do good to their people. That is why the role  of Chechnya's neighbors, kind peace Caucasian traditions is of  importance. Everyone will have some work to do.    We must try to compensate our lost urgently, to restore the  broken relations, to bring people back to their houses and to  halt growing crime.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / York chop The Shambles, built in the 13th century as the city's butchery centre, is set to lose its last butcher's shop, Chris Tighe writes. Dewhurst has earmarked its branch in the street for closure as part of a national programme to cut its outlets from 1,000 to 400. One of the best-preserved medieval streets in Europe, the Shambles was formerly called the Fleshammels, meaning meat counters. It has 47 shops, most of which were once butcher's. Dewhurst said: 'The Shambles really is a tourist haunt now. It's not the ideal trading environment for a butcher's' An increase in supermarkets in and around York has also curbed trade.</p>

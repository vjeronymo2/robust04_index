			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech delivered by Crown Prince Hasan at the </F> conference on economic and business implications of the  Arab-Israeli peace process, organized by the Middle East  Economic Digest in London on 10 January]    [Text] Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:    It is an honour to deliver the keynote address to the Middle  East Economic Digest (MEED) conference on the economics of peace  in the Middle East. With so many distinguished thinkers on this  subject gathered together today, I feel that we cannot but make  significant progress in the understanding of this complex area.  I would like to set the tone by presenting an approach that  could help achieve a viable framework for the areas to be  discussed in the three other sessions today: the future of the  Palestinian economy, the reconstruction challenge, and financing  the peace.    As all those involved with MEED are aware, the entire region  has been shattered by decades of conflict. While the Middle  East is potentially self-sustaining in every respect, the  Arab-Israel conflict has left the economies of the region  insular in orientation and stunted in development. Crippled by  debt and the demands of massive military expenditure, not one of  the countries of the region--including Israel--could at present  claim to be self-supporting in any meaningful way. Only peace  can redeem this state of affairs.    The Middle East peace process has weathered changes of  administration in Israel and the United States; it has survived  political and military crises, and its negotiations have come  through periods of difficulty to provide fresh hope. If the  process is currently encountering a number of technical  obstacles, it has also demonstrated unprecedented resilience.  Jordan believes that this opportunity to resolve the conflict  cannot be missed. The no-war, no-peace stasis that holds us in  its thrall has benefited none of the parties. The accumulation  of weapons in the region, particularly since the second Gulf  war, means that the consequences of a future war are  unthinkable. Peace is therefore the only viable path, and we in  Jordan are pledged to do all in our power to pursue that path.    The mutual recognition of the PLO and Israel last autumn was  a significant breakthough in Arab-Israeli relations. The  Conference to Support Middle East peace, held in Washington last  October, provided guarantees of support and assistance from the  international community to the Palestinians, to help translate  the promise of peace into tangible reality. The  Jordanian-Israeli common agenda was likewise a bold step on the  road to peace. However, the substance of peace is infinitely  more complex than its rhetoric.    Peace-making has entered a new phase which requires an  extensive investment in detail and technicalities. Soundbite  diplomacy is no substitute for substantive negotiation.    Jordan is engaged in serious and substantive discussions  with  its neighbours, with the aim of delineating areas of future  cooperation in all spheres.    We have just agreed with the Palestinians a cooperation  agreement at the official bilateral level, at the private sector  level, and at the Arab and international levels. We will  explore the details of such fields as money and banking, trade,  human resources development, tourism, investment promotion,  taxation, health, agriculture, infrastructure: not the stuff of  headlines, but the stuff of which true peace is made.    For despite the 1988 severance of administrative links, the  geographic, historic and demographic ties between Jordan and  Palestine endure.    Such factors lie behind our decision to reopen branches of  Jordanian banks in the occupied territories and to encourage the  Jordanian private sector to invest in the West Bank and Gaza:  for these are designed to help the nascent Palestinian economy  in its development.    On the Jordanian-Israeli track, the  Jordanian-Israeli-American economic committee will provide a  valuable forum to address all aspects of human resource  development, trade, finance, economic and monetary policy  between Jordan and Israel. We now look forward to discussing  other substantive issues, such as water, boundaries and  refugees, on the basis of international law.    It is possible that in the long term, an arrangement  similar to that which exists between Belgium, the Netherlands  and Luxembourg would give all parties the psychological and  material sense of security that is vital to sustainable peace.  Jordan's primary role in a Benelux-type arrangement would be to  provide stability: a role for which it is well-qualified,  having traditionally served as an island of moderation in an  otherwise volatile region. In addition, Jordan's historic  position at the crossroads of East and West, stretching back to  antiquity, equips it well to be a window for the world on a new  Middle East, one finally at peace.    However, the disparties and distortions created by the  conflict must be eliminated if such arrangements are to enjoy  lasting success. Peace must be forged between partners, and the  relationship that exists between Israel and the occupied  territories is not one of partnerhsip, but of hegemony. The  Israeli occupation has destroyed the economies of the West Bank  and Gaza Strip, preventing the development and expansion of  Palestinian enterprise, and prohibiting free trade within the  area. A recent World Bank study shows that in a "normal"  situation, Israel would account for a fifth of the occupied  territories' exports and a third of their imports; instead, 85  per cent of their trade is with Israel. Whatever the nature of  the Palestinian entity agreed upon for the occupied territories,  it would not serve the interests of any party for it to be  subject to a single set of incentives.    Even under conditions of peace, the disparity between the  Israeli economy and those of the other core parties to the  conflict would demand appropriate measures to fashion a balanced  relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of Spain and  Portugal within the EU bear consideration in this regard. This  is particularly vital as the Israeli economy has many  restrictive features and is heavily subsidised. Given a  negotiated peace, the complete removal of these features on both  sides would be possible; but at the moment, when Israeli limits  on our export to the occupied territories closely resemble  boycott provisions, talk of lifting the Arab embargo is  premature.    A GATT-EU approach could be the best way to deal with the  economic legacies of the conflict. Indeed, Jordan has decided  to apply for membership of GATT; for we believe that in seeking  to envolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the  experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche  arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The  European Commission recently approved a communication on "Future  Relations and Cooperation Between the Community and the Middle  East," illustrating the importance of experience in other parts  of the world. The communication stresses the need for a common  regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East.  It states:    "Partnership requres balanced economic development. If  cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive  disparties in income levels between potential partners in the  region." It adds that:    "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of  common capacities and the tackling of common problems ...  implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for goods,  services, capital and labour."    If one thing is clear at this point, it is that peace cannot  be piecemeal. All the peoples of the region have suffered  through the conflict; and just as all have their part to play in  its rebuilding and renewal, so must its fruits be distributed  equitably.    For it should never be forgotten that peace is ultimately  not  in the hands of governments, but of individuals; and unless  peace can be made attractive to the man on the street, the best  efforts of negotiators will come to nought.    Jordan, nearest to the core of the conflict, has shouldered  an enormous human load. We have given shelter to three waves of  displaced Palestinians. These refugees--about 1.7 million  individuals--account today for one third of Jordan's population.  The demographic strain on my country is vast; and the conflict  has also had consequences in terms of debt. We are grateful for  President Clinton's public commitment on the part of the United  States to debt relief for Jordan, as our $7bn. debt overhang is  a real obstacle to the progressive policies which we wish to  adopt. We seek to attract foreign investment, to upgrade  infrastructure and to participate fully in regional projects.  Jordan is committed to the peace process, to democratisation  and economic liberation, to human rights, sustainable  development and regional cooperation. But if we are to promote  these policies effectively, exceptional efforts will be needed  in respect of our debt burden.    Ladies and Gentlemen:    International investment in development projects that serve  the region and its peoples is vital. it is equally important  that such projects be founded upon sound concepts, and that they  receive the support of international financial institutions,  governments and multinational corporations alike. A basketing  approach, covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and  security, must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure  that can tackle the 'over-arching' problems of economies of the  region: disparities created by conflict, over-extended public  sectors, addiction to aid on the one hand and oil revenues on  the other. An economic framework is needed to deal with such  problems. This must in turn be backed up by wide-ranging  security and cooperation arrangements at the regional level,  involving all players. The multilateral component of the peace  process provides a possible framework for this enterprise.    Given such arrangments, the reconstruction of the Middle  East  could proceed apace. In terms of economic development, a  free-trade zone across the Middle East would be the ultimate  goal. Arrangements for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a  MEFTA along the lines of NAFTA--would allow the region to play a  more creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this  goal, it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement  of all factors of production: labour, goods, capital and  services. In this context, a dialogue on the rights of migrant  labour emerges as a vital prerequisite; for the existence of  surplus labour in the north, and capital in the south,  immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime.    Such a development would provide an impetus for a new  relationship of hope in the Middle East. Many other instruments  would back this up. First and foremost, there needs to be a  commitment to arms control from the purchasers and suppliers of  weaponary. Secondly, regional bodies and charters will help  ensure equity in resource-related areas such as energy and  water; while incentives for local sustainable development  programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all.  Finally, a regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle  East reconstruction and development, will promote stable and  open financial practices, improving the chances for the region  to play a dynamic part in the world economy.    For many of the problems of the Middle East stem from the  fact that the climate of conflict has forced the diversion of  funds away from long-term development and into the military.  Generations have grown up in a region which has prioritised  military security above health or education. In a Middle East  established by a negotiated peace, and upheld by structures of  collective security and cooperation, these funds could at last  be channelled into building the social and economic foundations  of peace, which are the surest foundations of all.    In all these areas, the experience and assistance of the  international community of nations, and the international  business community, will be indispensable to the Middle East. I  am sure that conferences of this sort will help to deepen  international understanding of the tasks at hand. I would like  to thank the organisers for all their efforts; and I would like  to thank you all for your attention.</p>

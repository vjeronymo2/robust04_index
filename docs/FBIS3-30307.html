His statement came as a follow-up to the message  Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the Party of Social Democracy of  Romania, sent to the MSZP. (The message and Horn's verbal  answer were covered earlier tonight.)    The message, handed over by Ambassador Ion Donca, refers to  "sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary which may succeed in  normalizing bilateral relations."    "Whom can we consider Hungary's sober-minded forces that may  guarantee the success mentioned in the letter," Oberfrank asked.    "Do the two countries need a treaty to settle their  relations  or do they need citizens who are satisfied and have rights, no  matter whether they belong to a minority or the majority? Why  do both sides consider the border issue timely?" the cabinet  chief asked.    "It is contrary to international diplomatic practice that an  ambassador hands over a party message and comments it,"  Oberfrank said.</p>

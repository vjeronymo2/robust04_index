			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Andrey Apostolov: "Alas, the Bear Is Not </F> Dead Yet!"]    [Text] One week after Russia's Sarajevo initiative  obliterated NATO's ultimatum and confused the plans of certain  eastern and western capitals, Moscow claims that it has come out  of the three year-period during which it used to lethargically  bow to the West and indicates that it will not stand in front of  Brussels' gates as Henry IV used to in front of the gates of  Canossa.    With his address to the Federal Assembly, President Yeltsin  certainly gained points in Russia, which still awaits the  billions the West promised. This is the first time that Moscow  has warned the West in such a categorical manner that the time  of unilateral concessions, especially regarding defense, is over  and that expanding NATO without its participation would be a  threat to Europe and the world. This could only mean one thing  for NATO's East European candidates -- they will have to wait.  Apparently, the period of waiting will be a long one.    The "a-la-Zhirinovskiy" style, with which the president  declared that a priority task will be to strengthen the state  and prompt it to act firmly and decisively when the state  interests require this, will obviously be a leading style of  Russian policy. This was not a mere implication but a threat to  NATO and those neighbors who have written Russia off as a great  power. Now they will have to get used to the formula of  "protecting the Russian citizens' life and interests." A  similar formula in the last 40 years sent U.S. troops to the  Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and many other  places. The Russians do not have to go that far to send their  troops. After all, their troops already are in Georgia,  Tajikistan, the Baltic states, and so on.    The Western capitals probably watched Yeltsin's address,  which was directly carried by CNN, and even more probably, they  were unpleasantly surprised. The dying bear was brought back to  life and it appears that it did not forget how to jump.</p>

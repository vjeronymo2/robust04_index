			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] has revealed  that it held contacts with Western officials and diplomats in  London a few days ago with the aim of "suspending" military  operations against the Israelis and to give the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement a chance to succeed.    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas  representative in Jordan, said that he "personally met with some  of those Western diplomats and officials in the British capital."    To spare them embarrassment, Nazzal declined to give the  names of the Western diplomats and officials with whom he met.    He said: The contacts revolved around Hamas's position on  the Gaza-Jericho agreement and other developments in the  occupied territories, especially the qualitative military  operations that the movement carried out against the occupation  troops and settlers.    Nazzal said that he explained to those officials that the  movement has a clear position regarding the need to continue  military action until the occupation is removed.    In response to a question on the Israeli occupation  authorities' recent contacts with Hamas in the occupied  territories, Nazzal said: These contacts were initiated by the  Israeli side. They were held with some Hamas officials in  Israeli prisons to convince them to ask Hamas leaders outside  prison to halt military action.    Nazzal revealed that Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli  delegation to the negotiations with the Palestinians on  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, is one of those who held such  contacts. He stressed that Hamas has rejected those offers  because the occupation, which is the justification for the  continued military action, is still there.    In response to a question, Nazzal denied any contacts  between  Hamas and Israeli officials outside Israeli prisons.    On what has been reported about a cease-fire offered by  Hamas, the Hamas representative said that the truth of this  offer has been distorted by the Israeli mass media. He said the  cease-fire was not comprehensive and final, but was for three  days only and covers only the settlers. He noted that this  ultimatum is over, and that the al-Qassam battalions have  declared a resumption of military operations against the  settlers.    In response to a question, Nazzal denied that the 10  faction-bloc has broken up. He emphasized that the 10 factions  will meet in Damascus on Thursday [31 December]. However, he  admitted the existence of differences and various views  regarding the organizational formula, which is currently under  consideration.    He said: The 10-faction bloc will remain the minimum level  through which the resistance to the occupation and to any  agreement that relinquishes the Palestinian people's rights can  continue.    He said: Hamas has every respect and appreciation for all  its allies in the 10-faction coalition, but it does not want  charges to be leveled against it by any of those allies through  the media.    Nazzal hoped that a "brotherly spirit would prevail between  Hamas and its allies." He stressed that "the points of  agreement are more than the points of disagreement."    Nazzal criticized the "phenomenon of some Palestinian  factions' claiming responsibility for some operations that have  been carried out by the al-Qassam battalions, especially since  the factions that claim responsibility for such operations are  among the 10 factions."    It is noteworthy that some military operations in the  occupied territories were claimed by both Hamas and the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The latest  operation was the one in which two settlers were killed in  Baytuniya near Ramallah.</p>

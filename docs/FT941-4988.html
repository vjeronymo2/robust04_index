			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Bank puts up cost of long-term corporate borrowing The cost of long-term funds for Japan's hard-pressed corporate borrowers is to rise, despite the central bank's policy of keeping official interest rates at a record low. The Industrial Bank of Japan, the leading long-term credit bank, yesterday announced it will raise its long-term lending rate to its most credit-worthy corporate clients by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent from tomorrow, the second increase in two months. Other commercial banks are expected to follow suit and raise interest rates on long-term loans next month. IBJ's long-term prime rate is regarded as a benchmark for the industry. Its 0.3 percentage point rise to 3.8 per cent in February ended an eight-month decline in long-term rates, arousing concern at the Bank of Japan. The central bank is under increasing pressure to cut its 1.75 per cent official discount rate to stimulate flagging demand. Yesterday's move will intensify fears that the Japanese economy's capacity to recover might become hampered by a lending squeeze. Even before the latest rise, companies told an IBJ survey that they planned to cut capital investment this year for the third year running, the longest decline since the second world war. IBJ's decision reflects a recent rise in the long-term bond yields, due to a fall in prices caused by an oversupply in the Japanese government bond market and the rise in US interest rates. Japan's bond market has faced a huge sell off recently, as investors locked in profits ahead of the March book closing. The turmoil on global bond markets and fears of an increase in bond supply to finance the economic package and tax cuts announced last month, has exacerbated the fall. The Bank of Japan has become increasingly worried that the rise in corporate lending rates will hurt corporate earnings, hampering economic recovery. To ease the downturn in the government bond market, it has led short-term money market rates lower over the past few weeks and the yield spread between the discount rate and the overnight call rate is currently at a historical low.</p>

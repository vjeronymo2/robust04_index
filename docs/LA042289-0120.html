			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> POIGNANT LESSONS IN 'TEACHING MORALITY TO KIDS'  </P> <P> Could your child lie? Cheat? Murder?  </P> <P> Increasing numbers of our nation's youth are doing just that, apparently  without conscience. We can thank decades of "epidemic greed, dishonesty and  corruption," says a remarkable program, "See Dick &amp; Jane Lie, Cheat &amp;  Steal: Teaching Morality to Kids," airing Sunday at 8 p.m. on KTLA Channel 5.  </P> <P> Don't tune out. This isn't a harangue, a religious tome or an hour of doom and  gloom. The first part of the show, intelligently hosted by Tom Selleck, does  offer shocking examples of "moral collapse" -- children, teens and young adults  talking on camera of their misdeeds and violent crimes.  </P> <P> But the bulk of the hour shows us we aren't powerless, with an illuminating  cross-country tour of "pockets of hope," where sound new programs teaching  basic decency are making a difference. We're shown pilot projects involving  basic values, self-esteem and personal responsibility that reportedly have  resulted in higher academic scores and a major reduction of disciplinary  problems and vandalism.  </P> <P> All of them share one thing: Children are treated with respect and they respond  in kind. Remember the Golden Rule?  </P> <P> This is the first in a four-part series, "Raising Good Kids in Bad Times,"  written, produced and directed by Carol L. Fleisher for Academy Award-winning  executive producer Arnold Shapiro ("Scared Straight!").  </P> <P> Viewers are offered a number to call for videotapes of the show and for  information on values-teaching programs to start in their own communities.

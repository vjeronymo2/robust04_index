			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Davy probe near completion - Result of investigation into share placing expected early June THE IRISH Stock Exchange says that its investigation into the April 30 placing of 25.4m shares in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group, by Davy, the Dublin stockbroking firm, is expected to be completed early next month. The investigation is focusing on several aspects of the placing, including Davy's original share placing arrangements with SG Warburg, the London broking firm with whom Davy has said there was a profit and loss sharing agreement which was abandoned on the day of the placement. Warburg was to have taken up to 10m of the shares, as a buyer of last resort, but Davy ended up placing 7m shares with groups associated with the Davy directors instead. Two investigators from the London Stock Exchange's surveillance unit together with Mr David Mulville, the ISE's compliance officer, are apparently heading the investigation. In a new development earlier this week, Davy said that some of the telephone conversations made from the company's dealing room, failed to be recorded on the day of the Greencore placing. As standard practice, most brokers record dealing room telephone calls to clear up any subsequent misunderstandings. In the week following the placement, trading in Greencore shares were suspended in London and Dublin for two days, after the Irish government, which owned the Greencore shares, said it had been informed by Davy that there might be legal problems with the placement. The ISE then took the unusual step of making a public statement saying Greencore shares had been trading on the basis of 'misleading information' following the placing and that the conduct of Davy was to be investigated. Several overseas institutions then pulled out of the placement. However, it was rescued by Davy's parent, the Bank of Ireland, which stepped in to buy 9.6m of the shares at the offer price of IPounds 2.75. Mr Leonard Abrahamson, the ISE's new president, said the main findings of the investigation will be made public.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> INFORMATION ASKED ON SHOOTING VICTIM  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department is seeking information about the shooting death of a  man whose body was found alongside a major thoroughfare near Brea city limits.  </P> <P> The body of Manuel Duarte, 49, whose last known address was in La Habra, was  found at 6:45 a.m. on Saturday off Brea Boulevard in an unincorporated area  about half a mile from the city line, Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson  said.  </P> <P> Duarte had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, Olson said. "It would  appear to us that he was killed someplace else and then dumped there," he said.  </P> <P> Duarte was also known as Ramiro Mendez Vargas and Manuel Llanes. Olson declined  to say why Duarte would use aliases, but he said that Duarte had worked in the  construction industry.  </P> <P> Olson is asking anyone with information about Duarte's death to call the  Sheriff's Department at (714) 647-7000.  </P></p>

We are building an open society in which all human rights will  be respected. Each citizen can voice his/her opinion, but when  a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow."    Niyazov expressed regret that until now Western countries  continue to accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and the  lack of democracy. "I am convinced that there is no more  democratic state than ours nowadays," he stated.    According to the president, there is not a single political  prisoner in the republic, anybody can organize a party, "if its  has regulations, program, supporters and if it acts within the  framework of the constitution and the law."    Speaking about priorities in the foreign policy, Niyazov  again stressed that Turkmenia will cooperate with Russia on an  equal basis "whatever the power in Moscow." In the president's  opinion, "it is necessary to choose five-six states for having  close relations with them." Among these Niyazov named all  countries neighboring Turkmenistan. "The break-off in relations  with them will lead to damage for each side."    Niyazov also said that every CIS meeting passes "hard" for  him and that he feels "pressing." Particularly, when proposals  come in on Turkmenia's more active role in the Tajik and Abkhaz  issues and on the entry in military or economic unions. In his  opinion, today many states on the territory of the former Soviet  Union facing problems after gaining independence cannot cope and  start to support the ideas of creating some coordinating centers  and structures. "Turkmenia will pursue its policy without  entering any alliances," Niyazov pointed out.    The president urged diplomats to clearly see the goals of  the  state and to trust the government policy and be able to explain  to representatives of other countries.    In conclusion, Niyazov approved a resolution on the ministry  and its top officials. In the resolution he excluded only  articles "on the organizational and methodical control by the  Foreign Ministry over foreign economic activites of ministries  and departments" and "on the obligatory implementation of  Foreign Ministry's resolutions on foreign policy by ministries  and departments."</p>

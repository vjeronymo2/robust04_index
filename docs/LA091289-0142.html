			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN HAD EARLIER BLOOD CLOT ON BRAIN, DOCTOR SAYS  </P> <P> The horseback-riding accident that doctors believe produced the blood clot  removed from former President Ronald Reagan's brain last Friday caused a  similar but smaller clot last July that disappeared without surgery, Reagan's  doctor has disclosed.  </P> <P> According to a report in Monday's New York Times, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, chief  neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic and the head of the team caring for Reagan,  said that the earlier clot had shown up in medical tests performed in Los  Angeles several days after the accident, which occurred July 4 on a Mexican  ranch.  </P> <P> Doctors watched the clot, called a subdural hematoma, in periodic brain tests  until it disappeared spontaneously, Sundt told the New York Times. Sundt could  not be reached Monday, but Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg confirmed the report.  </P> <P> Because the clot had developed after the July head injury, Reagan's doctors at  Mayo recommended repeating the brain test, called a CAT scan, as part of his  routine physical examination last week to make sure the problem had not  recurred, Weinberg said.  </P> <P> Reagan, 78, who is recuperating at St. Mary's Hospital, a Mayo Foundation  hospital in Rochester, Minn., has reportedly received hundreds of cards and  messages from well-wishers. He is continuing to make an excellent recovery from  last week's surgery and may be able to return to California at the end of this  week, according to a statement issued by Weinberg Monday afternoon.  </P></p>

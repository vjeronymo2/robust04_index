			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Sri Lankan offensive More than 5,000 Sri Lankan troops launched a joint air, sea and ground offensive against Tamil separatists yesterday, Reuter reports from Colombo. The aim of the operation in the north of the island was to 'destroy as many rebels as possible and deplete their cadres', a military spokesman said. Seven battalions numbering more than 5,000 soldiers were advancing on two flanks, north and south of Vettilaikerni, a beach front in the Jaffna peninsula, meeting little resistance from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatist guerrillas, who control much of the peninsula, officials said.</p>

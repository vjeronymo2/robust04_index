			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Correspondent report by Stojan Zitko: "Railroad Loan"] </F>   [Text] Luxembourg, 18 January -- At the European Investment  Bank [EIB] headquarters, Slovene Minister of Finance Mitja  Gaspari, accompanied by Andrej Umek, minister of transportation  and communications, this afternoon signed an agreement for an  ECU50 million loan, granted to the Ljubljana railroad enterprise  to modernize some priority sections of the railroad network in  our state.    This will be the first tranche of a loan earmarked for  Slovenia in accordance with the transportation agreement signed  last year between Slovenia and the EC and the financial protocol  derived from this agreement, enabling Slovenia to receive an EIB  loan of ECU150 million. Further cooperation between Slovenia and  the EIB was also the topic of discussion between Gaspari and the  EIB vice president.    Gaspari was also received by Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jacques Santer and thanked him for his help with Slovenia's  inclusion in World Bank activities (Slovenia is in the so-called  constituency with Belgium and Luxembourg). Drawing on  Luxembourg's considerable experience with the steel industry,  they also discussed the possibility of Luxembourg helping the  Slovene steel industry, not with money but mainly with advice or  engineering. The economy ministers of both countries are to meet  as soon as possible for further discussions. As far as we know,  today's talks were not related to the Slovene Government's  decision to temporarily deposit the repayments of outstanding  liabilities of Slovene debtors to the Consortium of Commercial  Banks. As reported, this money is to be deposited in a special  account at the Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg.</p>

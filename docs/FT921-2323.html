			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Bundesbank warns of tax rises to help east German economy THE BUNDESBANK warned yesterday that further tax increases may be necessary to support the east German economy. The central bank gave the warning as it spelt out the full cost to west Germany of propping up the east, estimating that net transfer payments to the region would rise to DM180bn (Pounds 62.5bn) this year from DM139bn in 1991. It also warned that further public borrowing to finance such payments could put a severe strain on economic policy. State indebtedness had to be reduced as quickly as possible by curbing spending. The bank's transfer figures work out at DM3,000 per west German inhabitant. It said in its monthly report that the figures were equivalent to 5.5 per cent of west Germany's gross national product last year and 6.5 per cent this year. The cost of propping up the east Germany economy, painfully recovering from 45 years of communism, is well beyond estimates made in the heady days of unification. In 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an abortive election promise that no tax rises would be necessary to finance unity. This was to counter opposition charges that the costs were being underplayed to win votes. The bank said yesterday more funds were urgently needed for investment, while accepting that the emphasis so far on consumption was unavoidable. East Germany, the German population, contributed only 3.5 per cent of tax revenues last year. Domestic demand in east Germany, at DM360bn, was twice as high as its GNP. The Bundesbank again complained that the federal government was having to contribute too much compared with the Lander (states) and local authorities. The Bonn government's net share (after tax revenues) was DM53bn, which would rise this year to DM74bn, or nearly 40 per cent of the total. By contrast, the states and local authorities would pay only DM12bn (DM8bn in 1991). In addition, unemployment, short-time working, retraining, and job creation costs would account for DM30bn this year, the German Unity Fund for DM24bn, and aids to industry and investment through grants, cheap loans, and tax concessions for DM25bn. Pensions would take DM14bn, with a net DM1bn coming from the EC. About 25 per cent of federal spending would go to east Germany this year against 20 per cent in 1991, the bank said. Some DM85bn of the transfers would flow into east German households (DM60bn in 1991), such as through social security payments, financing 40 per cent of private consumption.</p>

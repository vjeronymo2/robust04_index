			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY ON CAMBODIA  </P> <P> The Administration's recent about-face on Cambodia can only be applauded, no  matter how late the reversal comes, and no matter the degree of previous  support for a despicable policy. That this, and previous, Administrations have  helped to fund a group of rebel forces that includes the Khmer Rouge must rank  as one of the venal acts in U.S foreign-policy history.  </P> <P> REILLY POLLARD  </P> <P> Goleta  </P></p>

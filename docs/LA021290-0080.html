			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. KOREAN EXECUTIVE CRUSADES FOR HARD WORK;  </P> <P> WORKPLACE: IN HIS BEST-SELLING BOOK, THE HEAD OF DAEWOO GROUP ADVISES YOUTH TO  WORK HARD AND DREAM. MORE THAN 900,000 COPIES HAVE BEEN SOLD.  </P> <P> The national best seller is written by the founder of one of South Korea's  largest conglomerates, an unabashed workaholic who says he shaves and eats  breakfast in his car to save time.  </P> <P> Kim Woo-choong heads Daewoo Group, maker of products ranging from Leading Edge  computers to Pontiac LeMans exports to the U.S. market. Kim says he wrote the  book to tell young people how to find inspiration and direction in life. Or as  the suggested title for the English version suggests, "Work!!!"  </P> <P> In South Korea, one of the fastest-growing Asian countries, the drive to  succeed and make money is a passion. Kim's position as head of a conglomerate  with 1988 sales of $17.2 billion hasn't hurt his credibility as an author.  </P> <P> "Nothing comes free in this life and nothing is accidental," writes Kim,  53-year-old father of four. "The more you dig, the deeper the hole. And the  deeper the hole, the more water from the well. That's what it's all about."  </P> <P> More than 900,000 copies of "It's a Big World and There's Lots to be Done" have  been published since it came out last August. In January the book was in its  89th printing.  </P> <P> South Korea's largest bookstore named it one of the five best sellers of the  decade. Daewoo says it has even sold the rights to a professor in China for a  Chinese version.  </P> <P> Although the book has been translated into English, Daewoo is looking for a  U.S. publisher, and negotiations are under way for publication in other  countries.  </P> <P> The 211-page paperback sells for $4.50 and features 39 essays with pithy  fatherly advice on school, working women, choice of jobs, relationships and  making money.  </P> <P> His commentary is full of personal anecdotes ranging from his school life ("not  exemplary") to religion ("better than not having one") to observations on why  nations in southern Europe waste so much time napping.  </P> <P> Kim says he doesn't exercise, takes no vacations, sleeps five hours a night and  spends the rest of the time working and making business deals. He wrote the  book nights while waiting out a shipyard strike last spring.  </P> <P> "My generation didn't eat well and couldn't dress well, but look at the Korea  that we've built," he says, advising young people not to become smug by the  country's new consumerism and leisure time.  </P> <P> "Days are too short for me," he writes. "I wish they were 30 or 40 hours long.  I sometimes shave and wash with a towel in the car on the way to work. I even  occasionally have breakfast in the car."  </P> <P> He holds staff meetings before or after the regular workday and prides himself  that at Daewoo, which means "Big House" in Korean, a 9-to-5 workday can mean 5  a.m. until 9 p.m.  </P> <P> "Wasting time is worse than wasting money, for you can always make more money,"  says Kim. "When it comes to making money, I'm an expert."  </P> <P> As founder and chairman of Daewoo, Kim oversees 70 overseas offices and 93,000  employees involved in trade, construction, shipbuilding, the manufacture of  cars, industrial robots, telecommunications, consumer electronic products,  textiles and home appliances.  </P> <P> The book skips over the ways that Daewoo rose from a small textile exporter to  the world's 46th-largest industrial company in 22 years, omitting mention of  its ties to past authoritarian governments, low wages, easy bank credit and  protectionist barriers that allowed Daewoo and other conglomerates to grow.  </P> <P> "There's a frantic trend nowadays to think only in terms of immediate profits,"  Kim writes. "People are looking for comfort and satisfaction rather than having  a fighting spirit to overcome difficulties and succeed in the long run."  </P> <P> He advises Korean women to stamp out sex discrimination by considering a job  professionally, not "a bus stop on the way to marriage."  </P> <P> "You have to find places that people have never been to and you have to do  things that people haven't done before," he advises both sexes. "Of course,  there's danger in pioneering. Pioneers take paths that haven't been paved."  </P> <P> "There is too much egocentrism," he says. "If everyone's an egoist, then  there's always going to be trouble."  </P> <P> He recommends forming close lifetime friendships, a code followed closely among  Korean businessmen who often judge each other by the schools they've attended.  </P> <P> Although Kim exalts nonstop work, he encourages day-dreams. "Dreams are like  the rudder of a ship setting sail. The rudder may be small and unseen, but it  controls the ship's course."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME SAY WOES MAY FORCE S&amp;L'S SALE;  </P> <P> DOWNWARD SLIDE HITS DOWN-HOME MERCURY  </P> <P> Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Chairman Leonard Shane might be called a little  old-fashioned.  </P> <P> Until a few years ago, one of his favorite marketing tools was to hire school  teachers to walk door-to-door and encourage neighbors to visit the nearest  Mercury branch, where they could pick up a free pad of personalized stationery.  </P> <P> And he still prefers to promote the Huntington Beach-based S&amp;L by  sponsoring lunches for local civic groups rather than by taking out newspaper  ads as his competitors do.  </P> <P> "A basic, good idea doesn't get dated," Shane said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Basic is the word to describe Mercury S&amp;L, which was founded by Shane in  1964.  </P> <P> While some S&amp;Ls have evolved into brokers of "junk bonds" and wholesale car  loans, Shane has stuck with conventional mortgages, preached the value of home  ownership and criticized less traditional thrift operators who pushed industry  deregulation to the limit.  </P> <P> Recently, however, the 66-year-old Shane has had problems of his own with  regulators and accountants, and his institution is stumbling. Shane has brought  his son William back as manager of branch operations for Mercury's 25-branch  network, a key role in the institution, and the chairman said he hopes he can  retire soon. William Shane left in late 1987, citing a desire to "pursue other  ideas." He opened a sports novelty business.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, regulators forced Mercury to reduce the value of some of its  assets. The reduction turned a $6.1-million profit originally reported for 1988  into a $7.4-million loss. The writedown ended many years of profitability.  James Wilson, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage firm,  said the writedown has ignited rumors that Mercury is experiencing a capital  crunch that could force Shane to sell.  </P> <P> Shane said he is not negotiating a sale of the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Analysts said the return of William Shane, who was Mercury president before  resigning, might mean that Leonard Shane intends to keep control of the thrift  in his family. Members of the Shane family own about 15% of Mercury's stock.  </P> <P> A dozen years before Shane started Mercury, the Chicago native was an outspoken  political advocate of the social, as well as economic, importance of national  policy that promoted home ownership. A former journalist and advertising  executive, Shane gained prominence in the 1950s by running national campaigns  of Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Estes Kefauver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Party Activist  </P> <P> Shane said he remains a party activist and was one of Orange County's biggest  financial backers of Michael Dukakis, the unsuccessful 1988 Democratic  presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Shane, a heavy-set, sometimes loud and exuberant and sometimes gentle and  grandfatherly man, admits to delivering emotion-packed speeches.  </P> <P> "If I believe in something, I put all my effort behind it, whether it is with  politics or business or religion," he said.  </P> <P> For decades, Shane, currently national vice chairman of the United Jewish  Appeal, has led educational missions around the world to increase awareness of  the rights of Jews.  </P> <P> It was only in the early 1980s that Shane stopped hiring school teachers to go  door-to-door through new housing developments to encourage neighbors to stop in  the nearby Mercury Savings &amp; Loan branch for a memo pad and a friendly  hello.  </P> <P> Shane said he stopped that approach only because neighborhoods surrounding most  of Mercury's branches are now developed.  </P> <P> The memo pads are still free to anyone who drops into one of Mercury's 25  branches, and most locations have rooms for local civic groups to conduct  meetings, with full lunches paid for by Mercury. The money spent on the lunches  and memo pads makes up most of Mercury's promotional budget. No money is spent  on media advertising.  </P> <P> Carl Frederick, president of Frederick Research in New York, said Mercury's  down-home style as the trustworthy safe keeper for a neighborhood's deposits  has established one of the most loyal customer bases in a business where  depositors hop from one institution to another chasing interest rates.  </P> <P> "You won't find that style anywhere else in California. I don't know where you  would find it," Frederick said.  </P> <P> Old-style ways of doing business often are not the most cost-effective, and  observers said that over the years that fact has not been lost on Mercury.  </P> <P> "There are cost improvements that could have been made at Mercury. And Leonard  knows that. He's been making them the last couple of years to boost Mercury's  value," said Wilson, the Sutro analyst.  </P> <P> Another analyst said some of the inefficiency is caused by centralized decision  making that revolves around Shane. One former employee, exaggerating the point,  said every loan considered by Mercury is reviewed by Shane.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Computer in Office  </P> <P> While Mercury's operation is automated, Shane doesn't have a computer in his  office. An old manual typewriter, a historical showpiece in some offices, is a  practical tool in Shane's.  </P> <P> Shane's approach was not questioned through much of the 1980s while Mercury was  prospering and other S&amp;Ls were failing.  </P> <P> In 1984, when Shane headed the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the central  trade group for S&amp;Ls, he gave impassioned speeches and Senate testimony  warning of the dangers of deregulation.  </P> <P> Shane said then, and three years earlier when he headed the California Savings  &amp; Loan League, that institutions involved in more speculative activities  were a major threat to themselves and the economy. A more vocal group of  S&amp;L operators argued at the time that the industry must be deregulated for  it to survive.  </P> <P> "Leonard has always seemed to understand what the industry is about. And he's  always been proved right," said Jim Grohl, an executive with the U.S. League in  Washington.  </P> <P> For many years, Shane was able to juggle the management of his institution with  extensive civic duties, such as being a member of the Los Angeles Coliseum  Commission and a local school board. However, some analysts said the time he  committed to the U.S. League in 1984 eventually took its toll on Mercury.  </P> <P> At the company's shareholder meeting in 1986, Shane predicted that 1986 profit  would top the record earnings of $11.1 million in 1985. Instead, 1986 marked  the start of an earnings slide. Earnings that year reached only $9.4 million,  as Mercury increased by $27.6 million its reserve for loan and real estate  losses. That was a sixfold jump from the amount of a year earlier.  </P> <P> In 1987, Mercury's losses from loans, foreclosed losses in real estate and  direct involvement in real estate totaled $23.4 million, compared to only $2  million two years earlier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hard to Determine  </P> <P> Mercury is now among the S&amp;L money losers. And its health has become  difficult to determine because Mercury, which has yet to hire a new accountant  to audit its books, missed the Securities and Exchange Commission April 15  deadline to file 1988 financial results. At the end of 1987, the institution  did have more than the required 3% of assets in capital.  </P> <P> In Mercury's recent battle with federal regulators, Shane said regulators  disagreed with Mercury's accounting of some transactions and loan-loss reserves  dating to 1984. The fight ended with Mercury writing down the value of some  assets and increasing its general loss reserves by $12.2 million. Mercury has  not reported its total loss reserves.  </P> <P> Last year's loss, which one analyst said was caused by overvaluing mortgage  income in previous years, reduces the company's capital and raises concern that  Mercury might not be able to meet higher capital requirements that analysts  expect Congress to impose. The capital is the institution's insurance against  losses.  </P> <P> "There may be little choice but to sell," said Henry Dahlgren, an analyst at  Cruttenden &amp; Co., a brokerage in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boost May Be in Store  </P> <P> As part of its multibillion-dollar bailout of the virtually bankrupt Federal  Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Congress is studying a recommendation from  the Bush Administration that S&amp;Ls double their capital reserve to 6% of  their assets by 1991.  </P> <P> Others said Shane will be able to maintain control of the institution.  </P> <P> "Leonard Shane has friends all over Wall Street. If he needs money, he can come  here," Frederick said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MERCURY SAVINGS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, founded in 1964 by Leonard Shane, now has 25  branches across the state and $2.5 billion in assets. Shane and his family own  about 15% of the stock.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="3" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended Dec. 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '87  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '86  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $247  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $233  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $263  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (7.4)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Assets $2.5 billion  </P> <P> Employees 1,000  </P> <P> Shares outstanding 6 million  </P> <P> 12-mo. price range $4.375-$10.25  </P> <P> Mon. close (NYSE) $5, unchanged  </P></p>

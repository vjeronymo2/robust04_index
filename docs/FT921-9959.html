			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: Homely and odd - Poetry in performance NEW ZEALAND poet Lauris Edmond is in the habit of rocking back on her sturdy, high-heeled shoes and chuckling a lot. It is one of the endearing ways she has of drawing us into her intimate circle; of making us honorary citizens of her country, a place that she described on several occasions in the course of an hour-long reading at the Voice Box as 'the smallest and farthest away place in the world.' Small places are homely. People talk to each other. Lauris Edmond came late to poetry. She had lived one whole life - as wife and mother - before the muse began to crave some attention, too. That was in the middle 1970s. Now, nine books later, and having won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize in 1985, she is one of New Zealand's most distinctive female voices and, at nearly 70 years old, something of a dignified elder stateswoman of the art. And that is how she seems: assured, approachable, ready to share with us what she has found. And, for greater ease of intellectual digestion, she divided the poems that she read that evening into groups: poems that sounded 'authentically New Zealand'; love poems; poems about relationships and so forth. And at the end of each little section, she would stop and ask us if we wanted to ask her something - anything, within reason. 'I'd very much like a dialogue,' she said. 'Poems are like plays. They're created in part by an audience.' The questions, when they came, were respectful and predictable: 'Do you ever change your poems after you've written them?' Reply: 'It depends . . . I like poems that appear straight off. They seem to go on knowing what they always meant.' And the subject matter of these poems look the very spit of their mother: they are accessible, picturesque, gently humorous and often written more in celebration than despair - which is unusual in a 20th-century poet. Perhaps you can do new things with a young literature. Last week, David Constantine was reading from his Selected Poems in the murky, low-ceilinged basement of Islington's Market Tavern, an invitee of the Blue Nose Poets - this last fact confirmed, with teasing obliquity, by the two huge posters of clowns with red noses that were pinned to the walls. And how appropriately Dantesque a venue it seemed to be] For Constantine's poetry deals in the oddities of life - the tale of an 18th-century hermit who is hired to embellish some grandee's grotto; the story of an old man who launches himself off a roof, head stuffed full of the dream of Icarus; and another one based on a terrible experience in the life of 'mad' John Clare, that peasant poet who ate grass for want of better and believed himself to have no fewer than two wives. These are odd, extravagant, fantastical poems, pieced together from fragments of learning, frequently bloody, messy, and positively nasty in their details. But before he begins, Constantine, a short man with a delicate frame, sits imp-like on a low stool, leafing backwards and forwards through his book, wondering, and then wondering a little more, what to disturb us with this evening. Should he plunge in at the deep or the shallow end first? Alas, it's all the same depth. He never loses that questing, troubled look - the whites of his eyes often glare, as if suddenly caught in our headlights. He is inclined to scratch at his scalp as an aid to rumination. And then, at last, he seems to hit upon a solution, telling us, 'The coherence of one person's obsessions will structure it . . .' Yet the voice and its Salford music are mild-mannered enough, and quite as unthreatening as the rest of the candle-lit faces in that roomful of practising poets. And he reads every one of his alarming words as if it was the simplest in the language. The tempest has clearly blown itself out on the page, leaving Constantine free to feel touchingly scared (as he tells us, before he bolts out of the door) of the London Underground he might have to re-enter, if he is to catch his late train back to Oxford. 'I find it very creepy,' he confides. Perhaps he should hit back at all those murderous, leering faces with a poem or two. David Constantine's Selected Poems and Lauris Edmond's New and Selected Poems are published by Bloodaxe Books.</p>

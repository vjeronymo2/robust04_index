			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Personal View: Growth for sale at One Stop Shops Researchers recently looked at every known scheme around the world for helping small businesses. To their amazement, it seems that every form of scheme has either been started or subsequently tried in the UK. Britain is a great inventor of 'schemes' for small business. But many schemes have confused social objectives (cutting unemployment) with economic goals (maximising wealth creation). They have often been under-funded, chopped and changed, or run by people not trained to provide the necessary quality of service. The sheer multiplicity has bewildered clients: few schemes have had sufficient marketing to reach their target audience, and running them separately has raised costs and reduced effectiveness and led to 'turf wars'. As Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, declared last July: 'I tell you frankly, we can no longer afford to continue to waste our collective energy on this unhelpful debate.' Mr Heseltine has just run a national competition to pilot the idea of 'One Stop Shops' for business support. He wants the shops to target those with the aspiration and potential to grow. These are the people who will really contribute to wealth creation and to Britain's international competitiveness. This is not picking winners, but developing them. It cannot be done by national government, but by good business advisers who can spot and nurture such businesses because they have seen a client's commitment and ambition over time. A common complaint about business advice agencies is that the information they give is too general. Information technology, however, makes it possible to identify what businesses in a particular area and sector are asking for. Mr Heseltine has stressed that the shops must make the most of new technologies. They will need to be on-line to commercial databases, and to be connected to each other by electronic mail so that inquiries unknown to one shop can be checked out with others. Sharing expertise might be reinforced if shops have both a geographic responsibility and sectoral specialisms. IT would also allow video presentations and conferences in which business advisers and individual companies could participate via each shop. Considerable resources are already being spent through training and enterprise councils, chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies and local councils to help small firms. The impact could be greatly enhanced, but it is necessary to be realistic about what activities can become self-financing and what will need subsidy. Public money for One Stop Shops should clearly be for outcomes - not inputs. It should not, for example, be linked to 'bottoms on seats' on training courses, but to improvements in the client's business performance. Banks and companies such as Shell and BT have given large amounts of cash, people and expertise to enterprise agencies and other small business initiatives during the past 15 years. Apart from maintaining existing commitments, larger firms can help the One Stop Shops through making available expertise and contacts - for example, in total quality management, 'green' auditing and supplier opportunities. The government has repeatedly emphasised the distinction between policy formulation and delivery of services. There is no reason why the Department of Trade and Industry should deliver services such as consultancy or export advice to companies. In time, most of these can be contracted out to the One Stop Shops. Once established, it is essential that shops enjoy a period of stability and continuity - and that they are clearly seen not as a government scheme but as local partnerships in which government (not just the DTI) is an active partner. Cynics believe these One Stop Shops will end up as just one more government scheme. However, combining the vision of a political heavyweight such as Mr Heseltine with the emerging consensus among business support organisations on the ground, a 'once in a decade' opportunity is being given to achieve a national network of business advice centres setting world-class standards.

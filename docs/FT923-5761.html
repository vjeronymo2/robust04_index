			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology: Beethoven and the PC orchestra Speech is coming to the personal computer. After more than a decade of being unable to produce anything more than a bong or boom to accompany computer games, full-blown stereo sound, speech and a wide variety of sound effects are now being included with the modern PC. Compaq Computer is the latest PC manufacturer to join the 'sound' trend, with the launch of its 'Business Audio' feature - building a microphone and sound technology into a number of its new desktop PCs. According to Compaq chairman Ben Rosen, the audio capabilities were a way of 'adding customer benefit at no extra cost'. Compaq's idea was by no means original. Apple, NeXT and several other non-PC-compatible computer manufacturers have offered microphones and sound capabilities on their systems for several years and hundreds of local 'store-brand' PCs have for some months been offered with third-party sound add-ons and CD-Rom players in special 'multimedia bundles'. Still the question remains whether people can be convinced of the value of this technology. Proponents of PC sound claim that a direct, spoken comment is more powerful and more personal than a typed text message on-screen - and that if you can incorporate spoken comments into your desktop presentations, spreadsheet models and word-processed documents, they will be more effective in getting your message across. As with many such innovations, the first big manufacturer to offer this capability in full was Apple Computer, which included a microphone and built-in sound capabilities with the systems it introduced in October 1990. Since then, sound has become a natural partner to many Apple Macintosh applications - particularly when used with CD-Rom digital storage technology (based on CD audio technology and offering the ability to play CD audio disks as well as specialised multimedia CD-Rom software). Sound is also an integral part of multimedia applications - which mix sound, graphics, text and on-screen animation together using sound in partnership with CD-Rom technology. Sound add-ons are often sold with CD-Rom systems as part of a complete multimedia upgrade kit - which in the US typically sells for less than Dollars 800 (Pounds 400). Given that CD-Rom storage systems can store more than 10 times the amount of information held on the average PC hard disk - and that this is all contained on a slim, inexpensive, removable plastic disk - the medium is ideal for producing computer-based educational and reference materials. That is why encyclopedias, several world atlases, dictionaries, children's books and even film guides are now being offered on CD-Rom. Microsoft, for example, offers a CD-Rom application about composer Ludwig van Beethoven. Not only does it offer on-screen representations of Beethoven scores, pictures of the composer and scenes from his life - but also many digital recordings of his classic works that can be played in full stereo from the computer. There is also a spoken 'narration' that is offered throughout this guide. While all these applications are interesting, at the moment they are hardly mainstream business requirements. That is why hardware companies such as Compaq and Apple - and software firms like Microsoft and Lotus Development - are trying so hard to sell users on the idea of business audio. Rosen says he is optimistic about it. 'As people start annotating documents with audio, it will really catch on,' he predicts, although he admits that you cannot force a technology on people who see no use for it. 'You can produce the dog food, but you have to get the dogs to eat it,' he concludes.</p>

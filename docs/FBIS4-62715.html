			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has informed the  British Foreign Office that the 6 May statement by Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev amounts to a misunderstanding.  This is what Estonian Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna  told journalists today. According to INTERFAX, Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev stated at a press conference on 6 May  that 2,500 Russian servicemen will stay in Estonia so long as  the issue of the Russian military pensioners is not resolved.  As is known, both President Lennart Meri and Prime Minister  Mart Laar have reacted to this statement.</p>

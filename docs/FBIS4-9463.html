			<p>BFN     [Text] Kalisz, April 25 -- The All-Poland Strike Committee  of the brown coal mines addressed a letter to the prime minister  expressing the hope that the stand of the industry minister  Marek Pol did not represent the position of the government,  press spokesman of Solidarity's strike committee at the "Konin"  mine Zdzislaw Stasiak announced on Monday.    We are expecting the prime minister to immediately lift the  decision concerning the restructuring of the brown coal mining  industry, Stasiak said. According to him, the responsibility  for the further development of the situation now rests entirely  on Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Stasiak added that since the  industry minister's messages fail to propose any new solutions  and only increase tension among the strikers "There is no need  to further exchange correspondence with him".</p>

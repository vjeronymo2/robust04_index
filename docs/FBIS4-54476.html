			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, today sent an open letter to  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The letter reads:    Dear Mr. President, more than a month ago we signed the  Washington agreement, which opened a new perspective for the  development of relations between the Bosniak and Croat peoples,  as well as Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Soon after this  political document was adopted mutual Muslim-Croat clashes  stopped and roads for humanitarian convoys have been opened to a  certain extent. However, the implementation of other important  provisions of this agreement, and the possibilities that it  offers, are obviously (?late).    I would like to confirm in this letter our interest in a  speedy and complete implementation of the Washington Agreement.  Seeing that I am convinced that you share the same interest,  would you please use the influence you certainly have in order  to implement this agreement quickly and effectively.    I believe that delegations of Bosniaks and Croats should  meet  without further delay. The delegations should propose solutions  to all remaining open issues, including the maps of the cantons,  the personnel issues of the future government and presidency,  the formation of the joint military command, and other issues,  the letter stresses. Some of the priorities are also the  adoption of a program [not specified], the return of refugees to  their homes, and the opening of all communication routes. The  delegations have met twice, but the importance and volume of  work demand not a few hours, but a few days of work. After  proposals and stands are agreed upon, an Assembly session should  immediately be convened to approve the agreed issues.    I believe that we can count on your cooperation to curb the  enemies of the Washington Agreement. Unfortunately, there are  still such people, who, despite the efforts of the political  leaders, have not stopped short of barbaric actions in the field  in order to undermine and rekindle the conflicts.    Mr. President, I am also convinced that your soon arrival on  the announced visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina would contribute to  the realization of goals (?set out in this letter).    Please accept the expressions of my respect. This is said at  the end of the letter sent to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  by Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency.</p>

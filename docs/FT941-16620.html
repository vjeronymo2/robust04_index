			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Cover against the law - The benefits of insuring against litigation costs Few companies ever want to call in the lawyers unless there is no alternative; indeed, an unwanted suit can be especially damaging for smaller businesses struggling to stay afloat. But with solicitors charging up to Pounds 300 an hour, and fees for barristers running into thousands of pounds, legal expenses insurance - where a company will cover itself against the financial losses litigation might entail - begins to look ever more attractive. Although this type of insurance is often associated with motor and household policies, where it can be tacked on as an added extra, one of the biggest growth areas has been in policies tailor-made for companies. These now account for about Pounds 25m of the total Pounds 75m market in the UK for legal expenses insurance. 'Last year was a boom year for legal expenses insurance,' says Paul Asplin, assistant general manager of Bristol-based DAS, a leading specialist insurer which recorded a 28 per cent growth in premium income last year. In spite of this growth, the choice of insurers from which to pick a policy is not vast - unlike the Continent, where legal expenses insurance is a long-established market. There are two leading players in the UK which provide general cover for companies. One is DAS, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf- based Victoria Group which is a major German composite insurer. The other is the Legal Protection Group Ltd (LPG), a subsidiary of Sun Alliance, which operates from Sutton, in Surrey. The lowest premiums available are about Pounds 100 for the most basic cover, but more standard is a package that costs about Pounds 500. As Douglas Macdonald, sales and marketing manager of LPG, points out: 'If an hour's worth of a lawyer is Pounds 250 now, then a company can get that for a year's premium.' The standard package usually has two elements; advice (in the form of a legal helpline) and insurance. The helpline is intended to act as a 'smoke detector' and is likely to provide smaller businesses with many of the benefits of an in-house lawyer. Employers are encouraged to use the telephone as much as possible to nip potential problems in the bud. LPG's 24-hour advice line has 19 full-time advisers, while DAS gets 100,000 calls a year on its service. Many are related to employment problems and the correct procedures that should be followed. 'Typically, it's a boss with a small business worried about getting rid of someone,' says Macdonald. In fact, most legal expenses policies oblige you to consult the helpline before taking action which could lead to dismissing anyone. (If you do not, you will not be covered). The insurance packages themselves are flexible enough; most policies enable you to mix and match. They should include general cover for such risks as fees, expenses, witnesses' attendance at court hearings, and costs awarded against you. Typically, these risks take in contract disputes (where you can sue if a supplier fails to meet required specifications); the costs of defence (should mistakes lead to criminal prosecutions being brought); property problems (relevant to those leasing or sub-letting); tax proceedings and VAT disputes. Some, but not all, policies provide further cover for race and sex discrimination proceedings, or breaches under the Data Protection Act. This can add another Pounds 50 or Pounds 60 to the premium. So, how much does this cover you for? Indemnity limits tend to be flexible, set typically at Pounds 50,000, Pounds 100,000 or Pounds 250,000 a claim. Although the insurers may advise you to go for the upper limit, it is probably best not to take caution too far; the standard limit for which policyholders opt is Pounds 100,000. If, however, you are the awkward litigant, you should not necessarily regard legal expenses insurance as a blank cheque. The excesses on the contract disputes cover can vary from Pounds 500 on DAS, while the LPG's minimum excess on contract cover is Pounds 1,000. This will not cover the niggling disputes that bedevil so many smaller businesses. Nor will any crusading zeal on your part convince the insurance company to cover you in a claim it regards as hopeless. There is a small but significant clause which states that you must have a 'reasonable prospect of success'. 'If it's better than a 50-50 chance, we're quite happy with that,' says Macdonald. But it should be remembered that the insurer decides what constitutes a 'reasonable' prospect, although certain arbitration procedures are built in. 'If we can't see eye to eye, we get an independent lawyer to give a report,' says Asplin. Even if you never see the inside of a courtroom, Pounds 500 is probably worth a bit of peace of mind for many smaller businesses. After all, the helpline alone is cheaper than your own in-house lawyer. Catrin Griffiths is deputy editor of Legal Business</p>

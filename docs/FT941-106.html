			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Government to cut Pounds 21bn road programme by 15% Britain's Pounds 21bn road building programme is to be cut by 15 per cent following a detailed review of government transport policy. Of the 371 schemes originally planned over the next 10 years, 49 projects, worth some Pounds 3bn, have been withdrawn, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced yesterday. Work on a further 69 schemes will be halted at the earliest opportunity though they will remain in the programme for long-term completion. Eighty schemes have been given top priority while a further 173 have been ranked as 'priority 2' and will be put back. Despite the decision to drop many planned new roads and road-widening schemes, the impact of the review was less severe than many had expected. Roads and motoring groups reacted with relief to the proposals. Transport 2000, a pressure group opposed to roads, described it as 'a con'. The aim of the reassessment was to concentrate funds on a smaller number of motorway and trunk road-widening schemes. New roads which cut across open country such as the M12 from London into Essex and roads which encourage commuter journeys into town centres have been dropped. Deciding priorities would allow essential projects to be built faster and remove those deemed environmentally unacceptable or unnecessary for the foreseeable future, Mr MacGregor said. It would also minimise damage and disruption to local communities. Nearly 100 motorway improvement schemes have been retained including expanding parts of the M25, up to 14 lanes, southern parts of the M1 and the M6 from Birmingham to Manchester. The RAC commended the outcome of the review as being 'highly satisfactory' while the Road Haulage Association said it was 'less severe than expected'. However, the Freight Transport Association said it was 'deeply disappointed'. Mr Jim Turner, a director of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, said: 'At first glance, it could have been a lot worse. We welcome attempts to establish clear priorities.' In a second motoring initiative announced yesterday, Mr MacGregor promised fewer delays because of roadworks, more reliable emergency phones and better lit motorways under two charters - for road users and for people whose homes are in the path of road schemes. Responsibility for the charters will lie with the Highways Agency. Full list of road projects dropped, Page 10</p>

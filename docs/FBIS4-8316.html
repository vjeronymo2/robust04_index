			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- The leader of the  opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Filip Dimitrov  almost does not rely on parliamentary methods to oust Prof.  Lyuben Berov's government from power and provoke early  parliamentary elections. SDS wants the fall of Prof. Berov's  cabinet, which was formed in late December 1992 on the mandate  of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and with  the support of the ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP),  the New Union for Democracy (expellees or defectors from the  parliamentary SDS) and several independent MP's. After the  regular meeting of SDS's leadership today, the union's floor  leader Stefan Savov categorically denied that when he met with  President Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday they discussed Mr. Savov's  possible candidature to head a future cabinet. The union  insists on early elections. Stefan Sofiyanski, a deputy  chairman of SDS's National Coordinating Council, said the union  was not going to abandon the parliamentary methods in order to  provoke elections. In his view, SDS will insist that the  National Assembly debate and vote a resolution on the cabinet's  financial policy which, according to the opposition, has been  the cause for the steep appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the  rise of prices over the last few months. It will be only after  the National Assembly adopts such a resolution that SDS might  move its sixth vote of no confidence in the cabinet after its  previous ones were defeated.    The BSP will keep up its pressure on the government,  demanding practical measures to get inflation under control and  speed up the efforts to offset the erosion of the incomes of the  socially disadvantaged, Mr. Doncho Konakchiev MP of the BSP told  a news conference today. This is the decision taken at today's  meeting of the Socialists' leadership. The Socialists intend to  celebrate the International Labour Day on May 1 by "raising  slogans with demands for better social policy," for a crack-down  on profiteering and corruption, for taking practical measures to  solve the problems of the socially disadvantaged and for  economic stability", Mr. Konakchiev said.    The Socialists confirmed today the decision of their plenum  ten days ago to demand that the cabinet present in mid-May a  reasoned progress report and ideas of its economic policy.  According to the Socialists, the cabinet's report and the  report of the National Bank will have to be tabled for  discussions in the National Assembly. They said they were not  satisfied with the measures that the state and the bank  institutions are taking to bring the crisis in the currency  market under control.    The general strike announced by the Confederation of  Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB), one of the major  trade unions in the country, is also scheduled for mid-May.  Today the Women's Democratic Union declared its support for the  strike. "We neither support nor reject the strike but we cannot  accept some of the conclusions about the economic situation in  Bulgaria that the KNSB leadership has made," Mr. Sofiyanski  said. He emphasized that according to SDS some of the trade  union's demands are justified, but they can only be met by a  strong government, formed after early parliamentary elections.    KNSB and Podkrepa, the two major labour amalgamations, did  not attend today's regular meeting of the National Council for  Tripartite Coordination. A week ago the two amalgamations  walked out of the council over differences with the Government  and warned this might be their first step towards a final  withdrawal.    A special statement of the employers and the government,  circulated this afternoon, says that "the refusal of the trade  unions to participate in discussions poses a tangible obstacle  to a final settlement of the social partnership problems." The  employers and the government believe that irrespective of their  differences on the issues concerning collective bargaining, at  today's meeting they could have discussed current social  problems. The statement denies the allegations made by the  trade unions that the government was unwilling to reconsider the  principles of incomes policy.    Today KNSB leader Prof. Krustyu Petkov made public a letter  in which he says that the trade union is distancing itself  completely from the policy of the government, "from the inaction  and irresponsibility for the fate of the economic reform." KNSB  is expecting the prime minister's personal response to the  demands over which the amalgamation has threatened to go to  strike.    The extraparliamentary Bulgarian Agrarian Party (BZNS) again  criticized the government today accusing it of inability to cope  with the grave problems in the country. BZNS is staging a rally  and procession on April 23 under the slogan "Early Elections  Will End Crisis".    The parliamentary BSP and DPS discussed cabinet changes this  afternoon. The movement is considering so far only structural  changes in the cabinet and it will leave it to the prime  minister to decide on the personal replacements. According to  DPS, the Committees of Tourism and Power Engineering should be  transformed into separate ministries or placed under the  jurisdiction of other ministries. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan is  expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov this week.  Socialist PM's discussed changes in the government's policy.  At the end of last week, BSP representatives handed the prime  minister a memorandum setting forth their views. They expect  suggestions and even structural changes in the government to be  made by the end of April. The Socialists suggest the formation  of a Ministry of Privatization, Ministry of the State  Participation in Economy and a structure performing the  functions of the former Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (CNS) -- China civil aviation  industry had been monopolized by the state in terms of  investment, construction and management for the past several  decades. Foreign businessmen have been recently allowed to  engage in this industry by way of Sino-foreign joint investment,  cooperation and buying shares of China's enterprises  specializing in air shipment, the move, considered as an  important measure of reform in this sector, will greatly promote  the development of this industry.    "The Circular on Policies Related to Foreign Investment in  Civil Aviation Industry" recently jointly issued by the Civil  Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the Chinese Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation says that in line with  the principle of putting the state's investment in a dominant  place, foreign businessmen are allowed to conditionally engage  in investment in and running of civil aviation industry in China  in ways of making joint investment or cooperation in  construction of airports (excluding those airports used both for  military and civil purposes), runways, taxi-ways, aprons,  terminal buildings, hotels and restaurants at airports and food  and fuel items for aviation. In these jointly-funded entities,  more than 51 percent of their total registered capital must be  controlled by the Chinese side and their chairmanships of the  board of directors and posts of general managers must be chaired  by personnel from the Chinese side.    It is reported that at present investment in and management  over the air traffic control system in China has been still  monopolized by the state and no foreign airport authorities and  aviation manufacturers are allowed to set up enterprises for  aviation transportation in the country.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: UK must form a long-term energy policy Sir, On June 21 you reported that British Coal expects to close within the next year some of the 19 pits previously regarded as 'core pits' ('Key pits face closure threat'). On June 23 private mining companies were quoted as describing the government's plans to privatise British Coal as being little more than a 'farce'. Both reports illustrate the government's failure to develop a long-term national energy policy which recognises the need to make best use of all Britain's energy resources, including coal. The UK is fortunate in having access to the four principal sources of energy for generating electricity: gas, oil, nuclear power and coal. We see little sense in creating a domestic energy market in which coal is effectively 'priced out', thereby wiping out the massive past investment in this strategic resource. The government has said that private mining companies are free to bid for the pits that British Coal no longer requires. But it has done nothing to increase the market for coal; nor has it got round to repealing the legislation which bars such companies from operating mines which employ more than 150 men underground. In such circumstances it is hardly surprising that private companies have been reluctant to bid. And those that do may see it merely as an asset stripping exercise. If the government were serious about throwing a life-line to the 'reprieved' pits it would have ensured that a legislative framework was in place which would at least allow them to function under private ownership before it put them up for sale. We can only hope that its privatisation bill will be thought out more carefully or, in five years, we may have no deep mining industry left.

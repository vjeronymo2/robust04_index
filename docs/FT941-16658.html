			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading An uncertain opening in the derivatives market was turned to strength by the welcome re-appearance of US buyers following confirmation that the US employment figures for December were much better than feared, writes Terry Byland. The March contract rose very strongly on the news, driven by demand from several of the best-known US securities firms. At best, the contract was at a 30 point premium to cash and there was considerable arbitraging between futures and equities. At the close, March stood at 3,465, still a 20-point premium to cash the and 7 on the fair value premium. Volume was heavy at 17,709 contracts. In traded options, where turnover increased to 54,739 contracts, the FT-SE traded 13,717 on the renewed interest in the blue chip issues, against only 9,801 on Thursday when investors favoured the smaller stocks. The Euro FT-SE at 9,723 contracts was also busy.</p>

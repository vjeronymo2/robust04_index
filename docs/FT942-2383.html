			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Nissan personnel director to quit Mr Peter Wickens, personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is to leave the company. Mr Wickens, who is also a board member, is credited with moulding the shape of industrial relations and practices at Nissan's Pounds 900m UK plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. He joined the Japanese carmaker in October 1984 as the first British employee of its Sunderland plant. A former industrial-relations manager at Ford, he jettisoned most industrial relations practices at Nissan, substituting team-working and flexibility. He instituted a controversial single-union agreement with the AEEU engineering union, as well as 'flat' management structures and single status for all employees. Last autumn he implemented an 'agreed separation' policy - shedding jobs without redundancies. He will leave the company early next year.</p>

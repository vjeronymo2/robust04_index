			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / German support fails to halt franc's decline THE Bundesbank intervened in international currency markets yesterday in an attempt to support the French franc which came under attack in the European exchange rate mechanism. Heavy selling of the franc pushed it below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, less than two centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. The franc closed in London at FFr3.416, around its lowest level since the beginning of the year, compared with last Friday's close of FFr3.399. In late trading in New York, the French currency stood at FFr3.4145. As well as intervention by the German central bank, the franc's fall prompted a statement of support from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. He said the fundamentals of the French economy were still healthy and confirmed the strength of Franco-German co-operation in monetary policy. Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of finance ministers, Mr Waigel said further cuts in German interest rates were both possible and desirable. The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday, but analysts discounted the prospect of a cut in rates unless pressure on the franc became more acute. They said the franc had been weakened by pessimistic reports about the French economy. A report last week by Insee, the national statistics office, forecast that gross domestic product would fall 0.7 per cent this year and that the jobless rate would rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of December. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, said yesterday that maintaining the D-Mark-franc exchange rate was an 'absolute imperative', describing the current parity as 'the backbone of the construction of Europe'. But economists said they expected the weakness of the franc to continue as investors moved short and long-term funds out of the French currency. Nevertheless, analysts in Paris were sanguine about the franc's prospects. 'We are in for a bumpy ride,' said a currency expert at a French bank. 'But the franc has withstood several crises and the government cannot afford to retreat on its commitment to the current ERM parity.' A survey by Idea, the London-based financial information company, showed that 40 per cent of dealers expect the franc to be devalued before the year-end.

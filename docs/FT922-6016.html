			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore pays Pounds 15m for shopping centre Frogmore Estates, the property company, has bought a shopping centre in Hertfordshire from Norwich Union for Pounds 15.2m. The 73,000 sq ft Spires Shopping Centre in Barnet, which was opened about three years ago, has a rent roll of Pounds 1.64m, giving Frogmore a yield of 10.8 per cent. Five empty shops will increase the annual income to about Pounds 1.8m when let. The deal brings Frogmore's spending this year to over Pounds 40m. It said it was increasing its weighting in retail property, which it believed would be the first sector to recover. Frogmore, which fought off a takeover bid a year ago, said its ability to buy on historically high initial yields vindicated its earlier policy of eliminating borrowings by selling property.</p>

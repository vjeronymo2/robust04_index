			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Lei: "Talent Pooled To Bolster Nuclear Suppliers"] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, China's leading supplier of nuclear power  generating equipment, has banded together the city's strongest  scientific and technological talent to add impetus to the  country's nuclear industry.    The Professional Committee of Nuclear Power Equipment, under  the Shanghai Institute of Atomic Science and Technology, has  recruited 265 individuals and 29 groups as members.    The group members are large and medium-sized enterprises  that  make equipment for nuclear power stations, including the  Shanghai Boiler Factory, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and  the Shanghai No 1 Machine Tool Works.    "The Professional Committee is expected to reinforce local  academic research on civil nuclear energy and to supply local  manufacturers with more advanced technology," said Wang Zurong,  the committee's director.    Wang is also managing director of the Shanghai Nuclear Power  Office.    Local manufacturers have seen the domestic market blossom as  provinces like Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and  Guangdong are planning to build nuclear power stations.    The committee's members are divided into seven smaller  groups  according to profession to facilitate their work, according to  sources from the committee.    "One of the most important groups in the committee is the QA  (quality assurance) group. To all nuclear power station  equipment suppliers, nuclear safety is the first consideration,"  Qian Huimin, secretary general of the committee, said in an  interview.    The city has invested nearly 200 million yuan ($23 million)  in buildings for equipment suppliers and has loaned the local  industry more than 13 million yuan ($1.5 million) for scientific  and technological research.    Another 200 million yuan will be used to technically  renovate  some 20 suppliers in the next two years, according to the  Shanghai Nuclear Power Office.    Shanghai plans to continue supplying equipment for the  second  phase of the Qinshan Project in Zhejiang and has contracted with  Pakistan to build parts for a 300-megawatt nuclear power station.</p>

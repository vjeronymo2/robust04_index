			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The myth of 90-day accounts - Scheherazade Daneshkhu on building society rates HIGH RETURNS and convenience are usually the two most sought after attributes of a bank or building society account. Depositors are required to follow a few simple principles to obtain the higher returns - the larger the amount of money deposited and the longer the capital is left untouched, the greater the rewards. Ninety-day accounts operate on this principle. The building society finds it cheaper to administer accounts which do not have a large number of transactions. In theory, they are able to pass this saving on to the depositor in the form of higher rates. The snag for many investors is that the higher returns come at the expense of reduced accessibility to their money. Unless 90-days notice is given, the saver suffers 90 days loss of interest. This is not a problem if money is not needed in a hurry, but three months can be a long time to plan ahead and foresee financial needs. And if a good return becomes available, for example, in the form of a competitive guaranteed product, it can be a big disadvantage to forego the 90-days interest in order to be able to get funds out before the offer closes. But is it even true that 90-day accounts pay the highest returns? The tables show the highest rates currently available on 90-day, postal and instant-access accounts, on amounts of Pounds 500, Pounds 1,000, Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 10,000. A comparison of the rates on postal and 90-day accounts shows that 90-day accounts do not always pay the highest rates. Birmingham Midshires matches the 7.25 per cent gross rate paid by Scarborough's 90-day account on Pounds 500. The best of the 90-day rates are higher on Pounds 1,000 than the postal accounts, but the postal accounts beat 90-day rates on amounts of Pounds 5,000, Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 25,000. For example, the two highest 90-day rates on Pounds 10,000 are Halifax (7.75 per cent gross) and Alliance &amp; Leicester (7.60 per cent gross). Both rates are beaten by postal account rates on not only the Pounds 10,000 tier but also on Pounds 5,000. Skipton and North of England are paying 8.35 per cent gross and 8.20 per cent gross on Pounds 5,000, while rates on Pounds 10,000 are 8.45 per cent gross at North of England and 8.3 per cent gross from Northern Rock. As postal accounts are administered centrally, costs are lower than for accounts operated through a branch network. Low overheads and a smaller staff allow competitive rates to be passed on to the depositor. The accounts are advertised as instant-access, meaning that notice does not have to be given for withdrawals, but they are not instant in terms of ready accessibility to the cash. With most postal accounts, it will normally take a week before you have the funds. If you send off a withdrawal request on a Monday, the earliest you could hope to receive a cheque is on Wednesday. It will then take at least three working days for the cheque to clear, so usually you will not be able to draw cash until the following Monday. However, it should be remembered that most instant access branch accounts also require notification for large withdrawals. The tables show that rates on 90-day accounts are higher than those on instant-access branch accounts. The rates are 1.25 percentage points higher on all tiers, apart from Pounds 1,000, where the difference is fractionally higher at 1.45 points. Those with 90-day deposits should check the rates they are being paid and consider moving over to postal accounts which will allow them higher rates and much faster access to their money.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Highest 90 day rates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Building society              Account         Minimum        Rate                                           deposit (pounds)    (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Scarborough               Scarb' Ninety 3       500          7.25 Tipton &amp; Coseley         Investment share       500          7.00 Teachers                    Minster 90        1,000          7.45 Scarborough               Scarb' Ninety 3     1,000          7.25 Teachers                    Minster 90        5,000          7.45 Scarborough               Scarb' Ninety 3     5,000          7.25 Halifax                    Premium Extra     10,000          7.75## Alliance &amp; Leic              Bonus 90        10,000          7.60### Scarborough               Scarb' Ninety 3    25,000          8.50 Alliance &amp; Leic              Bonus 90        25,000          7.90###  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moeyfacts. ##Bonus of 0.25 per cent if no withdrawals in a year. ###Bonus of 0.5 per cnet if no withdrawals in a year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Highest postal rates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Building society              Account         Minimum        Rate                                           deposit (pounds)    (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham M'shires         First class         500          7.25 Scarborough                  First post         500          6.80 Norwich &amp; Peterboro'         Postmaster       1,000          7.00 Bradford &amp; Bingley         Direct Premium     1,000          6.55 Skipton                      Money Post       5,000          8.35 North of Eng                 Edinburgh        5,000          8.20 North of England             Edinburgh       10,000          8.45 Northern Rock                Go Direct       10,000          8.30* Skipton                      Money Post      25,000          8.60 Northern Rock                Go Direct       25,000          8.55*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts. *Rate fixed to 1/4/93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Highest instant access rates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Building society              Account         Minimum        Rate                                           deposit (pounds)    (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Portman                   Instant access        500          6.00 City &amp; Met                   City Gold          500          5.75 Portman                   Instant access      1,000          6.00 Teachers                   Minster Spire      1,000          5.80 Teachers                   Minster Spire      5,000          6.20 Portman                   Instant access      5,000          6.00 National Counties         Instant access     10,000          6.50 Chelsea                   Instant Option     10,000          6.25 Manchester                  Super Access     25,000          7.25 Birm M'shires             Quantum Instant    25,000          6.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

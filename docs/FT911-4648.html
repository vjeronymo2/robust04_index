			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): The dollar's turnaround - A look at foreign bonds TRADITIONALLY equity-oriented and domestically-minded UK fund managers are becoming more active in foreign bond markets, but their participation is still low compared with pension funds elsewhere in Europe. Last year, concern about the effects of economic recession on equity performance persuaded more fund managers to invest in fixed income products. The strong performance of foreign bond markets, especially for sterling-based investors, in the first quarter of 1991 has increased their readiness to buy foreign bonds. According to the WM Company's UK Pension Fund Service, the proportion of UK pension fund assets in the foreign bond market rose to 3 per cent in 1990 from 2 per cent in 1989. Yet only two-thirds of the funds surveyed hold any foreign bonds at all, so funds with foreign bonds hold around 7 per cent on average. But, even including fixed-rate gilts, straight bonds accounted for less than 10 per cent of pension funds' assets in total at the end of last year. Nevertheless, the research showed Pounds 2.9bn of fresh investment in foreign bonds last year, funded partly by an outflow of Pounds 1.5bn from the UK gilts market. Figures for 1991 are not yet available, but some analysts estimate that the net shift will not be substantial, considering the dramatic effect of currency movements on bond returns since the end of last year. The recent strong performance of equity markets may well reverse some of the shift into fixed-income products prompted by the prospect of a long and deep recession. 'It is time that UK pension funds assessed what is the proper bond element in a portfolio and how to constitute it,' says Mr Howard Flight, managing director of Guinness Flight Global Asset Management. While most international bond fund managers see European currencies as one bloc, following sterling's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, UK pension fund managers remain very domestically oriented by comparison. The increase seen in pension funds' exposure to foreign bonds since the bull market for bonds started near the end of last year has come partly from cash, where many funds found a safe haven in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August. In addition, there was some movement out of equities, since the bonds perform better in recession than stocks, and also out of the gilts market. Because of the strong performance of bond markets across the board during the first quarter, the most crucial decision for fund managers was on currency rather than the bond market. Though Spain and Italy provided the highest returns measured in local currency, according to the JP Morgan government bond index, the strengthening of the dollar had a dramatic effect on returns for UK-based funds. Consequently, the largest shift since the end of last year was from underweight to overweight positions in dollar securities, reflecting, in large part, the dollar's turnaround in the foreign exchange market. There are two different approaches to investing in foreign bonds. One is to view currency and bond markets as two separate components. Fund managers who adopt this approach may take one position in a currency and a conflicting position in the bond market. Thus, some managers are now overweight in dollars in the foreign exchange market, but underweight in dollar bonds. The currency position may have been taken in the spot foreign exchange market and held on deposit. One fund manager says he has taken a position in French government bonds, a market which he expects to perform well, but has hedged exposure to the franc. Other fund managers - in the UK perhaps the majority - take currency considerations into account when investing in foreign bonds, and do not hedge currency exposure to a significant degree. Those who take a separate view on currencies are generally still overweight in the dollar and underweight in European currencies. Others have stepped back somewhat from the US bond market, which is now widely considered to be quite expensive. In Europe, high-yielding bond markets such as Italy remain in favour. 'The currency decision will become increasingly important, given the high degree of volatility of foreign exchange compared with bond markets,' says Mr David Shaw, director of bonds and currency at Legal and General. In sterling terms, Canadian government bonds posted returns of 16 1/2 per cent in the first quarter, according to Kemper Investment Management Company's Seventeen Markets Database of International Bond Markets. New Zealand was the second best performer, returning 16 1/4 per cent. For fund managers who focus on the most liquid markets, the US market returned a handsome 12 1/4 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STILL BEAT;  </P> <P> ALLEN GINSBERG'S POETRY, SONGS REMAIN ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN  </P> <P> Still anti-authoritarian after all these years, Beat-movement luminary Allen  Ginsberg opened his appearance Friday at Cal State Fullerton with an a cappella  rendition of his "CIA Dope Calypso."  </P> <P> The humorous ditty -- to the tune of "Kingston Town" -- chronicles decades of  alleged U.S. involvement in worldwide drug trafficking, ending with a  recounting of the Reagan/Bush era: "They couldn't sell Congress, so the Contras  sold cocaine."  </P> <P> Ginsberg -- dressed conservatively in a dark jacket and tie, his once-lengthy  beard now neatly trimmed -- battled a crackling sound system and constant  rumbling from a next-door bowling alley to regale a capacity crowd at the  University Center Pub with his poetry and song.  </P> <P> The poet, now 62, was, along with "On the Road" author Jack Kerouac, one of the  central figures of the bohemian Beat movement, which rebeled against the  corruption and materialism they saw in post-World War II America. Ginsberg's  now-classic 1956 poem "Howl" is one of the central statements of the movement,  which set the stage for the rock 'n' roll-led rebellion of the '60s.  </P> <P> On Friday, Ginsberg went from "CIA Dope Calypso" to a sound poem titled "Whom  Bomb?" and on to another song, "Do the Meditation" (which includes the line "I  fought the dharma and the dharma won"). Ginsberg said his practice of  "psychedelic meditation" has supplanted his use of drugs, but still he  chastised the government for driving "educational drugs" -- namely marijuana  and LSD -- out of the marketplace, where they have been replaced by speed,  heroin and crack.  </P> <P> Ginsberg then launched a chronological reading of selected poems, interspersed  with occasional songs. The poet told the university crowd that he wanted to  start with older poems "that you're more familiar with from the Norton  Anthology."  </P> <P> Starting with "Pull My Daisy" (1948), which he wrote with fellow Beat  generation icons Kerouac and Neal Cassady, Ginsberg moved through such works as  "The Archetype Poem" (1950), "A Crazy Spiritual" (1952) and "A Strange New  Cottage in Berkeley," "A Supermarket in California" and "Sunflower Sutra," all  from 1955.  </P> <P> But he skipped his most celebrated work, "Howl," and instead read fragments  from his 1960 poem "Kaddish," a moving account of his mother's long confinement  in a mental institution. "I'd rather introduce those who are familiar with the  flash to the shadow underneath," Ginsberg explained.  </P> <P> Themes of physical decay and of mortality continued in later poems, including  recent works from the 1988 collection "White Shrouds" and several  as-yet-unpublished works. In "Airplane Blues," based loosely on Robert  Johnson's classic "Love in Vain" (which the Rolling Stones popularized),  Ginsberg sang: "The sun's not eternal; that's why there's the blues."  </P> <P> In "The Guest," a bemused Ginsberg detailed a homosexual encounter with a young  admirer, comparing his lover's taut, youthful body with his own sagging flesh.  ("This is pre-AIDS, incidentally," he told the audience Friday.)  </P> <P> Figures from his bohemian past haunt much of the recent poetry Ginsberg read  Friday, especially in poems based on actual dreams. In "I Went to the Movie of  Life" (1987), the poet encounters figures from his past while wandering the  Mississippi Delta at night -- Neal Cassady, old lovers, even members of the  prototypal '60s San Francisco acid-rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service.  </P> <P> "Wily wrinkled wanderers," Ginsberg called them in the poem: "Profound American  dreamers -- I was in their company again." Yet, later in the same poem, "I  wanted to meet someone new."  </P> <P> Ginsberg told of (but didn't read) a recent poem about Kerouac, who died in  1969. Kerouac visited his fellow '50s traveler in a dream to praise a talk he  had given ("The first thing he had approved of in years," Ginsberg said.).  </P> <P> A reading of the unpublished "Written in My Dream by William Carlos Williams"  led to an impromptu lecture by Ginsberg on his fellow New Jersey native, whose  use of vernacular and vivid description were a great influence on Ginsberg and  other Beat poets. Ginsberg recited Williams' "Red Wheelbarrow" from memory and  read his "To Elsie," which was included in the 30th anniversary edition of  "Howl."  </P> <P> Ginsberg read from a series of short poems collectively titled "Don't Grow  Old," largely anecdotal works written in 1976 after the death of his father,  poet Louis Ginsberg. He closed the reading about 10:30 p.m. with a final song,  "Father Death Blues."  </P></p>

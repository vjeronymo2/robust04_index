He stressed:  With regard to development in Gansu and the western region, you  must keep a cool head in acknowledging existing gaps, must not  be outdone, must seize favorable opportunities, must march  courageously, and must speed up development.    While meeting with the deputies from our province, Jiang  Zemin made an enthusiastic speech. He said: Due to the  shortage of time, I was not able to take part in your group  discussion, which is why I have come to call on you today. We  all know that we are, in the final analysis, making concerted  efforts for the prosperity, flourishing, and development of the  entire Chinese nation and the People's Republic of China  regardless of our different nationalities, religions, or  convictions. I often stress that he who has wealth speaks  louder than others. This must not be interpreted as everyone  being incumbent to make a fortune. This is not what I mean.  The people's standard of living must be increased, but this  does not mean that everyone must make a fortune. We must make  our country's economic power strong. In my view, becoming  wealthy means the development of our national economy as a whole  and the overall national power of our country.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: I have visited Gansu twice. My  general impression is that there is a certain gap between the  western region and the coastal areas in economic development.  Gaps have existed among various countries in the world. This  is also the case with the developed capitalist countries. Even  in the United States, there are differences between the east and  west coasts and between the southern and northern regions. Gaps  among them exist. There are definitely gaps among our 30  provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and such gaps  cannot be narrowed within a short period of time.    Jiang Zemin urged the Gansu people's deputies to keep a cool  head in acknowledging such gaps and to never remain content with  lagging behind because of a poor foundation and meager heritage.  They must march forward courageously to attain the economic  development target. In a word, they must reach this target.  With regard to the speed of economic development throughout the  country, the more proper the speed is, the better the results  that can be achieved. If the speed of economic development is  excessive, it will ultimately be slowed down. We will then  suffer great losses. If we fail to develop our economy at a  speed which is obviously achievable through hard work, this also  means losing the favorable opportunity for development.  Therefore, we must seize the favorable opportunity to promote  our economic construction as soon as possible.    Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, accompanied  Jiang Zemin to meet with the Gansu people's deputies.</p>

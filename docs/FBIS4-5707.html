			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The suggestion on  helping North Korean escapees from Siberian gulags settle in  South Korea is a matter officials here increasingly feel was  better left unsaid. Seoul estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 North  Koreans are virtually trapped in logging camps across Siberia,  120 to 170 of whom have escaped and are now seeking asylum in  South Korea.    Officials here are reluctant to even use the word "asylum"  since North Koreans, under South Korea's Constitution, are its  people. "Repatriation is probably a more appropriate word," says  one Foreign Ministry official.    Russia is said to make about 300 million U.S. dollars from  the wood logged at the camps. It gives 100 million dollars  worth of wood to North Korea to pay for labor.    Escapees interviewed anonymously described how they and  others had been deprived of food, beaten mercilessly and killed  when caught trying to break out. A picture showing the chains  binding these loggers set off widespread shudders.    Both Seoul and Moscow are aware of rampant human rights  violations inside the heavily guarded camps, but they have been  unable to find an acceptable solution.    Russia tried to press North Korea to improve conditions at  the camps, threatening to cancel the logging contract that was  to expire at the end of last year. The failure of negotiations,  however, forced Moscow to extend the contract for another six  months.    Seoul had quietly tried to help the camp escapees, asking  Moscow to issue residential permits and let them settle inside  Russia, or look the other way for illegal stayers. But after  stories began appearing in the media, North Korea went on guard  and warned against any meddling by either Seoul or Moscow. In  its latest statement, Pyongyang said it will hold Seoul  responsible for "kidnapping" all loggers found missing in the  future.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, apparently conscious of  Northern sensitivities, said last week he does not intend to  allow repatriation of North Korean loggers at this point. "The  escapees were quietly resettled, some in South Korea. But by  bringing them to the public's attention, we ended up making  North Korea nervous and forcing it to react," said the Foreign  Ministry official.    Even if Seoul boldly decided to accept the loggers, the  problem would not go away but actually worsen. More North  Koreans would try to settle in South Korea, worsening  inter-Korean relations already strained by the nuclear row.  Pyongyang could well accuse Seoul of attempting to absorb North  Korea under the guise of human rights by taking in all of its  people. Then there is the reality that Seoul would have to pay  for the living expenses of the escapees if they were brought  here. All of the 120 to 170 escapees would have to be properly  housed, trained and employed on government money. Officials say  it takes at least 10 years for a North Korean to fully adapt to  South Korea.    Some North Korean loggers are known criminal offenders, and  accepting them would cause social problems, the officials say.  Then there is a question of fairness. Seoul knows of an equal  number of North Koreans in China hoping to settle in South  Korea. Seoul cannot accept the loggers from Siberia while  refusing North Koreans from China.</p>

Commenting on aspects of this programme in Saturday's issue  of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Chief of the General Staff of  Russian Armed Forces Mikhail Kolesnikov noted that the Russian  Defence Ministry is the state customer of work on the  development of ecologically safe technologies for the  destruction (utilisation) of chemical weapons.    According to the general, the Defence Ministry uses the  principles of openness to choose adequate technologies,  discusses, together with representatives from various regions,  sections of the draft programme which are of interest to them.    The ministry actively helps the mass media and scientific  publications in describing various aspects of chemical weapons'  destruction. "The time of taking "hush-hush" decisions has gone  long ago," the general staff chief stressed.    According to Kolesnikov, the production of chemical weapons  in the former Soviet Union was discontinued in 1987 and has  never been resumed. Their stockpiles were not replenished and  not updated.    He stressed that the stockpiles of chemical weapons in  Russia  are under 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxic agents and are housed  at seven arsenals specially equipped for their safe and reliable  storage.    Russia will carry out the destruction of chemical weapons  only at specially built facilities, the location of which will  be determined by a government commission set up by the Russian  president's decision of August 9, 1993, Kolesnikov continued.    In the general's opinion, "the safety of population and  environment is the guiding condition for destruction." For this  purpose, the Defence Ministry closely cooperates with regional  and republican supervision bodies to conduct monitoring of  public health and to take samples from surrounding terrain.    Such work has already been done near the city of Kambarkiy  (Udmurtia), in the Krasnopartizanskiy (Gornyy village) and  Volskiy (Shikhaniy village) districts of the Saratov region.    Skilled medics are invited to participate in this work. The  results of population's medical checkups are reported to regions  where this work is done.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortality and expense risk charge would be a daily net asset charge at an aggregate nominal rate of 1.05% per annum, consisting of approximately .70% for mortality risks and .35% for expense risks. USAA Life will assume a mortality risk arising from its obligation to pay a death benefit prior to the annuity date. The death benefit payable is the greater of (a) the monetary value of the Contract ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the sum of the Contract values invested in the Variable Fund Accounts and in USAA Life's general account) on the date USAA Life receives proof of death or (b) the sum of all premium payments credited to the Contract, less the amount of any withdrawals and less any applicable premium tax. USAA Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity options that involve life contingencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In addition to mortality risks, USAA Life will assume an expense risk because the administrative charges under the Contract, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. In this regard, USAA Life agrees not to raise, for the duration of the Contracts, the daily net asset value charge of 0.10% for administrative expenses and the annual Contract maintenance charge in the amount of $30 per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The order requested by Applicants would apply to the Contracts and also to substantially similar contracts issued by the Account or by any Other Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants propose to assess against the assets of the Account a daily mortality and expense risk charge at an aggregate rate of 1.05% per annum. USAA Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts. USAA Life expects to make a profit from this charge. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. Applicants state that they have reviewed publicly-available information regarding products of other companies, taking into consideration such factors as guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed annuity purchase rates, minimum initial and subsequent premium payments, other contract charges, the manner in which charges are imposed, market sector, investment options under the contracts, and availability to individual qualified and nonqualified plans. Based upon this review, Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of charges determined by industry practice. With respect to any Contracts offered by it, USAA Life will maintain at its principal offices a memorandum setting forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the methodology, and results, of Applicants' comparative review. USAA Life will make this memorandum available to the Commission and its staff upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the expenses and cost assumed, the loss will be borne by USAA Life. Conversely, if the charge deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to USAA Life. USAA Life expects to earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants acknowledge that, in the absence of a specified charge for the costs of distributing the Contracts, all or a portion of any profit realized from the mortality and expense risk charge may be offset by distribution expenses. In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USAA Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by USAA Life at its principal offices and will be made available to the Commission and its staff upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. USAA Life represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that undertakes, in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by a board of trustees, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants submit that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing their administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of their resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed above, Applicants conclude that granting their requested order would be necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No planning in job losses Sir, It is disturbing that such a large company as BT still feels unable to plan its job reduction programme over a period of time and therefore avoid any need for the unpleasantness and bad publicity that goes with compulsory redundancy ('BT plans to shed 50,000 more jobs', August 1). It is particularly noticeable that while Sir Iain Vallance talks of the need for a further 50,000 job losses he suggests no valid reason as to why this might be necessary. One would have thought that with the expansion of telecommunications more rather than less staff might be a more sensible forecast for the medium term. Keith Flett, secretary London HQ branch, Society of Telecom Executives, 38 Mitchley Road, Tottenham, London N17 9HG</p>

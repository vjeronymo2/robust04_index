			<p>BFN     [Text] In a meeting of the extended secretariat of the  Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], chaired by CTC Secretary General  Pedro Ross Leal, it was announced that the Assemblies for  Economic Efficiency will be held in all work collectives  beginning on 15 May.    A recent survey conducted to obtain reaction on the first  assemblies of this type indicated that the assemblies constitute  an important form of participation so that the collectives can  measure their progress in production and services.    During the meeting, Ross insisted on the CTC's role in  supporting the changes and transformations that are necessary  and said that the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency preserve  the spirit of the parliaments in the workplace.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Agriculture Bank Takes Record Farm Deposits"] </F>   [Text] Farmers are saving more money than ever before,  according to the Agricultural Bank of China.    The bank reported record rural deposits of more than 700  billion yuan ($80.4 billion) at the end of last week.    Bank president Ma Yongwei said the bank had taken 90 billion  yuan ($10.3 billion) of personal savings since last December.    Farmers have become richer since the government started  paying them cash instead of IOUs, for their grain and  vegetables, Ma said.    So, rural savings have soared.    "At present, the bank's individual savings are experiencing  a  unprecedented upsurge." Ma said, adding that over the past six  months, the bank had taken 100 billion yuan $11.5 billion) from  individual depositors in the countryside.    The surge in individual savings is good news for the bank,  which, as a leading creditor in rural China, needs the money to  back up government buyers of farm produce during the summer  harvest, Ma said.    "We have pledged that there will be no more IOUs issued to  farmers this summer," he said.    At least 80 per cent of the Agricultural Bank's individual  savings are fixed deposits, which will be mainly used to fund  farm production and grain purchase credits.    And arbitrary levies on farmers are also being brought under  control by the government, further raising farmers' living  standards, he said.    Most farmers now believe that bank savings are the best way  of protecting their assets, the bank said.    The State Information Centre predicts that during the first  half of this year, rural per capita income will grow 9 per cent.    Last year the country's farmers only earned 3.2 per cent  more  than in 1992, while urban residents saw their income rise by  10.2 per cent during the same period.    The gap between rural and urban living standards appears to  be narrowing this year.</p>

He pointed out that investigations were  continuing to find out more about this mystery, particularly as  one of the criminals was still being treated and could not be  questioned because of the current state of his health.    In a statement he delivered today at the Transitional  National Assembly, the minister reviewed the incident at  al-Thawrah mosque and the criminal acts carried out by an armed  group of foreigners. He said that their moves began with an  attack on a police station at Umm Baddah north where they  claimed that they wanted to make a report but then seized  weapons [passage omitted]    In response to questions and requests for clarifications,  the  minister said that notwithstanding the basic principles of  general policy there must be measures for control and regulation  of the procedures relating to arrivals in the country. He  expressed the hope that further investigations would provide  more information about this mysterious incident. He ruled out  that the criminals were targeting Usamah Bin Ladin, proprietor  of the Hijrah company working on the al-Tahaddi road.</p>

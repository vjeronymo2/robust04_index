			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CAPTURING MEMORIES OF A BYGONE LOMITA ON VIDEOTAPE.  </P> <P> Julia Marie Steigh remembers a Lomita without a sheriff's station, park,  library or even a city charter.  </P> <P> Over the years, adding those elements to Lomita changed the small South Bay  city, the 74-year-old resident said.  </P> <P> "The only thing that bothers me about all the changes is we have so much  traffic," she said. "But my husband and I love Lomita and hope to stay here  always."  </P> <P> Steigh recounted 67 years of life in Lomita at a recent meeting of the Lomita  Historical Society. Her testimony was captured on videotape and will become  part of an oral history of Lomita as seen through the eyes of its longtime  residents.  </P> <P> Historical Society President Cindy Beiro said she plans to edit several  interviews together into one videotape when she gets enough material for a  two-hour tape. She also plans to get footage of historical sites in Lomita,  putting together a presentation that is easy to watch and accessible to the  public.  </P> <P> "We are capturing history for the future of our town," she said. "When people  look at these tapes 50 years from now, it's going to blow their minds."  </P> <P> Beiro got the idea while watching 50-year-old footage of the building of  Kiwanis Hall in Lomita. The film was incorporated into a video presentation on  the history of the Lomita-Harbor City Kiwanis Club and showed men in plaid  shirts and baggy overalls building the hall by hand, against a backdrop of open  lots and streets lined with with old Fords.  </P> <P> "I looked at this video of how it was 50 years ago, and I thought it was  unbelievably intriguing. It lives when it's videotaped. People might not take  the time to read about history. But with video, you might have a better  attention span."  </P> <P> Although gathering oral histories is nothing new to historical societies, the  use of videotape is just now becoming established, according to Terri  Schorzman, program manager of a video history project at the Smithsonian  Institution in Washington.  </P> <P> "We are just starting to look at how we can use videotape as historical  documentation," she said. "I think it's a great way to capture a community and  how it developed. You can reach out to a lot of people, because people are so  tuned in to visual media anyway."  </P> <P> City historians in Torrance, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach have embarked on  oral history projects using audiotape and are planning to make use of videotape  in the future. The city of Carson, Harbor College and UCLA also have  collections of oral histories on audiotape.  </P> <P> But videotapes are far more expensive to produce than audiotapes, Schorzman  said. There is practically no limit to how much a city can invest in equipment  and staff to produce archival or broadcast-quality images.  </P> <P> Beiro is offsetting the cost by using talented volunteers to film and produce  the videotapes. The city of Hermosa Beach is trying to line up journalism and  film students to record its oral history.  </P> <P> Steigh was the fourth person to be interviewed by the society. Two former  mayors and a community leader were also videotaped.  </P> <P> Jim Cole, a former mayor and journalist, recalled his days at Narbonne High  School before it was relocated to Harbor City. The building at the Lomita site  became Alexander Fleming Junior High.  </P> <P> One of his most vivid memories is of a day during World War II when a P-38  fighter circled the school and crashed a block away.  </P> <P> "It was the first time war was brought to Lomita," he said. "It crashed in a  victory garden right between two houses. We all ran over there."  </P> <P> He also recounted how Lomita was once a sprawling unincorporated community,  stretching west to the sea, and south over the Palos Verdes Peninsula to where  Marineland used to be. Neighboring cities began annexing portions of the  community and finally drove the city to incorporate in 1964.  </P> <P> "We want details that were never presented in writing," Beiro said. "We have  the fact that it snowed in Lomita one year, and when boats floated down the  streets" during a flood.  </P> <P> Cole addressed that 1948 snowstorm. "Our greatest thrill was throwing snowballs  at the teachers as they rode to school," he recalled.  </P> <P> According to Beiro, Steigh was so nervous about the interview that she asked  that members not be notified of the meeting. Beiro decided to videotape the  interview herself, so her cameraman would not fluster Steigh with directions.  </P> <P> "The women are so shy," Beiro said. "The men will get up there and just go on  and on."  </P> <P> The ordeal over, Steigh let out a sigh of relief and accepted congratulations,  along with a slice of cake. She told society members how the first mayor of  Lomita rode to high school on a horse.  </P> <P> "I was always afraid of horses," she said. "And he used to chase me up and down  the street with that darn horse." BERNICE HIRABAYASHI  </P></p>

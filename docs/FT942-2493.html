			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Property: A French connection - Cadogans's Place HOUSE-HUNTING in France is fun, and a voyage of self-discovery. But do not disdain advice if you want to succeed. It is worth letting yourself be nannied. 'Work through a UK consultant,' advises Sarah Francis at Sifex. She says they are of great use for those who want to be helped through the process, but adds: 'Decide which one you want to go with. If you use several, you will probably end up with the same agents in France showing you the same houses.' There is no extra charge, as such a consultant will split the vendor's fee with the French agent or British agent working in France. Here are some other points to remember: Besides the consultants' and agents' lists, useful magazines are Belles Demeures, Demeures et Chateaux and Le Figaro's Proprietes de France. Advertisements are often in English as well as French. There is a huge range of properties, many of which have been on the market a long time with the price falling gradually. Prices tend to be higher in favourite regions such as Brittany, the Dordogne, Normandy and Provence. When you set out to inspect properties, allow plenty of time; you will not then have to rush for a telephone in the heart of the country to tell the agent you are running late. Remember also that the agent has lunch from 12-2 and be certain to arrive at the agreed hour. 'Never offer the asking price,' says Crabb &amp; Templeton Associates (0225-810 531), a property consultant and financial broker. And make sure at the start that you have enough land if you want a tennis court or swimming pool. Also, inquire what might happen next door. A visit to the mayor will be helpful. Before you settle, get estimates for work that needs doing. An architect or surveyor might not be necessary but the local builder is. Small firms of British builders are now working in France on old houses. If you need a mortgage, says Crabb &amp; Templeton, consider getting one in francs. It will be of the old-fashioned type, with repayment of capital and interest, and probably will run for 15 years. At the moment, mortgage rates in France (about 10.15 per cent ) are higher than the UK. But there is a sporting chance the coming election will spark a devaluation, which would be the moment to exchange sterling. The extras - mainly taxes and fees of the notaire - are likely to be 11 to 13 per cent of the price. 'If you have any worries about the transfer, ask a solicitor who knows France to spend half an hour looking over the documents,' advises Tim Urquhart, of Bristol solicitor Osborne Clarke (0272-230 220); also London, Paris and Lyon. But, in general, he thinks it is not worth instructing a British solicitor for a property below Pounds 100,000. 'If two families are buying together, forming a company (a Societe Civile Immobiliere) is a sound idea,' says Francis. Otherwise, if somebody dies in a car crash the Code Napoleon will apply and the property will be split up. Crabb &amp; Templeton recommends making a will in France as well as the UK. There is also the matter of health insurance. C&amp;T says that form E111, issued in the UK, is fine for holidays, followed by E106 which is good for two years. But, after that, you might not be covered. If you are under 65, the best solution is to start paying into the French social security system, which will look after 75 per cent of your medical bills, with the rest covered by private insurance. But if you are over 65, it is too late to join. And private insurance can be expensive.</p>

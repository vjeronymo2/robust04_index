			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] While reports say that members of the disbanded  Ummah party abroad broke off from the so-called Patriotic  Alliance because of serious differences with the scattered  remnants of the opposition, security organs inside the country  exposed the threads of a conspiracy which was being hatched out  by some members of this disbanded party under the leadership of  al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. Security sources say they had been  monitoring this group for some time and made arrests after  fixing the zero hour. Following confessions by members of the  group, the security sources said the group had planned to  assassinate well-known personalities and to blow up some vital  installations. [passage omitted].    But there are other sides to this issue, namely the  intelligence of foreign states, which wish to see the day when  Sudan drowns in a sea of blood. Another aspect is the scattered  remnants of the opposition abroad which are linked to these  foreign intelligence organs and which are competing to carry out  activities inside the country, whatever these may be, in order  to justify obtaining funds from the financing quarters.    According to the confessions of those caught, that is  Brigadier Retired 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah, former security adviser,  Hamad 'Umar Baqadi, member of the dissolved Ummah Party's  Political Bureau and one called Seyf al-Din Sa'id, in charge of  security and information in the dissolved party, their contacts  with foreign quarters in Khartoum have not ended. Whether they  are instigating these quarters to finance sabotage operations or  whether those quarters are the instigators is immaterial.  Ultimately the result is the same, namely to drown the country  in a sea of blood and to sabotage vital installations. In any  case, the only ones to benefit are those foreign quarters.

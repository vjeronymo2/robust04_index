			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Imro admits failings over Maxwell: Regulator's own report sharply critical over absence of risk assessment procedures from which more than Pounds 400m was siphoned off before the death of Mr Robert Maxwell - has prompted a sharply self-critical report by the investment management industry's own watchdog. According to the confidential report, which is expected to be delivered to the government, Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is believed to admit that it failed to set up any proper risk assessment procedures to identify 'problem cases'. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, earlier this year asked Imro, whose members manage Pounds 300bn in pension funds, to review its oversight of Bishopsgate Investment Management. BIM was the Maxwell-owned fund manager which was apparently the instrument of the pension funds theft. Imro allowed it to operate under the more lax regulatory status given to in-house pension scheme fund managers. News that Imro has been critical of its own performance as a supervisor came as it emerged that two prominent City firms should have suspected for over a year before Mr Maxwell's death that they had been used in the disappearance of securities under their control, according to a writ filed in the High Court. Imro was set up in 1987 along with other City bodies to regulate relationships between clients and finance business. It was heavily attacked by a committee of MPs for its 'comic' and 'inadequate' performance in the Maxwell pension fund scandal. Imro's report is likely to encourage the 32,000 Maxwell company pensioners to press for government compensation. The internal assessment by a member of the Imro staff is understood to have concluded that the initial decision to admit the Maxwell fund to Imro supervision in 1988 was reasonable in the light of the knowledge available at the time and because 1,200 schemes had had to be assessed in a short time. The report is, however, critical of the fact that the first visit to check the working of the Maxwell scheme did not happen until late 1990 and that it seemed to have been a routine affair. The report's main criticism - already leading to changes in the way Imro views its work - is that there was no system for identifying pension funds in need of closer supervision. It is likely that Imro will try to develop a more investigative edge, perhaps by increasing resources and strengthening the staff. The initial plan was that the document would go to the government and eventually be published as a parliamentary paper. It may now be submitted as evidence to the independent inquiry on pensions announced by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary. Mr Lilley insisted that the Pounds 2.5m in temporary, emergency funding to help pensioners of Mirror Group Newspapers, announced by the government on Monday, would be adequate. No government, he said, could agree to underwrite the pensions of current and deferred pensioners. Speaking in a Commons debate last night, he responded sympathetically to the suggestion that pension contributors should be made holders of their contributions.

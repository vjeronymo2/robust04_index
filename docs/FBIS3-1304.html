			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The "disappearance" of  25kg of highly enriched uranium from South Africa's aborted  nuclear bomb programme could not be ascribed to theft or a  secret sale but to allowable chemical process losses, Armscor's  [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] Executive Manager  Tielman de Waal said on Wednesday [23 March].    He told a media briefing -- a year after the announcement  that South Africa would terminate its nuclear bomb capability  and destroy seven bombs, six of them completed -- that  international nuclear energy inspectors from Vienna had  investigated the recorded 25kg deficiency and ascribed it to  normal losses resulting from the chemical processes which the  material had been subjected to.    The highly enriched uranium extracted from the devices and  stored in South Africa could be used as medical isotopes. Worth  about R300 million [rand], it was a valuable national asset.    Mr de Waal said destruction of the devices was continuing  and  the metal parts, which had already been sawn up, would be sawn  into smaller parts and melted in furnaces in the next three  months.    To his knowledge none of the technicians associated with the  project had sold their skills abroad.    Mr de Waal said South Africa never tested any of its nuclear  bombs, but the head of Armscor's missiles department Deon Smith  said there was no doubt they would have worked.    A Japanese television researcher who attended the briefing  is  producing a programme drawing parallels between South Africa's  nuclear disarmament programme and North Korea's nuclear  programme which is seen as a threat to Japan.</p>

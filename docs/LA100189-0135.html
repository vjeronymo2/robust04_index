			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> IT'S TIME TO RETHINK USE OF DEADLY FORCE AGAINST THOSE FLEEING POLICE  </P> <P> On Sept. 19, Ernest Nunez was killed by a shotgun blast while fleeing from  police officers in Santa Ana. The shotgun pellets entered his back and the back  of his head, as one would expect in the case of flight without confrontation.  </P> <P> Nunez apparently had committed a felony and continued running away from  pursuing officers despite repeated orders to halt, satisfying (under English  common law) the two conditions necessary to justify killings by police  officers.  </P> <P> Common law was the basis for Section 196 of the California Penal Code when it  was enacted in 1872. It states: "Homicide is justifiable when committed by  public officers . . . in arresting persons charged with felony, and who are  fleeing from justice." The wording of that law has not changed in all the years  since enactment, and up until 1977 it was interpreted literally to mean that an  officer was justified in shooting any fleeing felon -- even when the felony  consisted simply of stealing a dog, avocados or nuts of relatively modest  value.  </P> <P> But in that year, the Court of Appeal in San Francisco construed that law to  mean that deadly force could be used by police officers only if the felony in  question was a violent ("atrocious") one that could lead to death or serious  injury, or there remained a serious risk to the officer or another person. That  became, and remains, the law throughout the state since there was no contrary  ruling by another appeals court or by the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The perspective was given nationwide force in 1985 when the U.S. Supreme Court  declared unconstitutional all state laws that followed codified simple common  law requirements, and adopted a standard similar to that of California.  </P> <P> Therefore, when it appears that an officer has shot a fleeing suspect who  apparently has not committed a life-threatening felony, one typically finds  such explanations by the officer as "The suspect reached for something in a  glove compartment or in his (or her) pocket," or "The hands of the suspect  moved suspiciously about his (or her) waist." If investigators, prosecutors or  jurors accept the explanation, there is justification, meaning no crime was  committed by the officer.  </P> <P> Furthermore, there is a tendency on the part of all three groups to believe the  officer -- there is, after all, a widespread sympathy with the travails of the  police in the non-minority population, and it is easy to imagine that the  police officer did perceive a furtive movement or a threatening stance.  </P> <P> That orientation toward sympathetic understanding is perhaps most noticeable in  the case of investigators from offices of district attorneys (on the "roll-out"  teams) who are, almost without exception, former police officers.  </P> <P> Consequently, very few criminal charges ever are filed against officers who  have shot citizens, and only some of those lead to convictions. Incidentally,  while juries are unlikely to find officers criminally liable, they are likely  to award large sums to the survivors of police shootings and the relatives of  non-survivors. These assessments are against taxpayers rather than officers.  </P> <P> Criminal action, though an intimidating threat in theory, thus is not much of a  controlling force in actual operation. What other means of control are there?  One begins to think of a possible need for more control in Orange County on  considering the substantial escalation of officer-involved shootings within its  boundaries in recent years. That escalation occurs in the context of a 1986  study that reported a 50% decrease in killings by police officers in 50 of our  largest cities over a 14-year period in which the weaponry of criminals became  more and more sophisticated. Moreover, the decrease in killings by the police  occurred along with an even larger reduction in the number of police officers  killed -- that is, reduction in shootings by officers has not been associated  with greater risk to officers.  </P> <P> Studies have shown two effective modes of controlling police deadly force. Both  are protective of the well-being of officers and the values of society. The  first method involves a carefully developed departmental policy statement  presenting acceptable departmental procedure, accompanied by a strict  enforcement attitude on the part of police officials, particularly the chief.  </P> <P> The second is a comprehensive training approach based on an attitude of  protection of life -- all life -- rather than on the archaic "officer survival"  mentality. It is worth noting that violations of departmental policy mentioned  in the first method are dealt with by administrative sanctions rather than  criminal charges, varying from written reprimand through suspension to  dismissal. In California, officers generally are well-insulated from abuse of  such administrative control by the legal and political advocacy of their strong  associations and by the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act of  1976.  </P> <P> Many cities have revised policy and procedures to control shootings by police  only after the occurrence of riots or near-riots in their minority communities  (where such shootings predominantly occur), or the awards of large sums in  response to claims and lawsuits.  </P> <P> Of course, there are many people, particularly among those in law enforcement,  who do not believe in control of police deadly force beyond the limits set in  common law. They believe that if a person commits a more serious crime and  refuses to stop on orders from a police officer, he or she deserves to be  killed. To them, more shootings and killings are indications that the police  are doing a better job.  </P> <P> However appropriate this sentiment may have been in the context of the society  of 18th-Century England, or even the society of a generation ago in the United  States, it is markedly out of step with the broad concerns for human life and  welfare that are pervasive forces in this country today.  </P> <P> Recognizing and accepting those concerns alongside the costs of excessive use  of deadly force in terms of the building resentments among minority citizens  and the settlement of claims and suits, it seems clear that action is called  for at this time. The escalation in shootings and killings by the police in  Orange County may be a sign that the system is not operating in the best  interests of society.  </P></p>

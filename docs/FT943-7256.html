			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: AIB may enter the bidding for HMC Interest from other mortgage lenders in acquiring Household Mortgage Corporation appears to be widening with Allied Irish Banks, the Irish Republic's largest banking group, now expected to be among the bidders. Through a subsidiary, AIB has a stake of about 7 per cent in HMC, which has a residential mortgage book of Pounds 1.5bn. Yesterday AIB would only say that it was watching the sale closely as a shareholder. Other potential bidders are thought to include a number of building societies, notably Yorkshire and Birmingham Midshires. HMC, the UK's largest centralised lender, said last month that it was seeking a buyer, and appointed Baring Brothers to manage the sale. Bidders have been asked to submit indicative bids in early September. HMC will then draw up a shortlist of those who will be able to make a revised bid after closer inspection of the loan book. The process is expected to take three or four months. One difficulty for HMC may be that potential buyers are more interested in acquiring the mortgage book alone than in buying the company as an ongoing organisation. Another factor is that the market in mortgage books is changing, particularly since Halifax Building Society's announcement that it was negotiating to buy the Pounds 1.5bn UK mortgage business of Banque Nationale de Paris. Some potential bidders suspect that the prices at which mortgage books are available may be too high.</p>

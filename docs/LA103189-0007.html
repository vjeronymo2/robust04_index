			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNT ALBERTO MARONE CINZANO; CHAIRMAN OF VERMOUTH FIRM  </P> <P> Count Alberto Marone Cinzano, 60, chairman of the noted vermouth and Spumante  aperitif firm. The Cinzano family's labels date to 1757, when the aromatic  liquor that years later was called vermouth first was produced in the back room  of a small wine shop in Italy. The family's sparkling white wine, Spumante,  became a major part of Cinzano's exports after World War II. Spanish police  said Cinzano died in a crash near Cordoba on Friday when his car failed to  negotiate a turn. He was said to have been en route to join Spanish royalty in  a hunting party.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Slovak coalition and opposition dealt with the  first hundred days of the government's rule in today's "Kroky"  [Steps] TV program. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik pointed out  that the functioning of a parliamentary democracy requires a  stable structure of political parties, which is an important  prerequisite for political stability. According to him, the  coming elections can also play an important role from the point  of view of sharpening the profile of the political scene. Jozef  Moravcik stated that the Left is forming well and that the Right  of the political spectrum is also clear. However, he said that  the situation is difficult in the center, where a rather  complicated development can yet be expected.    Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia, described the coalition government as a broad-based  experiment that cannot be maintained over the longer term. He  said of Jozef Moravcik's Cabinet that it is heading for economic  ruin in going back to a given macroeconomic policy, that it is  incompetent in the financial sphere, and that it is coping badly  with privatization.</p>

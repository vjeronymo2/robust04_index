			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Violation notice'' is defined as any written notification from any governmental entity advising of violations of the Act or any other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny issuance of a permit in accordance with the criteria contained in &sect;773.15(b) of the regulations. The type of written notification is broadly defined to include a letter, memorandum, legal or administrative pleading, or other written communication. Consistent with the provisions of &sect;773.15(b), the term includes notification of a violation of the Act, any Federal rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, a State program, or any Federal or State law, rule, or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection in connection with a surface coal mining operation. It includes, but is not limited to, a notice of violation; an imminent harm cessation order; a failure-to-abate cessation order; a final order, bill, or demand letter pertaining to a delinquent civil penalty; a bill or demand letter pertaining to delinquent abandoned mine reclamation fees; and a notice of bond forfeiture, where one or more violations upon which the forfeiture was based have not been corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773.10 is revised to include the new sections of the AVS-related rules that result in information collection requirements. The revision provides an estimate of the average public reporting burden of four and one-half hours per response for the collection of information under part 773 as such part is revised by these final rules. The section also lists the addresses for OSM and OMB where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 773.15(b)(1) is amended to require the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant. Such information would include that obtained pursuant to &sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information); &sect;773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information); &sect;778.13 (identification of interests); and &sect;778.14 (violation information). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net effect of referencing such provisions in &sect;773.15(b)(1) is to assure that the regulatory authority makes a decision with respect to permit issuance or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control, and violations. Such complete information includes the mandated use of AVS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, in accordance with &sect;773.23, the regulatory authority will follow the procedures and standards set forth in &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.25 in deciding whether to issue the permit under &sect;773.15(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM has also decided to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence of a failure-to-abate cessation order (FTACO), a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation (NOV) is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application that such violation is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In addition, OSM has also amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) to provide that any permits issued incident to such presumption and certification will be conditionally issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773.20 is amended by the insertion of a new paragraph (b)(2), which makes the provisions of proposed &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory authority makes determinations with respect to improvidently issued permits. In this context, &sect;773.25 is applicable when a regulatory authority determines whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time that it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, and whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The insertion of the language referring to &sect;773.25 has the effect of assuring that the standards, responsibilities, and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.25 are consistently applied to permit issuance and to determinations regarding improvident permit issuance. Such an approach enhances the fairness of the permitting process and the prospect for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum standards. In one respect, however, the improvident permit issuance process will differ from the permit issuance process. In the improvident permit issuance process, prior to permit suspension or rescission, the permittee will be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. In the permit issuance process, prior to permit denial, the applicant will not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

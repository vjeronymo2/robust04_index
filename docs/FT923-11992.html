			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / OECD jobless total heads for 10-year high UNEMPLOYMENT in the industrialised countries is expected to rise to 30m in 1992, its highest level since 1983, and will not start falling significantly until well into 1993, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The rise in OECD unemployment from 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent since 1990 has been less severe than following the second oil-price shock in 1979 - except in Australia, Finland and Sweden - 'but still represents a disappointing reversal following several years of falling unemployment', said the organisation. Unemployment is expected to remain at 9.4 per cent in the EC until 1993; in the US it is expected to rise to 7.1 per cent this year before falling to 6.5 per cent next year. The OECD, in its annual Employment Outlook, reiterated that OECD labour ministers should not be tempted to reverse recent moves away from passive support for the unemployed to active measures that improve the self-sufficiency of individuals and the functioning of labour markets. Wage growth slowed the most in North America, Scandinavia and Australia where some of the fastest rises in unemployment have been occurring. Labour productivity growth in the OECD held up in 1991 despite the fall in economic activity. In the UK the rise in unit labour costs is expected to fall to 3.5 per cent this year and 2 per cent next year. However, the OECD finds little evidence of greater wage flexibility as a result of the European Monetary System. The OECD highlights several peculiarities of the recession, including a large rise in white-collar unemployment and, consequently, the narrowing of regional unemployment differences (except in Canada and France). The OECD also points out that a high proporeen in non-standard employment - mainly part-time - which are less advantageous than permanent, full-time, jobs. Other points highlighted in the report include: Continuing high 'non-employment' rates, averaging almost 50 per cent for women and 25 per cent for men over the 1980s. Reductions in unemployment have often occurred at the cost of higher inactivity - or vice versa. Over the 1980s relatively few countries lowered both labour force inactivity and unemployment. Female labour force participation rates rose during the 1980s, but in most countries less rapidly than in the previous decade. A sharp decline in the labour force participation rate of the over 55s, representing an increasing waste in labour potential. Twenty years ago, in most OECD countries between 35 and 50 per cent of men over 55 were in the labour force, now the figure is between 20 and 35 per cent. Japan remains exceptionally high at 60 per cent and Italy at the other extreme on 11 per cent. The OECD is critical of this development and says pension and social security arrangements should be reviewed to give older people greater flexibility. After a long-term decline, self-employment has grown to one in eight of the non-agricultural workforce, reflecting not only the development of entrepreneurship but also structural changes in labour markets. Commenting on the rise of unemployment in Central and eastern Europe to 4m earlier this year, the OECD says a further wave of job-shedding is to be expected. This may weaken the social consensus for market-based reforms although unemployment social insurance schemes now exist in all countries. The implementation of active labour market policies has been limited by budgetary restraints and should be further decentralised.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: TAC bows to banks and officials - Negotiations with BAe IN TAIWAN the business of building aircraft has become too important to be left to businessmen. Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), the company set up two years ago by Taipei to launch one of Asia's leading manufacturing economies into the commercial aviation industry, is being elbowed aside by the country's banks and government officials. Its president and chairman will be replaced within weeks by nominees from creditor banks, whether or not the protracted talks with its potential partner, British Aerospace, succeed in establishing a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft. Although TAC's chairman is taking part in the talks, the state-owned Chiao Tung Bank, which leads the banking consortium that plans to lend money to the joint venture, has taken centre stage in the talks. Mr Denny Ko, TAC's outgoing president, is not even attending this week's event though he signed the original joint venture contract with Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, in January. US-educated Mr Ko acknowledges that he was 'perhaps naive' in believing the fine-tuning of the contract would take just three months. He says that the Taiwanese establishment tends to regard him as too pro-western to take any further part. But he admits the banks have some justification for their unhappiness about the way the deal has been conducted. 'There was a breakdown in communications' between TAC and the banks backing the project during the spring,' he says. That breakdown led this week to a redrafting of a series of clauses in the original contract with the intention of assuaging the fears of the banking consortium members that the joint venture might lose money. Those changes being negotiated this week are designed to: Ensure that assets BAe is putting into the joint venture called Avro can be used as collateral against bank loans. Details of the loans have dominated talks this week. Reduce the banks' exposure to risk in the leasing of aircraft - Taiwanese banks are relatively unfamiliar with leasing. Determine the nature of a market study that could lead to the production a new model of aircraft, the RJX. Strengthen BAe's commitment to transferring design and manufacturing skills to Taiwan - a senior government official on Monday said the original contract was 'loose' on the subject. This last point was underlined yesterday by Taiwan's defence minister, who was reported to have called for more technology know-how to be transferred to Taiwan as part of a separate military aircraft deal with Dassault, the French aircraft maker. The now sidelined Mr Ko can only watch Taiwan's banking and political establishment take direct control of the talks, indicating how determined it is to make Taiwan a force in civil aircraft manufacture. While BAe wants Asian manufacturing and markets to stem the losses in its regional aircraft operation, for Taiwan the logic of the deal is more complex and no less compelling. The country has a well-developed military aerospace industry that grew out of its political isolation. In the wake of western countries' recognition in the early 1970s of the communist government in Beijing, Taiwan was unable to buy advanced military aircraft from western countries. In the 1970s it began a programme to develop its own supersonic fighter aircraft. But just as production got under way last year, France and the US decided to risk Beijing's wrath by allowing the sale of General Dynamics F-16 and Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Taiwan. Taiwan's air force promptly halved its order for the indigenous fighter, leaving 200-plus local aerospace manufacturers and the design and manufacturing arm of the defence ministry with spare capacity. What is unfortunate for BAe, is there is no shortage of western suitors willing to take work-hungry Taiwanese partners. The Taipei annual aerospace exhibition, which finished on Sunday, was dominated by huge pavilions of French and US companies. BAe was represented by a small stand under the name of Avro. See Lex</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing to list as hazardous waste solids and spent filters from the production of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (K140) and the off-specification and discarded product (U408) based on their projected toxicities from structural activity studies, and potential exposure to these chemicals. EPA's decision to propose these additional hazardous waste listings represents a determination by the Agency that the wastes identified meet the criteria for listing as hazardous wastes presented in 40 CFR 261.11. Specifically, based on available evidence, the Agency concludes that 2,4,6-tribromophenol is similar in toxicity to its chlorinated analogue. EPA is proposing that these wastes from organobromines production be listed as hazardous and subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 124, 262&hyph;266, 268, 270, and 271 since they are capable of posing a threat to human health and the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise handled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the data collected by the Agency during the recent organobromines industry study and the unique conditions of the industry regarding limitations to future expansion, EPA believes there is justification for a no-list determination for wastes generated from the production of most of the other organobromine chemicals identified in the consent decree ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  bromochloromethane, ethyl bromide, octabromodiphenyl oxide and decabromodiphenyl oxide) and for the wastewaters from tribromophenol production. After considering the collected information and data from toxicological, chemical, hydrogeological, and engineering viewpoints, EPA has concluded that the disposal of any wastes from these processes that are not currently listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D do not pose a substantial present or future risk to human health and the environment. Therefore, at this time, EPA is proposing not to list as hazardous wastes any additional wastes generated from the production of these chemicals. The Agency reserves the right to revisit these listing determinations if additional relevant data become available. In addition, the Agency is deferring action on the solids waste stream from the production of tetrabromobisphenol-A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Waste Minimization Opportunities in the Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the industry study, the Agency identified two potential opportunities for waste minimization. The first involves the recovery of tribromophenol in the tetrabromobisphenol-A and tribromophenol process. Commercial bisphenol A is made by condensation of phenol and acetone and, hence, the feedstock contains some unreacted phenol. Record sampling of one wastewater stream that leaves the process hot revealed that it contained up to 15,000 mg/L of tribromophenol. A second unrelated wastewater stream from the production of tribromophenol also contains about 70 ppm. This chemical has a solubility of 70 parts per million at 25 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C. From the volumes of wastewater generated, the Agency believes that enough material potentially could be recovered to increase annual production of tribromophenol by up to 70%. Cooling and filtering of this wastewater prior to deep well disposal might recover phenolics, limit the quantity of brominated chemicals being disposed, and reduce the plant's overall requirements for purchased phenol. Brominated phenol recovery also could make recycling some process wastewater viable, particularly in the tribromophenol process where the wastewater containing chiefly this material is disposed of by deep well injection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second area where savings could be achieved is in product packaging. Materials spilled in the packaging areas are drummed and shipped to Subtitle C facilities. Presently, the two major manufacturers of organobromine chemicals generate over 300 tons per year of various spilled solid products. Recovery of this material could result in significant savings and benefit the environment. The Agency invites comment on both waste minimization options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> POT USE MAY STUNT FETAL GROWTH  </P> <P> Women who smoke marijuana during pregnancy may stunt the growth of their  fetuses, producing babies who are smaller than normal, according to a study  released today.  </P> <P> The research found that mothers who smoked pot while pregnant produced babies  who averaged three ounces lighter and two-tenths of an inch shorter than  non-users' newborns. Although their study does not definitely prove that  marijuana slows growth in the womb, the researchers said pot-smoking is common  during pregnancy and women should be cautioned about the link. The study also  confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine users produce unusually small  babies.  </P></p>

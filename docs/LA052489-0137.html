			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ACLU TALKS ABOUT THE PAIN, THEN GOES LIMP  </P> <P> Few would dispute that the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union  has been a leader in rallying public concern over police brutality.  </P> <P> Love it or hate it, you know where the ACLU stands. In September, the group  even established a 24-hour telephone hot line for citizens to report brutality  cases.  </P> <P> But now the ACLU has gone strangely silent about an alleged case of brutality  involving the way police handled dozens of demonstrators who refused an order  to walk to the paddy wagon.  </P> <P> At issue is a martial-arts weapon called a nunchaku, which was used to arrest  anti-abortion protesters at two demonstrations last month outside San Diego  medical clinics.  </P> <P> The ACLU had monitors at both demonstrations. The ACLU in Los Angeles had  obtained a court order prohibiting Project Rescue protesters from blocking the  clinics' entrances.  </P> <P> When a news story implied that the ACLU therefore approved of nunchakus, legal  director Betty Wheeler announced that the group had no position on "pain  compliance" and was reviewing the question of how much pain can be inflicted on  people not actively resisting.  </P> <P> ACLU members talked to San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, who said that  nunchakus were used only when protesters refused to cooperate. Cops could hurt  their backs by carrying uncooperative arrestees, he said.  </P> <P> A nunchaku consists of two pieces of 12-inch plastic connected by 4 inches of  braided nylon cord. Even a defiant suspect quickly complies when a nunchaku is  applied to his wrist or arm and given a twist.  </P> <P> A private demonstration of nunchakus was arranged so Wheeler could feel the  excruciating pinch. The ACLU's Police Practices Committee debated the problem  at two meetings.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Michael Crowley said the membership was split nearly evenly  between those who felt the ACLU should always oppose excessive police force and  those who felt a controlled use of nunchakus is acceptable.  </P> <P> The meetings, he said, erupted into "rancorous debate back and forth, with  people losing their tempers. I spent most of my time trying to keep the meeting  under control."  </P> <P> Project Rescue activist Connie Youngkin says the ACLU is silent because the  nunchakus were used "to clear away people the ACLU wanted cleared away."  </P> <P> "If they were used on a rapist or a bank robber, the ACLU would immediately cry  foul," Youngkin said. "But they were used on law-abiding citizens who only  wanted to stop the slaughter of innocent babies. The ACLU doesn't care how  brutally we're treated."  </P> <P> Wheeler and Crowley say that isn't so. They insist that the fact the nunchakus  were used on anti-abortion demonstrators is irrelevant to the ACLU's internal  debate.  </P> <P> "It pains me that we can't come to a consensus about it," Crowley said. He said  he could not predict when, if ever, the group will reach a decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mitigated Murals  </P> <P> Make no mistake: Chairman Mao is not necessarily endorsed by San Diego State  University.  </P> <P> The controversy over dormitory murals at SDSU is headed toward a compromise.  The Young Americans for Freedom had objected to wall murals of Mao, Castro,  Khrushchev, Brezhnev and two Soviet generals.  </P> <P> The administration will install ideological disclaimers near the murals saying  that the historical figures are open to differing evaluations and that no one  is trying to indoctrinate the students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Dog Could Do Worse  </P> <P> Joan Kroc has dropped efforts to locate the owner of a lost dog she found last  November outside a Rancho Santa Fe restaurant.  </P> <P> No more reward, no more newspaper ads, no more trips to an Escondido woman who  claims she talks to animals. Boots is now an official member of the Kroc  family.  </P> <P> Boots knows a good thing when she sees it. "The dog seems very happy in her new  home," said a Kroc spokeswoman.  </P></p>

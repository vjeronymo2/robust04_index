			<p>BFN     [Text] Salamanca, Spain, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico and  Spain will ask that the UN Security Council be enlarged and that  its organizations vary their appointments to allow continuing  democratization efforts, it was reported here today.    This is the main agreement of the 18 reached at the Seventh  Mexican-Spanish Inter-Parliamentary Meeting, after three days of  work in Salamanca, northeastern Spain. With the approval of  these agreements, political and legislative ties between both  countries are expected to increase.    Both countries revealed their increasing initiatives in  international politics by calling for changes in the UN Security  Council to democratize its function and for it to reflect not  only geopolitical criteria but economic and social issues too.  They agreed to provide more institutional follow-up to the  Ibero-American summits of chiefs of state and governments to  further regional and transatlantic integration. The  parliamentarians agreed to expedite the ratification of  agreements to avoid double taxation, fight monetary fraud,  provide reciprocal guarantees for investments, and speed  negotiations for the modification of the bilateral extradition  treaty.    The delegates agreed that beginning with this meeting, Spain  will increasingly become a representative for Mexico and Latin  America before the European Union and that Mexico will do the  same for Spain and Europe in North America.    Juan Jose Laborda Martin, the leader of the Spanish  delegation and Senate president, also highlighted the points of  agreement between the two countries in issues related to  internal policies. "Our two nations are working intensely to  achieve greater clarity in the implementation of democracy by  doing all we can to further reflect the will of the people and  not that of pressure groups," Laborda stated. "Mexico and Spain  agree it is illogical that countries like Japan and Germany be  excluded from the Security Council. We believe in a unipolar  world. The UN needs to strengthen itself as a sphere of  supranational authority," Laborda, senator of the governing  Spanish Socialist Workers Party, said.    In a news conference after the close of the meeting, Saul  Gonzalez Herrera, president of the Mexican delegation and  senator from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, underscored  the importance that "legislators should give to their efforts at  the summits of chiefs of state and governments to boost  improvements in the Ibero-American integration process."    Initially, the two delegations had been scheduled to discuss  the issue of Cuba's future in the Ibero-American community and  the role that Mexico and Spain could play to counter U.S.  pressure on the island. Although the issue was not included in  the final communique, Laborda told NOTIMEX "it is not something  we have forgotten about." "Cuba must be helped to equalize the  political and economic situation -- while maintaining its  sovereignty -- of its government. We do not agree with the  embargo or with the future of the island being dictated by a  minority in the United States," Laborda indicated. Gonzalez  Herrera emphasized that "Cuba's problems will not be solved by a  blockade. Mexico has always favored Cuban self-determination  and hopes that this unilateral attitude will be overcome."</p>

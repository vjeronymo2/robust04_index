			<p>According     to research papers presented at a symposium on China's  economic and trade relations, China's priorities in foreign trade  are upgrading its export mix and "internationalizing" production  enterprises.  Symposium participants tended to see  prospects for  trade relations with the United States and Western countries as only  fair, with Asia viewed as likely to become the focus of China's  external economic development.      The November issue of XIANDAI GUOJI GUANXI, an international  affairs journal affiliated with the well-respected China Institute  of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a research think  tank, is devoted to papers presented at an October symposium  sponsored by that institution on "China's Economy Opening to the  Outside World."  The papers present current thinking on the full  spectrum of China's economic and trade relations with the world by  participants from government, press, academic, and commercial  circles.  (The appendix to this Foreign Media Note lists the  reported articles, authors, and affiliations represented at the  symposium.)      All symposium articles dealing with further opening up China's  economy to the world give top priority to upgrading China's export  mix by shifting away from low-profit, labor-intensive products.  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher Zhang Shouyi argues  that a low-cost, skilled labor pool gives China a comparative  advantage in "knowledge-intensive, high-tech products."  Other ideas  for expanding high-profit exports by other authors include improving  product quality, before and after sales service, and packaging.  JINGJI RIBAO journalist He Ming stresses the importance of in-  country marketing agents and products responsive to consumer demand  when targeting markets in advanced countries.  Others at this  symposium call for implementation of international standards and  foreign managers in China's export enterprises to expand exports.      In reforming the foreign trade regime by "internationalizing"  Chinese enterprises, state-run enterprises are in the best position  to upgrade their exports, gain overseas market share, and become  multinational corporations.  According to Wang Zhile of the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation International Economic  Cooperation Research Center,  "Of all the regions of the world,  Asia, and especially East Asia, should be the key region, the target  of first choice for internationalizing Chinese enterprises."      The image of Asia as China's stepping stone to the world economy  is a common theme in many of the articles, but there is some  ambivalence in the respective arguments supporting that view:  Asia  is seen both as the region of greatest potential for China's  outward-oriented economic growth and as its stiffest competitor.  In  many cases Chinese exports are in direct competition with exports  from other developing Asian economies.  Moreover, low-quality  exports and lack of experience in international business dealings  put Chinese companies at a disadvantage in this competition.  China  is also see as in direct competition with ASEAN countries and  Indochina for foreign investment.      Nonetheless, there appears to be general agreement that China  must concentrate on Asia and Asian markets, both for their high  growth potential in the 9O's and to counterbalance the increasing  protectionism of Western countries.  With Asia, as with the world,  China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub-  regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and  regional fora.  Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission  Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three  triangles.  Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China-  Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore  and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United  States).  The larger triangles have the potential for economic  competition and even conflict.  Huang predicts the large triangle of  the Asia-Pacific will be the "main battlefield" in the U.S.-Japanese  struggle for economic leadership.  Huang sees areas of concern in  China's economic relations with both countries.  Japan doesn't want  to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always  "fly in formation" following Japan's lead.  According to Huang, the  United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its  political agenda on China.      Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent  theme in the articles.  CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the  United States is "politicizing" the economic relationship between  the two countries.  Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on "unwarranted accusations" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all "harmed the bilateral relationship."  Yan Xuetong, also of  CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, "Hereafter  the United States will continue to use every pretext, including  constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit  China's exports to the United States."  Ke Juhan urges the United  States to put the relationship on a more "practical" footing,  stating that President Clinton's recent "intentions, statements, and  actions" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with  China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved  with China economically, they will "play an active role" in  improving the bilateral relationship.      Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations,  three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out.  Wang Lijiu  asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic  relations with Russia.  However, according to Wang, both countries  must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy.  Wang  also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to  resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased  technology trade between the two countries.  In an article on  economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using  barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out  Western competition for those markets.  Finally, Guan Shufen  characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European  countries as "cautiously optimistic."  Sino-German economic  relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development.  On  the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade  protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic  industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral  relations.

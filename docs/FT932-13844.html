			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / IBM loses Dollars 285m in first quarter as sales fall: Result gives little hope of quick recovery - Mainframes down by 'high double-digit per cent' INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday reported a Dollars 285m first-quarter loss, providing little hope for a short-term recovery by the world's largest computer company. Its losses were almost Dollars 5bn last year, its worst ever. IBM said European sales dropped sharply in the first quarter, by almost 14 per cent, with 3 per cent declines in the US and Asia. Worldwide sales of IBM's core mainframe computer products were down by a 'high double-digit per cent'. One bright spot was a 48 per cent increase in service revenues, which rose to Dollars 1.9bn. Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who joined from RJR Nabisco on April 1, said the results 'reflect weak demand and continued competitive pressures in many of our hardware product lines, particularly mainframe computers and large disk drives'. Overall, revenues declined to Dollars 13.1bn from Dollars 14bn while losses per share were 50 cents, in line with Wall Street's expectations. In the first quarter of 1992, IBM posted net earnings of Dollars 2.5bn, including a gain of Dollars 1.9bn from the adoption of a new tax accounting standard. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.12, or Dollars 4.45 including the one-time gain. Gross profit margins fell to 39.5 per cent, down from 50.8 per cent in the first quarter last year. IBM said it would continue to 'aggressively seek ways to improve the company's profitability,' but Mr Gerstner had no comment on what form these actions might take. In his first public appearance since taking over at IBM, Mr Gerstner will address the company's annual meeting in Tampa, Florida, next week. IBM said operating expenses declined by 8.9 per cent in the first quarter to Dollars 5.4bn, and expenses were expected to continue to decline as the company reduced its workforce. Previously, IBM has said it would eliminate more than 25,000 jobs this year. The group also said its personal computer business had achieved profitability in the first quarter, with shipments up 40 per cent over the same period last year. Sales of computer workstations also grew strongly. However, total hardware sales fell to Dollars 5.7bn, against Dollars 7.1bn. Rental and financing revenues, driven by mainframe computer installations, were down 12 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn, while maintenance services fell by 5 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn.</p>

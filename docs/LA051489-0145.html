			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW OWNER TO RENOVATE THE BARKER BROS. BUILDING;  </P> <P> N.Y. DEVELOPER BUYS LANDMARK STRUCTURE, THREE ADJOINING PARCELS ON FIGUEROA  STREET.  </P> <P> Multimillionaire Harry Macklowe has purchased the landmark Barker Bros.  building, at 818 W. 7th St., and three adjoining parcels on Figueroa Street for  about $100 million.  </P> <P> The New York-based developer has plans to put about $165 million into  renovating the building and constructing a conference center and 600-room  hotel, which he will name, following the tradition of another well-known New  Yorker, for himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Linked to Building  </P> <P> The 450,000-square-foot Hotel Macklowe and conference center will be linked to  the Barker Bros. building, which will continue to be restored, Macklowe said,  "with its architectural integrity preserved." The hotel will have what he  described as "a sympathetic design that respects the historical significance of  this important structure."  </P> <P> The 12-story Barker Bros. building, completed in 1929, housed the Barker Bros.  furniture mart and headquarters until 1984, when Hammerson Properties West USA  purchased the building and an adjacent site for $57 million. The furniture  company then relocated, the structure was redesigned and several specialty  stores moved in.  </P> <P> In announcing the hotel, Macklowe said, "With the planned expansion of the Los  Angeles Convention Center by 1992, we recognize the need for additional quality  hotel space." The Hotel Macklowe will provide 350 jobs during construction and  600 jobs at completion. A date for starting construction hasn't been set yet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Projects  </P> <P> Through his Macklowe Organization and Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co. Inc.,  Macklowe has developed more than 2.5 million square feet of hotels, commercial  and residential space in Manhattan. He is currently building a 638-room,  52-story hotel in Times Square that is expected to open in April, 1990.  </P> <P> Macklowe entered his first West Coast real estate venture in 1986 when he  purchased, with Swig Weiler &amp; Dinner of San Francisco, the  436,000-square-foot, twin-tower Arco Center at 200 Oceangate, Long Beach.  </P></p>

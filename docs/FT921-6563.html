			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon to raise Pounds 30m from asset disposals EVERED BARDON, the quarry products group which is seeking to cut borrowings following a spate of acquisitions, is selling two non-core businesses to raise about Pounds 30m. The company is selling its slag cement business, which has plants near London and in South Wales, for Pounds 25m cash. Daniel Platt, a clay tile manufacturer, is also being sold for Pounds 5m cash and Pounds 400,000 in repaid inter-group borrowings. Evered Bardon has now raised about Pounds 34m from disposals since announcing last September a 49.5 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said this was 'a good step' towards reducing gearing from 75 per cent in September to about 40 per cent. The company is looking to sell three business in the US, in Arkansas, North Carolina and Indiana, which could fetch between Dollars 70m-Dollars 80m (Pounds 40m-Pounds 45.7m). Net borrowings are expected to have fallen to about Pounds 250m at end-December, reflecting disposals and currency movements. This would reduce gearing to about 63 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 400m. The company has brought forward its reporting date by six weeks to mid-March and is expected to announce pre-tax profits for last year of about Pounds 26m, compared to Pounds 43.9m last time. James Capel, the company's broker, expects total dividends to be maintained at 5.595p even through this would not be covered by earnings per share of about 5p. The slag cement business, which was acquired within the Civil and Marine aggregates group in 1990, last year reported trading profits of Pounds 2.5m on turnover of Pounds 11.6m. The purchaser is a consortium led by 3i Group and involves Mr Mike Uren, co-founder of Civil and Marine and an executive director of Evered Bardon. Mr Uren will stay at Evered Bardon on 'a substantially full time basis', the company said.</p>

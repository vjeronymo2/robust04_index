			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that five  Arab countries are currently working to cancel the Arab boycott  against Israel. These countries are Egypt, Tunisia, Oman,  Qatar, and Morocco. Peres stressed that the Arab boycott is as  much a problem for the Arab world as it is for Israel.    Speaking before the Knesset Economic Affairs Committee,  which  discussed the effects of the Arab boycott on Israel, the foreign  minister added that in its war against the Arab boycott, Israel  is not seeking to take over the Arab world. Through the peace  process, Israel is trying to bring about an economization of  politics instead of a politicization of economics. This was  reported by our correspondent Eytan Almog.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1105 GMT on 21 February  adds that Foreign Minister Peres also said that "the economic  aid Israel receives from the United States compensates for the  losses incurred as a result of the Arab boycott."]</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / A recipe for success in the office canteen: Contract caterers are looking to the public sector for fresh growth TEN years ago when a UK worker tucked into a meal in the canteen, the chances were that it had been cooked and served by fellow employees. Now more than half the canteens in the business sector are run by contractors and the opening of the door to the public sector has set up a mouth-watering prospect. The growth of the contractors' role in providing the 3bn-plus meals a year that Britons consume at work and in schools, hospitals and prisons helps to explain why Compass Group outbid some serious competition, including a management buy-out team, to set up the acquisition of its rival, Gardner Merchant. At present, Compass's shares are suspended while details are worked out of the Pounds 500m to Pounds 550m purchase from Forte, the hotels and restaurants group. Compass plans to buy the bulk of Forte's contract catering division for Pounds 450m, with ARA Services of the US taking the rest. Compass will become the market leader with as much as 37 per cent of the corporate contract catering market. ARA will leapfrog from fourth to second with an estimated 20 per cent, ahead of Sutcliffe, part of P&amp;O, with about 18 per cent. The swallowing of Gardner means the top four become the top three. Rivals of Compass will expect the Office of Fair Trading to take a keen interest in the new combination. Compass has already discussed the issue with the OFT, however, and brought ARA into the deal to try to avoid competition problems. The merger's impact depends on how you define the market. Gardner and Compass have more than half the business sector that is contracted out, but that in turn is only half the Pounds 1.5bn whole and in-house caterers are part of the competition. If public sector canteens are included, the contractors' penetration comes down to only 15 per cent, according to figures from Gira Sic, the independent consultancy. In business catering, the contractors' share has nearly doubled in 10 years, enabling Gardner, Compass and Sutcliffe to keep profits moving ahead. But growth has started to flag, according to a recent report from analysts at Hoare Govett. The closing of sites and redundancies have affected the operators and unemployment could prove a drag until 1994. Clients under financial pressure may wish to strike a harder bargain with the outside caterer, for instance by asking for more of the savings to be passed on. The traditional cost-plus contract in the UK has enabled groups like Compass to retain much of the discount achieved in buying materials, as well as taking the management fee represented by the 'plus'. In continental Europe, payment is more likely to be based on agreed prices for the meals, leaving the contractor with less predictability. Foreign competition, particularly from France, is becoming more of a threat. Hoare Govett says the UK is the only major European country in which foreign operators have not taken a significant market share. Mr Michael Jones, of Gira Sic, points to two culture clashes. One is the cost-plus versus the fixed-price approach. The other is British eating habits. In the more snack-orientated UK, staff canteens are used by less than 40 per cent of employees, while on the continent the take-up is at least 55 per cent. So far the presence in the UK of the French groups - Sodexho, Eurest and the contract catering division of Accor - has remained tiny, but most commentators believe this will change. Compass's catering business is far more dependent on the UK corporate sector than Gardner's. It risks a loss of momentum - unless it expands overseas and takes on more muscle for an assault on the public sector. Gardner is ahead of it on both counts. About Pounds 230m of its Pounds 800m turnover last year was overseas. It is market leader in the Netherlands and has significant shares in France, Belgium and Germany. After several years of investment, it has critical mass in these markets; each new contract is much more profitable than those signed in the start-up years. In the UK public sector, where only about 6 per cent of a Pounds 3bn-plus market is contracted out, Gardner is the biggest private operator. About a quarter of its new contracts are with institutions rather than companies. While the Forte deal will enable Compass to progress on all the most promising fronts, will it pay too much? The business it is buying with ARA made Pounds 47m operating profit on Pounds 1.13bn sales last year. Using the standard 33 per cent tax rate, the Pounds 500m-Pounds 550m price tag is 16 to 17 times resilient earnings, on a par with the FT-A 500-share index but higher than Compass's 15 times rating. And with a planned share issue of less than Pounds 200m, the group will end up with net debt of roughly Pounds 300m. Mr Francis Mackay, Compass's chief executive, stresses the scope for margin improvement, particularly on purchasing, and says his group - once a heavily indebted management buy-out - has shown it can reduce debt. He contrasts Compass's operating margin of 9.2 per cent with Gardner's figure of around 4 per cent, while analysts also credit his group with tight financial controls. Another factor is that Compass's purchase will include the higher-margin airport services operation. There is a suggestion that the comparison of operating margins is not straightforward because Gardner calculates its sales figures in a different way. Mr Mackay has obviously decided the opportunity warrants stretching Compass. Whether he is right will depend on the new group's success on the battlefields for future growth: the UK public sector and the continent of Europe.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                             UK CATERING  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Number of     Number of                    Number of      meals         meals      Contract                   restaurants    served      contracted    catering                     ('000)     per year (m)  per year (m)  (% share)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Business              33          600            330         55.0 Education             34        1,230             77          6.3 Health/Welfare        22        1,010             45          4.5 Other                  1          210             15          7.1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: GIRA SIC  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Play Delay: "M. Butterfly" won't arrive at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly  Hills until March or July, said a spokesman for the touring production of the  Tony-winning play, which just opened in Boston with a $1-million advance sale.  The Los Angeles run had been scheduled for Dec. 4-30, but the spokesman said  the producers now want a longer Los Angeles stay -- of at least five weeks --  and the only openings in the show's tour that would allow the longer run are in  March or July.

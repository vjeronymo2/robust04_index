			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Mexico tightens rules for financial sector after alleged fraud Mexico is drawing up tighter regulations for the financial sector following reports of alleged fraud at the Union and Cremi banks, and at the Havre financial group. Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy finance minister, said that the new regulations would require external auditors and the National Banking Commission to investigate activities of financial institutions in more detail. They would also make it easier for private agents to evaluate the quality of a bank's assets by requiring financial groups to disclose more information. The regulations are likely to be drawn up in time to be considered by the incoming government of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, which takes office on December 1. The new rules are aimed at bringing regulations in line with practices in the industrialised world. They are also intended to avoid a repetition of events at Havre - where company executives allegedly set up fake companies that received government-subsidied loans - and at Cremi and Union, where the chief executive is said to have illegally lent up to Dollars 700m to companies he controls. According to Mr Ortiz, the National Banking Commission mainly analyses the accounts of financial institutions without looking too closely at the financial risks that institution is exposed to. In future, the commission will examine more closely financial risks inherent in a bank's lending or trading practices. Mr Ortiz said that 'the financial authority is considering the emission of norms that will oblige banks to measure interest rate, exchange rate and inflation risk they are exposed to, and comply as a result with the necessary levels of capital.' The role of the external auditor is also expected to change. According to Mr Ortiz, the external auditor may have to analyse in depth a sample of credits, to verify information given by the banks. Mr Ortiz urged that the auditor 'stop making just simple revisions of accounts and help make clear to the investor the relevant information of each institution'. Directors will be encouraged to check more thoroughly that their institution is complying with the law, and is assessing risks appropriately. The government believes financial markets should become more important in the evaluation of banks and their assets. This should be helped by future regulations that will require similar information disclosure in Mexico to that demanded by the US under GAAP accounting rules.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: Astra-Takeda patent row settled Correction (published 30th May 1994) appended to this article. Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday settled a long-running patent infringement dispute with the Japanese group Takeda, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The out-of-court agreement lifted its A shares by SKr8 to SKr168 (Dollars 21.90). The dispute centred on Losec, Astra's best-selling anti-ulcer drug, which last year had total sales, including sales through licensees, of SKr12.7bn. Losec is the world's fifth best selling drug worldwide. Astra accused Takeda of marketing a generic version of Losec, claiming this infringed the patent protection which Losec enjoys until 1999. It filed a series of suits against the Japanese group and its licensees last year. Under the terms of the settlement, Astra will receive unspecified compensation for Takeda's future sales of products containing the generic version of Losec. CORRECTION Under the terms of the settlement between Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, and the Japanese group, Takeda, Astra will receive unspecified consideration for Takeda's future sales of products containing lansoprazole and not the generic version of Losec (Astra's best-selling anti-ulcer drug) as stated in a May 27 story headed 'Astra-Takeda patent row settled'.</p>

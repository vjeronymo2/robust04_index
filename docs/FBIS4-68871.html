			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hakob Asatryan: "Forty-Eight Percent of </F> Republic's Electrical Energy is Lost"]    [Text] "The government reports false figures in its  programs," declared parliamentary deputy Arshak Sadoyan [at a  meeting with reporters]. Representing the parliamentary group of  the National Democratic Union [NDU], Sadoyan drew the attention  of the reporters to the figures in the budget that was recently  passed by the Supreme Council and demonstrated that they do not  correspond to the truth. According to those figures, the monthly  income of the average person in the republic was 254 dram in  February 1994, indicating that it had grown by 15.4 times while  consumer prices rose by 125.8 times [as published]. In other  words, the living standards of the population declined by  8-fold. In addition, according to the same budget, the gross  national product of the republic must be 9.285 billion dram in  1994, but the real figure is expected to reach 60.100 billion  dram by the end of the year. In other words, the inflation rate  is expected to be 6-fold (597 percent). Sadoyan claims, however,  that if a more realistic approach is taken, the inflation rate  will be 20-fold. He says that the government is distorting the  figures so that it can hide the large difference between the  1.7-fold growth in incomes and 20-fold increase in prices.    The remarks of Semyon Baghdasaryan, the other member of the  NDU parliamentary group, about energy production were even more  interesting. It has been determined that the electrical energy  output of the republic declined by 2-fold from 11,270 million  kilowatt-hours in the first 11 months of 1989 to 5,822 million  kilowatt-hours in the corresponding period of 1993. On that  basis, the supply of electricity to the population should have  declined by 2-fold and not by 12-fold.    Thus, where has the electricity generated in the republic  gone? In Mr Baghdasaryan's words, 48 percent of the electricity  generated was lost in the transmission network alone, and 25 to  30 percent was distributed through illegal or so-called "private  supply" means. This assumes that 50 percent of the 305 million  kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in November 1993 was  delivered to the population and the remaining 50 percent was  given to industry. According to Mr Baghdasaryan, because of this  situation not only electrical energy but industrial production  is lost.    Mr Baghdasaryan says: "Officials of the Ministry of the  Interior derive personal benefit from the `private services' of  supplying electricity." He noted that if this situation  continues, the directors of substations may illegally privatize  their units and decide on their own who receives electricity and  who does not.    Parliamentary deputy Seyran Avagyan said that the harsh  taxation system does not help the importation of high-priority  foodstuffs into the republic. He said that today the minimum  monthly expenses (bread, salt, sugar, heating oil and soap) of a  family comprised of four members is 2,095 dram. Assuming that  two members of the family work, each working person must  therefore earn at least 1,047 dram a month at a time when the  minimum monthly wage is 110 dram (176 dram beginning in April).  The deputies then spoke about Armenia's domestic and foreign  policies. In particular, Shavarsh Kocharyan declared that  Armenia must look for strength in itself and rely less on  outside forces.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Japanese pledge boosts Thorp THE Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant has been boosted by the Japanese government's confirmation of its commitment to the use of plutonium for nuclear fuel. The commitment, in the Japanese government's annual report on atomic energy, indicates that the country is likely to honour contracts for fuel from the Cumbria plant. Japan would be Thorp's biggest foreign customer, if the plant wins approval from the UK government. The report said recycling was 'an important element' in the country's energy policy, citing the country's scarce natural resources and heavy energy consumption. It aims to lift nuclear-generated electricity from the present 28.2 per cent of electrical power capacity to 40 per cent over 20 years. A fledgling environmental movement, which includes members of parliament from four of the seven ruling coalition parties, is lobbying for an end to plutonium imports because Japan has a surplus. But the report says Japan will have a plutonium fuel shortage until the end of the decade, when its own reprocessing plant is due to open. Stocks now stand at 4.5 tonnes, of which 1.6 tonnes are in Japan and the rest in France and Britain. They will be consumed at a prototype reactor at Monju, on Japan's west coast, due to start next spring. It estimated that stocks will last about three years. David Lascelles writes: British Nuclear Fuels, the owner of Thorp, said its main German and Japanese customers had reaffirmed their commitment to Thorp contracts. Mr Takeo Matsunaga, secretary-general of the overseas reprocessing committee, representing the 10 Japanese utilities with contracts to reprocess fuel at Thorp, said: 'The Japanese government as well as the Japanese utilities strongly support the early commencement of Thorp operation.' Dr Karl Staebler, chairman of the VDEW nuclear sub-group which represents Thorp's German customers, said German utilities would abide by the contracts they had signed with BNF for the first 10 years of Thorp operation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev--Oleksiy Sheberstov, first deputy minister of  power engineering and electrification, reported at a news  conference at the Ministry of Power Engineering and  Electrification of Ukraine on 17 February that the situation  taking shape at Ukraine's electric power stations is that the  amount of fuel is ample for two or three days only. Last night  the Tripolye station was put out of operation; a question has  been raised about discontinuing the operation of the last unit  at the Zaporozhye GRES [state district electric power station];  43 tons of coal are left at the Burshtyn station, which requires  18,000 tons of coal per day. A similar situation is occuring at  other stations. Oleksiy Sheberstov reported that if the stations  are put out of operation completely, it would be virtually  impossible to resume their work.    The main reasons for the critical situation which is  happening at the electric power stations is the absence of coal  and fuel oil. Only 100,000 tons of coal are being supplied, but  the consumption need is 160,000 tons per day. There are ample  quantities of fuel oil; however, the Ministry of Power  Engineering and Electrification has no money to buy it, said  Sheberstov. At the same time, it was pointed out that there are  customers wishing to buy electric energy for Russian rubles,  however, the "Law on currency regulation" allows the sale of  electric energy for Ukrainian coupons only.    Dwelling on the process of setting up corporations and  joint-stock companies within the industry, Sheberstov remarked  that today this process is impossible to carry out without  restructuring the industry, because Ukraine has a single  centralized network. Therefore, the claims by Dnepropetrovsk,  Lugansk, Donetsk, and Zaporozhye oblasts that the regional  property, power transmission lines in particular, should be  passed into their ownership are groundless.    Replying to the question whether the increase in tariffs for  electric energy had positive consequences, Sheberstov said that  "electric energy will not be saved until it is sold to domestic  customers at a price which is lower than its current prime cost."</p>

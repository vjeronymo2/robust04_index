			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ALTER STANCE, BACK MERGER OF UTILITIES;  </P> <P> AIR QUALITY: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON PROMISES TO CUT POLLUTANTS TO OFFSET  THOSE GENERATED BY THE MERGER.  </P> <P> Despite objections from environmentalists, the Board of Supervisors Tuesday  approved an agreement that virtually removes the county's opposition to the  proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego's chief power  utility.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the supervisors had threatened to battle the merger between  Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric unless serious flaws in a state study  of the deal were corrected.  </P> <P> In a letter to the state Public Utilities Commission, board Chairwoman Madge L.  Schaefer charged that the study "may significantly underestimate the expected  air quality impacts in Ventura County."  </P> <P> But Tuesday, the supervisors voted unanimously to sign an agreement requiring  Edison to reduce certain pollutants by specified percentages, more than  compensating for increases expected as a result of the merger.  </P> <P> This, in effect, means that the board is going along with the merger, board  members said after Tuesday's supervisors meeting.  </P> <P> The pollution mitigation standards agreed upon Tuesday are based on the same  figures that were criticized May 29 by the board and Air Pollution Control  Officer Richard H. Baldwin.  </P> <P> "I'm more comfortable with the model those figures are based on today than I  was three weeks ago," Baldwin said, explaining his endorsement of the  agreement.  </P> <P> Schaefer agreed, saying, "I think this is the best deal we could get. We're  requiring Edison to more than make up for the pollution increases that will be  caused by the merger."  </P> <P> Under the merger, Edison's generating plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay in  south Oxnard are expected to pour an additional 2,885 tons of nitrogen oxide  into the county's air over the next 17 years. Production at these plants is  scheduled to rise while that at less efficient facilities in San Diego would be  curtailed.  </P> <P> On the whole, net emissions are expected to increase in the early years of the  merger but decrease after that.  </P> <P> In the agreement approved Tuesday, Edison would reduce overall nitrogen oxide  emissions at its plants and elsewhere in the county by at least 45% more than  the increase predicted in the PUC's draft environmental impact report. Reactive  organic compounds would be reduced by 2,300% and carbon monoxide by 500% over  the 17-year period. The deal must still be approved by the commission when it  rules on the merger.  </P> <P> Environmentalists at the board meeting argued that the county should delay  reaching terms with Edison at least until after the final environmental impact  report is issued June 29.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's prudent legislation to gamble on a matter this serious,"  said Russ Baggerly, executive director of the Environmental Coalition.  </P> <P> Critics questioned Edison's plan to reduce smog by helping businesses replace  internal-combustion engines with electric units. "They won't even tell us where  these engines are located," said Baggerly's wife, Pat, an Environmental  Coalition director.  </P> <P> She said after the meeting that "the supervisors have sold our air. They didn't  even listen to the environmentalists."  </P> <P> Michael M. Hertel, Edison's environmental affairs manager, told the supervisors  that the agreement "would be the equivalent of removing 12,000 cars driving  15,000 miles a year from the county's streets."  </P></p>

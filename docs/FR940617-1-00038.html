			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency agrees that antibacterial or antiseptic personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleanser products are practical for home use, to help prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross contamination from one person to another, especially after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diaper changing and caring for invalids or ill family members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also agrees with one comment that claims relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general health-care and personal hygiene similar to the claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed for health-care personnel handwashes may be suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because such claims explain the uses of these products in lay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency separated the first aid antiseptic uses of OTC topical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial drug products from the ``non-first aid uses.'' In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that document, the agency proposed that the following terms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories be deleted: skin antiseptics, skin wound protectants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and skin wound cleansers; and the agency proposed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate labeling, instead, be included in a new category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called ``first aid antiseptics'' (56 FR 33644 at 33649). Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses proposed by one comment, i.e., ``minute cuts and abrasions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from shaving and other minor traumas,'' are considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describing ``first aid uses'' and are adequately covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling provided for ``first aid antiseptics'' in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.50(b) (56 FR 33677), which contains the following: ``First  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid to help'' (select one of the following: ``prevent,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``decrease'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), (``reduce'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), ``guard against,'' or ``protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against'') (select one of the following: ``infection,'' ``bacterial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination,'' or ``skin infection'') ``in minor cuts, scrapes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burns.'' The agency believes that the first aid indication is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently broad to cover minute cuts and abrasions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shaving and that it is not necessary to include the words ``other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor traumas'' in the indications statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beyond the first aid uses described in the first comment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency recognizes a need for an OTC ``antiseptic handwash''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product for repeated or daily use over an extended period of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for some of the other uses described by the comment. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees with the comments that health-care personnel handwashes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are appropriate for such use because submitted data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness studies, for uses subject to this rulemaking, were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from handwashing tests similar to or the same as tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the agency's previously proposed testing guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see 43 FR 1210 at 1240), i.e., ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' ``Glove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Juice Test,'' and ``Test for Health-Care Personnel Handwash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effectiveness.'' The agency is proposing in this tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph in &sect;333.455(a) that a health-care personnel handwash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can also bear a statement of identity of ``antiseptic handwash.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See section I.B., comment 3.) For products labeled for multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses including both antiseptic handwash and first aid labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims, the general statement of identity would be ``antiseptic''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in section I.B., comment 3. The product would then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to incorporate the monograph labeling for both antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash as well as first aid antiseptic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``cleanser'' included in claims requested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments is not appropriate in this rulemaking because it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be a cosmetic claim in view of the fact that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) defines a cosmetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as ``articles intended to be *&blank;*&blank;* applied to the human body *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cleansing *&blank;*&blank;*'' (21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1)) and thus may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading to consumers. As discussed in section I.I., comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19, the terms ``microbicidal'' and ``germicidal'' may appear in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling of OTC antiseptic drug products under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the agency is proposing as the indication for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products bearing the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a general claim similar to one recommended by one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, i.e., ``for handwashing to decrease bacteria on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin.'' The agency has determined that this claim may, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's option, be followed by one or more of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following examples: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or treatment.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Descriptive statements such as ``contains antibacterial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients'' and ``for the purpose of promoting good individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and family hygiene'' are considered to be examples of statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not significantly related to the safe and effective use of the product and thus are outside the scope of the rulemaking. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements may be included in the labeling of these OTC drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products subject to the statutory provisions against false or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has determined that the indication proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic handwash drug products is also appropriate for health-care personnel handwashes and is also proposing the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication for health-care personnel handwashes. ``For handwashing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical care or treatment.'') In addition to the indication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed above, the agency is proposing that health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwashes may also bear the following indication:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease.'' The agency is proposing the statement ``recommended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated use'' as an ``other allowable indication'' for antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or health-care personnel handwash drug products (see below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency sees no reason to continue to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``antimicrobial soap'' as a separate product category. Soap is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be a dosage form, and specific dosage forms are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being included in the monograph unless there is a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety or efficacy reason for doing so. Antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients may be formulated as soaps for some of the uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in this document, e.g., handwash; however, the designation ``antimicrobial soap'' is no longer being proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion in the monograph. In addition, the agency considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other product categories that are being proposed to be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informative to the users of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the comments, the agency is proposing labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for professional or consumer uses as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 333.455&blank;Labeling of Antiseptic Handwash or Health-Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Personnel Handwash Drug Products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of identity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The labeling of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product as an ``antiseptic,'' as stated above under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.450(a), and/or ``antiseptic handwash,'' or ``health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwash.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indications. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For products labeled as a health-care personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'') <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For products labeled as an antiseptic handwash.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a person under medical care or treatment.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

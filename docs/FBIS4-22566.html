			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, </F> by special correspondent Arkadiy Khantsevich; date not given:  "`I Am an Unsuitable Candidate for Whipping-Boy'"]    [Text] Tiraspol-Moscow--He is honored among the  troops with the respectful "Papa" (this at the age of 43).  Moldovan nationalists have christened him "occupier" and  "imperialist." Super-patriots in Moscow and Tiraspol abuse him  with the words "Judas" and "traitor."    What career has not been predicted for him as of  late--from defense minister of Russia through banishment to a  remote military district. Aleksandr Rutskoy offered Lebed the  chance to become a minister in October 1993--and he received the  sole possible response: "You can go and... yourself." More than  just the former vice president have experienced the brusque  manners of the commander of the 14th Army. The inordinate  sharpness of Lebed's opinions go against the grain with many of  his present superiors also--the Ministry of Defense even  attempted to ban the general's contacts with the press and the  public. But subduing or intimidating him is not, apparently,  that easy....    [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, is what has been written  about you the truth or an invention ?    [Lebed] A conventional biography. I am native of  Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Host. I graduated from  school there in 1967, I worked there also for two years--a  grinder and loader. This whole time I was trying--three  times--to enroll in flying school. I was not accepted--because  of a bad nasopharynx. It was operated on, but I was ultimately  still deemed unfit for flying service....    [Khantsevich] And what about the nose, if it is no secret?    [Lebed] I took a blow. In 1969 I enrolled at the Ryazan  Airborne School and graduated from it in 1973. At the decision  of the school's council I was retained for service there. I was  commander of a platoon for three years, and from 1976 through  1981, commander of a company of officer candidates.    In 1981 I left for Afghanistan as commander of a battalion.  Then, the academy: enrolled in 1982, graduated in 1985.    [Khantsevich] Aside from the school and Afghanistan, what do  you remember most of this period of service?    [Lebed] As a division commander, I was repeatedly  "carousing"  around flash points. In the fall of 1988, Sumgait,  winter-spring, Baku. April-May of 1989, Tbilisi. The "jacket  potatoes" campaign of sorry renown--this was 1990, September.  Before this, in January-February, I was, true, in Baku once  again. And everywhere I was involved in defending people and  preventing them grabbing one another by the throat.    [Khantsevich] Not only the addresses but also the situations  in each of these "flash points" were, understandably, different.  Do such conflicts have anything in common?    [Lebed] I will say merely what I felt each time as a  soldier.  Wherever I went, not once did I receive an order in writing. Not  once! The telephone would ring, as a rule: Let's go to  such-and-such a place, boys, it's not good there, sort it  out.... You pull the fighters apart, and as soon as the carnage  ends, a crowd of prosecutors piles onto you: Why did you do  this, not this? Not one investigator could answer this simple  question for me. A soldier is standing there, guarding an object  that has been entrusted to him. A passerby spits in the  soldier's face. Is this assault and battery or not? And if so,  what should the soldier do: shoot the passerby, spit at him in  return, hit him? If so, with what: his fist, his boot, the butt  of his rifle? For I have to instruct a subordinate when I put  him at his post in an extreme situation. The soldier is, in  ancien-regime language, a sovereign individual, he is not here  on a visit. Civilians may sort things out between themselves--at  the level of presidents, politicians, what have you. But leave  the soldier alone, he is an official person, his mother is  waiting for him at home....    It was a very troubled time in this respect, telephone law  raged everywhere. Each time our former president, the  incomparable Gorbachev, was "astonished." Thus three divisions  were flown to Tbilisi, three divisional commanders, I recall,  came together--eight regiments for the three--a whole armada.  You can imagine what work this involved: getting people away  from all the airfields, loading the helicopters with equipment,  transferring, unloading, deploying, putting the city under  protection.... And then this astonishment is expressed at the  top: How did they actually come to be there, did the devil put  them there? They all pretend to be simpletons....    And how did they devour Rodionov, commander of the district?  He was a most intelligent person, an elite general, we do not  have many like him in the army. And he was subsequently  "appointed" the culprit, and they wrote that he was a murderer.    All this made an extremely negative mark on our minds. You  feel yourself to be in some way inferior, as we would put it,  perhaps. As though you are in service of the state and you have  power to hand, but you are like a butterfly beneath a net--it is  about to be slipped over you.    [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, continuing the subject of  inventions.... Various things are being said, for example, about  your relations with the present minister of defense....    [Lebed] I do not know who is saying what, but it has been  the  case that we have in our service careers been closely linked our  whole lives. Were, that is. Senior Sergeant Lebed was under  Lieutenant Grachev deputy platoon commander. Then Lieutenant  Lebed was a platoon commander in a company under Senior  Lieutenant Grachev. Subsequently we went our separate ways--we  met up in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Grachev, deputy  regimental commander, Captain Lebed, battalion commander. We met  up in the airborne forces once again. So we spent a lot of our  service life together.    [Khantsevich] One further myth--concerning the start of your  service in the Dniester region. That you came here incognito,  with papers made out for Colonel Gusev....    [Lebed] This was the case. My assignment included the  mission  of securing the evacuation of the servicemen's families. And the  document was issued for this special assignment.    [Khantsevich] So you came here with one mission, and then  the  order to take over the army came?    [Lebed] Yes, when I looked into the situation, I realized  that there could be no question of any evacuation and that the  armed conflict could be and had to be stopped.    [Khantsevich] At that stage you found a common language with  the local leaders. During the combat operations, upon their  conclusion particularly, you were frequently seen together. And  then a sudden parting of the ways....    [Lebed] Practically immediately. I will first show you a  document.    I arrived here on 23 June 1992. I became commander on 28  June. On 14 July I received a petition from Senior Justice  Counselor Luchik, prosecutor of the Dniester Moldavian Republic,  for the apprehension of Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko.  This commander of the Dniester Guard 2d Battalion in Bendery, of  sorry renown, was, indeed, a real villain: schizophrenic,  alcoholic, drug addict. This is what it says:    Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko, as commander of  the PMR [Dniester Moldavian Republic] Guard 2d Battalion,  embarked on the path of serious crimes. As of this time he has  unlawfully deprived of life more than 20 persons from the ranks  of peaceful inhabitants, PMR guardsmen, and police officers of  the Republic of Moldova. Kostenko carried out the executions of  the said persons in a state of alcoholic intoxication, as a  rule, without any verification, on suspicion or personal dislike  alone. In connection with Kostenko's criminal activity criminal  proceedings had been instituted in respect to the latter by the  PMR Procuracy on 9 April, and a warrant for his arrest had been  issued on 24 April. But Kostenko was not opportunely arrested.  Considering the above and also the fact that, remaining at  liberty, Kostenko could frustrate the negotiating process  between the PMR and Moldova, I would ask that you assist in  detaining Kostenko and placing him in a cell of the PMR Military  Headquarters. For your information: Kostenko is resourceful and  dangerous, is constantly surrounded by beefed-up security,  enjoys certain support among the activists of Bendery, and could  provoke a massacre in Tiraspol itself."    I was already aware of Kostenko's gangsterism by that time.  At first I believed that this was no concern of mine: Those who  have engendered a criminal, they should be the ones to slay him.  But petitioners came from Bendery in streams--help us, defend  us, save us.... It talks about his 20 victims here, but in  actual fact he killed no fewer than 100.    Having received this petition, therefore, I prepared an  operation and put it into effect on 17 July. A special airborne  battalion and an armored company assigned to it surrounded the  2d Battalion and completely disarmed it, without losses on  either side. Disarmed it handsomely. You need also, after all,  to know how to deliver ultimatums. When a 125-mm gun 100 meters  away is staring you in the face, there is nowhere to hide--a  shell from such a distance will turn the bravest into a heap of  pitiable rags hanging from the bushes.    In a word, the battalion was disarmed. But Kostenko himself  had been removed from his former whereabouts. He had been  spirited away, as we learned subsequently, by people from his  personal guard and the security service of PMR President  Smirnov. And then they finished him off. And they stuck it on me.    Why did they bump off Kostenko? He knew too much. Aside from  the killings, he had, in addition, been involved in robbery on a  very large scale. It is sufficient to say that he stopped a  KamAZ echelon, which was en route from the Western Group of  Forces via Tiraspol, unloaded it, and sold off the motor  vehicles. Mass arms dealings, a monopoly on food in hungry  Bendery--all this was controlled by Kostenko. And it is not hard  to guess why he was disposed of without trial or investigation.    So the disagreements with the local leaders began  immediately. And what you have seen has been simple diplomatic  courtesy. We meet even now and smile at one another. Not all  that sincerely, it is true.    [Khantsevich] That is, the conflict has switched to the  phase  of open confrontation. Has it?    [Lebed] But on each occasion the initiative does not come  from me. There is a mass of examples. An edict of President  Smirnov recently declared the entire air space over the Dniester  region property of the PMR. The sole proprietor is the Aviation  Administration, and within its jurisdiction are the  transportation of passengers and freight, services, and, note,  "all airfields." But there is just one here, and this is  military, Russian at that, what is more.    Further, an edict of that same president of the PMR  "inserted" amendments to the status of servicemen of the Russian  Army on the territory of the Dniester region. Thus in the event  of an agreement being reached on the withdrawal of the 14th Army  and also in the event of the disbandment of the units, all the  equipment and munitions, as, equally, the rest of the property,  shall be declared the property of the PMR. All this is aimed,  perhaps, only at the utmost exacerbation of relations with  Russia. Only people who are not planning on staying here could  behave this way, it being to their advantage to make a mess of  things and slip away on the quiet, seeing as there is somewhere  to go to....    [Khantsevich] Have there been any actions taken against you  personally?    [Lebed] Leaflets have been posted in Tiraspol with the  following content: "Alarm! Alert! Lebed, funded by Borovoy  (Moscow) and Manukyan (Tiraspol), is preparing bloody terror on  the land of the Dniester region. His purpose is the seizure of  power, destruction of the armed forces of the PMR, and surrender  of the republic to Romania. People of the Dniester region, be  vigilant! Lebed is the Judas of the Dniester region!" This  lunacy has been circulated in Tiraspol, but entirely opposite  information is being tossed Moscow newspapers of a particular  persuasion: "According to information received by the  newspaper, there has been a very serious change in the situation  in the Dniester region. Leaflets calling for the ouster of  President Smirnov have been posted throughout Tiraspol. As our  informant observed, this has been done on the directions of  General Lebed.    Part of the army has been put on a state of alert, and  the servicemen are being confined to barracks in body  armor."    The very environment of the activity of a number of local  leaders has accustomed them to being unable to live without  provocations. Some of them are conclusively entangled in corrupt  business. No way out, political, at least, is in sight. The  international isolation of the Dniester region has not eased  but, on the contrary, has intensified as of late. Plus the  economic impasse. You are carrying local money? It is a charm,  not money. They take a regular postage stamp and stick it on an  old Soviet note, and all this is passed off as a brilliant  invention of thinking humanity.    So that when everything is going badly, when a mass of  malcontents appears, all vile, unprofessional politicians start  to operate according to the stereotype--they switch tracks. The  search for an enemy--foreign, internal--gets under way. If the  foreign enemy does not work, let's have an internal one. It was  decided for some reason or other that I would be a suitable  candidate for an enemy. But I am no candidate for whipping-boy.  All this is short-sighted, and is being done quite clumsily,  what is more.    Then stage two--the organization of an armed  conflict--begins. For war, as we know, writes off everything.    A special situation was introduced in the Dniester region on  18 January. For what reason--no one can articulately explain.  Initially in connection, allegedly, with the elections in  Moldova--an exacerbation of the situation is possible, they  said, provocations cannot be ruled out.... But the elections  were held long since, and in organized fashion, what is more,  without conflicts. Politically sober-minded people have come to  power in Kishinev [Chisinau], a dialogue with them is possible.  But the special situation was ultimately extended for a month,  then for another....    [Khantsevich] Nonetheless, as long as Russian troops remain  in the Dniester region, it may be hoped that things will not  reach the point of a new armed clash. But there is information  that a decision on the conversion of the 14th Army into a  military base of Russia has already been adopted....    [Lebed] All this is much ado about nothing. The president of  Russia was in Georgia. There is nowhere currently for the very  sovereign Georgians to go, and they have found themselves  completely penned in. And so the following agreement was signed:  through the end of 1995, a transitional period, and as of 1  January 1996 there will be on the territory of Georgia three  Russian bases--army, naval, and air. And by analogy political  dreamers began to ponder what might happen in the Dniester  region. A base, for certain. And the commotion begins again.  There is no such decision.    [Khantsevich] What, then, do you yourself see as the fate of  the 14th?    [Lebed] Were I asked whether it were normal for the army of  one state to be on the territory of another, I would answer: No,  it is not. Should it be withdrawn? Undoubtedly. But when--this  is another matter. When the political and economic conditions  for its withdrawal have been created.    By political I mean the imparting of an international-legal  base to the relations of the left and right banks of the  Dniester. Some people must be serious guarantors that there will  be no more war here. Meanwhile, whether some people like it or  not, a certain military-political balance has taken shape here,  albeit somewhat spontaneously. People would simply not let the  army leave.    Economic conditions. Thanks to Mr. Shevardnadze, quite  enough  forces have been withdrawn to Russia. Withdrawn thus: officers,  into barracks, barns, and henhouses; tanks, into the open fields.    Only when we have built some things there: apartments, in  full measure, barracks, 50 percent at least, then, with the  appropriate political background, the army might get under way.  There is no technical problem--planning an echelon and  transferring it. Although there is one "but" also: munitions.  They can neither be dumped nor eliminated in situ--there is too  much of them. So they have to be withdrawn in small special  quantities. How would Ukraine view this, would it be happy at  such dangerous freight crossing its territory? What would it ask  for this? If we exclude weekends and holidays from the days on  which they are withdrawn, I would not even attempt to say how  long it would take. Several years, in short.    And when the Moldovan side continues to insist on the  withdrawal of the 14th Army before 1 July 1994, this is not even  funny. It is personal ambition pure and simple.    If the Germans, say, want the troops to leave their  territory, they render us the utmost help and assistance.  Moldova, on the other hand, has yet to provide one ruble to help  the Russian military relocate and fend for itself and has only  presented ultimatums.    [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, great interest was  aroused  in military circles, as among the public at large, for that  matter, by the book entitled "The Performance Was Called a  Putsch," in which you described the events of August 1991. Now,  as far as I know, you are working on yet another book. You are  not yet, it would seem, of an age to be sitting down to write  your memoirs. What has prompted an active general to take up the  pen?    [Lebed] There is, in fact, one book. What you read about the  putsch was merely a chapter from the future "Notes of an Army  Commander," a provisional title, it is true.    This book is not so much one of reminiscences as a  conversation with the reader. I myself have been attempting to  understand what kind of country ours is--great and at the same  time unfortunate. When will we start to respect ourselves, when  will we bring into line the colossal territory with its enormous  wealth and the living standard of the 150 millions persons  inhabiting it?    And if just some of the people who read this booklet ask  themselves such questions, I will consider it not to have been  written in vain.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Cable &amp; Wireless 10-year issue draws strong demand THE strong appetite of international investors for Eurosterling bonds was demonstrated yesterday by the successful launch of Pounds 400m paper despite of a sharp sell-off in the UK government bond market. Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK-listed telecommunications company, chose a difficult day to make a debut Pounds 150m 10-year bond issue, lead managed by Samuel Montagu. At the 10-year maturity gilts prices closed down a full point. However, Cable &amp; Wireless attracted strong international buying before gilts prices started to collapse. Participants in the deal reported strong buying from Far Eastern investors early in the day. The company's Asian telecommunications subsidiaries account for around two thirds of profits. UK investment managers were also strong buyers of paper issued by the UK's 17th largest company by market capitalisation. The 10 3/8 per cent bonds were priced to yield 86 basis points more than gilts of the same maturity, seen as fair by most underwriting firms. By the close of trading the yield spread over gilts had narrowed to 81 basis points, although this also reflected higher government bond yields. The proceeds of the issue will be used to finance capital expenditure, including investment by Mercury, the UK telecommunications licence holder. Cable &amp; Wireless has an annual capital expenditure programme of around Pounds 1bn. Finland also saw a warm response to its Pounds 250m five-year deal, lead managed by Warburg Securities, despite losing its top triple-A credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, on Tuesday. The 9 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points more than UK government bonds, considered generous enough to overcome any negative sentiment. Buying of the bonds was dominated by continental European investors starved of high-quality sterling bonds in recent months. Elsewhere, Turkey increased its Dollars 150m five-year bond issue launched on Tuesday to Dollars 200m in the face of strong buying from fund managers hungry for high-yield assets.</p>

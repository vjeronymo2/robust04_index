			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (7): When waste is the issue - Surplus packaging becomes a liability EARLIER this year, a group of activists from the Women's Environmental Network went into the Islington branch of J Sainsbury, ripped off the 'excess' packaging on several items and dumped it at the supermarket's check-outs. Whether retailers and food manufacturers like it or not, packaging has become a hot environmental concern because of its high visibility and seeming wastefulness. Supermarket chains have been quick to pick up on the mood and have launched a variety of projects to seize the initiative. The Institute of Grocery Distribution, a trade association for food manufacturers and retailers, has set up an Industry Policy Issues Council, one of whose functions is to examine what its members can jointly do to tackle environmental concerns. Individual supermarket chains have also started schemes to encourage better use of packaging materials and recycling. One of the most interesting of these has been a pledge by Gateway that within five years it would cut by half the energy consumption of the packaging passing through its 725 stores. Mr Iain Wolsey, Gateway's marketing director, says this will involve 'painful changes' in the way that the company conducts its business. But he adds: 'We have to solve this problem otherwise someone else will solve it for us.' Last year, Gateway asked the Landbank Consultancy, an environmental advisory group led by Mr Bryn Jones, a former chairman of Greenpeace, to study ways in which the company could improve its activities with regard to the environment. The consultancy drew up a report on the relative harmfulness of various packaging materials which will now form the basis of Gateway's action programme. Mr Jones says the report would prove controversial but that he wishes to stimulate a debate about the use of packaging materials. 'We want to talk to all the industries involved to see if we made any mistakes. There are substantial environmental benefits to be gained from discussing these issues together,' Mr Jones says. The report studied various packaging materials and ranked them according to environmental performance. It attached penalty points to different materials depending on the degree of harmfulness to the environment. The report listed the packaging materials which were least harmful to the environment in the following order: re-usable glass, paper, laminates, non-returnable glass, tinplate, aluminium and plastics. The most important factor in determining environmental harmfulness was the amount of energy a packaging material consumed throughout its entire life cycle, from production to disposal. On this scale, non-returnable glass and aluminium were considered highly undesirable materials while paper and laminates scored well. However, the bleach used in paper manufacturing, which is damaging to the environment, and the difficulty of recycling laminates counted heavily against these materials in other categories. Other factors taken into consideration were the environmental costs of extracting raw materials, the pollution caused in manufacturing the products, and the ease with which they could be recycled. The report went on to identify several ways in which Gateway could achieve this reduction in energy use and proposed a 10 point programme that it should follow. It suggested that Gateway could encourage packaging companies to reduce the volume of material by designing new forms of packaging or using different materials. It could also encourage new delivery and collection systems for its products, promote recycling and waste management schemes and use re-usable or returnable containers more widely. The Landbank consultancy urged Gateway to initiate a widespread debate on environmental issues, both within its own company and within the retailing and packaging companies generally. Ms Penny Walker, a recycling campaigner for Friends of the Earth, says the report makes an interesting contribution to the debate on packaging issues and she highlights two particular aspects which have not generally been considered in the debate. First, she says the report placed considerable emphasis on the effects of material extraction on habitats and species. 'What it attempts to do is to look at the direct impact on sensitive habitats like rain forests.' So, for example, aluminium scored badly because of the environmental damage that its extraction causes. The second area was the report's emphasis on the re-usability of packaging. 'The retailers' biggest problem is going to be to make the necessary leap of the imagination to use refillable containers.' Such containers could be used for drinks or for cosmetics, such as those used at Body Shop, which are packaged in refillable plastic bottles. Mr Tony Baldry, a junior environment minister who was present at the launch of the Gateway initiative, welcomed the move saying it would provide a 'useful lead in the direction we all want to go'. And he warned that unless other companies demonstrated their willingness to act on environmental issues then the Government would consider further action to compel them along the route. The food industry will also face increasing pressure from Europe to set high environmental standards as the Commission is currently drawing up a packaging directive, due to be published in the autumn, which looks as though it will set stiff recycling requirements. The Germans have already taken a decisive lead in this area and its parliament recently passed a tough law on waste management which requires industry to take back and re-use 80 per cent of packaging materials by 1995. The environmental trend is clear. Food manufacturers and retailers ignore it at their peril.</p>

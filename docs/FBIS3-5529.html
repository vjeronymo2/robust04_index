Christopher's three-day visit will be the first direct  high-level contact between Tokyo and Washington after U.S.  President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  jointly announced the collapse of bilateral trade framework  negotiations in Washington last month.    The failure of the talks, aimed at redressing the huge trade  imbalance, prompted the U.S. Government to take tough actions  against Japan, including an executive order to reinstate a 1988  trade law.    The Super 301 measure gives the U.S. Administration broad  powers to impose sanctions against countries it judges to have  unfair trade practices.    While U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in  announcing the step that the U.S. is not "designating or  identifying any practice of any country today," the action is  widely said to be targeting Japan to press it into reducing its  more than 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.    Reinstatement of Super 301 was reportedly considered by U.S.  officials as soon as bilateral trade talks broke down on  February 11.    While voicing conern over such "unilateral" moves in the  wake  of the just-concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations, the Japanese Government, at least on surface,  reacted calmly, saying it was expected because Clinton had  hinted of a reinstatement since his presidential election  campaign.    Tokyo and Washington, failing to close the gap on the  concept  of "objective criteria" to measure the penetration of imports  into Japanese markets, are now in a cooling-off period.    Japan, under pressure from the U.S. and Europe to open its  markets to reduce its growing current account and trade  surpluses, is currently making strenuous efforts to hammer out a  package of voluntary market-opening measures by the end of the  month.    When Christopher meets Japanese leaders, including Hosokawa  and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, probably on Thursday,  bilateral economic problems, including the failed framework  talks, are likely to be high on the agenda, Foreign Ministry  sources said.    The Japanese side is expected to explain the upcoming  market-  opening package and seek U.S. understanding, while expressing  concern over the reinstatement of Super 301, according to  sources.    "I think there are great attentions to what Christopher has  to say concerning the framework talks," a senior ministry  official said.    "But frankly, I don't think there will be any new moves as a  result of the visit," the official said on condition of  anonymity.    As ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said, it may be  difficult to offer Christopher "concrete ideas " about the  market-opening package although the cabinet ministers meet  Wednesday to map it out.    "The government does need a bit more time before it is able  to make an announcement on the complete action to be taken,"  Terada said.    With no immediate breakthrough likely in the economic arena,  the Japanese officials hope to deflect focus on economic and  trade issues and instead shed more light on two other aspects of  bilateral relations, the political and security fields.    "It's a good opportunity to show that Japan-U.S. relations  do not simply revolve around economic matters," another senior  ministry official said.    Terada said that economic and trade problems are "just one  of  the agenda items" and that Christopher's visit provides "ample  opportunity to exchange views on the international situation."    Hosokawa and Christopher are likely to discuss China, since  the secretary of state will fly to Beijing after leaving Tokyo  on Friday and Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China from March 19  to 21, he said.    Christopher and Japanese leaders are expected to reaffirm  the  importance of bilateral security arrangements and reconfirm  cooperation in solving problems involving North Korea's nuclear  development.    Japan and the U.S. are also expected to hold the first "two-  plus-two" security talks, with undersecretary of defense Frank  Wisner accompanying Christopher. Defense Agency Director  General Kazuo Aichi will join Hata.    Christopher will also attend an international conference on  aid to Cambodia on Thursday and deliver a speech to business  leaders Friday.    This will be Christopher's third trip to Japan. He visited  Tokyo last April to attend the Group of Seven (G-7) ministerial  conference on aid to Russia and last July for the G-7 summit  meeting.</p>

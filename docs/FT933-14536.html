			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Chemical safety failures found MORE THAN a quarter of employers do not comply with health and safety regulations on hazardous substances nearly four years after the introduction of new rules, research by the Health and Safety Executive yesterday revealed. The executive said it was 'encouraged' that 71 per cent of employers surveyed had implemented the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 'satisfactorily or with just minor shortcomings'. However, the MSF general technical union yesterday accused the executive of complacency over the research results. Ms Judith Church, the union's health and safety officer, said: 'We know the ICIs and DuPonts have done a lot of work on Coshh. The problem is in the small organisations where half of the total workforce are employed.' A government review aimed at cutting red tape is under way, with health and safety one of the areas under scrutiny. The executive is probably stressing the positive side of the research results because it wishes to highlight the benefits to businesses of complying with health and safety regulations, while minimising the bureaucratic burdens involved. The regulations, which took effect in October 1989, are described by the executive as 'one of the most significant pieces of health and safety legislation since the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974'. They cover all potentially dangerous substances from typewriter correction fluid to farm pesticides. All employers are supposed to produce an assessment of potential hazards and take appropriate action to protect and monitor the health of their employees. The research shows that 22 per cent of employers 'needed to make more effort to comply with Coshh'. A further 6 per cent 'had made little or no attempt' to meet the requirements of the regulations. The executive added that some companies had gone 'over the top' in complying with the regulations - 11 per cent had carried out assessments that went beyond what was required by law. Those assessments which had been prepared by employers without outside help were rated as highly as those prepared by consultants.</p>

This period is also  intended to facilitate the work of the Greek presidency of the  European Union [EU], which began 1 January and ends 30 June.    Although Foreign Minister Javier Solana has diplomatically  denied during several of his parliamentary appearances that the  establishment of relations with Macedonia by six EU countries  (Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, and  Denmark) represents a major failure of the common foreign and  security policy, it could hardly be interpreted otherwise when  half the EU countries reject what the other six approve in an  especially difficult situation such as that prevailing in the  former Yugoslavia. To this must be added another affront which  the Spanish Government will hardly forget: Chancellor Kohl  publicly lied during the Spanish-German summit in Granada when  -- asked at a news conference whether his country was preparing  to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia  -- he replied that the matter was not on his government's agenda  for the next few months. Ten days later Bonn announced the  exchange of ambassadors with Skopje.    For Spain and the other EU countries which did not support  the French, British, and German initiative, the aim now is to  facilitate the course of the Greek presidency, which looks like  being difficult. "To send ambassadors to Skopje now will not  resolve the political and security problem threatening that  republic and the Kosovo region. The United Nations undertook a  serious commitment by sending Blue Helmets to Macedonia, and  Spain supports this decision. We must bide our time and hope  that the Macedonians and Greeks will reach a compromise  solution," a Spanish diplomatic source told LA VANGUARDIA.    The Spanish Government has been quite sensitive to the  criticisms condemning it for not joining the group of the  European "heavyweights" in establishing diplomatic relations  with Macedonia. However, everything indicates that the exchange  of ambassadors will not take place until midsummer.</p>

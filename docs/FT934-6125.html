			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / DVLA censured for licence 'errors' Hundreds of professional drivers lost their licences or had applications refused because of 'serious errors' by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, says a report yesterday from Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman. One lorry driver lost a job he had held for 20 years because his licence was unjustly revoked. The driver - who had his licence returned, but could not get his job back or find a new one - is to be compensated. The DVLA has agreed that a further 230 drivers can submit compensation claims. The report said the DVLA had made serious errors in preparing and interpreting eyesight regulations.</p>

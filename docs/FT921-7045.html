			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Surge at Mabuchi Motor MABUCHI Motor, the Japanese motor producer, boosted pre-tax profit for 1991 by 30.6 per cent to Y17.29bn (Dollars 135m), as domestic demand for its components remained strong in spite of slowing economic growth. The company, which assembles most of its motors in other Asian countries, lifted sales for the year 15.3 per cent to Y69.6bn, with demand strong for both its completed motors and motor parts. Overseas production bases enabled it to avoid the cost increases experienced by other Japanese exporters because of last year's appreciation of the yen. But Mabuchi expects that slower demand this year from car makers and electronics companies Sales of Y73bn are predicted, with a fall in pre-tax profit to Y16.3bn.</p>

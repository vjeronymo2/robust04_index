			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Dumping penalties are still core problem - Steel ONE of the more hollow commitments in the Quad's market access report to G7 leaders was to cut steel tariffs to zero. This is not because zero tariffs are not achievable, but because conflict in the steel sector lies elsewhere - in over-production and alleged dumping. Indeed, formal tariff barriers on steel products are already low, averaging about 5 per cent. By contrast, the US is levying tariffs of up to 109 per cent on flat-rolled steel on charges of foreign dumping or subsidies in the US market. It is these duties - the upshot of cases still to be ruled on by the International Trade Commission on July 27 - which have so infuriated Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. In spite of international protests over US legal procedures that have led to such draconian dumping duties, neither President Bill Clinton nor Mr Mickey Kantor, his trade representative, have impeded the process, which is expected to eliminate most foreign flat-rolled steel from the US market. It was not until he began his round of pre-summit interviews that Mr Clinton addressed the steel issue directly. He told reporters: 'We can discuss the facts. But there's nothing wrong with our law, and it's not different from the laws of a lot of other countries.' In spite of such strong words, the route to settlement of both the dumping duty row, and to successful introduction of zero tariffs, is a Multilateral Steel Agree-ment. This MSA has been the subject of angry and fruitless negotiation for several years. Talks collapsed in March last year, and resumed in Geneva yesterday. By including steel on the list of sectors destined for zero tariffs, the US has put a firm marker down that no Uruguay Round deal will be done without the MSA issue being resolved.</p>

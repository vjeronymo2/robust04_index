			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SUSPECT SEIZED IN SHOOTING SPREE AT RESTAURANT IN UNIVERSAL CITY  </P> <P> A man who was asked to leave a Universal City restaurant after an argument in a  bar returned and fired several shots at security guards and about 100 other  patrons this morning but no one was injured, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department reported.  </P> <P> The suspect, identified as Charles Bryant, 31, of Studio City, was then chased  by the security guards and captured after the 1:30 a.m. shooting in front of  the Victoria Station restaurant. He was arrested on suspicion of attempted  murder and was being held without bail in the sheriff's West Hollywood  substation jail.  </P> <P> Deputy Roger Hom said Bryant had been in the bar of the restaurant, located in  the entertainment and studio complex off Lankershim Boulevard. Bryant got into  an argument with another patron and was asked by the restaurant manager to  leave, Hom said.  </P> <P> Bryant returned as the restaurant was closing and patrons were leaving. Hom  said the suspect fired two shots from a semi-automatic pistol at two unarmed  security guards and then turned and fired at least nine more shots at the  patrons leaving the restaurant. Hom did not know how far away from the people  Bryant stood when shooting. "Miraculously, none of the scattering patrons were  hit by the gunfire," he said.  </P></p>

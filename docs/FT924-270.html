			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Management takes over Atco Qualcast for Pounds 17m THE management of Atco Qualcast has completed a Pounds 17m buy-out from Blue Circle Industries of the Suffolk-based lawnmower manufacturer. The deal is being equity-financed by institutions investing through Candover Investments, the investment trust specialising in management buy-outs and development capital projects. Bank term debt worth Pounds 8m and working capital facilities are being provided by Bank of Scotland. Mr Stephen Roberts, head of the management team, said Atco Qualcast had successfully consolidated its operations after closing its Derby factory in 1991. It had increased market share this year, returned to profits on sales of Pounds 40m after two years of losses associated with restructuring costs and poor rainfall. Mr Roberts said prospects for 1993 were good and it was important to complete the buy-out before the company's busy February to June season began. Blue Circle acquired the business when it bought Birmid Qualcast, the Birmingham engineering group, in 1988.</p>

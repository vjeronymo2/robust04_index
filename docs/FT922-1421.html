			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: Sounds from the myth makers - Technically Speaking The myth-making industry has outdone itself with two products set to be launched later this year: the minidisc and the digital compact cassette, new digital recording formats developed by Sony and by Philips and Matsushita. The companies themselves can be absolved of blame. It is natural, after all, that they want to see us throw out perfectly good electronic equipment and replace it with the latest gizmos. Yet an extraordinary number of new audio products have been acclaimed as winners before anyone has seen or heard them except in prototype form. The first myth about these latest offerings is that because MD and DCC are digital they must sound as good as compact discs. While audiophiles may argue over CD quality, it is undeniable that the sound which hi-fi equipment makers have been able to achieve on a CD has improved over the years as they have gained experience with digital processing. Unfortunately that experience may not be directly transferable because the MD and DCC formats are different from CDs and from each other. Indeed, MD and DCC may never match a CD in quality because they employ compression technologies to store more information in a small space. Compression works by eliminating storage of repeated information, theoretically not needed, but this is a bit like saying that a frozen vegetable tastes theoretically like a fresh one because everything important is preserved. The test is in the tasting, or in this case the listening, and the final quality depends on how well the engineers do their jobs. No one knows just yet. And don't believe anyone who claims to have heard the two new technologies run off against CDs. Proper testing comparisons of audio equipment is a subjective business, often best performed in the quiet of your own living room. The second myth is that MD is in direct competition with DCC, and that only one can succeed. Although both are digital recording formats, from the point of view of consumers, they will be competing in different segments of the traditional analogue cassette market, and probably not against CDs at all. DCC will appeal to consumers ready to replace their old tape recorder who want to be able to play old cassettes on the new machine, while at the same time enjoying the advantages of digital sound, namely the absence of background noise. But consumers ought to ask whether their old cassettes will sound nearly as good on the new machines as on the analogue recorder they now own, which probably has high-quality sound reproduction already. And while no tape hiss is a strong point, musical fidelity of DCC for digital tapes may be no better than the analogue machines. MD, by contrast, is really for people on the go, who want recordable digital sound in an extremely small package. In a few years, when the engineers have time to shrink it further, an MD machine may be a fraction of the size of the smallest currently available Walkmen-type cassette players, and will offer instant access to musical tracks just as a CD does. In short, both formats have a their place. Indeed, Sony, as one of the world's biggest manufacturers of magnetic tape, has a strong interest in seeing both products succeed. DCC, apparently rival to Sony's MD, will happily use Sony tape. The third myth is that the fate of the the companies involved, if not the entire consumer electronics industry, hangs on the success of these two products. Certainly the consumer electronics industry is in the doldrums, in large part because of a lack of exciting new blockbuster products. Yet neither DCC nor MD really offers the promise of revolutionising the music industry, as did the launch of compact discs a decade ago. More likely, both will be moderately successful products that will neither make nor break their backers.</p>

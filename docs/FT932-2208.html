			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BT's chance to repeat its success story - Andrew Adonis and Philip Coggan analyse whether the latest BT share offer has attractions for private investors ON PAST performance, BT is a good buy. In the first seven years after privatisation, BT's pre-tax profits increased every year, rising from Pounds 1.4bn in 1985 to Pounds 3.08bn in 1991. In 1992 profits stabilised; in the year to March 31 this year they fell to Pounds 1.97bn, but allowing for the company's massive redundancy programme, earnings per share still rose. Analysts are forecasting profits of over Pounds 3bn this year. BT's share price, up from 240p at the start of 1988 to a high of 445p this year, has markedly outperformed the FT-A All Share index over the period. Dividends have increased every year since privatisation, rising from a net 6.5p per share in 1985 to 15.6p for the year to March 1993. The gross yield on the fully paid shares is 4.7 per cent, and the price earnings ratio 19.6. With the final dividend for the 1992/93 year payable on the 150p partly-paid shares, and the interim dividend due before the second instalment is payable, the prospective gross yield on the partly-paid shares is 13.3 per cent. BT even seems to be regulator- and recession-proof. Profits have prospered in spite of successive price caps imposed by the regulator Oftel. Turnover rose marginally between 1991 and 1992, and fell only from Pounds 13.3bn in 1991/92 to Pounds 13.2bn in 1992/93. With underlying turnover growth of 2.8 per cent in the quarter to March 31, BT looks set to match the revival in the UK economy. Add in the bonuses for the small investor, the low returns available elsewhere, and cheap dealing offers, and the blandishments of Inspector Morose are hard to resist. However, as UBS's latest BT research bulletin notes: 'BT's track record as a guide to future performance has declined over time.' This, it argues, is because BT will lose market share to new operators; and because volume growth for BT will translate into lower levels of revenue growth as the price cap becomes progressively tighter. Both points carry weight. BT's price cap is set to tighten by a further 1.25 per cent in August, from the retail price index minus 6.25 per cent to RPI minus 7.5 per cent for each of the four years until 1997. In a period of low inflation, BT will have to work exceptionally hard to sustain turnover growth. The UK telecoms market place is getting more competitive by the month. In the international market, companies reselling leased lines are undercutting BT prices; in the trunk market, two new companies are constructing national networks; while in the local market, cable TV companies are offering telephone services at discounts to BT. Then there is BT's global strategy. The merits of last month's decision to spend nearly Dollars 5bn of shareholders' funds on a grand alliance with MCI, the second largest US carrier, have yet to be proven. Of the Dollars 5bn, Dollars 4.3bn is, in effect, a straight investment in the US carrier; the rest is for a joint venture intended to make BT the prime supplier of telecoms services to the world's multinational companies. Success depends upon the market for multinationals appearing, and upon MCI sustaining its remarkable success in gaining market share from entrenched US operators. Neither venture is assured. Small investors should not believe BT has a licence to print money. Nonetheless, most analysts do not believe BT is set on a downward path. Take competition. In its nine years of operation, Mercury has secured barely eight per cent of the market. In the long term, new entrants could be a significant threat, but most projections show BT losing only some two to three per cent of market share for the next few years - and that in a fast growing market. Nor is BT standing still. In the past three years the company has shed nearly a third of its staff; and a further 30,000 are set to go in the next two years. With improved efficiency is coming improved service quality and a sharper marketing strategy. As to BT's overseas adventures, its bid for a global role looks plausible in a more integrated international business world for which advanced communications are the lifeblood. And should the worst happen, BT could blow a billion or two without too much pain. How to buy The government likes to use privatisations as a means of encouraging wider share ownership, hence the concept of 'share shops' which is being trotted out again, as it was for BT2. However, in striving to ensure that the offer is successful, the government has made buying shares in BT complicated. There are two routes for private investors, the public offer and the retail tender. The latter is designed for larger private investors and those who want to put BT shares into a personal equity plan. Shares are being sold in three instalments. The first instalment is 150p for those who apply through the public offer (see below). The second instalment, payable in March 1994, will be 140p. The third instalment will be payable in October 1994; the price will be set later. The price of 150p on the first instalment of the public offer represents a discount to the price which will be paid by the institutions, but the size of that discount will not be set until June 29. The public offer. Those who want to apply for shares via the public offer can choose between two routes; by calling the share information office (081-200-3000) or by registering via one of 150 'share shops'. Most major banks, many building societies and leading stockbrokers are acting as share shops. The share shop route is best. For a start, those who apply via a share shop will receive preference when it comes to allocating shares. Furthermore, many of the share shops are offering cut price dealing rates, or other attractions, for registrants. It is especially important for those who were pre-registered (automatically the case for BT shareholders and employees) to realise this. Unless they register again with a share shop, they will not head the queue for allocations. Bottom of the pile when shares are handed out will be members of the public who did not register with the share information office or a share shop. Next in line will be people who register with the SIO, but who were not previously BT shareholders. Above them are ranked existing BT shareholders, or those who register via a share shop (preference between these two classes will be decided later). Top of the list (apart from employees) will be existing BT shareholders who register with a share shop. There is nothing to stop investors registering with the share information office and with one, or more, share shops. However, they can only make one application on their own behalf through the public offer (other family members are entitled to apply separately). Investors have a choice of further incentives to buy the shares. They can opt for 10p off the price of the second and third instalments. Alternatively, they can have one bonus share for every 15 shares they hold until July 31, 1996, subject to a maximum of 150 bonus shares. The minimum application allowed in the public offer, which closes on July 14, is for 120 shares, or Pounds 180. The retail tender. This route is for those who want the maximum number of shares. In addition, those people who want to put their shares in a Pep (see below) will get preferential treatment in the tender. The 'cut off point' is that those who apply for more than 2,000 shares will get better treatment in the retail tender than in the public offer. Indeed, 2,000 shares is the minimum for tender applicants (except for those who want a Pep). The disadvantage of the tender route is that investors will not get the incentives available via the public offer, ie no discount on any of the instalments and no bonus shares. The price they pay will be determined with reference to the bids of the institutions for shares. The only way of applying via the retail tender is through a stockbroker. A full list of those taking part will not be available until June 29. The retail tender closes on July 16. Personal Equity Plans. Share offers which come in several instalments create headaches for private investors. You cannot have part of a share in a Pep and part outside it. The first two instalments lie in the current tax year, so Pep investors must allow for this. If you want to put your BT shares in a single company Pep, then you can effectively apply for 1,000 shares. This is the minimum allowed under the tender rules, and the two instalments would cost you Pounds 2,900, just under the annual Pounds 3,000 limit for a single company Pep. You will also have to use up part of your single company allowance in 1994-95, to meet the third instalment. Those who want to put their shares in a general Pep will probably opt for 2,000 shares. The two instalments would cost Pounds 5,800, just under the Pounds 6,000 allowance. Part of next year's Pep will be needed to meet the third instalment. Where to buy As there are 150 share shops, it is difficult to produce a comprehensive list of deals. Some brokers have yet to decide on their dealing rates. Furthermore, share shops have been discouraged from over-emphasising their cheap selling services, on the grounds that the government wants to promote the long term attractions of BT shares. Many share shops will not be participating in the retail tender, and a full list is not yet available. So once investors have found a share shop (they have their own bull and bear logo), they should ask whether they can use it for the tender. The following offers are among those currently available: Barclays Bank is offering to deal for a minimum of Pounds 12.50 through its share shop, and its Barclayshare Portfolio Administration and Barclayshare Advisory Services. Those who apply through the share shop can also trade Abbey National, Barclays Bank, British Gas and TSB shares at Pounds 12.50. Up to four family members can lump together deals at no extra charge. Dunbar, Boyle &amp; Kingsley (071-247-8898) will deal at 1 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 15. Up to ten holdings can be batched together at no extra charge so six holdings at Pounds 250 each would be charged Pounds 15 in total. Killik (071-515-0398) operates a postal dealing service for a flat Pounds 10 fee. The broker needs the share certificate and the transfer deed before it can deal. Lloyds Bank is offering a selling commission of 1 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 11. National &amp; Provincial BS (0800-220396) will deal in BT3 shares for a flat Pounds 9.75 via a postal service. Up to three further family members can deal for Pounds 2.50. National Westminster Bank is offering a minimum commission of Pounds 17 on BT shares, and on 450 leading shares. A postal service is available at 1 per cent commission, with a minimum of Pounds 9.95. Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS will deal in 35 privatisation stocks, including BT3 for a minimum of Pounds 9.50 for customers who register with the society, or its stockbroking arm, Waters Lunniss (0603-622265). The Skipton BS (0532-342444) is offering to deal at 1 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 15, for those who register with it. Up to three further family members can deal for an extra Pounds 4.50 each. John Siddall (061-832-7471) is offering to deal for those who register with the broker. In addition, applicants will receive vouchers entitling them to make three further trades for a total commission of Pounds 10. Peps Barclays Bank is waiving its Pep fees for BT registrants. Broker Henderson Crosthwaite (0800-581206) has a self-select Pep (both single company and general), with an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. There is no initial charge for those putting in BT3 shares. John Siddall is offering a Pep with no initial charge and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent plus VAT.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kolbenschmidt posts DM33.4m loss KOLBENSCHMIDT, the car components arm of the Metallgesellschaft industrial group, made a loss of DM33.4m (Dollars 20.46m) in the six months to the end of March. This was more than double the loss of DM14.7m in the first half of 1991-92, but was a considerable improvement on the DM73.9m loss made in the six months to the end of September. The company said conditions for suppliers to the motor industry had worsened in the period. At the parent company, sales dropped 11.4 per cent to DM311.1m over the six months. But Kolbenschmidt said that if the results were measured against the second half of last year, a gradual change in the company's fortunes was noticeable, reflecting rationalisation measures designed to restore profitability. Kolbenschmidt predicted that against a gloomy economic background, it would take until the next financial year for the rationalisation measures to have a substantial effect on profitability. Volkswagen, Europe's leading vehicle manufacturer, sold 1.08m cars worldwide in the first four months of the year, the company said yesterday, 11.7 per cent less than in the same period last year. In Germany the number of vehicles sold fell 22.4 per cent to 358,200; in western Europe as a whole VW sold 747,000 cars, 19 per cent down.</p>

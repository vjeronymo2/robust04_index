			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CALFEST PUTS 'GEOGRAPHY' ON THE MAP  </P> <P> South Coast Repertory had a big weekend. The industrious playgoer could see new  plays by Marlane Meyer, Beth Henley and Robert Daseler, and attend readings of  new scripts by Sam Garcia Jr. and Philip Kan Gotanda, all part of SCR's  California Play Festival -- Calfest.  </P> <P> With time for only one show, I chose Meyer's "The Geography of Luck." This  started as a reading at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and will return there  for a mainstage production in August. It's a work in transition, although you  wouldn't know it from Roberta Levitow's assured SCR production, featuring Ebbe  Roe Smith as an ex-con trying to connect with his life and Elizabeth Ruscio as  a woman who is ready to help him, up to a point.  </P> <P> This is Meyer's third play (after "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish") and we begin to  see where her concerns lie. She's not endorsing "attitude" for attitude's sake  -- although her characters are masters of it. She knows that they are hurting,  and she suggests that the hurt runs through the culture.  </P> <P> She's particularly concerned with men, because they run things. She presents  them as landlocked creatures with a primitive response system, rising only to  power games and sex. What a pity, she says, that they can't respond to the  woman in themselves. What a tragedy that real women have to descend to their  archetypes to find a place in the world.  </P> <P> We could sense Meyer's concerns in "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish," but they are  literally spelled out in "The Geography of Luck," not to the improvement of the  play. The setting is Las Vegas, a world of strippers and used-car sharpsters.  Levitow's SCR cast makes us believe in their sleaze, and we neither expect nor  want them to talk like normal people -- brigands deserve a language of their  own.  </P> <P> It can even be a little high-flown. Thieves do believe that they know it all.  But when Meyer's characters start to talk about "demystifying the landscape,"  one wonders why such informed sensibilities are still drinking Ripple with  their fish sticks. Without losing its fantasy, the language of the play needs  to be taken down a peg.  </P> <P> There is a play here. The story suggests "Tender Mercies" -- an ex-country  singer (Smith) gets redeemed by a good woman (Ruscio). Here, though, the hero  is just out of the pen for having killed his wife. He's also haunted by the  goddess-like image of his mother, a former showgirl (Joan Stuart-Morris). Not  until she becomes just an image, will he be free.  </P> <P> His liberation isn't spelled out, simply played, and it registers. Less  explanation might also deepen the scene where Smith forces his mean-mouthed  father (Al Ruscio) to accept his love -- a fight scene, paradoxically. There's  sound mythic stuff bubbling under "The Geography of Luck," if Meyer would just  remove the footnotes.  </P> <P> Smith and Elizabeth Ruscio are very strong at the center of the play. Neither  asks for sympathy from the audience, and each gets it. Fine, cold supporting  performances come from John Nesci, Scott Burkholder, Ismael (East) Carlo,  Dendrie Taylor and the aforementioned Stuart-Morris, doubling as a customer who  takes Smith for a ride.  </P> <P> Cliff Faulkner's setting isn't lavish -- not with all those other plays on the  budget -- but Susan Denison Geller's costumes are properly hostile and Tom  Ruzika's lights convey the hellishness of a town that never sleeps. Orpheus in  Vegas: it fits.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8:30 p.m., with Saturday-Sunday matinees at 3 p.m.  Closes June 4. Tickets $20-$25. 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. (714)  957-4033.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia will make continuous efforts to give a  clearer perception on the concept of East Asia Economic Caucus,  EAEC, among the various countries such as the U.S. and Japan.  The international trade and industry minister, Datuk Sri  Rafidah Aziz, said such a step had been taken to enable that  EAEC could be launched as soon as possible. Speaking to newsmen  after officiating the Family Day of the Forest Research  Institute of Malaysia, FRIM, in Kepong, she said at present the  U.S. has not made any official stand on the EAEC concept. She  added that the U.S. had expressed uncertainty on EAEC and had  sought views from other countries.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Beazer Homes flotation to raise Pounds 450m Beazer Homes plans to raise sufficient new money to leave it with 'significant' net cash when it is floated next month. Hanson, the conglomerate which acquired the whole of Beazer in December 1991, plans to sell all its shares in the float. The new money being raised could increase the size of the offer to over Pounds 450m. The extra money will help the company, the fourth largest UK housebuilder, to expand annual completions from 4,805 in the financial year to end-September, to 7,000 a year by the late 1990s. It also plans to move up-market. According to James Capel, joint broker to the issue, this strategy suggests annual profits could then exceed Pounds 60m. In its latest financial year Beazer Homes made an operating profit of Pounds 37.5m. Yesterday Hanson announced that Mr Victor Benjamin, deputy chairman of Tesco, the food retailer, and of Lex Service, the car distribution and leasing group, is to become chairman of Beazer Homes, while Mr David Legg, joint managing director of GE Capital Europe, part of the US financial services group, is to be a non-executive director. Another non-executive will be appointed. Beazer Homes has not published its balance sheet for September 30 1993, but James Capel estimates it had net assets at that time of Pounds 120m to Pounds 130m. Since then it has acquired Walker Homes, a Scottish housebuilder, for up to Pounds 28.2m, adding 1,488 plots to the land bank, and bought another 770 plots. Hoare Govett, lead broker on the issue, and James Capel have each published pre-prospectus research. Both say that the value of Beazer Homes' land bank, at Pounds 8,500 a plot, is well below that for other national housebuilders. Beazer Homes has a bias towards Scotland and the north of England where land is cheaper. The low land value follows a Pounds 75.5m write-down of the land bank in the 1992 accounts, part of a Pounds 99.3m provision. Of the Pounds 75.5m, Pounds 49.1m was written off the value of land in the south and Pounds 22.4m against the Midlands. The provision cut land values to a level where Beazer Homes could make a 12 1/2 per cent gross margin on houses. Beazer Homes' land bank, totalling 16,117 plots on December 31 last year, is also longer than that of its rivals, at 3.4 times last year's completions, However, James Capel points out that the low written-down value of the land bank will mean the group's profit margins are likely to rise less sharply as the market recovers than those of other housebuilders. A pathfinder prospectus will be issued on February 24, with pricing due on March 10. Applications for the public offer will close on March 18 with dealings in the shares starting on March 25.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Power workers accept merit pay Eastern Electricity's 6,000 employees have agreed a 2.5 per cent pay rise in return for performance assessments of their work in the company's first wage settlement since the abolition of industry-wide bargaining last year. 'After many years of having to implement nationally agreed pay arrangements, Eastern Electricity has now secured a pioneering deal,' said Mr Stephen Connock, personnel director, yesterday. Under the agreement the company is introducing performance pay for its 1,400 professional and supervisory staff who are in unions. This will end union participation in pay bargaining for them. The rest of the workforce will continue for the time being to have their wages negotiated collectively, but their work will be assessed. Eventually the company aims to negotiate full performance pay for its entire workforce. British Coal yesterday warned that more closures among the remaining 22 operating pits were inevitable. But Mr Andrew Horsler, commercial director, said that the programme of restructuring was nearing its end.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK wins backing for EC budget proposal: Rich and poor countries divided over finance plan THE UK won majority support among EC partners yesterday for its compromise on future Community financing, but its tough approach drew a storm of protest from the poorer countries, led by Spain. Britain's refusal to give up its annual rebate of about Pounds 2bn also faced fierce criticism. The UK's compromise package was condemned by Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, as 'a serious political mistake'. He continued to press for his proposal, known as Delors II, to boost the EC budget. Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland joined Mr Delors in opposing the British plan. But there was strong support from Germany and the Netherlands. France, Belgium and Italy, which has it own severe budgetary problems, also appeared to be leaning in Britain's direction, according to EC and German officials. British ministers had been bracing themselves for a furious reaction from EC partners over its plan to limit Community spending. In the event, UK ministers were pleasantly surprised. Britain's compromise envisages holding down the increase in Community spending to 3 per cent a year in real terms for seven years. This would allow for a budget of Ecu79.3bn (Pounds 61bn) by 1999, from Ecu61.1bn this year. Mr Delors wants to boost the EC budget to Ecu82.3bn over the same period, a figure he insists to be in line with the goals of the Maastricht treaty. The split between Europe's prosperous northern tier, led by Germany, and the poorer Mediterranean countries and Ireland emerged during a 'conclave' of foreign and finance ministers in Brussels. Unless Mr John Major can bridge the north-south divide, he risks a destructive budget wrangle overshadowing a crowded agenda during next month's EC summit at Edinburgh. The prime minister is touring European capitals in an effort to narrow differences on enlargement of the Community as well as a resolution of Danish demands for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty. A resolution of the budget impasse is being seen among diplomats in Brussels as the test of Britain's much-criticised presidency. Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, described the budget talks in Brussels as serious and calm. 'There is no guarantee of progress at Edinburgh,' he said 'but we have identified the obstacles and are well-placed for a compromise.' However, he acknowledged, that the UK's refusal to yield to pressure to give up its rebate had been fiercely criticised. The UK remained open to suggestions of reworking how to pay the the money back, but the amount of the rebate remains non-negotiable, he said. The core of the British proposals seeks to raise the maximum size of the EC budget - the so-called own resources ceiling - to 1.25 per cent of EC gross national product by the end of 1999 from 1.2 per cent at present. Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary for finance, said a majority of countries accepted the UK's approach as 'serious' and said it ought to be possible to reach a deal at Edinburgh. Much hard bargaining lies ahead if differences are to be bridged over how to divide the EC pie. Most controversial are the 'cohesion' funds for poorer countries to bring them closer to their prosperous EC partners in the drive to economic and monetary union. The UK's proposal doubles the cohesion and structural funds for the four poorest countries to Ecu12.25bn compared with Ecu15bn under the Delors II package. Peter Norman, Economics Editor, writes: Mr Lamont and other EC finance ministers will take part in the Edinburgh summit, reflecting the growing importance of economic issues in the remaining weeks of the UK presidency.

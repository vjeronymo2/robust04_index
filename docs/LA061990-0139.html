			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'LL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT MOLA, EXECUTIVE SAYS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE FAILURE OF CHARTER SAVINGS BANK WILL HAVE 'NO EFFECT' ON NEWPORT  BEACH-BASED MOLA DEVELOPMENT CORP., ITS FORMER PARENT COMPANY, PETER VON ELTEN  SAYS.  </P> <P> The failure of Charter Savings Bank last week will have "absolutely no effect"  on the continuing operations of its former parent company, Mola Development  Corp., an executive with the Newport Beach real estate firm said Monday.  </P> <P> Mola will continue to conduct business "as usual," said Peter von Elten, Mola's  executive vice president and a former Charter director.  </P> <P> The company is awaiting final approval on a controversial 149-acre $200-million  residential project in Seal Beach for which it has already spent between $8  million and $10 million to develop plans. A favorable court hearing Wednesday  and City Council approval on Monday are the final hurdles, Von Elten said.  </P> <P> Mola also is working out a financing deal to start construction on its  high-rise Mola Centre in Irvine, a $300-million mixed-use project that has been  in the planning stages for three years.  </P> <P> Von Elten said Mola and Charter executives expected the takeover of the thrift,  especially after Mola decided not to invest any more money in Charter. But he  denounced federal regulators for saying they had asked the U.S. Justice  Department to look into the possibility of criminal wrongdoing at Charter,  which has its headquarters next door to Mola.  </P> <P> When they seized Charter on Friday, regulators said they made a "number of  referrals" to the Justice Department.  </P> <P> "There certainly shouldn't be any criminal allegation against any individual or  executive here," Von Elten said. "Mola never used Charter to finance its  projects. We've conducted ourselves properly."  </P> <P> The referrals for a criminal inquiry "seems to be an action they're taking with  each and every institution" they seize, he said.  </P> <P> The call for a criminal investigation also took state regulators by surprise.  </P> <P> "We certainly didn't have any inkling of this," said William D. Davis, acting  commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loans. He described Mola's  owner, Frank J. Mola, as a "very reliable person."  </P> <P> One industry source knowledgeable about the referrals said the request centers  on two sets of loan transactions. The source would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Both Davis and Von Elten said Charter's 1988 acquisition of failing Merit  Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles became an albatross, especially after the  federal thrift rescue law, enacted last year, set up tough capital standards.  </P> <P> "The Merit acquisition just killed them," Davis said. "It had a drastic effect  on their operating ability. They had monthly operating losses that were  significant. Couple that with the new law's dictates on capital and net worth,  and they were just not able to recover."  </P> <P> Von Elten also objected to comments made Friday by the Office of Thrift  Supervision that Charter was plagued by poorly documented files and bad  management and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.  </P> <P> In routine examinations, he said, federal agents always praised Charter for its  clean operations. And any unsafe operating claim is based solely on the  thrift's low level of capital, its final reserve against losses, he said.  </P> <P> Regulators determined that, under the tougher standards, Charter had run out of  capital. They also rejected Mola's offer to add $4 million in capital.  </P> <P> After the new law changed the rules, Von Elten said, "the only question was  whether we wanted to put more capital into Charter."  </P> <P> "We looked at it real carefully, and we decided we had no further interest in  being in the S&amp;L industry," he said.  </P> <P> Mola Development, incorporated in 1976, started out by specializing in  residential projects. During the last six years, it has expanded to commercial  and industrial developments as well.  </P> <P> It acquired Orange Coast Savings &amp; Loan in 1984, changed the name and  increased the thrift's assets from $125 million to $450 million. Charter had  $308.6 million in assets at the end of April.  </P> <P> "We saved taxpayers money by taking over Orange Coast Savings, which had a heck  of a lot of problems, and by acquiring Merit without federal assistance, and we  turned that around," Von Elten said. "The irony is that if regulators had not  permitted us to acquire Merit, there would have been no problem at Charter."  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Unilever puts a smile on Chinese faces with toothpaste venture UNILEVER IS to set up a joint venture with Shanghai Toothpaste Factory in China for the production and marketing of oral care products. Unilever will have a 60 per cent share in the venture - its sixth in China - which will employ 1,350 people. Shanghai Toothpaste claims to be China's largest toothpaste manufacturer - producing more than 550m tubes a year - and with about 5 per cent of world production, is also the largest manufacturer in Asia. Its brands Zhonghua (China) and Maxam are well known in China, while Maxam is also exported to several Asian and African countries. With a population of over 1.2bn, the Chinese oral care market has substantial growth potential. Toothpaste is already widely used and there are significant opportunities as oral hygiene consciousness increases, prompted by educational programmes aimed at the predominantly young population. Shanghai Toothpaste and Unilever will team up to utilise technological and marketing expertise to further develop the Chinese brands, together with Unilever's existing international brands which will be introduced in China. Unilever's brands include Signal, Mentadent, Pepsodent and Close-Up. The transaction will be subject to the approval of the Shanghai authorities.</p>

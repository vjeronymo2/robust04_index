			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Early warning to put safety first The Cullen Inquiry into the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 found that if the public address system on Piper Alpha had not failed, more lives could have been saved, writes Ian Holdsworth. A new kind of PA system, billed as 'explosion-proof', has been developed and is being installed by the Chevron oil company on its new Alba oil platform in the North Sea. The system, made by Spector/Lumenex of Nottingham, has been designed to exceed the safety requirements laid down by Lord Cullen. It has two principal features. First, it can work in a gas-filled environment without any danger of causing an explosion. Conventional systems have to be switched off during a gas alarm - when they are most needed - because of the risk of ignition from the electric current. Second, every part of the PA system is duplicated so that if any piece is destroyed the rest will continue to work. Spector/Lumenex: UK, 0602 608052.</p>

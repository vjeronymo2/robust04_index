Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo  attended and delivered speeches at the closing session in which  they emphatically stated that 1994 is a crucial year for Hunan's  finance and taxation system reform. Therefore, government  departments at all levels in Hunan should become fully prepared  for certain temporary difficulties that might arise by  strengthening confidence, making concerted efforts, sharing weal  and woe, and actively, assuredly, and successfully furthering  finance and taxation system reform as well as other types of  work.    Speaking on Hunan's work at present, Governor Chen Bangzhu  pointed out: All levels and all departments across the province  should develop the spirit of plain living and hard struggle,  curb expenditure, and strive to maintain a sustained balance  between revenue and expenditure. Finance departments, on their  part, should make every possible endeavor to guarantee the basic  livelihood of the broad masses of the people, notwithstanding  revenue cuts resulting from policy changes and growing pressures  in this regard, and should resolutely put an end to the practice  of issuing IOU's to both peasants and cadres.    Provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu noted, in particular, that  finance and taxation departments at all levels in Hunan should  waste no time in collecting revenue during the first quarter of  1994. Party committees and governments at all levels in Hunan  should take the interests of the whole into account and give  unreserved support to finance and taxation system reform and  finance work.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Nations tackle global warming Crucial negotiations commence today on how to implement the international climate change treaty to combat global warming, which comes into force on March 21. Governments are rushing to put flesh on the bones of the framework convention, signed by over 160 nations at the United Nations 'earth summit' in Brazil in 1992. The key issues at the two-week meeting in Geneva will be guidelines for the preparation of national strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions and for the funding of climate change projects in developing countries. For the first time negotiators will also discuss whether to toughen the convention by requiring industrialised countries to reduce emissions of warming gases rather than simply to stabilise them. Under the present treaty, developed nations aim to bring their greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The World Wide Fund for Nature on Friday called for governments to start immediate negotiations on a cut of at least 20 per cent in carbon dioxide emissions, ready for adoption when treaty members hold their first conference in Berlin in March 1995. Another longer-term issue concerns the scope for 'joint implementation', which would permit rich countries to meet emission targets partially by financing more cost-effective schemes in poor nations. Opponents contend that this would allow the developed world to duck its prime responsibility for causing global warming. Some 55 nations, among them the US, the European Union and Japan, have so far ratified the climate change convention. Industrialised country members must submit information on national emission strategies by September 21. In Geneva, negotiators will be trying to ensure comparable data by agreeing a common methodology for countries to calculate gas emissions.</p>

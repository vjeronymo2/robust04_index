			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The topic everyone is discussing this morning is  the one which Francois Mitterrand has just relaunched concerning  nuclear testing. At the Elysee [president's office] yesterday  the head of state in fact expressed great firmness over the  costs, reaffirming his opposition to any resumption of nuclear  testing. The statement has been well received by the Left, but  criticized by the Right. [passage omitted]    Without being totally opposed to the head of state, [Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe is less convinced: the refusal to resume  testing threatens the entire nuclear deterrent system, the  foreign minister believes: [begin recording]  Juppe: We need a credible and adequate deterrent  force. It exists today; will it exist in 10 years' time? We are  not certain of that, because it has to be modernized, and in  order to modernize it many experts, in fact most experts,  consider that further nuclear testing will be necessary, before  computer simulation makes it possible for us to do without it.  The president of the republic has taken up a position. That is  his right, no one contests his position as head of the armed  forces up until the end of his mandate. But he cannot  anticipate what his successor will do. It is for the future  president of the republic in May 1995 to explain to the French  people what his concept of the matter is. [end recording]    That was Alain Juppe, who was the guest of Annette Ardisson  just now at 0820 on France-Inter.</p>

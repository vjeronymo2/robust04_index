			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe Siebe appears to have struck it lucky with Eckardt. Its German acquisition is a good fit with Foxboro and will enhance its position in the European controls market. Moreover, a price of only 92 per cent of turnover looks an extraordinary bargain, despite Eckardt's small loss last year. Both its cost base and its depreciation rate must look unnaturally high to Siebe, so there is plenty of room for margin enhancement, even if some of it is cosmetic. Yet for all this, the acquisition is not exactly a quantum leap. Eckardt's turnover was less than 6 per cent of Siebe's last year. The suspicion that Siebe has more acquisitions in mind is increased by the fact that its rights issue is raising Pounds 72m more than it needs and that the excess will be kept in cash rather than used to pay down debts. It may simply be a question of in-fill acquisitions, but Siebe will have to watch its use of provisions if this is its chosen route to growth. And it probably requires something more substantial to generate the critical mass needed to confront the likes of Honeywell. That is why Eckardt could be useful in another way. Since its German owners account in a particularly conservative way, Siebe may be able to write up its stated DM29m (Pounds 11.7m) net assets considerably once they are absorbed into its balance sheet. Presumably it will also follow its controversial practice of adding intangible assets as well. Siebe's gearing would then fall well below the 39 per cent it forecast yesterday. It could then swallow a pretty large morsel without tapping shareholders for more.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Tau Kappa Epsilon, the nation's largest college social fraternity, announced  that it had ended pledging in an effort to stop dangerous hazing, making it the  second fraternity in a week to do so. "We have tried numerous programs to  eradicate (hazing) from the fraternity, but so far none have accomplished the  task," said T.J. Schmitz, the group's executive vice president. Legislation  banning pledging was passed by undergraduate delegates from the fraternity's  more than 280 chapters at the national convention in Indianapolis last weekend.  Instead of a pledge period, TKE recruits will be initiated immediately. TKE has  more than 177,000 initiated members and 16,000 active undergraduate members.  Last week, Zeta Beta Tau announced that it was eliminating the traditional  pledge period.  </P></p>

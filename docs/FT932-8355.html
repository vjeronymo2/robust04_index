			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fenner passes interim as exceptionals bite FENNER, the Hull-based industrial group which last month revealed 'indications of interest' in the company, is passing its interim dividend and undergoing a further programme of disposals and rationalisations among its smaller businesses. The diversified producer of power transmission equipment, industrial conveyer belting and fluid power products announced that pre-tax profits in the six months ended February 28 fell from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 105,000, on turnover down slightly from Pounds 97.7m to Pounds 97.2m. The decline in profits partly reflects a net exceptional charge of Pounds 1.4m. Redundancy and rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.8m, and Pounds 1.2m of professional fees associated with an aborted merger, were offset by a Pounds 1.6m profit on the sale of the Fenner Industrial Controls business in the US. After minority interests, and a higher overseas tax charge of Pounds 1.7m - previous tax losses in the US have now been absorbed - there was a loss attributable to shareholders of Pounds 2.29m or 5.24p a share, compared with profit of Pounds 174,000 or 0.41p a share a year ago. The interim dividend in 1991/92 was 1.7p per share. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, would not give any further information about the recent bid approaches, but did say that Fenner had previously come 'very close' to a merger that would have benefited shareholders. The aborted merger talks, and the uncertainty over the future of the UK coal industry had been major factors in Fenner's first-half performance, where a further decline in demand had been the background to trading. Demand from British Coal for Fenner's conveyer belting had fallen by one-third year-on year in the first half. But Mr Julian Bigden, group managing director, said Fenner had managed to offset some of the decline with increased overseas business, and had letters of intent to sell belting to the Ukraine. In the power transmission business, UK demand had been affected severely by trading conditions, although Mr Bigden said there were signs that it was picking up. But continental European markets for power transmission products were worsening. Fenner has cut 240 jobs in the financial year to date, reducing the total workforce to 3,800. Mr Bigden said the planned rationalisation programme was 'a cleaning-up exercise' of underperforming operations which would simplify the company and increase UK profits through a further reduction in costs. Mr Barker, who has been Fenner's chairman since 1982 and saw off the bid from Hawker-Siddeley in 1984, is retiring. Sir James Cleminson will be acting chairman until Mr Barker's successor is announced.</p>

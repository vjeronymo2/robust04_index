			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Curbs sought on ex-ministers' jobs MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday said there should be a delay of at least two years between ministers leaving office and them taking up posts in private business. He was responding to the announcement the day before that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, had been appointed a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, less than four months after his reluctant departure from government. 'The public will be very concerned about cabinet ministers moving straight from the cabinet room to the board room of companies heavily involved in privatisations,' Mr Brown said. He called for guidelines governing the conduct of ministers, similar to the cabinet office rules about officials taking posts in the private sector after leaving the civil service. 'The prime minister should lay down new rules immediately governing the appointment of ex-ministers to companies within months of leaving the government,' he said.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: John Fairfax well ahead at nine months JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian publishing group in which Mr Conrad Black and Mr Kerry Packer have significant holdings, boosted profits before tax and interest by about 30 per cent to ADollars 120.95m (USDollars 86.3m). in the nine months to end-March, Reuter reports. Fairfax, relisted on the stock exchange a year ago, said there were no formal comparative figures but thought it appropriate to compare results. Net profit was ADollars 47.4m. Advertising and circulation revenues rose while costs were held at about 1992 levels. Operating revenue rose to ADollars 568.01m from ADollars 539.24m in the same period last year. Mr Black's Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax and has government approval to move to 25 per cent. Mr Packer controls 10.45 per cent.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Biological weapons in Russia Russia may be illegally producing biological weapons despite a ban announced by President Boris Yeltsin nine months ago, according to Mr Douglas Hogg, junior foreign minister, writes David White. Mr Hogg told the BBC last night Britain had information the decree had not been fully complied with. Dr Vladimir Pasechnik, a Soviet expert who defected in 1989, said an institute in St Petersburg had been working on a genetically-manipulated strain of plague. Biological arms are prohibited under a 1972 international convention.</p>

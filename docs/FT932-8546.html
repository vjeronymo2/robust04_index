			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / US West finds cable role in deal with Time Warner: Nikki Tait on increased co-operation between two US industries THE announcement that US West, one of the seven US regional telephone companies resulting from the break-up of AT&amp;T, will invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner Entertainment, part of Time Warner, the giant media and entertainment conglomerate, marks an important step in the fast-evolving relationship between the US telecommunications and cable industries, writes Nikki Tait in New York. To date, that relationship has largely been one of confrontation  - a battle over who will bring communications into American homes over the coming decade. Now, it seems, co-operation may be the order of the day. At a financial level, the deal is complex. Essentially, US West will put up Dollars 1.5bn when the deal closes, hopefully later this year. The remainder will be supplied over a four-year period. This investment will give US West a 25.5 per cent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, the company's filmed entertainment, programming and cable arm. Time Warner will continue to own 63.27 per cent of TWE, and have operating control of much of the division. Remaining equity will be split between Itochu Corporation (previously C. Itoh) and Toshiba, existing partners in TWE. But the relationship between Time Warner and US West is expected to run a good deal deeper than this. Out of US West's total investment, Dollars 1bn will be devoted to developing Time Warner's planned 'full service networks'. This is the highly-ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and communications network, which the company outlined in detail earlier this year. At present, Time Warner's plans for the full-service network centre on Orlando, Florida, where it hopes to start demonstrating the system by the end of 1993, and then make it available to residential customers by 1994. Using more sophisticated technology than the traditional coaxial cable systems, the full-service networks promise customers a vastly-increased range of services  - including the ability to call up movies on demand, conduct interactive games, full-motion shopping, access to distance learning, and so on. Over a five-year period, Time Warner hopes to extend the networks to about 25 US metropolitan areas. All this is costly. According to one senior Time Warner executive yesterday, the company's capital expenditure on cable is currently about Dollars 400m a year. In the five years between 1994 and 1998, it is expected to average about Dollars 800m annually  - and most of the money will go on the full-service networks development. US West's Dollars 1bn will be welcome. But US West will also play a big operational role in the partnership. The full-service networks venture will be run jointly and involve employees from both groups. TWE's full-service networks, however, will not venture into US West's territory, which stretches from Denver, its home town, up to Seattle in the north-west; indeed, Time Warner will shed its modest cable operations in US West's 14-state telephone service area. This a recognition of the restrictions which still limit Baby Bells' forays into US cable. At present, telephone companies are barred by Federal law from owning cable TV systems in the markets in which they provide a telephone service. Nevertheless, in formidable fashion, yesterday's deal emphasises the determination of US telephone companies to carve a large role in cable's future. It comes only two months after Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two cable TV systems in suburban Washington for Dollars 650m from the privately-owned Hauser Communications, a deal which must still secure regulatory approval. That was the first attempt by any US telephone company to acquire a US cable TV group, although Southwestern Bell owns and operates a system in Britain, and spurred speculation that it could set off a scramble by other telecommunications companies.

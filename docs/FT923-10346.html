			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / BCCI liquidators to contact creditors LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International will circulate a letter to creditors in the next two weeks on behalf of the Luxembourg court giving recommendations for dividing the bank's assets. Mr Brian Smouha, of accountants Touche Ross, and Mr Georges Baden and Mr Julien Roden, who were appointed joint liquidators to BCCI SA by the Luxembourg court, are expected to continue pressing for their liquidation package, which offers creditors up to Dollars 1.7bn. They will write to about 50,000 creditors and place newspaper advertisements laying out the arguments. The letter was requested in an order issued by the court last week, when it postponed a decision on whether to approve the deal until October 7, to hear creditors' views. Some creditors have attempted to challenge the deal, calling for larger contributions from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders in the bank, or for litigation to recover more assets. The liquidators say the government of Abu Dhabi will not contribute any more money, and that litigation would delay any dividend to creditors for many years.</p>

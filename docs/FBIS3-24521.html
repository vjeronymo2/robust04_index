N. Fomenko;  place and date of interview not given: ``The First Facilities  Will Begin Working as Early as in March'']    [Text] The problem of organizing low-volume regional  operations producing microbiological preparations within the  state agricultural service is now being broadly discussed among  specialists. We asked V. P. Filatov, chief of the biological  methods subdivision of the Russian Agricultural Production  Ministry's Plant Protection Administration, to describe the  means by which this administration plans to solve the  problem.    FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, what compelled the  Plant Protection Administration to address the idea of  organizing low-volume regional production operations?    FilatovTwenty-five biological agents can now be  used to protect agricultural crops in greenhouses--12 useful  insects and 12-15 biopreparations. New, highly effective  developments exist which require extensive testing under  production conditions. Possessing such a huge potential, we  could significantly increase the role played by the biological  method on open and especially on sheltered ground. However, our  high-volume ``giants''--the plants of microbiological  industry--are extremely sluggish. Their production continues to  revolve around a few bacterial preparations coming in imperfect  preparative forms. The plants never did get into producing  fungal preparations. Nor are they willing to produce small,  so-called low-volume lots--that would be unprofitable. To make  matters worse, the plants supply their products to agriculture  in the third and fourth quarters, forcing the farms to store  biopreparations locally until the following summer. All of this  brings out uneasiness and a mistrust of the manufacturer, the  preparations and the biological method as a whole.    Considering the many years of practical work with the  plants,  and their slowness in making use of scientific developments, we  were forced to create biofactories and biolaboratories within  the plant protection system, which began producing a broader  assortment of biological resources in direct proximity to the  consumer. Life has confirmed the correctness of the selected  path. All that has been done to introduce the biological method  in recent years is a credit to it. However, time is marching on,  and laboratory procedures remain at a primitive level--jars,  rockers, cans, etc. As an example, production of baktorodentsid  requires ``babying'' it manually 10-15 times. The quality of the  products is unstable. Nor are the biolaboratories always able to  produce the needed volume, especially if the preparation is new  and effective, and if the demand for it is snowballing.    There is but one solution--we need to have our own  low-volume  production operations, ones established on the basis of  equipment similar to that used in industry.    FomenkoWhat has been done already in this  direction?    FilatovThe Russian Ministry of Agricultural  Production has allocated the money, and it has found a certain  defense industry enterprise to manufacture the needed equipment.  We went there in August 1992 together with specialists--process  engineers and microbiologists--and contracted for the creation  of five facilities producing bacterial and fungal preparations  in the form of pastes rather than dry powders. First of all,  pastes have a shelf life of up to 6 months, which is fully  sufficient considering the mobility of production and its  proximity to the client. Second, this form is applied more  easily--it doesn't create dust, and it doesn't clog sprayers.  Third, paste preparations will be 40 percent cheaper than dry  ones. Moreover their effectiveness is usually 10-15 percent  higher.    FomenkoWhat does the set of equipment possessed by  such facilities include?    FilatovA steam generator, a compressor, coarse and  fine cleaning filters, 10, 100 and 1,000 liter fermenters, a  separator and a filtering unit to concentrate the product.    FomenkoWhat preparations have you decided to  produce in the first stage?    FilatovWe have an extremely great need for aktinin  to control the spider mite, ampelomitsin, boverin of various  strains, trichodermin of various strains, nematofagin,  mikoafidin, piromorfin, fitolavin and rizoplan. The last  preparation, by the way, is needed in large volumes, and one of  our facilities will be able to produce up to 700 kg of rizoplan  daily. We will also produce pentofag and baktorodentsid. We plan  to introduce the procedures of producing lepidotsid,  bitoksibatsillin, gomelin and dendrobatsillin in paste form.    FomenkoWhen will these facilities be ready?    FilatovThe manufacturing plant is to turn them  over fully ready for use in March 1993. It will provide  guaranteed repairs and service for a year.    FomenkoWhere are they to be located?    FilatovIn the most ``needy'' places: in the health  resort zone of the city of Bolshiye Sochi, and in Krasnodar,  Voronezh, Kirov and Yoshkar-Ola, to perfect the procedures and  debug the equipment.    FomenkoWill specially adapted premises and  buildings be needed for them?    FilatovThe set of equipment can be located in an  area of 30 m[.sup]2[/], and its height will not exceed 2  meters. Suitable space will probably be found at the plant  protection stations. There is only one important condition that  must be observed: A supply of up to 100 kW of electric power.    FomenkoWho will work at these plants, where are  you going to get the specialists?    FilatovThere are microbiologists in our service  that could take on this job. Moreover we have reached agreement  with workers of the Omutninsk Plant to organize courses for our  specialists in which they could learn the procedures of working  with the new facilities.    FomenkoHow will the production volume and  assortment of preparations be determined?    FilatovThe low-volume production operations need  to seek customers themselves. Anyway, in this stage they won't  need to seek them--they are already known. First, we have  greenhouse complexes, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, commercial farms,  and storehouses in which products are processed before storage.  Also, we are doing little to satisfy the demand of clients in  the private sector, the army of which is growing, and which has  always been and will always be interested in ecologically clean  products and safe plant protection resources. That is, the range  of our customers is very wide.    Unfortunately we are doing little to provide publicity and  information on biopreparations. Agronomists need to know, for  example, that the Colorado beetle could be fought not only with  the preparation detsis, but also bitoksibatsillin, and the  effective preparation detsimid; there are plans for carrying out  field tests with the new preparation Colorado. If we sit down  and think about it, we already have five effective  microbiological resources for controlling these pests that are  in no way inferior to chemical ones. Once they learn about them,  the demand will doubtlessly grow.    FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, considering the known  demand for biopreparations, how do you feel, how many facilities  will be needed, in an oblast for example?    FilatovA single facility wouldn't of course solve  the problem in some southern oblasts, two or three would be  needed. Moreover in our planning work we foresaw the possibility  of increasing their productivity by 2-3 times. This ``reserve''  is present in all of the machine units--in those delivering  steam and air, and in filtering units. Just add another  fermenter, and the possibilities will widen significantly.    FomenkoThe first five facilities will be  practically given away to Krasnodar, Sochi, Kirov and other  cities. What if other oblasts would want to have the same kind  of equipment? Will they have to buy it?    FilatovYes, they will have to buy it.    FomenkoHow much does one such set cost?    FilatovIt's no secret: We signed a contract with  manufacturing plant for five facilities for a total of 32  million rubles.    FomenkoWill clients have to apply directly to the  plant, or would it be more advantageous to work through the  Plant Protection Administration?    FilatovI wouldn't want this to be done directly  through the plant. Here is why. It would of course be profitable  for the plant, because it is looking for work. But we would like  to perfect the production operation, to teach people, to check  out everything and achieve maximum reliability ourselves for the  time being, within the plant protection service, with our own  specialists. After all, the equipment has to work without  interruption for more than just a single year. The plant is not  going to become involved in training personnel and tailoring the  instruments to each client. After we get all of the bugs out,  let potential clients visit us, see the facilities in operation,  and they can decide for themselves whether they want to acquire  the equipment.    FomenkoIf everything goes according to plan, will  high-volume microbiological production operations become  unnecessary?    FilatovNo. Plants of microbiological industry will  continue to produce large of lots of preparations--over 500  tonnes. They won't lose any clients if the quality of their  products is high and if they are convenient to use. All the more  so because microbiological resources are now becoming  competitive with chemical ones both in price and in  effectiveness, while in terms of ecological safety they are far  superior.    FomenkoWhat is your attitude toward the numerous  cooperatives and small enterprises outside the plant protection  service that have now begun producing microbiological  preparations?    FilatovIt is fully positive, though at the same  time cautious. Because production and use of biopreparations by  nonspecialists who violate the procedures may result in woeful  consequences. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production  and the Ministry of Health have even prepared a special document  calling for the prohibition of unregulated production of fungal  and bacterial resources. Please understand me correctly: We do  not fear competition with any other producers. The more  preparations that are produced, the better. The only thing is  that the producer must have all of the necessary documents, the  technical conditions and regulations must be observed, and  emblems of quality and guarantees must be present. Then there  wouldn't be any problems.    COPYRIGHT: ``Kolos'', ``Zashchita Rasteniy'', 1993</p>

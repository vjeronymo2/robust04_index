			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Socialist victory will hit economy, says Mitsotakis MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, kicked off his re-election campaign at the weekend by warning that the economy would face serious problems if the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) came to power. Mr Mitsotakis, whose government was toppled last week by defections from his New Democracy party, also claimed the socialists' pledge to call off the privatisation programme would disrupt Greece's bid to achieve economic convergence with its EC partners. 'There will be a new haemorrhage of deficits. The Greek people will be called on to pay out a huge amount if privatisation is abandoned,' he told an audience of Greek businessmen in Thessaloniki. Whatever the outcome of the October 10 election, called seven months before the expiry of the conservatives' mandate, delays in revenue raising can be expected. Budget projections for 1993, the first year of Greece's five-year convergence plan, include at least Dr330bn (Pounds 930m) in privatisation revenues. Nevertheless, Pasok's intention of cancelling negotiations for the sale of public utilities and rolling back recent legislation permitting private operators to build and run power plants would damage chances of attracting investment. Mr Mitsotakis also warned that any serious deviation from the convergence targets, which include reducing government borrowing from 9.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 0.7 per cent in 1998 and halving the public debt, would mean that transfers from EC structural funds would be held back. Greece's current account deficit is held at manageable levels by steadily rising EC transfers, with up to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.24bn) due to be disbursed in the next five years. The conservatives, their popularity eroded by a three-year decline in real incomes and rising unemployment, are well aware they will have an uphill struggle to stay in power.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTA HERE!;  </P> <P> $16 DEPARTURE TAX ADDS JOLT FOR VISITORS ON TIGHT BUDGET  </P> <P> After a summer of sightseeing, visitor Erich Moritz had a few final words for  Los Angeles: "Lemme outta here!"  </P> <P> The 19-year-old German tourist had spent his vacation traveling by bicycle from  Alaska to Acapulco. He had swatted mosquitoes in Canada, sweated in Mexico and  slept next to roadsides on all but two nights during his three-month odyssey.  </P> <P> His camera had been swiped in Anchorage on the first day of his trip. His tent  had been stolen in San Francisco, halfway through the trek. Now he was  wondering whether his pocket was about to be picked on his last day in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Moritz had the departure tax on his mind.  </P> <P> The tax is a $16 fee that is collected from Los Angeles International Airport  passengers headed abroad. Six dollars goes to the federal Department of  Transportation; the rest is split by the federal Customs and Immigration and  Naturalization services -- although all three agencies waive the fee to  passengers flying to areas of Mexico, Canada and some Caribbean islands.  </P> <P> Most travelers pay the tax without knowing it after it is automatically added  to the price of their airline ticket at the time of purchase.  </P> <P> But hundreds of others are jolted each day to discover that their travel agent  failed to include the tax in the air fare and they must fork over $16 before  they can board their plane for home.  </P> <P> That spells trouble for tourists who have spent their last $30 on a taxi ride  to LAX or used up the last of their American currency at an airport souvenir  shop.  </P> <P> Youthful visitors traveling on a shoestring -- those who have sought out  cut-rate air fares to begin with and carefully budgeted their trips -- are the  most common victims. People like Erich Moritz.  </P> <P> "Sixteen dollars is a lot," said the student from Munich as he waited in the  Alitalia Airlines check-in line. He was eager to claim a window seat and learn  whether his $500 round-trip ticket included the tax. "I have just a few dollars  left. They should warn people about this."  </P> <P> Across LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal, visitors Linda Hollis, 21, and  Mark Smith, 22, of Liverpool, England, mulled over the tax in front of the  American Trans Air charter flight check-in counter.  </P> <P> "We spent all we had on day trips and so forth," Hollis said. Added Smith: "I  don't have a cent left."  </P> <P> At the British Airways counter, Sven Schelo, 21, and Annemarie Vogelbusch, 20,  of Dusseldorf, Germany, asked an airline agent whether their tickets included  the tax.  </P> <P> "I've got $5.15 left. We spent the last of our money to fill the rental car up  with gasoline," Schelo said.  </P> <P> Airport ticket agents cringe when they have to collect the departure fee.  Although the Customs and Immigration portions have been assessed for about the  past two years, the $6 portion has only been collected since January. It  replaced a $3 fee that was established in 1970.  </P> <P> "It's a government tax. The government should collect it, not us," said the  British Airways agent who examined Schelo's tickets and determined that the fee  had indeed been prepaid.  </P> <P> "It happens every flight," shrugged Khaleel Siddiqui, a ticket agent for KLM  Royal Dutch Airways.  </P> <P> Most carriers pay the tax for passengers who do not have the cash.  </P> <P> Joe Matz, an agent for Air New Zealand, said he collects the tax from reluctant  travelers "all the time . . . every day." Some passengers claim they don't have  the money, however.  </P> <P> "We usually scare them. We take a picture of the passport and have them sign it  and tell them the government is going to come after them. They'll say, 'The  travel agent didn't tell me,' or 'I spent my last money on the cab.' But we  usually collect it -- they have credit cards, and that's what we grab."  </P> <P> Some airlines send passengers without cash to the Travelers Aid Society, which  donates the $16 if an investigation verifies that the passengers have no money.  </P> <P> "Generally, it's a young person who's backpacking it and is down to his last  dollar," said Susan Edelstein, who heads the LAX Travelers Aid office.  </P> <P> "They have their return ticket. They know they're going to be fed on the plane  and that someone is going to pick them up at the airport."  </P> <P> Back at the Alitalia counter, Moritz had four one-dollar bills left in the  nylon money belt beneath his T-shirt after learning at the last minute that he  was required to purchase a $16 shipping box for his bicycle. Happily, the  coding on his ticket showed that he had prepaid the departure tax.  </P> <P> With minutes to spare, Moritz boxed his bike and ran for his plane. "The window  seats are taken. I've got one in the middle. And it's a 16-hour flight," he  shrugged.  </P> <P> So long, L.A.  </P></p>

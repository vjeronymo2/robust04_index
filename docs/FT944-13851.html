			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Coal licensing body launched The new Coal Authority, which will take over the ownership and licensing of coal from British Coal, was launched yesterday as a further step to privatisation of the industry. Mr Charles Wardle, the junior energy minister, described it as 'the start of a new era for coalmining'. The new authority, based in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has the task of encouraging 'viable coalmining and coal-bed methane operations' and providing safeguards for the public. It will also license mining operations, ensuring that mining companies make adequate provision to cover possible subsidence claims. The licences of mine owners will be reviewed annually by the authority and it will cancel those of any private operators which fail to meet required standards. The authority will be responsible for subsidence claims outside areas of current mining. It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 abandoned mine shafts in the UK. The authority will have a staff of about 100 and an annual budget of about Pounds 50m, which will come in the form of grant-in-aid from the Department of Trade and Industry. The authority will be expected to recoup its costs wherever it can, and to earn revenue through licence fees on a scale which will be announced later this week. Sir David White, the chairman, said he wanted 'to create an authority that is responsive to those who want to mine'. He said much of its work would be outsourced to private contractors. The authority's chief executive is Mr Neville Washington, a former army officer. The authority takes over British Coal's duties next Monday, although British Coal will survive as an entity until all its liabilities have been settled. The government hopes to complete the privatisation by Christmas day.</p>

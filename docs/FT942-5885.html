			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Seagram seeks seat on Time Warner Seagram, the international drinks company, has indicated that it wants a seat on Time Warner's board, but has no plans to raise its 14.9 per cent stake in the US entertainment and publishing group. The issue of Seagram's representation on the Time Warner board has contributed to an awkward relationship between the two companies in the 16 months since Seagram began building up its stake. Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, who took over as Seagram's chief executive from his father yesterday, said that 'we would prefer to be invited'. Although Mr Bronfman speaks to Time Warner chairman Mr Gerald Levin once a week and the two men have met regularly, Mr Bronfman said 'the request for a board seat will not come from Seagram'. Time Warner has so far indicated a reluctance to invite Seagram on to its board, apparently fearing that the drinks company would use its position to acquire control. There had been rumours that Seagram was talking with Time Warner over a possible standstill agreement that would allow Seagram to increase its stake to more than 15 per cent without Time Warner invoking its 'poison pill'. However, Mr Bronfman said 'there had been no discussions in that regard'. Mr Edgar Bronfman Snr who remains chairman described the purchase of the stake in Time Warner as a calculated decision. 'That was our decision and remains our decision,' he said. His son told the annual meeting that the main purpose of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) investment was to generate funds to expand Seagram's core beverages businesses. He compared the Time Warner investment with Seagram's forays into oil and gas and its existing 25 per cent stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals group. Mr Bronfman Jr, aged 39, predicted that the value of Seagram's stake in Time Warner will rise 'dramatically' over the next five to 10 years. 'Patience will be our reward with Time Warner as it was with Du Pont,' he said. Seagram yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in first quarter earnings to Dollars 197m, or 53 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from Dollars 162m, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating income rose to Dollars 162m from Dollars 148m. The figure excludes a one time accounting charge of Dollars 75m, or 20 cents a share. Sales rose 3.5 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

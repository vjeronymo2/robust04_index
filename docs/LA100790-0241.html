			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO PAY OFF HER LOAN IN 12 YEARS  </P> <P> QUESTION: I am a never-married single female, 53 years old, and would like to  retire at age 65 in the year 2002. My objective is to have the roof over my  head paid for.  </P> <P> In 1981, I purchased a condominium for $44,900 with a 5% down payment. I signed  a note financing $42,600 at 10.75% (fixed) for 30 years. The balance today is  $39,000 and my payments are $402 a month and the mortgage will be paid off in  July 2011.  </P> <P> I live on a fixed income which, last year, was $29,000. I have other assets,  put the maximum allowed by law into an IRA plus I save $100 a month in a  regular savings account which has a balance of $8,000.  </P> <P> In a few months I will receive about $7,000 to $8,000 from a retirement plan  from my employer and plan to roll that over into an IRA.  </P> <P> What advice can you give me regarding having the home paid for in 2002? Should  I refinance to a 15-year term? Apply extra money to the principal and to the  IRAs? Or apply an additional amount to the principal each month?  </P> <P> ANSWER: I wouldn't refinance if I were you and lock myself into higher payments  that, at some time in the future, might be a little binding. Nor would I dabble  with the IRA you are contributing into because of the tax-deferment aspect of  it.  </P> <P> According to my calculations it will take about another $93-a-month additional  payment to your mortgage principal to pay your mortgage off in about 12 years.  </P> <P> That, of course, will eat up the $100-a-month that you're putting in your  savings account, but since you have a balance there of about $8,000 for an  emergency cushion it seems like the most practical diversion of funds open to  you.  </P> <P> What's "smart" about borrowing $60,000 for a home and over the next 30 years  paying the lender $137,591 in interest alone (at 10.5%)? By painlessly  accelerating the payoff of your mortgage you can save thousands in interest and  cut many years off that awesome 30-year indebtedness.  </P> <P> Our leaflet, "Free and Clear: Getting the Mortgage Monkey Off Your Back"  explains all. Send a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope and $2 to cover  costs to Don Campbell, P.O. Box 80260, Phoenix, Ariz. 85060.  </P> <P> Campbell, a retired Times staff writer, now is a Phoenix-based free-lance  writer.  </P></p>

A PN spokesman  explained to NOTIMEX that last night unidentified individuals  threw a fragmentation grenade near the BCH and the national  library without causing much property damage.    The PN says that the victims were passing the area when the  explosive was thrown. Authorities identified the elderly woman  as Agripina Azucena Rivera de Rada, 61. The injured were taken  to the local hospital where they were given immediate medical  attention. According to the medical report, they are out of  danger.    The PN also reported that yesterday another group of  unidentified individuals threw tear gas bombs into a San  Salvador municipal registry office. Political observers called  this the first act of sabotage to the electoral process. The two  attacks took place 30 days prior to the general elections in  which 2.7 million Salvadorans will elect a president, a vice  president, deputies, and aldermen.</p>

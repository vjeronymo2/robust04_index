			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE SMITH'S 32 POINTS, CLIPPERS LOSE  </P> <P> Charles Smith scored 32 points and backup center Ken Bannister, starting in  place of ailing Benoit Benjamin, had 21, but the Clippers still lost to the  Portland Trail Blazers, 126-102, Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Benjamin suffered an allergy reaction and did not play.  </P> <P> For Portland, Clyde Drexler scored 24 points and Terry Porter had his second  triple-double of the season as the Clippers fell to 18-58.  </P> <P> Drexler scored 10 points in the second quarter, helping the Trail Blazers build  a 66-42 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Porter finished the game with 10 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds for  Portland, which improved its lead over the Dallas Mavericks to three games with  six to play in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff  spot.  </P> <P> The 32 points were a career high for Smith.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers built a 30-22 lead after one quarter, then outscored the  Clippers, 16-8, in the first six minutes of the second period. Porter and  Kersey had consecutive layups to give Portland a 46-30 lead.  </P> <P> Portland took its largest lead, 70-44, early in the third quarter before the  Clippers used a 28-16 spurt to close the gap to 86-72. But that was close as  the Clippers could get in the second half.  </P> <P> Portland got balanced scoring. Kevin Duckworth had 21 points, Jerome Kersey 18  and the bench 45. Clipper reserves had 27.  </P> <P> For Porter, it was his sixth career triple-double.  </P> <P> "We really tried to concentrate and get off to a good start, which we did," he  said. "We weren't going to let them get back into it like we did before."  </P> <P> Porter was referring to a 133-123 loss to the Clippers at the Sports Arena last  Thursday night.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Clippers, 50-34, and blocked 11 shots,  including three by Sam Bowie, who missed the previous nine games with a  sprained ankle.  </P> <P> "Danny Young and Sam Bowie played well off the bench," Portland Coach Rick  Adelman said. "I was especially pleased to see Sam move as well as he did after  the long layoff. Jerry Sichting was also moving well after such a long layoff  and I want to give him some time before the playoffs."  </P></p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (6): 'Few farmers mourn subsidies' - Terry Hall sees agriculture benefiting from economic reform New Zealand's farmers are in a sunny, expansive mood. They have enjoyed the best summer in memory with just the right amount of sun and rain encouraging spirited grass growth. Cattle, sheep and deer are in excellent condition. But no summer is perfect. A series of freak hailstorms devastated a fifth of the country's apple crop, and more rain than usual caused harvesting difficulties for South Island arable crops such as wheat and barley. Farming confidence remains high despite a rising Kiwi dollar, which is eroding export earnings. Prices for lamb, sheep, beef and dairy products have all dropped over the past four months, although there has been an encouraging rise in wool incomes. Farm profitability is expected to rise by 5 per cent this year, mainly due to higher lamb-kill and wool prices. However, historically, returns are low. Rob Davison, chief economist with the Meat and Wool Board's economic service, says that, while farmers' incomes are at the highest level since 1984, they are only two thirds the level recorded in the 1970s and early 1980s. Those were the years when farmers received generous taxpayer assistance with subsidies for fertiliser and other inputs to encourage production. In 1984, the reformist Labour government wiped these out, leading to seven years of difficulty as farmers were forced to adjust. The most indebted, and those with uneconomic units, were forced to leave their farms. Mr Davison says that few farmers want to return to the days of subsidies. They prefer the risks of the marketplace, believing it is the only sustainable long-term option. However, he says that all Kiwi farmers wish that other countries would follow the New Zealand lead. Farmers are also benefiting from other reforms introduced from 1984. Low inflation has led to a sharp reduction in costs, as have falls in interest rates, and fuel and fertiliser costs. There is optimism that the progressive relaxation of agricultural protection under the Gatt round from next year will eventually lead to greater benefits for local farmers. Most exporters expect a minor improvement in prices from June next year, as a result of Gatt. There is optimism, too, about the long-term trend, given the Uruguay round's commitment to gradually lower agricultural barriers over the coming years. Sharply rising land prices are also adding to farmer confidence. Investment levels are high, especially from city people, and farms are changing hands at double and treble the price of five years ago. Market forces have led to rapidly changing land-use patterns. High dairy prices over the past three years have led to a spate of conversions of former sheep and cattle country to dairying. Conversion costs are high, as dairy farms need ample water and related costly plant. Record land prices in the traditional dairy provinces of Taranaki and the Waikato have encouraged many farmers to migrate to areas like Southland and Otago in the deep south, where land is cheaper. Other land is being converted to forestry, while low venison prices have seen some prime land revert to dairying or horticultural use. The rate of farm conversion to alternative uses has led to forecasts that suggest that, even if prices improve, New Zealand is unlikely to return to the days when sheep farming was the mainstay of the agricultural industry, as there is no longer suitable land available. Vast tracts of the hilly high country has been converted to forestry, and it takes 25 to 30 years for a tree to reach maturity. Sheep numbers have dropped from 73m in 1984 to 50m today. Sheep farming is hard work, and modern New Zealand farmers prefer to work their farms on their own. A third of a present day farm may now consist of radiata pine forests which require minimal care. Unlike other farm endeavours, there are taxpayer incentives to encourage forestry. The rise in wool prices since January has been cheering, as has the steady reduction in the stockpile. This stood at 655,000 bales in 1991 when the Wool Board decided it could no longer support the market. The magnitude of the stockpile initially depressed prices. But it should all have been sold by next year. The stockpile has fallen to 190,000 bales The wool season began last July with low demand and prices averaging around NZDollars 3.75 a kilo. However, prices have risen by around NZDollars 1 since February, helped by stronger demand from Britain, which has emerged as the second biggest buyer. The UK increased its purchases by 41 per cent in the nine months to March. China and Hong Kong remain the biggest buyers, using New Zealand wools in a range of products from hand knitting to tufted carpet. In recent weeks, lamb prices have fallen in Europe, the main market. This has caused some concern to exporters as prices had been unusually buoyant for the previous 18 months. There is optimism that consumption will recover towards the end of the year. Beef exporters have continued to struggle with protectionist measures in the major markets, Canada and the US, over the past year. However, some newer markets were developed in Asia, notably Korea, as well as in Mexico. The strong New Zealand dollar, and intense competition from Europe and Australia on world markets, has depressed returns from dairying. The industry is confident that prices will improve markedly over the coming months. Even so, farmers are expected to receive a payout of NZDollars 2.85 a kilo of milkfat this season, 45 cents lower than last. A series of freak hailstorms - none of which lasted more than a few minutes  -destroyed the hopes and incomes of many apple-growers. Thanks to the warm summer, the fruit was in the best condition for many years. After the buoyant prices of 1992, world prices remain low, although the New Zealand Apple and Pear Board is proud that Kiwi apples still fetch a premium on major markets. The kiwifruit industry is recovering from the massive losses it incurred in 1992. Production is down sharply, and quality up: leading to hopes that there will be good markets for the fruit overseas.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers expands in Asia United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday acquired a Hong Kong trade fair group as part of its strategy of expanding in east Asia. Earlier this week United announced a further push into the US advertising periodicals business with the Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) acquisition of Harmon Publishing Company. United is paying an initial Dollars 35m cash for Hong Kong International Trade Fair Group. A further Dollars 9m is payable if exhibition income beats certain targets this year and in 1995. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United, said the industrial logic of the deal was very strong. The group, the third biggest exhibition organiser in the US, would be moving into the heart of the growing Asean market. United also announced that it had acquired the 58 per cent of shares in Asian Business Press that it did not already own. It has held a 42 per cent stake since 1974. Mr Wilson said the two businesses would work closely together to exploit joint opportunities in the region. United as a group would put increasing emphasis 'on developing titles and activities in markets which have a worldwide reach.' HKITF owns seven exhibitions serving the leather, shipping, cosmetics, tanker and cruise markets. In the year to end-December it made pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.74m on revenues of Dollars 9.78m. No figure has been given for the purchase of ABP shares, although Mr Wilson said it was less than a quarter of the price paid for HKTIF. ABP publishes controlled circulation business magazines in the travel, aerospace, computing and broadcasting markets, as well as tourist guides. Last year when it launched a Pounds 190m cash call, United said that several opportunities for expanding existing publishing and exhibition interests were being 'actively pursued in the US and Far East'.</p>

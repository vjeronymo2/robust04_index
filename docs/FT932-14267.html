			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Machine tool company 'saved' THE managing director of Dean Smith &amp; Grace has saved part of the West Yorkshire-based machine tool company from closure by acquiring the spares, service and rebuilding activities from Monarch Machine Tool, the US parent company. Monarch said in December it would close Dean Smith &amp; Grace in June because of the recession. A new company, DSG Lathes, has been formed by Mr Richard Hole to focus initially on rebuilding and re-engineering standard and computer numerically controlled lathes. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed but Mr Hole and his wife will be the sole owners of the new company.</p>

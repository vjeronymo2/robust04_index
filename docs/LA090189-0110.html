			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTION LEADER SOBS ON WITNESS STAND  </P> <P> Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, in the dramatic highlight of  anti-abortion activists' trespass trial, broke into sobs on the witness stand  Thursday as he described a Good Friday rally in which funeral services were  held for an "aborted baby."  </P> <P> With his voice cracking, Terry sobbed, "That night there were 2,000 of us  filing past the dead baby in the coffin . . . ."  </P> <P> Before he could testify further, Los Angeles Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez,  who has shown impatience with the defense tactics throughout the three-week  trial of five Operation Rescue leaders, said, "Mr. Terry, do you want a break?"  </P> <P> Terry, his body shuddering, gulped, "No, I'll be OK . . . ."  </P> <P> "You will take a break, Mr. Terry," retorted Paez, who has been trying to keep  a taut rein on what he called the "circus-like atmosphere" of the trial.  </P> <P> Terry, a charismatic church leader from Binghamton, N.Y., has led his "holy  army" in a series of nationwide demonstrations at woman's clinics. He is the  last defendant to testify in the trial of five Operation Rescue activists  charged with trespassing, conspiracy and resisting arrest during a March 25  protest at a clinic on Westmoreland Avenue. Also charged are Jeff White, 31, of  Santa Cruz; Andrew Eppink, 41, of Palmdale; Michael McMonagle, 36, of  Philadelphia, and Don Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> During the half-hour recess, Terry remained seated on the witness stand, his  back to the courtroom packed with his Bible-carrying supporters. His muffled  sobs could be heard, and his shoulders were heaving. He continually wiped at  his eyes with a handkerchief.  </P> <P> About 20 minutes later, with Terry still hunched in his seat, Deputy City Atty.  Lara Bloomquist rolled her eyes toward the ceiling and said, "At some point  doesn't this become counterproductive?"  </P> <P> When the jury returned, a somber Terry testified that during the rally at a  church in Orange County, "It took two hours for the crowd to file by the coffin  . . . of the 20-week-old aborted baby."  </P> <P> The fetus, nicknamed "Baby Choice," Terry said later outside the courtroom, was  used by anti-abortion activists during press conferences and other appearances  the week they conducted "rescues" in Southern California.  </P> <P> Throughout the trial, Paez has threatened the defense with contempt for  referring to the medical clinics as "killing centers," and "abortion mills."  </P> <P> Thursday was no exception. Less than 10 minutes into his testimony describing  the sit-in, Terry used the word "aboratorium."  </P> <P> "OK, Mr. Terry, into my chambers!" Paez said sharply.  </P> <P> Out of earshot of the jury, Paez threatened Terry with contempt if he continued  to use words that might "inflame the jury," court officials said. Terry argued  that the words were not used for effect but were "second nature" to him. Terry  testified that he had been named in 20 court injunctions nationwide forbidding  him from blockading woman's clinics. "The bottom line is that the injunctions  are meaningless and I have given them no more attention than a piece of paper  laying in the street."  </P> <P> In his testimony, Terry said, the arresting officers at the sit-in threw him  down into a mud puddle. "Someone put a foot on me and pushed my face into the  pavement, and tried to bend back my finger . . . all I could think of was don't  break my finger, because I play the piano . . . then they dragged me to the  bus."  </P> <P> Operation Rescue protesters have argued that their actions at the sit-in are  based on the "defense of necessity" -- breaking laws in order to prevent harm  or "significant evil." But Paez rejected this defense because abortion is legal  in California.  </P></p>

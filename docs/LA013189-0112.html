			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> A buying frenzy that began last Tuesday helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average  gain back the last of the 500 points lost in the October, 1987, crash,  according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego  Securities.  </P> <P> The Dow continued to move ahead last week, gaining 88.75, or 3.9%. Some San  Diego stocks -- particularly the financials -- joined in the advance, Katz  said.  </P> <P> Southwest Bancorp led the financial sector as it climbed $1.50 to $5.25 on an  acquisition offer by Security Pacific and a stock swap valued at $6 a share.  The offer must be approved by regulators and Southwest's board of directors and  shareholders.  </P> <P> First National Corp. reached a new high of $12 after reporting excellent  earnings of $1.18 for the year, up from $.70 the previous year. BSD Bancorp  gained $.25. BSD is selling at six times earnings and only 66% of book value,  Katz said.  </P> <P> Most of San Diego's savings and loans participated in the week's gains, Katz  said. Home Federal, which has yet to release 1988 earnings, was up $1.25, and  Great American First Savings Bank was up $.375, despite reporting earnings  below those of the same quarter a year ago. Great American is selling at below  book value and returning a dividend of 5.1%, Katz said.  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America recorded a new low of $6.875. ICA eliminated its $.15  cent dividend and announced a reduction in 1988 earnings that was attributed to  various write-offs.  </P> <P> Cipher Data reached a new high of $10.75 on second-quarter earnings that rose  by 47% to $.22, up from $.15.  </P> <P> Other good movers last week included Xytronyx, up $1.375 after receiving an  order for 50,000 periodontal disease detection kits from Colgate. Intermark was  up $.875, responding to a favorable article in Business Week magazine.  </P> <P> Other stocks moving up this week were San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, up $1.50;  Henley Group, up $3.25; Price Co., up $1.50, and Rohr Industries, up $1.375.  </P> <P> Burnham Pacific Properties successfully sold 1.5 million shares at $18.625.  </P></p>

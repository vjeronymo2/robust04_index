			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report: "Special Appointment"] </F>   [Text] Russia has a new member of the cabinet of ministers  -- Mikhail Barsukov, head of the Russian Federation Main  Security Directorate [MSD].    Having been elevated to the level of a ministry, his agency  continues to perform the functions of guarding the Russian  establishment. No one, however, knows how wide its powers are  because MSD activities are guided by a classified statute. In  the opinion of acting Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay  Vitruk, at the present moment the MSD can bring pressure to bear  on any, the most senior politicians of the country. Indeed, in  Vitruk's words, the MSD "is in charge" not only of bodyguards  but also of government limousines, special communications  facilities, health centers, stores, tailoring establishments,  and the other goodies of former special distributors.    Thus, on the one hand Minister Barsukov is supposed to take  orders from the premier and his vice premiers. But on the  other, it is on himself that all of them depend.</p>

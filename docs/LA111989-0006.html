			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A THIN TIME FOR 'FAT MAN'  </P> <P> If director Roland Joffe wants to know why "Fat Man and Little Boy" isn't  drawing audiences, he need only look as far as his trailer (Outtakes, Nov. 12).  Instead of a sober profile of the men behind the Atomic Age, the movie is  presented in the trailer as a pious, bombastic, partisan star vehicle for Paul  Newman's favorite pinup boy, Paul Newman.  </P> <P> Newman is miscast, like having Tom Cruise as Westmoreland, or Dan Quayle as  President.  </P> <P> WILLIAM J. BECKER JR.  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P> <P> Roland Joffe brought us "Fat Man" -- wasn't such a fun day,  </P> <P> Now he wonders where he went wrong (Outtakes, just last Sunday).  </P> <P> Says he thinks its message may have been rejected  </P> <P> "At some gut level" by the public --  </P> <P> Now he's all dejected.  </P> <P> Methinks there's just a whiff here of Hollywood self-delusion,  </P> <P> My only gut reaction was yawns and deep confusion.  </P> <P> The action dragged, the dialogue sagged,  </P> <P> Clear plot was an illusion.  </P> <P> Paul Newman hammed it as General Groves  </P> <P> (No wonder we all stayed away in droves).  </P> <P> So, Roland, if you're contemplating "Fat Man Number 2,"  </P> <P> Do us all a favor -- don't drop the other shoe!  </P> <P>  JACK MANCHESTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

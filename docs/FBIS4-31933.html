			<p>BFN     [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] and SZDSZ  [Alliance of Free Democrats] have agreed that under the  coalition government there will be 12 ministries. The  ministerial posts and the posts of political and administrative  state secretaries will be filled on a professional basis. Judit  Laszlo reports on the governmental committee session.    [Laszlo] The two parties do not wish to amend the  Constitution in order to transform the government, but the law  on ministries will require correction, said Imre Szekeres, the  committee's Socialist cochairman, at the end of the discussions.    He added: The work of the new government will require 12  portfolios. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and the  Ministry of International Economic Relations will be amalgamated.    The new government will have to decide which organizations  of  national jurisdiction it will want. Until then they will come  under ministerial supervision, said Imre Szekeres, who spoke  about other decisions as well:    [Begin Szekeres recording] We agreed that the internal  structure of the ministries will not change; that is the 1990  decision, namely the separation of the political and  professional tasks, will remain in force. In other words,  political state secretaries will remain, whose first tasks will  be deputizing for the minister and a liaison role with  parliament.    For the time being we have left it in the balance whether to  change the name. There are two possible standpoints; I think  that there is no dispute between us on this point; both are  acceptable. What we must look at is which one represents less of  a change, a change either of a legal or financial nature, if we  alter the name.    We have agreed not to alter the ministries' internal  structure insofar as the professional work will be coordinated  by an administrative state secretary, one administrative state  secretary. However, we will propose that the number of deputy  state secretaries should be determined in accordance with the  tasks and not according to a general rule. In other words, that  there should not be five deputy state secretaries everywhere  where that number is not actually needed. [end recording]    [Laszlo] The two parties are agreed that the majority of the  minister without portfolio posts are not needed. There is a  debate about the post of minister without portfolio in charge of  national security. This topic will come before the plenary  coalition session on Friday [17 June], as will the tasks of the  various ministries, said Gabor Kuncze, the committee's SZDSZ  cochairman.    The politicians were agreed that one and the same party  should provide the minister and the political state secretary  for a given portfolio, but that one or two exceptions are  possible. To this Imre Szekeres added: The important thing is  that both the minister and the political state secretary should  be experts, and if one of the parties can recommend a more  qualified candidate, it is conceivable that in exceptional cases  the minister and the political state secretary would belong to  different parties.    In answer to a question, Imre Szekeres said: If nominated,  he  would accept the post of SZDSZ parliamentary group leader.</p>

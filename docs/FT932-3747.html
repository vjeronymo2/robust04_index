			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Pernicious prescription Sir, Richard Layard (Personal View, June 8) provides a classic example of what happens to economists in a depression: they become apologists for, not analysts of, failure, and the purveyors of pernicious prescriptions. EC unemployment has averaged 9 per cent in the past five years and is now back to the double digits; job security in the US and Japan is also a thing of the past. This indicates general stagnation, not a short-term aberration or the failings of a few unfortunates in society. Layard, in explaining unemployment, emphasises workers' attributes (skills and price), rather than dismal returns on investment and the concomitant failure to invest in future production. The cure for unemployment is sought among its victims, not at the level of the economy as a whole. Unemployment, for Layard, is a matter of benefits, training and wages. The cure? Cut benefits, increase training and control wages. No matter how this is dressed up it is an argument of the 'they're too stupid, too greedy and too lazy' variety, whIch leads nicely into the 'they need whipping into shape' argument. Such prejudice and support for authoritarian action by the state makes one nostalgic for the 'get on your bike' idea. S Dickinson, 51 Woodside Avenue, Leeds LS4 2QX</p>

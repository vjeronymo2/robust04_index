			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Spread on French 10-year paper narrows to three basis points THE yield spread between French and German 10-year government bonds crumbled yesterday as investors piled into long-term French government paper and German bonds were held back by the impact of a strong dollar. The spread for 10-year benchmark bonds dated April 2003 narrowed to three basis points by the close of trading from 10 basis points on Wednesday. French long-dated bond futures for September jumped sharply on the Matif in heavy turnover. Dealers said the near-parity of the yield spread was prompting program-trade selling, but that was countered by domestic buying as investors switched out of the short end and extended along the yield curve. The interest in French paper was sparked by news that Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, had invited representatives from the Bundesbank and the German ministry of finance to visit Paris to discuss co-ordinated interest cuts. Many economists saw the invitation - and Germany's subsequent refusal - as part of the perceived power-play for the role of holder of the anchor currency within the European exchange rate mechanism. In the futures market, 10-year French bond contracts for September delivery opened at 119.36 and were bought up to 119.80 before drifting in the afternoon and closing 38 basis points higher at 119.74. Turnover was high, with more than 165,000 contracts traded within the official dealing period. GERMAN government bonds also benefited from rate cut hopes, but their performance was hampered by the continuing strength of the US dollar against the D-Mark. Bund futures for September rose from 95.12 to 95.33 although the dollar broke through 1.71 against the D-Mark. The Bundesbank said yesterday that although next week's repo funds would be allocated on Thursday rather than Wednesday, in order to avoid end-of-the-month pressures, the rate would be announced on Wednesday as usual. ITALIAN government bonds picked up after a repo rate cut raised hope of an imminent easing in official interest rates. US investment house Citibank is a strong buyer of Italian bonds. It argues that the fundamentals are positive, the lira is firm and inflation is at the same level as in Germany. RUMOURS that the Spanish prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, had failed to reach a coalition agreement with the minority Catalan party came too late to affect the performance of the Spanish government bond market. The September futures contract traded in Barcelona rose a further 10 basis points to 93.85, although Mr Steve Major, economist with Credit Lyonnais and a leading bull of the Spanish bond market, said he was preparing to turn seller. 'Ten-year bonds have performed very well but I think they have run too far now and there is scope for a correction.' UK GILTS shrugged off the impending supply pressure of tap issues totalling Pounds 850m and avoided profit-taking to continue their strong performance, particularly at the long end. The Bank of England announced a tap of Pounds 300m of 7 1/4 per cent stock dated 1998, Pounds 400m of 8 per cent stock maturing in 2013 and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index linked stock dated 2013. Dealers said that the combination of low inflation and slow growth made the UK gilt market particularly attractive, and many expected long gilts to hit new price highs and consequent yield lows. Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets predicted that long gilt yields would reach their lowest level for a quarter of a century. He forecast a yield of 7 3/4 per cent by the end of the year for the 8 3/4 per cent stock maturing in 2017. A FAVOURABLE jobless claims report lifted US Treasury prices across the board yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105, yielding 6.730 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.141 per cent. The announcement that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance rose by 8,000 in the third week of this month surprised the market, which had been expecting a decline in jobless claims. Consequently, investors started buying Treasuries at both ends of the maturity range on the latest piece of gloomy economic news. Prices were also helped by some switching out of mortgage-backed securities into government securities. Investors were selling mortgage-backed securities because recent declines in interest rates have raised concerns that mortgage prepayment levels could increase.</p>

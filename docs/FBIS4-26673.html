			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping has asked China's top  generals to safeguard an orderly succession and to defuse unrest  that might occur after his death.    Chinese sources said while Mr Deng's health remained  precarious, he was fit enough to do short-term travelling.    Leaving weighty matters of state to lieutenants including  President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, the patriarch  has devoted his energy to ensuring a smooth succession.    Informed sources said in a secret talk to about 20 senior  generals earlier this year, Mr Deng spelled out a two-pronged  strategy for guaranteeing a trouble-free succession.    "Rally round comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the new  leadership," Mr Deng told the gathering of top brass, who  included former president Yang Shangkun, one of Mr Jiang's major  rivals.    "Uphold political stability at all costs. Provide help to  the party and the Government in maintaining social order.  Bolster central authority and check the growth of regionalism."    The patriarch specifically asked his long-time  comrade-in-arms General Liu Huaqing to help Mr Jiang, Mr Deng's  successor as Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman,  consolidate his hold over the People's Liberation Army and the  paramilitary People's Armed Police.    Under Mr Deng's overall guidance, Mr Jiang, General Liu and  the generals laid down contingency plans through which urban  riots could be contained and defused.    Military sources said after having secured the loyalty of  the  generals, including the commanders and commissars of the eight  military regions, Mr Deng and Vice-chairman of the CMC, General  Liu, are confident that the centrifugal tendencies of a number  of powerful regional cadres could be held in check.    In return, the army officers have been assured a big budget  and a large say in civilian matters, particularly foreign policy.    The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported  yesterday that Mr Deng recently toured Qingdao in eastern  Shandong province.    It quoted authoritative sources in Beijing as saying Mr Deng  was accompanied by General Liu and that he had given  instructions on maintaining stability.    The report was yesterday denied by the Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin.    Asked to clarify Mr Deng's whereabouts, Mr Wu said: "Mr Deng  Xiaoping is wherever he is."    Sources in Beijing said however, that Mr Deng had indeed  travelled out of Beijing, and that he had spent time with  General Liu on ways to promote stability.    The sources said the senior leader paid a week-long visit to  Shanghai in late April.    The patriarch's recent edicts are similar to those reported  in WEN WEI PO yesterday.    "To ensure the longevity of Communist-Party rule, we must  absolutely not change the policy of taking economic construction  as the national core," Mr Deng reportedly said.    "Taking the lesson from the former Soviet Union, we must  handle well the relationship between the centre and the regions.    "We must uphold Communist Party leadership The ruling status  of the Communist Party must no be compromised. China cannot  have a multi-party system."    What WEN WEI PO has not reported is that Mr Deng has given  instructions to the PLA, his major power base to "provide  imperial escort" to his policy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Two countries -- Rwanda and Burundi -- are today  stunned by the death of their presidents. The plane they were  traveling in from a summit in Dar es Salam crashed at Kigali  Airport. There were strong reports that it was shot down.  President Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprien Ntaryamira  and the other passengers and crew were all killed. [passage  omitted]    Well, if the presidential plane was shot down, then almost  certainly an accusing finger will be pointed by some quarters at  the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. They fought President  Habyarimana's government during the civil war, they are still  armed, and don't see eye to eye with the government over the  implementation procedures. Timothy Ecort asked RPF Commander  Major General Paul Kagame if his men had shot down the plane:    [Begin recording] [Kagame] No, no. To the best of my  knowledge, they didn't. The RPF batallion in Kigali is guarded  by the UN force and the shooting couldn't have come from that  batallion and we have nothing to do with that incident at all.    [Ecort] You are quite certain about that?    [Kagame] Yes, I am sure. If I wasn't I should let you know.    [Ecort] Do you have any clues as to what happened to the  airoplane?    [Kagame] Nothing at all. Not at all. But... [pauses] well,  I am not very surprised given the situation we have had in this  country for quite some time, where everybody has access to all  types of weapons and with the chaos that has been going on in  the country, I am not very surprised. Anybody could do that  kind of job.    [Ecort] Are you shocked?    [Kagame] Well, I am just aggrieved. I am not shocked. I  have heard of such a thing happening elsewhere, the kind of  business we have been engaged in is that of war, so I am not  very shocked. Such a thing can happen but it is unfortunate.    [Ecort] But you are not supposed to be at war at the moment,  aren't you? Aren't you supposed to be negotiating with the  government?    [Kagame] Yes, that is correct. We are not supposed to be at  war. In fact, we are not even supposed to be negotiating. I  think negotiations were also over long ago. We are supposed to  implement what were agreed on in those negotiations.    [Ecort] That is what I mean. You said these things happen  when you have chaos in the country, but you are saying this  thing is not related to the problems you are having in reaching  an agreement with the government.    [Kagame] I am saying... [pauses] the incident is certainly  related to the political chaos going on in the country and there  are so many parties to that problem. So, I am only imagining  that could be a result of that situation we have been in for  quite some time after the negotiations at a time when we should  be implementing what we have agreed on in those negotiations.    [Ecort] What do you think this will do to the situation  inside Rwanda now?    [Kagame] Well, I always imagine this may create some  problems. I always imagine that people who may come up with all  sorts of courses of action. So, we are just waiting to see what  happens. But on our part, we think it is an unfortunate  incident, but everybody should try and keep on the track on the  peace process.    [Ecort] Do you fear that chaos will break out again?    [Kagame] Well, there is a possibility. [passage omitted]</p>

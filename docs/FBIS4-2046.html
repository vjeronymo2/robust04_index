			<p>BFN     [Text] The organizational reform of the party and  government organs directly under the province has officially  started. The provincial party committee and government held a  mobilization rally on the morning of 4 March on the  organizational reform of the organs directly under the province  to implement the plan for the party and government  organizational reform of Jilin Province approved by the party  Central Committee and the State Council and to mobilize and  arrange the party and government organizational reform of the  organs directly under the province.    He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  chaired the rally. Liu Yazhi, standing committee member of the  provincial party committee and director of its organization  department, read the circular of the party Central Committee and  the State Council on the plan for the party and government  organizational reform of Jilin Province and the plan for the  setup of Jilin's provincial-level party and government  organizations. On behalf of the provincial party committee and  government, Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of Jilin, spoke to mobilize and arrange  the provincial-level party and government organizational reform  and put forward clear requirements.    Gao Yan pointed out: The provincial party committee decided  that Jilin's party and government organizational reform should  be conducted in such a way that the province as well as counties  and cities will start first and that the province will lead the  reform of cities [shi] and the autonomous prefecture, and  counties and cities will lead the reform of towns and townships.  The organizational reform at the provincial level and the  county level should be by and large completed in the first half  of this year, and efforts should be made to complete the  organizational reform at the city or autonomous prefectural  level and the town or township level in the second half of this  year. According to the province's party and government  organizational reform plan approved by the party Central  Committee and the State Council, Jilin's provincial-level party  and government organizations will total 54 after the  organizational reform. After the reform, the provincial party  committee will have nine organizations directly under it. The  provincial discipline inspection commission; the general office,  organization department, propaganda department, united front  work department, commission for politics and law, research  office, and rural work office of the provincial party committee;  and the work committee of the organs directly under the Jilin  Provincial CPC Committee are the agents of the provincial party  committee. In addition, the provincial party committee's  veteran cadre bureau, medical bureau, office of the secrets  commission, office of the overseas propaganda group, and office  of the leading group for the work toward Taiwan will be put  under the administration of the departments of the provincial  party committee. In line with the above-mentioned reform plan,  the organizations directly under the provincial party committee  will be reduced by four, or 30.8 percent, from the original 13  before the reform. After the organizational reform, the  provincial government will have 46 departments. They are  general office, planning commission, economic and trade  commission, economic structural reform commission, education  commission, science and technology commission, the foreign  affairs office of the provincial government, public security  department, state security department, supervision department,  civil affairs department, justice department, finance  department, personnel department, labor department, geological  and mineral resources department, construction department,  machinery industry department, metallurgical industry  department, petrochemical industry department, light industry  department, communications department, water resources  department, agriculture department, forestry department, trade  department, grain department, foreign trade department, foreign  economic cooperation department, culture department, radio and  television department, public health department, physical  culture and sports commission, family planning commission,  auditing department, statistical bureau, industrial and  commercial administration, press and publication bureau,  township enterprise management bureau, tax bureau, environmental  protection bureau, land management bureau, the legal system  bureau of the provincial government, construction industry  bureau, and coal industry bureau. In addition, following the  state's method, nine organizations under the administration of  the commissions and departments will be established: state  property management bureau, technological supervision bureau,  building material industry bureau, medical administration, food  industry bureau, labor reform work administration, the  letters-visits office of the provincial party committee and  government, the investigation and study office of the provincial  government, and the reception office of the provincial  government. These organizations under the administration of  commissions and departments will be at the deputy-departmental  level.    In line with the above-mentioned plan, the organizations of  the provincial government will be reduced by 23, or 33.3  percent, after the reform.    Gao Yan pointed out: The organizational reform of the  provincial-level people's congress and Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference organs, court, and  procuratorate will be conducted simultaneously with the party  and government organizational reform, and so will be the reform  of mass organizations, such as the provincial trade union  council, Communist Youth League committee, and women's  federation.    Speaking on the reform of the institutions directly under  the  province, Gao Yan pointed out: The orientation is the  separation of government functions from the functions of the  institutions and socialization of the institutions. After the  reform, the personnel of the institutions directly under the  province who are supported by financial allocation will be  reduced by over 20 percent.    Speaking on the organizational reform of cities, autonomous  prefecture, counties, cities [shi], towns, and townships, Gao  Yan urged that they should step up implementation of the plan  for the provincial party and government organizational reform  after it is transmitted to lower levels, study and work out the  specific plans for the organizational reform at their own  levels, and apply for approval according to the stipulated  procedures to their implementation.    Gao Yan also pointed out: In coordination with the  provincial party and government organizational reform, we should  popularize or try out the state public servant system in a  timely manner. All departments of the provincial organs should  institute the system in a timely manner after their  organizational reform plans are approved. The system should be  popularized or tried out mainly in party and government organs.  When popularizing or trying out the public servant system, the  organs directly under the province should adhere to the  following basic principles. First, the organizational reform  and the popularization or experimentation of the public servant  system should be conducted under unified plans and in a  coordinated manner, and they should support each other. Second,  key areas should be emphasized and consideration should also be  given to other areas. Third, standards should be unified,  different guidance given, and overall operation conducted.  Fourth, the organizations should be improved, their quality  raised, and their personnel optimized.    Comrade He Zhukang gave an important speech at the  mobilization rally. He emphasized: The following work should  be made successful if we are to achieve success in the present  organizational reform.    First, we should make conscientious efforts to unify  thinking. Pertinent comrades of all units should first take the  lead in studying documents and unifying their thinking in line  with the plan for the reform and the decision of the provincial  party committee and government to ensure smooth implementation  of the present organizational reform.    Second, we should give attention to focus in doing work. We  should devote more efforts to raising work efficiency. All  organizations and personnel should strive to raise work  efficiency in line with the requirements of the new functions  and the qualifications of public servants.    Third, we should correctly handle the relationship between  organizational reform and day-to-day work.    Fourth, we should strengthen leadership. To make the present  organizational reform successful, we should strengthen the  party's unified leadership, adhere to the principle of  democratic centralism, and strictly enforce discipline. Matters  related to the organizational reform should be decided after  collective discussions, and the practice of letting only one  person or a few persons have the final say should not be  permitted. This system should be strictly implemented  particularly in the transfer of personnel. Taking advantage of  the reform to promote cadres quickly, grant titles, divide up  money and materials, and transfer public property must never be  allowed. Pertinent departments should strengthen supervision  and examination and strictly deal with the law and discipline  breaches discovered in the process of reform.</p>

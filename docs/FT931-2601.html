			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Three banks have credit ratings lowered MOODY'S Investor Service, the US ratings agency, has lowered credit ratings of three Japanese trust banks due to continued asset-quality problems. Property-related loans have exposed the country's trust banks to increasing bad loans, while heavy reliance on asset-management businesses focusing on property and stocks has depressed their core profits. Moody's lowered the long-term rating of Mitsui Trust and Banking to Baa2 from A3. Mitsui is providing financial aid to Dai-Ichi Real Estate and its affiliates. The senior debt rating at Toyo Trust and Banking was lowered to Baa1 from A3. Moody's said Toyo might have to make large provisions on its bad loans, placing significant pressure on its already weak earnings. Yasuda Trust and Banking long-term ratings were downgraded to Baa2 from A3, while short-term ratings were lowered to prime-3 from prime-2.</p>

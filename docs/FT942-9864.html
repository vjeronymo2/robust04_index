			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: UN sees humanitarian successes in Somalia Sir, A month ago you reported some comments of mine ('UN's Somalia military role attacked', April 7) about the miliary role of the United Nations in Somalia, both during the American (non-UN) presence there and since its departure at the end of March. Your article chose not to cover those parts of my report which discussed the UN's humanitarian and legal programmes there. Somalia today bears little resemblance to the war-torn country of two years ago. A number of international and a host of Somali organisations have involved themselves in relief and reconstruction, and the UN has, particularly through Unicef and its legal section in the UN operation in Somalia (Unosom), played a key role in these processes. Whereas, by late 1992, more than a quarter of a million children had died from starvation caused by warfare, drought and poverty, now malnutrition is no longer a major emergency; more than 750,000 children have been vaccinated against a range of diseases; more than 80,000 have returned to school; some 3,000 water wells have been rehabilitated. Health services and food production are being revitalised and Somali women's organisations are more active than ever before. Cholera was detected in Somalia in February. Unicef played the leading role in structuring and resourcing a large campaign to educate people about the causes, symptoms and correct treatment of the disease; and - more importantly - how to prevent it. It also took action to chlorinate wells all over the country. To date some 15,000 cases have been identified, with 500 deaths. When we remember that the capital, Mogadishu, alone has a population of 900,000 people with very poor sanitation, to have kept the number of cases so low is a considerable achievement. The Unosom legal team is helping to re-establish district and regional administrations and is insisting that women should be included in them. A police force, a judiciary and a prison service are now being re-established. The enormous problems of the population are by no means over. But our fears that the withdrawal of the US and most of the European miliary contingents would very possibly lead to renewed warfare have not materialised. Somalia today remains a story of cautious optimism, as I said five weeks ago. In this context, the military problems of Unosom should not be seen as the beginning and the end of the UN story.

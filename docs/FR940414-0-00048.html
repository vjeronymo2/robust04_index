			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the publication of the final rule, the Department is clarifying the scope of covered awards under this policy. The policy is limited to those grants/cooperative agreements that have as their principal purpose a relationship wherein the recipient/partner will contribute resources to promote agency programs, publicize agency activities, assist in fundraising, or provide assistance to the agency. Therefore, because of the unlikelihood of a research award meeting this criteria, we are eliminating the separate distinction and policy for research awards. In determining the applicability of the policy, the focus should be on the purpose of the award. For such an award, the Department's policy should apply whether the award is for research or not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, since this rule merely implements a former Secretarial decision concerning the prohibition of recipients to use the Department's use of services and products provided as an endorsement.

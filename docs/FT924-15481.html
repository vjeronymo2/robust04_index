			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Former directors' payments push James Wilkes into red PAYMENTS to former directors helped to push James Wilkes, the engineer which earlier this year fought off a hostile bid from rival Petrocon, into the red with interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 316,000, against a profit of Pounds 2.75m last year. About Pounds 1m was paid to four former directors, including ex-chairman Mr Stephen Hinchliffe who left the board during the Petrocon bid. The compensation payments were taken above the line for a total exceptional charge of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a Pounds 338,000 gain last year. Mr Arthur Watt, chairman, said the company had suffered difficult trading conditions, particularly in the Presto machine tool and Deritend printing press subsidiaries. Sales in these two businesses had fallen by Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in the first half, with profits down by Pounds 1m. However, sales for the group as a whole were just Pounds 923,000 down at Pounds 28.4m. Operating profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.96m. Continuing businesses reported operating profits of Pounds 2.66m. Mr Watt said Wilkes' remaining businesses had performed as well as, if not better than, last year. He said he expected the first half trading pattern to continue for the rest of the year. However, he added that he would be 'devastated' if Wilkes remained in the red for the full year, before extraordinary items. The chairman expected gearing to remain at the current 92 per cent, which was 72 points lower than last year. Interest charges were slightly higher at Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.6m). The battle against Petrocon's bid cost Wilkes Pounds 1.6m in extraordinary items. The Pounds 612,000 loss on the sale of the aviation division was also taken below the line. Total extraordinary charges came to Pounds 5.1m, including the accounting requirement to write back Pounds 7.6m in goodwill which had previously written off. As a result the retained loss was Pounds 6m, compared with a profit of Pounds 990,000. The interim dividend was cut by 1.5p to 3.25p while the loss per share was 2.3p (10.4p earnings).</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / EU plans closer ties with Ukraine The European Union aims to wrap up negotiations on a more generous partnership and co-operation agreement with Ukraine before the March 27 parliamentary elections, a European Commission official said yesterday. The announcement of closer ties reflects concern in Brussels over the collapse in Ukraine's economy and a desire to use the prospect of stronger trade and political ties to curb extreme Ukrainian nationalism in the poll. At the same time, there was continued confusion over whether Thursday's vote by the Ukrainian parliament had gone as far as ratifying the Start 1 disarmament treaty, although it was widely acknowledged to have removed obstacles to ratification. The UK interpreted the vote as a decision to ratify, which it 'warmly' welcomed. In Washington, the White House hailed it as 'a major non-proliferation achievement', and expressed its confidence that Ukraine would soongo on to agree to the non-proliferation treaty. 'By approving the Lisbon protocol, Ukraine is committed to accede to the non-proliferation treaty in the shortest possible time,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. During Thursday's debate MPs insisted on more specific details on financial compensation, security guarantees and dismantlement procedures. Parliament told the government to finalise these technical agreements with the exchange of ratification instruments. This leaves a loophole for the Ukrainians on ratification should the technical agreements not be concluded to parliament's satisfaction. Parliament did not ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on Thursday, but will reconsider it soon. Meanwhile, EU officials said apartnership pact with the Kiev government could be signed before a similar agreement with Moscow. Talks between Russia and the European Commission continued yesterday, but there were few signs of progress on the two most difficult obstacles, the treatment of Russian uranium exports and the need to safeguardthe position of foreign banks operating in Russia. On Monday, EU foreign ministers will discuss progress on the Ukraine and Russia partnership agreements at a meeting in Brussels. Ministers are expected to agree to a mandate for the Commission to negotiate proposed free trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with Estonia likely to receive more favourable treatment because it has liberalised its economy fastest, the Commission said.</p>

			<p>This     issue focuses on recent reporting in the Algiers and Paris  French-language press on the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).      Slain GIA Members Identified      The 28 February edition of EL WATAN reported that GIA leader Si  Ahmed Mourad, known as El-Afghani, and IO GIA members were killed by  police forces in Bouzareah.  According to EL WATAN, among the GIA  members killed were Rachid Djabri, Beraf ta Aissa, Daas, and  Lounici; the others have not yet been identified.  (LIBERTE of 28  February reported that Aissa's death has not yet been confirmed.)      EL WATAN reported the following biographical information on the  GIA members:      Si Ahmed Mourad, a 29-year-old Afghan veteran living in Kouba,  had been condemned to death in absentia by the Algier's Special  Court.  Mourad was reportedly responsible for several  assassinations, as well as numerous crimes attributed to the GIA.  Mourad, Beraf ta Aissa, Rachid Djabri, and Buezmir Mohamed were said  to have been behind the October kidnapping of three French Consulate  employees.  Five GIA members were killed in the operation, although  Mourad, Aissa, Djabri, and Mohamed escaped.  Mohamed was later  killed by police.  (According to the 1 March edition of LIBERTE,  Mourad was also known as "Seif Ellah" ("Sayf Allah").)      Berafta Aissa, 35, and Rachid Djabri, 29, were both residents of  Algiers.  An arrest warrant had been issued for their involvement in  several murders and other crimes in the Algiers region.  Daas had  reportedly been GIA head in Bouzareah and was wanted for several  murders.      Reaction to Slaying of GIA Members      According to an article in EL WATAN of 28 February, the slaying  of the GIA members on 27 February was not only "a brilliant success  for the forces of order but also a significant blow to the  organization and structure of the terrorist groups."  The deaths of  El-Afghani and his followers, considered "the bloodiest and the most  radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the terrorist  movement," was viewed as a "decisive turning point" in a three-year  struggle against "terrorism."  According to EL WATAN, it is  "reasonable to think that a considerable slakening" in GIA activity  can be expected, although the paper did not rule out retaliatory  acts by surviving group members.  El-Afghani's refusal to support  dialogue between the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the  government made his wing of the GIA a "serious barrier to dialogue."  Now, according to EL WATAN, "his disappearance should logically open  channels for dialogue."  Given the GIA's threats under El-Afghani to  kill all Islamists who engaged in any kind of negotiations with the  government, EL WATAN asserted that his death was probably a priority  and a prerequisite for any negotiations between the FIS and the  government.      An article in the 28 February LIBERTE interpreted the police  operation as an indication that Algerian President Liamine Zeroual  is "determined" to combat violence:  "The successful attack  demonstrated that the authorities not only had the intention of not  easing up on armed groups, but when necessary also had the means to  attack 'terrorism'."  According to the article, the incident will  "have a great effect on government-FIS negotiations," given El-  Afghani's resistence to dialogue.  However, the LIBERTE article also  predicted that the government would harden its position that  eradicating violence is of primary importance.  The article also  speculates that the government is still in the process of "getting  back on its feet" after having recently appointed a new president.      New GIA Leadership; Organizational Structure      Sayah Attia has replaced Mourad Si Ahmed as chief of the GIA,  according to Paris daily LE FIGARO of 9 March.  Algiers daily EL  WATAN of 1 March reported that Attia's group is one of three  operating outside of Algiers under the name of the "Armed Islamic  Group."      Sayah Attia, the son of a "Harki", operates in Medea, Ksar El  Boukhari, and Tissemsilt, according to EL WATAN.  The newspaper  calls him a "bloodthirsty" individual who prefers hand-to-hand  fighting.  He reportedly leads a "commando" of armed criminals,  which is said to have committed over 200 "savage" terrorist acts.  Attia is reportedly responsible for 132 assassinations, and 283 acts  of aggression and vandalism.  Security services have identified him  as the ringleader in the killing of 12 Croats in December, as well  as an attack on an official motorcade in Tissemsilt that killed 10  and a 1993 attack on the Boughezoul military barracks.  ALGER  REPUBLICAIN of 8 March reported that Attia returned to Afghanistan  in 1989 with Saudi assistance.  After staying in Afghanistan three  years, he re-entered Algeria clandestinely in November 1992.  Attia  is the father of six children, and recently took a 14-year-old as  his second wife.      Khaled Sehili heads the second "Armed Islamic Group" which  operates in Blida, El-Affroun, Chrea, and Boufarik, according to EL  WATAN.  Sehili is reportedly responsible for the slaying of at least  SO police officers and nearly 150 acts of sabotage.  He is also  reportedly responsible for an ambush which killed about 12 military  personnel last September in Chrea.      Kada Benchiha, also the son of a "Harki", heads the third "Armed  Islamic Group" which operates in Sidi Bel-Abbes.  The group is  composed of about 20 "elements" who reportedly easily slip through  police blockades and escape from police sweeps in the region.  Benchiha is reportedly responsible for the assassination of two  French surveyors last September and for a fire at ENIE in Sidi Bel-  Abbes last August.

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / EC rule on work hours angers Hunt MR DAVID HUNT, the new employment secretary, yesterday attacked the European Community's directive to introduce a maximum 48-hour working week as 'unnecessary and bureaucratic'. A meeting of EC employment and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg today is expected to approve it. Britain will abstain in the vote over the 48-hour directive. It has already secured an opt-out of its provisions for the next 10 years - unlike its EC partners which have three years to implement it. Approval does not require a unanimous vote by the EC ministers, which means Britain will be unable to block approval of the directive. But Mr Hunt's public attack on the proposal after only four days in his new job suggests his arrival at the department will bring no change to the British government's generally hostile attitude to much of the EC's social programme. Although described as being on the left of the Conservative party, Mr Hunt shares the conviction of his party's right wing that EC directives such as the one on a 48-hour working week are a burden on the European labour market that threatens competitiveness. He said yesterday on the BBC's Today programme: 'Forcing employers and employees throughout Europe to restrict their working hours is the sort of unnecessary regulation which is going to result in a loss of world markets.' Mr Hunt said he hoped his EC colleagues would 'allow common sense to prevail' and concentrate on solving Europe's unemployment crisis - 17m are jobless. Britain is also likely to find itself isolated today in Luxembourg over a directive to introduce mandatory consultative works councils in large pan-European companies. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, expressed support for the 48-hour directive. He said: 'Our route to success must lie through high skills and high productivity. These will only come through the higher standards of social protection limits, such as working hours and worker involvement in decision-making. Europe cannot compete by driving standards down but only by raising them.' Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'If Tory arguments were right the British, with the poorest employment laws, would be the most prosperous in Europe, have the fewest out of work and the best balance of trade. 'In fact, our standard of living has fallen to eighth position in the EC tables, our real jobless total is the highest in the EC and we have the EC's worst trade deficit with the rest of the world.'</p>

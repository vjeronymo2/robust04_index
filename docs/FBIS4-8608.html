			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 14 April carries in its  regular 45-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic.    Describing the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that  "the chetniks have been fiercely shelling all the residential  areas this afternoon. It has been particularly bad in Vitkovici  and the surrounding villages." He says that "the chetniks have  been pounding the village of Kopaci with multiple rocket  launchers. The latest information is that the chetnik heavy  artillery and infantry attacks are still under way on (Borova)  from the direction of Ustipraca. There is very fierce  hand-to-hand fighting."    Enes Osmancevic reports from Tuzla that "this morning  Karadzic's Serbs fired with tanks and artillery at Tuzla  airport. A dozen destructive shells were fired at the airport  from Jablanica on Mt. Majevica, which has been under the control  of Karadzic's terrorists since the outbreak of the war." He  says that "just after this artillery attack on Tuzla airport,  NATO planes appeared and patrolled for a while over Tuzla and  Mt. Majevica."    Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "the  defenders have been heroically resisting attacks that have been  coming in waves. In decisive counterattacks, the defenders  today eliminated dozens of chetniks and destroyed one T-55 tank.  As for Buzim, the attacks on this area have been increasingly  coming from the territory of Croatia, that is, from the  so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina, and the enemy  mortar shells have also been sailing over the heads of members  of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]."    Reporting on the situation in Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says  that  "the Serbian aggressor's troops have today carried out a whole  series of tank and infantry attacks. There have been nine of  them on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-Boderiste direction alone,  and at the moment of reporting chetnik infantry and tanks,  supported by all sorts of artillery pieces, are attacking the  central part of the Brcko defenses, and again Omerbegovaca,  Vranovaca, and Boderiste. These attacks, which were launched  late this afternoon, came after the aggressor received new  amounts of MTS [expansion unknown] from Banja Luka." He says  that "over 3,000 shells of various types have landed on the  Brcko defense lines today, and the enemy commanders are also not  sparing their manpower. Such losses by the aggressor have been  unseen here since last summer. The fighters of the 108th  Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brigade have brought the  chetniks to their knees today. At 1615 the fighters of the  108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a chetnik tank with its entire  crew, then they destroyed the command post of an enemy unit, and  then a chetnik stronghold on the central part of the Brcko  front. There was a real slaughter of chetniks in the  Omerbegovaca- Vranovaca-Boderiste direction. (Two) high-ranking  enemy officers and a number of their retinue still lie dead in  front of our positions. The chetnik ambulances have today  covered as many kilometers as there are on the Paris-Dakar  rally."    Ahmed Begicevic reports from Travnik that "the chetnik  shelling started early this morning and throughout the day  mortars of all calibers have been landing on the town. The  chetniks also shelled the defense lines in Turbe."</p>

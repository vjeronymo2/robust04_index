			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IT'S EASY TO CHECK SOCIAL SECURITY STATUS  </P> <P> QUESTION: How can a taxpayer find out if all the Social Security contributions  that have been taken out of her paycheck have been paid to the government and  that the government has accurate records of these payments? -- L. J.  </P> <P> ANSWER: It's worthwhile to find out every few years whether your Social  Security account is at the level it should be, and believe it or not, there is  a fairly easy way to check. The same procedure will also tell you how much you  can expect to receive from Social Security upon retirement.  </P> <P> Simply call 1-800-937-2000. This toll-free number has been set aside  exclusively for telephone requests for Social Security Form SSA-7004, "Personal  Earnings and Benefit Estimate." If you have difficulty getting through on the  line, try the general Social Security request line, 1-800-234-5SSA, and ask for  the same form.  </P> <P> When you get the form, which asks your birth date, Social Security number and a  few other questions, complete it and mail it back to the address that  accompanies the form. The Social Security Administration will then send you a  listing of your Social Security-qualified employment earnings and expected  retirement benefits.  </P> <P> If you think that there is an error in the information, you should contact your  local Social Security office. Be prepared to show agency officials appropriate  tax returns or earnings statements to support your position. Agency officials  say they cannot guarantee that they will be able to correct mistakes made more  than three years earlier, and that's why they recommend filing Form SSA-7004  every three years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consult Expert on Property Exchanges  </P> <P> Q: We are a bit confused about tax-deferred exchanges of real estate. How do  these procedures work, and how much time do we have to complete one of these  transactions? We have tried to read as much as we can about these exchanges,  but all of this is still pretty mystifying. For example, these transactions  seem to go by a lot of different names. Please clarify. -- G. J. B.  </P> <P> A: We'll try to clear matters up for you, but, please understand, tax-deferred  exchanges are a complicated subject and you will probably want to consult an  expert -- specifically an "accommodator" -- before proceeding.  </P> <P> First of all, tax-deferred exchanges, also known as Starker exchanges because  of a famous legal case on the subject, are available only for similar types of  property. You may exchange a piece of investment real estate for another  investment property, but you may not engage in a tax-deferred exchange of a  principal residence for a piece of income property. The law outlining the  requirements is contained in Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, which  is why these transactions are sometimes referred to as "1031 exchanges."  </P> <P> Under legislation passed in 1984, a seller has 45 days after the close of  escrow on the sale of his initial property to identify the real estate he  wishes to acquire through a tax-deferred exchange. He must complete the  acquisition of that property within 180 days of the escrow closing. Pay  attention: The government allows a maximum of 180 days from the close of escrow  on this first property for the completion of a tax-deferred exchange. You do  not have 45 days to select the property and an additional 180 days in which to  complete the purchase.  </P> <P> When you enter escrow for the sale of your initial property, you should advise  your real estate broker as well as your escrow officer that you intend the  proceeds of the sale to go into a tax-deferred exchange. This is a very  important matter, and a statement of your intentions should be included in the  official escrow instructions. Equally important is the requirement that you  never take possession of the proceeds from the sale of the initial property. If  you do, the tax-deferred advantage of the transaction is forfeited.  </P> <P> Because of the strict regulations surrounding tax-deferred exchanges, you  should get help from a qualified third-party accommodator before attempting one  of these transactions. Your real estate broker, escrow officer or family  attorney should be able to steer you to an accountant or lawyer who has been  trained as an accommodator. But be careful. The area is ripe for abuse, and you  could be out of luck if you select an unskilled or inexperienced, unqualified  accommodator.  </P> <P> The most important service the accommodator performs is temporarily taking  possession both of the property you intend to buy and of the funds you receive  from the first property sale to ensure that you never touch those assets until  the deal is completed. These are highly sensitive and important duties, and you  should be sure to interview prospective accommodators carefully before making  your selection to learn of their experience and qualifications.  </P> <P> For additional information, see Internal Revenue Service publications No. 17,  "Your Federal Income Tax," or No. 544, "Sales and Other Dispositions of  Property."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Hike Deduction on 2nd Home's Loan  </P> <P> Q: I recently purchased a vacation home for $500,000. I know I can deduct the  mortgage interest on this house. However, I wonder if I can finance the  vacation house by making a cash down payment of $100,000 and increasing the  mortgage on my principal residence by $400,000? I can get a better interest  rate by borrowing on my principal house than I can if I borrow on the vacation  home. -- R. B.  </P> <P> A: You may be able to get a better interest rate by increasing the mortgage on  your principal residence, but your borrowing power on this house has been  severely limited by recent tax code revisions. Under the current law, you are  limited to increasing the mortgage on your principal residence by just $100,000  if you want the interest on that loan to be completely tax deductible.  </P> <P> So, in your case, if you want the mortgage interest to be fully deductible, you  can, at best, borrow $100,000 on your principal house. The remainder of the  purchase would have to be financed through a combination of a down payment and  a mortgage on the property for which the loan proceeds are intended: your  vacation house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handwritten Will Is Perfectly Legal  </P> <P> Q: I am a widow with assets of less than $100,000. I intend to leave all my  possessions to my only child, a son. Since my affairs are uncomplicated, will a  handwritten will, duly signed, stand up legally? -- S. W. G.  </P> <P> A: Yes. According to the lawyers we consulted, you can leave a handwritten  will, also known as a holographic will, indicating how your possessions are to  be disposed of after your death. You should be sure to write the entire  document by hand. Do not merely type it and then sign it. Put the complete date  on the document: month, date and year. You should indicate in the text of the  will that you are of sound mind and that you intend the document to serve as  your will. Be sure to sign it with your full legal name. The will does not have  to be signed by a witness. Keep it with your other important papers.  </P> <P> Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this  column to financial questions of general interest.

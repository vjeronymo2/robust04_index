			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Concluding" address by President Leonid Kravchuk at the </F> Supreme Council session in Kiev -- live]    [Text] To begin with, I shall answer some of the comments  made and questions asked here. First of all, about a legally  binding document on compensation to Ukraine for nuclear weapons.  As for strategic nuclear weapons, such a document was signed  with Russia and it is legally binding. It was signed by the  Russian and Ukrainian premiers, [Viktor] Chernomyrdin and the  then Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma. As for  compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, by all means there  will be this compensation. As early as this month experts will  begin to work on determining the value of these weapons. They  are experts from Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Thus,  on the main issue on the agenda here, that is, on compensation  for nuclear weapons to Ukraine, one part of it was legally  settled and the other will be settled after the evaluation of  these nuclear weapons.    This, I tell you, is what it is in reality. There is an  absolutely specific accord on the part of Ukraine: Should one of  the sides fail to fulfill its obligations, Ukraine for its part  will stop actions.    Next, there is no agreement -- and I do not know where what  was said here comes from -- on the destruction of missiles,  including SS-24's. There is no such a thing, I emphasize this.  What it is about is lowering the combat status of missiles, not  destroying SS-24's. This is quite another matter. It is about  lowering their combat status. As for withdrawing them, we will  determine what warheads will be withdrawn and not the  destruction of missiles, as was said here. Not a single  document mentions this. Why distort facts? This is a question  of principle.    I emphasize -- please do not interrupt me -- it is  specifically about lowering their combat status and withdrawing  200 warheads within 10 months, without specifying what warheads  and from what missiles.    Next, I have nowhere and never said that I will withdraw  nuclear warheads independently from the Supreme Council  decision. I address this reply to Mr. Hudyma. The talk was  about the following: When the nuclear warhead becomes physically  obsolete and when Ukraine faces danger, then irrespective of the  decision, whether taken by the president or the Supreme Council  -- and the defense minister was saying about this, by the way,  people will not say this is not true -- then the nuclear  warheads will have to be withdrawn. Because there will be a  dilemma: Either danger or nuclear warheads. I have said this  and I am saying this to you. As for everything else, the  president's actions will be adequate to the Supreme Council  decision.    Another question arises. I want to tell you about this  sincerely. If we withdraw the warheads according to an  agreement, this is an appropriate legal document and a process  of compensation. If we withdraw in the face of danger, then the  question will be put in a different manner by those who accept  the warheads. It is not by chance that I read the message from  the chief designer, or, a group of chief designers. This is a  question of principle and one must take it into account.    I can fully support those deputies who are saying that not  everything has been done neatly over this time, both on the part  of the president and on the part of the government, that we have  made many mistakes and that it is really true that we have been  put in complicated economic, political, and international  situations and that these situations require appropriate  actions. And if someone has other possibilities for such  actions, then let him offer them. I have been acting in line  with the decisions of the Supreme Council and I was striving to  achieve the fulfillment of those decisions.    One more thing: Not a single country can ever claim that all  agreements should be concluded with it in advance, before it  determines its final status. We have to determine our status.  If we are a nonnuclear state, then we have to exercise this  status consistently. And after that the agreements are  concluded -- both the defense minister and Vasyl Vasyloyvych  Durdynets [deputy chairman of the Supreme Council] have partly  enumerated those agreements which are envisioned for signing: On  the value of compensation, on silos, on withdrawal, on schedules  -- everything will be done without fail. Not a single move can  be made without such agreements because it would be dangerous to  make such moves and nobody would do this.    I understand that today it is difficult to make decisions,  there are political problems, there is pressure applied on  Ukraine. They are right who say that Russia should abandon its  claims to Ukraine. But these claims were made by that Supreme  Soviet which no longer exists. There is another Supreme Soviet.  Now that country must determine itself and I support those who  raise this question, but you must understand that there are  relevant procedures and a relevant order. I cannot force the  Duma or the Federal Assembly of Russia to cancel these  reservations, as far as the former Supreme Soviet is concerned.  Russia itself will determine whether or not these are legal.  And, in the long run, this is the legal and constitutional  right of the Duma and the Federal Assembly. We can only propose  that such steps should be taken.    We are facing economic problems which must be solved. And if  we stop or block, as People's Deputy Haysynskyy said, this  process in the presence of all those economic difficulties and  absence of possibilities to act, both in relation to power  engineering, nuclear power stations, and fuel elements, then we  will have to face the dilemma: Either one or the other.    I would like to assure you, esteemed people's deputies,  that Ukraine will be compensated for both tactical and strategic  nuclear weapons. I would like to tell you that today, at  lunchtime, I received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton,  in which he gave his consent to double economic aid to Ukraine  -- specific figures, serious figures are mentioned, to provide  assistance in eliminating nuclear weapons and to provide aid to  those officers who need social protection, including housing.    As a matter of fact, I was acting in a situation which took  shape, I was acting so as not to do harm to Ukraine, so as to  preserve the state. Maybe, someone else can do it better. Now  it is up to the Supreme Council. I would only like to say that  we must take steps consistently. And this consistency was  initiated by the Supreme Council and I believe that this Supreme  Council must also say its final word, to finish what it once  began.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

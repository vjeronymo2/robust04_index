			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eva Mitrova, newly appointed ambassador of </F> the Slovak Republic to Hungary, by Ivan Scipiades in Budapest;  date not given: "We Would Like To Receive Positive Feedback"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Scipiades] In a recent  interview to MAGYAR HIRLAP, your Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik  admitted that foreign policy is the only area in which the  Slovak Government can show results until the elections scheduled  for September this year; he also declared that he wants to send  positive signals to the outside world, including Hungary. You  will convey some of these signals. What signals can we expect  in the near future?    [Mitrova] We will indeed try to convey such signals, and  Hungary is among our priorities. The Slovak Government adopted  the law on population registration a few days ago, a law that  makes it possible for national minority women to register their  names without the Slovak ending "ova." I hope the Slovak  Parliament will also adopt the law soon and that this will end  the debate on this issue. I regard this as a really positive  signal. I hope the issue of village and town names will also be  solved soon.    [Scipiades] What would you like to achieve as ambassador in  Budapest?    [Mitrova] I would like to contribute to the easing of  tension prevailing between the two countries, a tension that  seems to have already decreased slightly. I see possibilities  for such an easing of tension. I think the most important thing  for me is to create confidence. I would like very much to also  receive positive signals from Hungary to our positive signals  because this is very important for us to be able to come up with  further positive steps. [passage omitted]    [Scipiades] In your opinion, what effect could the Hungarian  elections have on the Slovak election campaign or the elections  themselves?    [Mitrova] I very much hope that the Hungarian elections will  only have positive effects. On both banks of the Danube, we  came to the conclusion that there is no other solution but to  seek and find a way adequate to both sides; otherwise, both  sides will also hurt themselves. [passage omitted]    [Scipiades] Do you see any possibility of opening consulates  and some further border crossing points?    [Mitrova] There are no serious obstacles whatsoever in  gradually implementing these things. I cannot yet give you a  concrete time, but these are natural things. [passage omitted]</p>

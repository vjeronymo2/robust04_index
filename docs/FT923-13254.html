			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (9): Survival seems assured - Image of store cards still dented by memories of credit surge STORE cards do not, at face value, have much of a future. Many bad memories of the credit surge of the late 1980s revolve around both the ease with which credit could be obtained from retailers, and its expense. It was easy to build up a heavy bill. That led to mountainous debts. Store cards - the cards offered by individual retailers, usable in general only in the stores themselves - suffered a dent in reputation as a result, from which survey evidence suggests they have still not fully recovered. A survey by Credit Card Software International (CCSI) earlier this year found that 'high interest rates' was the most common reason, cited by 31 per cent of respondents, given by consumers for not having a store card. Credit from a store card is certainly expensive compared to the rates on offer from credit cards, which almost always charge less than 30 per cent annual percentage rate (APR). Store cards vary from 26.6 per cent (Marks &amp; Spencer and Selfridges) to 38.5 per cent (Kingfisher). Other high rates come from Littlewoods and Sears (38.4 per cent) and Dixons (37.6 per cent). A further complication is the widespread introduction of front-end fees by credit card issuers, who found they were needed to cover losses on accounts which were regularly paid in full. Card-users with all the big four clearing banks, and with several other leading issuers are now obliged to pay an annual fee, even if they always pay their bills promptly. This move caused outrage among consumer groups, but neatly made it easier for credit card issuers to make a profit. This avenue towards cutting costs is not open to store cards, which aim in part to foster increased brand loyalty. Customers might regard fees as an unreasonable burden on a product which could only be used in one store, and so fees are 'not even on the agenda', according to Ms Elizabeth Stanton of the Retail Credit Group. They could if anything harm the loyalty of regular customers. A year ago there were several premature obituaries of store cards as an ossified market, unable to compete with more flexible rivals. However, the retail credit industry ardently denies this, pointing out that the cards are not intended primarily as a vehicle for lending. Ms Stanton said: 'The primary aim of a store card is to increase customer loyalty. An awful lot of people never pay any interest at all on their cards in any case.' On this argument, store cards are simply the application of modern technology to the usual service of offering regular customers an account. Store cards are now the most convenient method of doing this, and so their survival in form should be assured. The cards' proponents also suggest that the introduction of fees by credit cards might boost the use of store cards. Mr Keith Douglas-Jones, a member of the Finance and Leasing Association, and marketing director of Sears Financial Services, says: 'Bank card issuers have seen their traditional revenue streams reduced, and have compensated by introducing fees. This will lead to a store card renaissance, in those areas where the issuers provide a range of tangible service benefits for their customers. 'Store cards are highly developed loyalty-building marketing tools used by retailers to strengthen the relationships with their best customers. The credit, if required, is just another feature which gives the account its versatility and flexibility.' The CCSI survey seems to support this conclusion. It found that ease of use was cited by 56 per cent of store card holders as a reason for using a card, while 21 per cent used them because of card-holder discounts. Vitally, given the cards' role in fostering brand loyalty, holding a store's card makes a consumer 50 per cent more likely to use that store each week. But the survey also showed that store cards fall a long way behind other credit instruments. Only 16 per cent of adults own at least one current store card (5 per cent have two or more), compared with 45 per cent who hold a bank credit card, and 74 per cent who have a current account, which normally will include a cheque card. And a look at the figures for Marks &amp; Spencer suggests that store cards are regarded by consumers as a competitor to credit cards. Marks &amp; Spencer does not accept any credit or debit cards apart from its own store cards, and the company accounts for one third of all recent purchases using store cards, according to the survey. Marks &amp; Spencer has also taken a distinctive course in keeping its card operation 'in house'. This issue divides the industry. Mr Neil Grant, director of the Finance and Leasing Association, says: 'There have been two distinct approaches taken by retailers and there are arguments in favour of both approaches. Those, like Sears and Marks &amp; Spencer, which have maintained their own card operation, feel this is the best way to ensure their store cards are used as an important marketing tool. Others have passed their store cards to finance houses when the financial going got tough.' A year ago it looked as though farming administration out to finance houses would become the norm. However, the trend has now come to a halt. According to Ms Stanton: 'There was a great switch starting two or three years ago but it's now settled down.' She said companies which had kept their operations effectively in-house included Sears, Littlewoods, Kingfisher and the John Lewis Partnership. The bigger names which opted to contract out their services included Storehouse, Burton and House of Fraser. However, fraud has brought co-ordinated action from the industry. The problem - either at the point of application for a card, or by interceptions in the post - is growing, and the industry is addressing it via the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance Scheme (CIFAS). This pools information by allowing companies to enter details on fraudulent applications with a credit reference agency. The applicant can then be subjected to more rigorous tests. For the future, 'smart cards', which would cut down on the risk of fraud still further since they carry a small amount of intelligence with them, are likely to be the next significant item on the agenda. The possibilities of the new technology for enhancing the cards' use as a tool for brand loyalty are obvious, and are being explored.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. VS. ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> There was nothing in "L.A. vs O.C.: A Special Report" (June 17) that a  10-minute drive through either county would not reveal.  </P> <P> Generally, the article was a presentation of data of well-known facts. That is,  Orange County: Republican, white, "parties," wealth, condos, surfers.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County: Polluted, crime, urbane, culture sites, freeways, racial  diversity.  </P> <P> What I said in two sentences took Patt Morrison ("Family Feud") 12 pages. What  a waste.  </P> <P> HAATSARI KAGURABADZA  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

The format for each monitoring element, whether it is implementation, effectiveness, or validation monitoring would address the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Monitoring Goal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Purpose of Monitoring <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Unit of Measure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Threshold of Variability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Frequency of Monitoring <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Responsibilities  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This EIS will tier to the Final EIS and Forest Plan. The CMP is incorporated into the Forest Plan. The CMP provides the programmatic management direction for the HCNRA. The Forest Plan provides goals and objectives, standards and guidelines, management area direction, and monitoring and evaluation for the various lands on the Forest and HCNRA. Both the Forest Plan and CMP provide programmatic management direction for site-specific management practices that will be utilized during the implementation of the Forest Plan and CMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCNRA consists of an estimated 652,488 acres. The HCNRA is comprised of the following management areas: wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, dispersed recreation/native vegetation, forage, dispersed recreation/timber management, research natural areas, and developed recreation and administrative facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis will consider a range of alternatives, including no-action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis, beginning with the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, local agencies and other individuals, organizations, or governments who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identifying potential issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identifying major issues to be analyzed in depth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Identifying issues which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Exploring additional alternatives based on themes which will be derived from issues recognized during scoping activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of this project and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Notifying interested publics of opportunities to participate through meetings, personal contacts, or written comment. Keeping the public informed through the media and/or written material (i.e., newsletters, correspondence, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft EIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is expected to be available for public review by April, 1995. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The final EIS is expected to be available for public review by September, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived or dismissed by the court if not raised until after completion of the final EIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F.2d. 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 30-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully be considered and responded to in the final EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merit of the alternatives discussed. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public workshops are scheduled in Boise and Grangeville, Idaho and Enterprise and Portland, Oregon on November 28 through December 1. Please contact Kurt Wiedenmann, Planning Team Leader, at (503) 523&hyph;1296 for additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by September, 1995. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding the proposal. R.M. Richmond, Forest Supervisor, is the Responsible Official. As the Responsible Official, he will decide whether to implement the proposal or a different alternative. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service Appeal Regulations (36 CFR part 217). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> R.M.

Right after the tragic  developments of October 3 and 4 he decided to use up his annual  leave for the past two years. After his vacation he resigned.    The new Prosecutor General, Aleksey Kazannik, signed his  request for resignation without even interviewing him. "I  resigned because the present office of prosecutor general with  its new functions and powers does not conform to the model I had  created," Stepankov stressed.    According to him, he has not been summoned yet as a witness  in the legal proceedings connected with the October events,  though he participated in them on both sides.    Beginning with September 21, Stepankov explained, he visited  the parliament building more than once, where the congress of  people's deputies was taking place, and attended sessions held  at the headquarters led by First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets.    As Stepankov said, he is still out of work. He declined the  only offer he received: the Foreign Trade Minister, Oleg  Davydov, offered him a job abroad.    When asked by INTERFAX's correspondent why he had taken no  part in the race for parliament, Stepankov said that his former  work as a member of the Supreme Soviet had not satisfied him,  and so he was not prepared to join the new parliament. "I  belonged to no faction in the previous legislature, and now I  have no wish to represent the interests of any party in the new  parliament," Stepankov pointed out.    With reference to the case of those who plotted the failed  August 1991 coup, the former prosecutor general said: "Now,  looking back, some charges against myself could be revoked."  According to Stepankov, at one time he was accused of  procrastinating with investigations. "But those investigations  began only four and a half months previously, and 9 months more  were spent on acquainting the defendants and their lawyers with  the materials. The trial has been in progress for over a year  now, but only one defendant has been questioned so far."</p>

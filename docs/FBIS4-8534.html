			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Following the dismissal of Defense  Minister Janez Jansa on 28 March, his Social Democratic Party of  Slovenia [SDSS] left the governing coalition, raising the  prospect of a political crisis in Slovenia. Prime Minister Janez  Drnovsek tried to discount this possibility in an interview  published by the Brussels LE SOIR on 31 March. In response to a  question about the governing coalition (comprised of Drnovsek's  Liberal Democrats [LDS], the Christian Democrats [SDK], the  United List of Social Democrats [ZLSD], and Jansa's Social  Democrats) now being "threatened" by Jansa's removal, Drnovsek  said that his party was prepared to rule with the Christian  Democrats alone, because "above all, the entire country first  needs continuity and stability." Drnovsek minimized the  possibility that other parties would demand a new election,  saying he was convinced that the LDS, his own party, would  emerge with a majority if "elections were held today."    According to 31 March Ljubljana Radio reports, the LDS  discussed future relations with its coalition partners at a  closed meeting in which Drnovsek remarked that the coalition  agreement would probably have to be "redefined." The SKD, led by  Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, discussed two possibilities:  immediate departure from the government or continued  cooperation. The SKD leaders decided to remain, stating that in  "times of political crisis" the cooperation of the two parties  was necessary to establish a "new political balance," and  recommending to Drnovsek that the ZLSD, a coalition of leftist  parties, leave the government.    A commentary in the 28 March issue of the right-of-center  Ljubljana daily SLOVENEC strongly criticized Jansa's removal,  characterizing it as "a putsch" organized by the leftist forces,  and predicted further polarization of the Slovene political  scene--the strengthening of the right-wing opposition parties in  their fight against "corruption and neocommunism" on one side  and attempts by the leftist parties to "restore old political  structures" in all spheres of public life on the other.    The liberal Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK of 28 March expressed  concern about the impact of Jansa's dismissal on the military  readiness of the armed forces, emphasizing that the army must  remain depoliticized. Indicating that there might be further  personnel changes in the Defense Ministry and in the armed  forces, the paper says that military personnel "carry the  largest burden" and must prove that "the army serves the country  and does not take part in politics in this critical political  situation." In this context, DNEVNIK sees Colonel General Albin  Gutman, the armed forces commander, having a "special  responsibility," because it depends largely on him how much  impact political developments might have on his subordinates.    On 29 March Ljubljana Radio reported that the State Chamber  of the Slovene Assembly had confirmed Jansa's removal as defense  minister by a vote of 49 in favor and 39 opposed and approved  Jelko Kacin, Prime Minister Drnovsek's choice to replace him, by  a vote of 48 to 39. In an interview published in DNEVNIK on 25  March, nominee Kacin stated that "recent events" had damaged the  reputation of the military, which must try to restore its  positive image. He said that as defense minister he would strive  to restructure Slovenia's Territorial Defense Force into a  modern army composed of highly trained personnel and equipped  with sophisticated technology. His goal, he added, was to create  a "depoliticized, professional" army whose members would be  sought as specialists in the civilian economy when their  military careers were concluded.    DNEVNIK's 28 March prediction of further personnel changes  appears to have been borne out by Kacin's replacement of Anton  Krkovic, commander of the "Moris" 1st Special Brigade, with  Vojko Pavlin, former head of the School for Noncommissioned  Officers, reported in the 31 March issue of SLOVENEC. According  to the 29 March issue of Ljubljana MLADINA, a pro-LDS weekly,  "special" units are subordinate directly to the defense minister  rather than to the armed forces' chain of command.</p>

The extra budget will become law later in the day after  being  passed by the full upper house. The more powerful House of  Representatives passed the budget program on Tuesday.    The third extra budget calls for a spending increase of some  2.19 trillion yen over the second supplementary budget.    It will help finance the largest-ever pump-priming package  of  15.25 trillion yen, and increases the overall general account  budget for the current fiscal year ending March 31 to about  77.44 trillion yen.</p>

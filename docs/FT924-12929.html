			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Gucciesque style on a budget ONE THING you do not need to achieve the sleek, Gucciesque, town-into-country style is an Italian textile magnate's budget. So ingrained has this look become in global fashion that it has been copied, sometimes unwittingly, by every chain store in the UK. It is rarely presented in shops as a total look. It is up to you to pull the ingredients together. So, to help you search through those forbidding rails, here are a few rules: Start by deciding on a colour scheme, because the point of this style is that everything should blend smoothly. Stick to warm-toned and less obvious shades: they look more opulent than cooler neutral. Decide how to layer your outfit. A simple, boxy, easy-cut short coat works for either sex, perhaps edge-to-edge or a parka for a woman, a duffle or pea jacket for a man. Fabric should be a soft-textured, wool mix - even a little cashmere content can be reasonably priced - or a muted check. Under this can go toning knitwear in the same understated but elegant mood, perhaps with a plain cotton shirt as a base. You can make the look more formal by replacing the knit with a tailored jacket. Armed with this plan you can track down the crucial pieces. Marks and Spencer has excellent plain knitwear and wool moufflon or flannel jackets for both sexes. Benetton has a range of knitwear and wool separates in pale, warm shades. British Home Stores has upgraded its styling and has men's wool moufflon jackets at Pounds 65, soft pale parkas at Pounds 69.99 and a range of knitwear. River Island has good soft-cut trouser suits and a plain, rich-looking parka at Pounds 59.95. For a younger version, Dorothy Perkins covers the field, from a blonde fake fur duffle coat at Pounds 125 to a muted plaid jacket at Pounds 59.99. Equally casual, Littlewoods' men's bargain prices include suede waistcoats at Pounds 24.99 and check shirts at Pounds 9.99. And the finishing Italian touch - the penny loafer or lace-up boatshoe - is widely available, for example from Asda at Pounds 24.99.</p>

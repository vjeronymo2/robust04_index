			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Vultures gather over Major: Former supporters within the Tory party and the press have lost patience It does not matter whether John Major uttered the words. It does matter that his government can be destabilised by what should have been a storm in a media teacup. The furore over reports - fiercely denied by Downing Street and unconfirmed elsewhere - that he had again castigated the Tory right during a private conversation with journalists guaranteed Mr Major another dismal weekend. The prime minister's aides blamed a malicious campaign by sections of the Tory press for the allegations. Nobody who attended the dinner was willing to admit they had heard the prime minister utter the alleged expletives. But the details were judged irrelevant by many of Mr Major's colleagues. Who-said-what stories generally have a limited shelf life. What worried his friends was that the government was still being buffeted by events - and that the episode had once again highlighted the prime minister's weakness in the eyes of the media and many in his own party. Some once-loyal newspapers - most notably The Sun but also on occasion The Times and the Daily Mail - make little effort to hide their contempt for Mr Major. As his authority wanes, he is finding it harder and harder to re-establish discipline within the government and the party. Concerted campaigns to bolster that authority can only be launched so often. The mood among Tory constituency activists is ugly. Attempts to disentangle the party conference clarion-call for a return to traditional values from the personal behaviour of politicians have not gone down well. Many activists view the government as incompetent, the prime minister as not up to the job. The latest row, following hard on the heels of the divisive and debilitating debate over the 'back-to-basics' programme and the spate of personal and financial scandals, has exposed once again the tensions between Tory right and left. Mr Major was the right's chosen successor to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Many of those who made that choice have not forgiven him for turning out to be One of Them rather than One of Us. Many Tory MPs believe a stronger prime minister - and one with a clearer ideological vision - would have been able to restore the party's self-discipline. But for all his personal frustration Mr Major is powerless to take on his critics while his own personal and political standing is so low. It is hardly surprising that many are already positioning themselves for the possibility of a leadership contest after what they expect to be disastrous results in this year's local and European elections. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his deliberately provocative attack on social liberalism and political correctness on Friday has reinforced his claim as the natural candidate of the right. Baroness Thatcher herself is ready to annoint his candidacy (just as she did Mr Major's). Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and perhaps Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would be the centre-left candidates. Mr Clarke would almost certainly win. There is though one important person who does not share the sense of inevitably that some weary Tories have already attached to such a scenario. Mr Major is not ready to throw in the towel. The one thing that everyone attending last week's dinner agrees on is that the prime minister made it absolutely clear that he does not intend to allow the Tory right - or anyone else - to force him out of office. He believes he has two years to rescue his premiership. His Thatcherite enemies will not desire a leadership challenge until Mr Portillo - still only 40 - is more firmly established. The prime minister judges that two years of economic recovery will transform the political scene before the next general election. But surviving the next six months may be harder than he thinks.</p>

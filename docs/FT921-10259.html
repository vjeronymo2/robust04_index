			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: They Might Be Giants - Bloomsbury Theatre There are two of them, both called John. One plays the piano accordion (rather well) and the bass clarinet; the other brandishes a home-made guitar and occasionally launches brutal attacks upon an unsuspecting drum kit. They take turns to deliver their short, sharp songs, favouring an adenoidal New York whine which despite itself is sometimes blended into Everly Brothers sugarsweet harmony. Like all genuine eccentrics They Might Be Giants defy sensible categorisation; they seem at the same time determinedly anarchic and perfectly unself-conscious. Contemporary rock is not short on artists who take themselves too seriously, so it is sheer delight to find an act so determined to send up everything in sight, themselves included. It is all made to seem so utterly guileless; hard to believe that the duo learnt their trade busking on Brooklyn's East River and yet still managed to keep their wide-eyed freshness intact. The meanings of their songs come shrouded beneath coatings of nursery-rhyme lyrics and hand-me down pop riffs; only rarely are their teeth bared. A number like 'Your racist friend', seems shocking for the directness of its message, especially when surrounded by 'Birdhouse in Your Soul' ('I'm not your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend') or 'Particle Man' ('Is he a dot or is he a speck? When he's underwater does he get wet?'). It seems appropriately illogical that They Might Be Giants are touring Britain almost two months before their new album (the fourth) is due to be released here. There was a sprinkling of those latest songs at the Bloomsbury, but most of their set was devoted to singalong favourites. The audience bounced happily through the best of Flood (which appeared in 1990), confident in the knowledge that nothing was going to last longer than a couple of minutes and that a high percentage of the songs have the kind of naggingly memorable melody lines and surreal lyrics which will run through the brain for hours afterwards. Try hard enough and almost any influence you care to mention is stirred into the mix somewhere - a dash of Buddy Holly and the Beatles here, some Tom Waits and Elvis Costello there - but the worst thing that could happen would be for They Might Be Giants to make it too big and find themselves absorbed into the rock mainstream. Playing Wembley Arena with an army of roadies and real session musicians to replace the marvellously tacky backing tapes just wouldn't be the same, and nothing like so exhilarating.</p>

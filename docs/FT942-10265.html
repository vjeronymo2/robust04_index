			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W spurns partners for outsourcing Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, yesterday reaffirmed its intention to attack the growing corporate market for telecoms contracting-out without seeking international partners. It said its existing federation of companies made an external alliance unnecessary. It claimed it had won a quarter of the contracts awarded around the world in the last 18 months by large multinationals for providing telecoms services outside public networks. C&amp;W's strategy contrasts with those of British Telecommunications and AT&amp;T, the US group, both of which have forged international alliances to develop corporate business over the past year. BT has formed a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.63bn) alliance with MCI, the second largest US carrier, while AT&amp;T launched Worldsource last year in partnership with telecoms operators in the Asia-Pacific region. It is seeking a similar arrangement with state operators in Europe. Some analysts believed that C&amp;W, which is far smaller than BT and AT&amp;T, would also seek an alliance. But Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, emphasised his company's determination to develop its international business through its existing companies. 'It is the alliance of C&amp;W companies which gives us our competitive edge,' he said. C&amp;W owns a majority stake in Mercury and Hong Kong Telecom and has significant stakes in operators in the Caribbean, Sweden, Australia and the Baltic, as well as a US subsidiary. Mr James Ross, chief executive, claimed that C&amp;W had an 8 per cent stake in the international telecoms network services market and could develop its multinationals business through its business networks division, established 18 months ago to pioneer outsourcing. The division has staff of 200 liaising with C&amp;W operations in 56 countries. 'We already do business with more than 1,500 of the 2,500 multinationals we are targeting,' Mr Ross said. C&amp;W estimates that the contracting-out market for the top 2,500 multinationals could be worth Dollars 15bn a year. In March, C&amp;W launched a Pounds 1bn network upgrading programme, starting with a new Pounds 200m 'backbone' network for the UK capable of offering advanced services such as video-conference and corporate phone meetings.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Last challenge to EC working hours BRITAIN is to make a last-ditch effort to amend the European Community's working-time directive to allow voluntary overtime to be worked above the 48-hour ceiling on the working week. The directive, scheduled to be agreed by a meeting of EC employment ministers next Thursday, will be the first European test for Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary. British ministers hope Luxembourg and Portugal will support a move either to raise the limit to 52 or 55 hours a week or to allow voluntary overtime on top of the 48 hours. They will also continue to argue that working more than 48 hours should be permitted if a risk assessment shows there is no danger to health or safety. In the past few months some moves have been made in the UK's direction. Some industries have been exempted from the directive, and the requirement of four weeks paid holiday a year has been lowered to three weeks for the first three years of the directive. There appears to be further room for manoeuvre on the period within which an average of 48 hours a week must be worked. The UK and Germany favour six months, and a compromise of four or five months looks possible. There may also be movement on Sunday being the day of rest, which the government fears would boost the anti-Sunday trading lobby.</p>

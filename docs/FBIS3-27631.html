Despite a smaller crop acreage  for 1993, the total output value that year still exceeded 1992,  a bumper harvest year, by 291,000 tonnes. The peasants'  per-capita net income for last year rose for the first time to  860 yuan, the national level of peasant income. Closely related  to peasant income, township and town enterprises also achieved  major breakthroughs and a 115.39 percent increase in total  output value last year.    Government officials in charge of agricultural affairs here  characterized last year's agricultural economy as "simultaneous  growth on three fronts:" Simultaneous growth in total  agricultural output value and peasants' per-capita income; in  grain and cash crops; and in farming and breeding industries.  The rural economy has been developing steadily every year in  this ethnic autonomous region, which previously lagged behind in  economic development. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi  Regional CPC Committee, pointed out in analyzing the recent  increasing momentum of growth of the region's rural economy:  Guangxi has done much in recent years to strengthen rural work,  improve and adjust rural economic structures, and develop  township and town enterprises and has achieved much in  developing sub-tropical forestry and orchard cultivation and  concentrating on its strong points. From this, Zhao Fulin felt  that, as long as the road is right and the measures implemented  are effective, the provinces and regions which got a late start  can also eliminate poverty and become comparatively well-off,  and the prospect of tens of thousands of peasants getting rich  is not so remote.</p>

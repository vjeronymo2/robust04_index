			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banks asked for new Metallgesellschaft credits Metallgesellschaft's bank creditors heard yesterday that they were expected to extend new credits worth DM700m (Dollars 407m) to the crisis-torn German metals and engineering group as part of the rescue package put forward last Wednesday. The request, restricted to banks which are owed more than DM50m, was DM200m more than the figure mentioned at last week's crisis meeting, when the new management also proposed raising DM1.4bn through a share issue, plus a DM1.3bn debt-for-equity swap. It came in a note sent out yesterday that was described by one source as 'long on what is required of the banks but short on the new strategic direction of the group'. The note said that participants in the new credit line would be granted a charge over Metallgesellschaft assets assembled in what one banker described as a 'security pool'. It is understood that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, both house banks to and shareholders in Metallgesellschaft, will not be involved in this part of the proposed deal. The two banks contributed an estimated DM1bn in fresh credits late last year when details first emerged of the oil market speculation losses which have brought the group to the brink of insolvency. Although smaller lenders are believed to be anxious that the new proposal relegates their debt to junior status, bankers on balance believed that the rescue would go ahead. 'There are not many people around who think they will be better off if they allow the company to go down,' one noted. Lenders and shareholders, who have until the end of Wednesday to approve the deal, accept that insolvency is the only alternative to agreement. Mr Eberhard Zinn, a director of the Bayerische Landesbank, one of Metallgesellschaft's biggest lenders, said his board had not yet made a formal decision, but added: 'We hope we will be able to get it through.' Mr Zinn told the Reuters news agency that some foreign creditors might have difficulties accepting the package 'above all for reasons of timing'. But it was important that such lenders - accounting for around half the total of 100-plus banks involved - should agree, he added. Non-German bankers complained yesterday at the lack of time allowed for consideration, the rigidity of the conditions and their inability to negotiate. 'There will be many lessons to be drawn from this. It does not paint a very flattering picture of the German way of doing things,' one said. 'Some people may try to lay down conditions for participating, but I suspect they will join in, kicking and squealing,' another added.</p>

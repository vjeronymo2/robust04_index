These figures, which were released yesterday by the INDEC  [National Institute of Statistics and Census] census bureau,  also show that 1993's deficit exceeded the previous year's  deficit of $2.6 billion by some $1.05 billion.    Last year's deficit is evident from comparing total imports,  which were $16.79 billion, against total exports, which totalled  $13.09 billion.    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo insists that these figures  aren't alarming if you consider the increased amount of capital  goods that are being imported.    According to Cavallo this trend means that companies are  modernising and bringing their technology up to world standards.    During 1993 the purchase of capital goods increased by 33  percent, going up from $3.1 billion to $4.12 billion.    Concerning exports manufactured goods increased by 29.8  percent, fuel and energy by 13.1 percent while the export of raw  materials dropped 6.5 percent.    As to imports consumer goods coming into the country  increased by 10 percent, spare parts by 8.4 percent, cars by 7.1  percent while 7.1 percent less fuel was imported.    Argentina's main suppliers were: the United States $3.86  billion-worth of goods, Brazil $3.57 billion, Germany $1.02  billion and Italy $980 million.    Argentina's main markets abroad were: Brazil which bought  $3.57 billion worth of Argentine goods, the U.S. $1.273 billion  and Holland $1.270 billion.</p>

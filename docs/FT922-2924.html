			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Earth's leaders display Rio diversity NEVER BEFORE and probably never again will so many world leaders have assembled in one place. From the US president to the emir of Kuwait, from the German chancellor to the Chinese prime minister and the ruler of Monaco, 117 of them were there to give their views on how to save the planet. Photographers at the Rio Earth Summit hardly knew which way to turn as they tried to snap the parade of men in African tribal robes, resplendent military uniforms or Islamic dress, as well as leaders of Europe's new countries and of little known places such as Kiribati and Vanuatu. Whispers of 'Who's that?' and 'Where's that?' pervaded the balmy air. Depending on wealth and importance, the leaders arrived by fleets of private aircraft or charter flights. Thailand's glamorous Princess Chulabhorn easily took the record for most baggage (140 cases) and the Americans brought in their own mineral water. Rio airport ran out of parking space. Everyone got a grand reception at the airport. The prime minister of Tuvalu joined the queue for passport control, commenting to an aide that 'Someone important must be arriving', not realising that the reception committee was for him. For two days Rio was a city under siege, with a strict security cordon in place. Many roads were closed. The city awoke to the sound of sirens of 116 motorcades, watched by 40,000 soldiers and policemen, many of whom appeared to have the safety catches off their guns. Presiding over it all was Brazil's President Fernando Collor who could hardly keep the grin off his face. Until three years ago he was a political nobody, barely known outside his home state of Alagoas in the country's poor north-east. Now Mr Collor had achieved his moment of glory. The grin had slipped a little by late morning as he tried valiantly to keep so many egos under control and restrict speeches to the allotted seven minutes. When Cuba's Fidel Castro mounted the rostrum there were gales of laughter as Mr Collor warned that speeches were overrunning. Don Fidel is not known for his brevity. But yesterday he was on his best behaviour, delivering one of the day's shortest speeches. Dressed in his usual khaki uniform, he was in ebullient form, punching the air as he crossed the plenary to carry the banner of the socialist revolution, these days a rather lonesome task. The world's most famous beard called for 'the end of selfishness and hegemony, selfishness and deceit', blaming the world's environmental problems on 'imperialist policies'. Chancellor Kohl appeared not to be listening, but one African leader whipped out a video camera to film the event. It was the first time Mr Bush and Mr Castro had been in the same room. Mr Castro's spirited speech came as light relief amid 56 leaders spouting worthy rhetoric about the future of life on earth and the measures they had taken at home. Mr Li Peng treated everybody to a long list of statistics about the Chinese economy and 'large-scale soil improvement programmes'; the Europeans disappointed everyone by failing to open their wallets.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Boise Cascade extends losses BOISE Cascade, the US forest products group, yesterday posted a third-quarter deficit but said its underlying losses had started to reduce. For the three months to September 30, the company recorded a net deficit of Dollars 35.2m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, compared with Dollars 14.3m, or 47 cents. Excluding extraordinary items, Boise lost Dollars 1.24 a share last year. Sales fell to Dollars 935m in the quarter from Dollars 1bn last time. Boise, based in Idaho, is still being hit by weak paper prices but said there were some signs of improvement. Mr John Fery, chairman and chief executive, said order backlogs in pulp and paper were relatively firm and the company had announced price increases in some key grades. 'This emerging trend of improvement, assuming it continues, combined with continuing cost-reduction efforts under way in the company, should lead to further improvement in performance,' he said.</p>

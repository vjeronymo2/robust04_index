			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Kenya asks donors for 'substantial' support Kenya is seeking 'substantial' financial support to clear external debt arrears and close projected gaps in the balance of payments, Mr Musalia Mudavadi, minister of finance, told a donors' meeting in Paris yesterday. The consultative group meeting, chaired by the World Bank, is the first since November 1991, when donors froze new aid until the government implemented political and economic reforms. The intervening two years had seen 'fundamental political and economic change', Mr Mudavadi told the conference. He did not, however, set a target for aid pledges. Debt arrears, thought to total Dollars 700m (Pounds 475.5m), will not be negotiated at the Paris meeting, but discussed directly with creditors. Mr Mudavadi appealed for help in meeting a food shortfall of 1.25m tonnes, from July 1993 to September 1994, which will cost Dollars 200m. The shortage has been caused by poor rains. Reviewing developments in the economy, the minister said the government had completed a policy framework paper which had been put to the IMF and World Bank. Inflation had been brought down from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, and the underlying rate on a three month annualised basis was 24 per cent. Acknowledging that this year's budget deficit of 6.1 per cent of GDP was high, the minister said the government planned to bring this down to 2.9 per cent in 1994-95. Spending cuts would include a reduction in state employees, by 16,000 a year over the next three years. Donors acknowledge significant progress in recent months. As well as curbing inflation, Mr Mudavadi has liberalised trade, floated the shilling, and cracked down on financial wrong-doing in the banking sector. He has even managed to dislodge some of the worst abusers of public office from their sinecures at the Central Bank and certain parastatal companies. But donors yesterday expressed concern about ethnic clashes in which more than 1,000 people have been killed, with Kikuyus taking the brunt of the casualties. Mr Mudavadi gave details of a Dollars 20m programme to assist the victims. Diplomats were cautious in their response yesterday, suggesting that the restoration of fast-disbursing aid will be modest, and linked to further progress in economic reforms. Japan spearheaded Kenya's financial rehabilitation last month with a new Dollars 77m credit. The World Bank has about Dollars 120m in suspended programme assistance; the IMF another Dollars 60m. Together, these funds should help cover Kenya's balance of payments gap next year.</p>

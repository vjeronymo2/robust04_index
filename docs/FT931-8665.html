			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Time for auditors to come out of their shells - Michael Fowle clarifies the profession's role in business and its future direction and development IT IS time that auditors 'came out'. We should demonstrate that our profession is a fundamental part of risk management in the economy, that we are proud of our contribution and want to do our job even better in the future than we have in the past. I am an auditor and I am proud of it. My predecessors built my firm on a reputation for providing a service to those who used the accounts of their audit clients - and not by kowtowing to the wishes of company directors. That is the past of auditing and so must it be its future. I am passionate about auditing and its contribution to business society. The UK Auditing Practices Board (APB) paper on the future development of auditing issued last November gives us plenty to think about. Its authors make clear that it is intended to promote public debate, and is certainly not a worked-through proposal, let alone a legal framework. But reflecting the diversity of public concern, its scope is so wide-ranging that it runs the risk of prompting a series of unending debates. I want to return to basics. The public role of auditors is to audit accounts. They may - and indeed do - fulfil other functions which contribute materially to the benefit of the economy, but the essential issue is that of competence in their primary function. An audit report is a matter of opinion - an opinion in support of facts, and on their presentation. Failures in audit evidence do occur, but they are surprisingly rare and we have to remember that no process of inquiry can be absolutely conclusive. Opinion on presentation is an opinion on the way in which the directors have set out the facts and arrived at judgments where these are required. Neither opinion is of any worth unless it is objectively arrived at. The APB paper notes that the small number of audit reports which are qualified is seen by some as indicating a lack of objectivity. But this confuses a qualified audit report with an auditor's badge of virility. Auditors do their duty to the stakeholders by assisting, advising - and, on occasions, persuading - their clients' directors to publish accounts which, in the auditors' opinion, show a true and fair view. A qualified audit report is not only an expression of the auditors' opinion that the directors have failed to comply with the law. It is also an admission by the auditors that they have failed effectively to influence the directors. Qualified audit reports are indeed rare, but this is a sign of success, not failure. On every single public interest audit engagement, auditors in my firm work for at least four separate client constituencies, whose interests may well conflict. There are shareholders; other stakeholders and regulators who may represent their interests; the board; and executive management. If auditors cannot build a working relationship with the executive directors and management of their client company, they can never undertake a truly efficient and effective audit. There is no point in being frightened of conflicts of interest. The world is built on them. My favourite working definition of a professional is somebody who can identify conflicts and make judgments amongst them. Good auditors understand that not only can they serve all four client constituencies, but that they must serve all four. If the audit fails to do so, it fails as an audit. That is why the Cadbury Report on corporate governance is entirely right to concentrate not on auditor independence but on achieving auditor objectivity. Good auditors have always known that because they serve four constituencies, their first duty is not to the directors of their client company but to the company itself. It is the company and only the company which can be the proxy for the stakeholders - in particular the shareholders, who are the prime stakeholders. On this issue auditors are in the same position as the directors. But this legal relationship in no way detracts from the essential fact that both directors and auditors owe their duty to the shareholders and stakeholders. Auditors know this very well. Auditors also know the importance of understanding the framework within which they operate. Their critics sometimes find this less essential. One example is accounting standards, which are not the province of the Auditing Practices Board but of the Accounting Standards Board. The roles of these related but necessarily distinct bodies are often confused in the public mind. Another instance is the failure to grasp that it is management that manages companies, and directors who set and monitor a direction. It is directors - not auditors - who are responsible for reporting to shareholders on the company's business, its financial results and future prospects. The heart of the question is not the narrow one of professional liability nor the details of what an audit report is meant to say. It is the fundamental issue of the function of auditors and where they stand in relation to management. We do not wish to take cover behind a defensive barricade. We welcome the opportunity to contribute more effectively to the economic process, and in so doing to respond to the needs of the market. But the APB suggests that the purpose of an audit should be re-defined beyond the auditors' current role to encompass reporting both on the proper conduct of the company's affairs and/or future risks attaching to the company. Surely these suggestions address not the role and scope of audit, but the role and scope of annual reports by directors to shareholders? It is for the directors to report to the shareholders and other stakeholders and only then for the auditor to express an opinion on this report. If you move to a position where reporting is in the first place the duty of auditors not directors, this denies the auditors' essential role as objective commentators and effectively makes them another tier of management. There are strong arguments for suggesting that directors should be given an enhanced responsibility to stakeholders other than shareholders. There are strong arguments that directors should report each year to shareholders on the way the company's affairs have been conducted and on how they have satisfied themselves on the propriety and perhaps the efficiency of that conduct. There are also strong arguments for suggesting that the directors should report to shareholders about the risks inherent in the group's business and the way in which they ensure that those risks are appreciated and appropriately limited. This last proposal is covered in the Operating and Financial Review proposal from the Accounting Standards Board circulated last April. Auditors are neither guarantors, nor guardian angels, nor soothsayers. But if the reporting standards for directors encompass the issues of proper conduct and future risks, and if the benchmarks are there, we auditors will be able to obtain information, verify it, make judgments and arrive at opinions on those matters of conduct and risk on which an objective opinion is both practicable and relevant. It is then for the business world to judge whether the cost will match the benefit. Michael Fowle is senior UK audit partner at KPMG Peat Marwick.</p>

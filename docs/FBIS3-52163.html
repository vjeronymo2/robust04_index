Nabil Sha'th phoned  Shim'on Peres several times today, and the two are slated to  hold another phone conversation in the next few hours. Our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports:    Jerusalem sources are saying that conditions are not yet  ripe  for resuming the Taba talks. What does this mean? In a fax  sent by Nabil Sha'th, the PLO demands that the Taba talks will  revisit all the issues previously negotiated in Oslo,  Versailles, and Cairo. Israel, on the other hand, maintains that  the document formulated during the Liaison Committee's session  in Cairo is a binding summation of all three meetings. Israel  contends that in Cairo the delegations managed to overcome the  controversies which were not solved in Oslo and Versailles.  Officials in Jerusalem today learned that not only is 'Arafat  unwilling to approve the document formulated by Peres and  Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], but that the PLO wants to renegotiate  the gaps which have apparently been bridged in Cairo.    Following their private meeting this morning, Yitzhaq Rabin  and Shim'on Peres stated that Israel considers it impossible to  resume the Taba talks for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  First plan.    Despite the present stalemate, various sources -- some of  them close to the PLO leadership -- assess that by next week  conditions will ripen and that Foreign Minister Peres will find  the right formulations to clear the way for resuming the Taba  talks.</p>

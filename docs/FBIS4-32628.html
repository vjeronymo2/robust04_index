			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivana Anyzova reports on today's talks between Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Albanian Prime Minister  Aleksander Meksi.    [Anyzova] The two prime ministers signed an agreement on  trade and technical relations and one on the support and mutual  protection of investments. They exchanged information about the  situation in their countries, foreign policy initiatives, and  bilateral relations. They expressed a wish to develop mutual  contacts in science, culture, and tourism. They also agreed  that the Czech side will grant Albania a long-term loan to  purchase farming and food-processing equipment.    Although economic cooperation has receded over recent years,  our side regards as advantageous the fact that Czech goods have  been offered to Albanian agriculture and the food-processing  industry.    Vaclav Klaus emphasized that such cooperation is a useful  form of policy aimed at boosting exports.</p>

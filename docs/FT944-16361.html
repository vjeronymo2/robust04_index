			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Aegon's Dollars 600m convertible meets strong demand Blue-chip corporates were again prominent in the euromarkets yesterday with both J. Sainsbury and Ford raising funds in the three-year dollar sector and Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, tapping the market for Dollars 600m with one of the biggest European convertible issues of the year. J. Sainsbury, the UK retailer, raised Dollars 150m to help fund its recent acquisition of Giant Food, the US supermarket chain. The paper offered a coupon of 7.375 per cent and an initial yield spread of 39 basis over the equivalent US Treasury, although this widened marginally when the bonds were freed to trade. Two-thirds of the issue was placed by the end of trading, although JP Morgan, the lead manager, conceded that distribution was becoming more difficult in the short end of the dollar sector following issues earlier this week by SmithKline Beecham and Toyota. Ford Credit Europe turned to the sterling sector for Pounds 100m with a three-year issue. The paper, sold to investors at a reoffer price of 99.705, offered a coupon of 8 5/8 per cent and, at its reoffer price, a yield spread of 55 basis points above the equivalent gilt. Lead managers HSBC Markets said investors were showing interest in shorter-term sterling deals, following recent steepening of the yield curve. Morgan Stanley led the 10-year subordinated convertible bond for Aegon, which has expanded in the US in recent years. The bond carries a coupon of 4.75 per cent and has been used partially to refinance a Dollars 370m 10-year subordinated convertible bond issued in 1991. The issue, one of Europe's biggest in a generally quiet year for convertibles, met strong demand from continental Europe, according to syndicate managers. Elsewhere, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, raised FFr1bn with a five-year deal offering a coupon of 8 per cent. The deal was offered to investors at a re-offer price of 100.08, with a yield spread of 32 points over the equivalent French government bond. Prices fell slightly after the syndicate closed, ending down 2 basis points. Credit Local de France tapped the short end of the lire sector with a L150bn three-year bond with a coupon of 11.3 per cent. Proceeds from the deal, led by Credito Italiano, were swapped into floating rate dollars. Two borrowers tapped the three-year area of the Canadian dollar sector. The European Investment Bank launched a CDollars 150m offering of bonds, priced to yield 10 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The pricing spread tightened to around six basis points when the bonds were freed to trade, joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said. Rabobank Nederland launched a CDollars 100m offering of bonds, also priced to yield a spread of 10 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The spread narrowed slightly to nine basis points over in late trading.</p>

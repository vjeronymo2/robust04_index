			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Philippines debt deal in shadow of election: Senators' fears of tax reforms THE agreement between the Philippines and the International Monetary Fund reached last week over the level of the 1992 budget deficit is a crucial step towards containing the country's Dollars 29bn (Pounds 16.2bn) external debt. Put a new IMF programme in place, bankers argue, and Dollars 5.3bn of commercial debt could be restructured in a way that would substantially reduce the impact of one of the country's most debilitating problems. But central bank and finance department officials are racing against the clock to secure Senate approval for tax changes demanded by the IMF before elections in May. Without the new tax laws, which are designed to tackle the budget deficit, the IMF will refuse the Philippines its 'stamp of good house-keeping' and the rescheduling would be back on ice. Manila would also then miss out on a year's aid from its largest bilateral donor, Japan, if the IMF's approval came after Tokyo's current budget cycle ends. And there would be a freezing on new aid from multilateral donors who seek comfort from IMF-backed structural adjustment programmes. The IMF has agreed to allow a national government budget deficit of 9bn pesos this year and a consolidated public sector deficit (which includes the losses from 14 government corporations and the central bank) of 37.7bn pesos, equivalent to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares with an estimated consolidated deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1991 and 5.8 per cent in 1990, according to Mr Jose Cuisia, central bank governor. Failure to pass the tax measures would be a 'disaster', according to Mr Ramon Mitra, a leading presidential candidate and speaker of the House of Representatives which has passed the measures. 'They are not new taxes, they only enhance government's ability to collect taxes.' Despite what many economists and businessmen see as the overwhelming case in favour of the tax measures - most controversial of which is a modification of VAT - the Senate's approval is still in doubt. Anything that smacks of tax increases may be seen as political suicide in the run-up to an election in which many of the senators are standing for office. Even with the IMF squared away, bankers will have to move quickly to implement the commercial debt rescheduling that was agreed in principle last year before the administration changes at the end of June. Mr Cuisia and Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, must first seek about Dollars 600m from the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese government. This will be used as collateral for new debt instruments issued in line with the Brady/Miyazawa plan applied in Venezuela and Mexico. The debt instruments would reduce interest rates and the stock of debt for the Philippines; the banks would be able to convert debt into bonds that provide a better quality of security. Mr Cuisia expects most banks to opt for the Principle Collateralised Interest Reduction bonds (PCIR or par bonds) which are secured by zero-coupon US Treasury bills. The bonds mature in 25 years when the proceeds will have grown by enough to repay the banks. Manila will pay a reduced coupon, which rises over time to 6.25 per cent and one year's interest will be collateral-ised. A second bond is the simple Interest Reduction Bond. These are not collateralised, carry an interest charge that starts at 4 per cent and rises to Libor-plus  13/16 per cent and have a seven-year grace period. They were designed primarily for Japanese banks which can not easily secure long-term liabilities with a fixed-rate instrument. In addition to these two types of so-called 'exit bonds' for creditors that want to leave the Philippines, new money bonds are available for banks that want to maintain an exposure in the country. For every Dollars 1 of new money, a bank is permitted to convert Dollars 4 of outstanding debt into Dollars 4 of debt conversion bonds. The bonds are priced  13/16 per cent above Libor with a five-year grace period. Venezuela and Uruguay did a similar deal last year with a swap rate of 5-for-1. The more banks opt for the PCIR bonds the less the country will have to worry about its foreign debt as Manila has no principal to repay on these bonds, bankers say. Before banks opt for any of these options the central bank will offer them the opportunity to buy back debt at a discount, similar to a 1990 deal when Dollars 1.38bn was retired. The central bank expects it will need Dollars 300-Dollars 600m from its foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 4.3bn for this. In the event the Senate does not pass the tax measures, scuttling the IMF deal and all that hangs on it, there could be an immediate loss of confidence. Bankers fear renewed pressure on the balance of payments and a reversal of the recent net flow of dollars back into the country. Furthermore, any increase in pre-election government spending not matched by higher tax revenues would add to a domestic borrowing level that is threatening to run out of control. 'Failure to put the debt deal in place before the elections would not be the end of the world,' says one Filipino official of a foreign bank. 'But the new government would start at a much disadvantaged position.' Imelda Marcos yesterday formally launched her bid for the presidency, saying she was determined to heal political wounds. The widow of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos was the first major politician to file candidacy papers for the May 11 polls.</p>

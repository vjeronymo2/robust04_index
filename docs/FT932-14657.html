			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hanson pays Dollars 116m for US housebuilder - Deal is part of strategy for bolt-on acquisitions HANSON INDUSTRIES, the American arm of the Anglo-UK conglomerate, is expanding its property interests with a Dollars 116m (Pounds 75.5m) purchase of a residential housebuilder with assets in California, Arizona and Nevada. Beazer Homes Inc, an affiliate of Hanson Industries, is buying the assets from Watt Housing Corporation. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, said: 'The acquisition of Watt Housing at an appropriate time in the homebuilding economic cycle, further expands Hanson's operations in building materials'. The move is also part of Hanson Industries' strategy of buying bolt-on acquisitions to existing core businesses. Mr Clarke said recently it was part of 'a continuing programme ofexpanding Hanson's core businesses'. After being in recession for five years since the end of 1986, the building industry is recovering with new work rising by 3.5 per cent last year. NatWest Securities estimates that it will rise by 5 per cent this year and that the recovery should continue at least until 1995, when total work in place will be more than 15 per cent higher than it is today. California remains the weakest state, and NatWest Securities believes it will continue to underperform the rest of the US for another two years. Mr Martin Taylor, Hanson's vice chairman, said: 'You would expect us to take that into consideration when we did our due diligence and decided on what price we would pay for the assets'. Last year Beazer Homes sold 1,182 homes in the south-east of the US. Beazer Homes Limited, the UK's third largest homebuilder, sold 4,948 houses. Combined Beazer sales for the US and UK homebuilding operations in 1992 were Dollars 602m with pre-tax profits of Dollars 80m.</p>

Andreatta stressed that "there has been no official request  from the United Nations for Italian participation in Bosnia" but  he confirmed that talks on the subject are going ahead at the  United Nations in the wake of promptings from Britain.    Answering a question on possible Serbian reaction to an  Italian presence, Andreatta said that "the opposition of the  Serbs referred to Turkey, not to Italy." "The problem is rather  whether troops should be used under the auspices of NATO or that  of the United Nations, since one choice or the other requires a  different type of commitment."    Andreatta was speaking after a brief visit to the large  Italian community in Koper, the capital of Slovenian Istria,  during which he inaugurated a historic palazzo restored with  Italian funds.    Noting in his speech that ethnic minorities help sharpen  "critical acumen and a relish for contradiction," Andreatta  expressed the view that "our generation is only passing through,  but it has the job of reducing borders to an archaeological  status."    Andreatta's visit was keenly awaited by the Italian minority  in Istria -- also in the Croatian part, which he will visit this  evening (Verteneglio) -- who are hoping for a new constitutional  settlement from Croatia and Slovenia in the wake of Yugoslavia's  break-up.</p>

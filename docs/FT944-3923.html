			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switching from equities to gilts hits FT-SE 100 - Market Report Talk of big switching activity by a number of UK pension funds and general investment portfolios, out of equities and into gilt-edged stocks, plus another erratic performance by Wall Street, drove the UK equity market sharply lower yesterday, pushing the FT-SE 100 index firmly below the 3,000 level. The FT-SE 100 index closed a worrying session a net 36.5 lower at 2,977.3, leaving the market's premier index down 40 points on the week. The pain extended to many of the second liners where the FT-SE Mid Cap 250 index gave up 32.1 to 3,359.8. Gilts, meanwhile, progressed throughout the session, closing around 5/8 higher, as the switching stories circulated in the market. But the real damage to London was done overnight on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones plunged more than 50 points before staging a minor rally, amid growing fears that yet another rise in the Fed Funds rate could occur soon. Wall Street remains the key to world markets and has been hit by a series of bearish stories over the week, notably the Orange County bankruptcy, worries about the Magellan mutual fund not paying its year-end distribution and increasing fears that the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates again when it meets to discuss monetary policy on December 20. Markets took fright again during the afternoon, when Wall Street fell more than 30 points shortly after the opening, in the wake of persistent stories of forced selling of equities and bonds in the US. Equity market strategists said the market's problems were centred on the US. 'London has coped very well with its domestic worries, including two budgets, the government's defeat and the rise in interest rates. But until Wall Street settles down we can't go anywhere,' said Mr Rob Buckland at NatWest Securities. At Charterhouse Tilney Mr Richard Jeffrey insisted the UK equity market would be sustained by gilts. 'You can't have gilts rallying when equities are slipping away. A fall in the yield ratio to 2.0 is as clear a buy signal as you will get at this stage of the economic cycle,' he said. The FT-SE 100 opened sharply lower, slipping below 3,000 and never really showed any signs of stabilising during a difficult trading session during which traders took fright at stories of enormous sell programmes about to hit the market. These stories impacted around midday when a long list of big trades moved across the screens, only to be cancelled later in the session and described as 'trade reporting errors'. But with the market running scared of another poor showing by Wall Street, share prices began to slide again and slithered to their lowest levels at the close. The chancellor's moves to increase tax on beer, wine, spirits and fuel in his mini-budget on Thursday, failed to cause any real damage in those areas of the market. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, in fact, was one of only nine FT-SE 100 stocks to end the session in positive territory. Other good performances included Great Universal Stores, after the recent interim results and the special dividend. The merchant banks and securities houses continued to hold the market's attention after more talk that merger discussions between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley will trigger a wide-ranging rationalisation of the European securities markets, involving the likes of Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court. Turnover in the equity market reached 709.9m shares, the highest of the week, but was inflated by heavy turnover in two of the market's penny stocks, Ticketing Group and Sunleigh which attracted turnover of 84m and 55m shares respectively and accounted for 140m shares or 20 per cent of the total.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GERMANY'S EAGLES BARELY FLYING;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: BERLIN TEAM, WHICH PLAYS AMERICAN VERSION OF THE GAME, IS SUCCESSFUL,  BUT VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN IN THE COUNTRY.  </P> <P> In a land where 1-0 soccer scores prompt national celebrations and general  mayhem, a quarterback who threw 52 touchdown passes in a single season might as  well have not existed.  </P> <P> Such is the staggering popularity climb American football faces in Germany.  There are three sporting names that matter here: Steffi Graf, Boris Becker and  Franz Beckenbauer. If your name is not among them, take your proper place  behind a long and lonely offensive line in Berlin.  </P> <P> Cliff Madison, a graduate of Crenshaw High in Los Angeles, is quarterback for  Germany's best American football team, the Berlin Adler (Eagles). His team  scored more than a 100 points in a game three times last season on its way to  Germany's equivalent of the Super Bowl title. Madison threw for 4,028 yards in  10 games, which included one nine-touchdown performance.  </P> <P> Yet, hardly anyone knows of him.  </P> <P> Obviously, one country's definition of excitement is not another's, as the NFL  will learn as it attempts to export its brand of football to a new Germany.  </P> <P> But if 52 touchdown passes doesn't grab your attention, what will? For one, a  World Cup soccer championship, no matter what the complaints about aesthetics.  </P> <P> "They're just learning American football," Madison said. "It hasn't even caught  on yet. Most people know very little about it."  </P> <P> Madison said there are no attempts to compete with soccer, the national sport.  American football was probably set back further after West Germany's recent  victory in the World Cup.  </P> <P> "Berlin was wild," Madison said. "So many things were happening at the time.  The wall came down, Germany takes the Cup. I mean how much better can it get  for a city like this?"  </P> <P> If you said the Rams and Kansas City Chiefs this weekend at Olympic Stadium,  perhaps it's time to loosen the straps on your leder hosen.  </P> <P> But until they deport Madison for preferring his brand of football, he promises  to keep lighting up scoreboards to the sound of no applause.  </P> <P> "I look in the stands sometimes, and I say 'Where are the people?' " he said.  "This is America's sport. But that's why I like scoring 60 or 70 points a game.  I let them know, this is football, this is not soccer."  </P> <P> Madison's team, the Adler, is one of about 75 club teams competing in the  country's Bundes Football League. The Berlin squad plays on a grass field  encircled by a bicycle track. Madison said crowds range from between three and  four thousand per game. As part of Saturday's scheduled events, Berlin will  play the Dussaldorf Panthers before the Rams and Chiefs take the field.  </P> <P> Madison joined the Adler in April, 1989, after playing out all his options in  the states. He attended three colleges, had a brief stint in the Canadian  Football League, and last played for the Chicago Bruisers of the Arena Football  League in 1988. The Bruisers picked him up after Madison was beaten out by Matt  Stevens for quarterback of the L.A. Cobras.  </P> <P> After his Arena career ended, Madison attended another pro tryout camp that was  held at UC Irvine. Madison's logic was simple:  </P> <P> "Nobody picked me up, and I didn't feel like working 9 to 5," he said.  </P> <P> A coach at the tryout suggested Europe, and Madison soon found himself in  Berlin.  </P> <P> He is one of three Americans on the team. The star receiver, though, is German.  His name is Roman Motzkus, who has 20 touchdown catches with one game remaining  this season.  </P> <P> Motzkus, one German who considers American football more than a passing fancy,  watched Monday's Ram practice with uncommon awe.  </P> <P> His favorite American player is San Francisco's Jerry Rice, but he wears  uniform No. 83 in honor of Ram receiver Flipper Anderson. Motzkus came to know  Anderson after his game-winning playoff catch last year against the New York  Giants. The game was broadcast live in Germany at 2 a.m.  </P> <P> "Perhaps I'd like to meet him," Motzkus said as he watched Anderson run a pass  pattern.  </P> <P> The German's club football season runs from April to October.  </P> <P> The teams are staffed with German coaches, but Madison finds himself doing most  of the teaching for the Adler.  </P> <P> "The coaching staff is not really obligated," he said. "They have to work and  take care of their families.  </P> <P> "We don't have a head coach. I run the offense. We have three assistants and  myself."  </P> <P> When none of the coaches had arrived for a recent game, Madison ran the team  from the huddle.  </P> <P> Although Madison averaged 5.2 touchdown passes per game last season, he keeps  the statistics in proper perspective.  </P> <P> "Hey man, these are phenomenal stats," he said. "But only over here, you know  what I mean?"  </P> <P> The Adler pays Madison 3,000 German marks -- roughly $2,000 -- and furnishes  him with an apartment.  </P> <P> Madison's goal is to catch the attention of someone in the newly-formed World  Football League, which kicks off play in spring, 1991, with European teams in  Frankfurt and Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> "I think I can get a shot at it," he said. "I'm 27 years old, but I feel like  23. My body's not aching at all. I've been in this game 20 years and my arm  feels great. I am looking forward to leaving and joining one of these World  Football teams."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The first of three scrimmages between the Rams and Chiefs is scheduled for  today. "I think it's great," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "It begins the work  of practicing against strangers. I think it's a nice step up." . . . Great  arms, bad voices: Two generations of former Purdue quarterbacks, Len Dawson and  Jim Everett, were reported out on the town Monday night, singing Elvis Presley  songs in bad German accents. Dawson is a local television sports anchor in  Kansas City. Everett, of course, plays quarterback for the Rams . . . Ram  defensive end Bill Hawkins appeared to have aggravated an injury to his left  knee in Monday's practice, but said the leg was just stiff from Saturday's long  plane ride. Hawkins had surgery in December to repair a torn ligament in the  knee. . . . Cornerback Darryl Henley (groin) and linebackers Larry Kelm (toe)  and Fred Strickland (hamstring) also missed practice. Robinson said Kelm may be  held out of Saturday's game as a precaution. . . . The best question of the day  came from a German journalist who asked Everett: "In the United States, you are  a star. But in Germany, it's a bit different. Who's Jim Everett? You're no  Franz Beckenbauer. How does it affect you?" Everett's reply: "That's just fine  with me. That's probably the way I'd like life anyways. I don't mind that one  bit."  </P></p>

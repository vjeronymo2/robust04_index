			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Bellway advances in weak market BELLWAY yesterday became one of the few housebuilders to announce a rise in profits in the latter part of 1992. The period included Britain's withdrawal from the ERM which prompted a sharp fall in confidence of house buyers. Despite this, Bellway managed to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.48m to Pounds 5.79m for the six months to January 31. House sales rose from 698 to 833. Bellway, which has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, currently has Pounds 40m of cash following a Pounds 33.6m rights issue in March. The company intends to increase output to 4,000 homes a year by the mid 1990s, making it one of the six largest builders in the country. Since the rights issue it has contracted to buy more than Pounds 35m worth of land. Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said that Bellway was on target to achieve its forecast, made at the time of the rights issue, of at least Pounds 16m pre-tax profit for the 12 months to end-July. First half turnover rose from Pounds 52.4m to Pounds 56.1m. Earnings per share edged ahead from 7.3p to 7.8p. The interim dividend is maintained at 4p but directors intend to raise the final by 0.5p to 8p. The number of homes to be built by the group during the year is expected to rise from 1,841 to at least 2,200. Mr Robson said that the UK housing market had turned since the beginning of the year. Net reservations by Bellway - agreed sales on which a deposit had been paid, less cancellations - had increased by a third compared with the first four months of 1992. 'Experiences are patchy and vary from development to development,' said Mr Robson, 'but prices have begun to stabilise. We are offering less incentives to encourage sales and prices in one or two instances have even risen slightly.'</p>

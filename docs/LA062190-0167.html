			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTS;  </P> <P> U.S. PUTS 14 LARGE S&amp;LS UP FOR SALE;  </P> <P> BAILOUT: GOVERNMENT HOPES TO GET TOP-DOLLAR FOR GIBRALTAR SAVINGS WERE SET BACK  AS THREE POTENTIAL BUYERS DROPPED OUT.  </P> <P> The government put 14 of its largest savings and loans, including Mercury  Savings in Huntington Beach, up for sale on Wednesday as part of its ongoing  effort to speed up the disposition of large problem thrifts it has seized.  </P> <P> Separately, the government's attempt to fetch a premium price for another of  its largest thrifts, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, is running into trouble  because three parties that at one time were among the most interested potential  acquirers chose not to bid. Sources identified the three as Citicorp,  BankAmerica and Toronto-based Royal Trustco, which owns Pacific First Bank in  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The list of prospective buyers for Gibraltar is now believed to be limited to  three parties, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Security Pacific and Great Western  Financial. Golden West Financial, the Oakland-based parent of World Savings,  looked at Gibraltar, but thrift executives said they would be surprised if it  bid.  </P> <P> The sale of Gibraltar, which was seized 15 months ago, could be an indicator of  how well the government will do in selling its largest troubled thrifts. Thrift  bidders are enjoying a buyer's market, which does not bode well for the  government's efforts to get healthy prices. Bids for Gibraltar -- which has  $7.2 billion in assets, $5.7 billion in deposits and 83 branches -- were due  Tuesday, with an announcement of a winner expected by June 29.  </P> <P> The 14 thrifts put up for sale Wednesday by the federal Resolution Trust Corp.,  the agency charged with selling failed thrifts, have a total of $39.8 billion  in assets and $31.3 billion in deposits. Eight have assets of more than $1  billion, including such large institutions as City Savings Bank in Bedminster,  N.J.; Empire of America in Buffalo, N.Y.; Merabank in Phoenix, and Benjamin  Franklin Savings in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> The RTC is under increased pressure to speed the sale of large thrifts it  controls. It is also under criticism that it has let some large thrifts, such  as Gibraltar, deteriorate in value by running them under government supervision  for too long.  </P> <P> "They have got to start getting rid of them," said Alexandria, Va., thrift  consultant Bert Ely.  </P> <P> An RTC spokeswoman said the agency hopes to sell the thrifts by year-end.  Mercury is the only California thrift of the 14 for sale, although Empire of  America has a California operation based in Woodland Hills known for ads that  once featured Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda.  </P> <P> Some institutions, including Mercury and Ben Franklin, were taken over only  this year. Regulators, who have taken years to sell thrifts, are moving quickly  on these S&amp;Ls because "there is real good franchise value, and the quicker  we sell them, the higher value we'll realize," said Kevin Shields, an RTC  spokesman in Denver.  </P> <P> Regulators seized Mercury, which has $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in  deposits, Feb. 23 after it ran out of capital under the tough standards imposed  by last year's thrift rescue law. The federal law, designed to bail out the  industry's deposit insurance system, put several hundred marginal thrifts under  water with its new rules.  </P> <P> Mercury had been reeling for more than a year from accounting errors and  adjustments it had to take. It lost $53.6 million in the last two years and  started this year by announcing that two major commercial loans went sour,  wiping out the institution's already weakened capital. It's now in  receivership.  </P> <P> Industry analysts speculated that Mercury, as well as a few other  multibillion-dollar thrifts up for sale, has strong sale prospects because of  its good branch network with solid deposits from loyal customers who live near  the branches.  </P> <P> Those deposits generally cost less -- a lower interest rate is offered -- than  large certificates of deposit brought in from money brokers or from thrifts'  own money-gathering desks. And healthy financial institutions are looking more  for low-cost deposits than anything else.  </P> <P> "The main draw is deposits," said James F. Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery  Securities in San Francisco. "There's no deposit growth out there in most  markets, as far as internal generation of deposits goes. You have to buy it."  </P> <P> Mercury's co-founder and chairman, Leonard Shane, used novel approaches to  round up local deposit customers and never relied on higher-cost brokered  funds. That should make the institution's 24 branches appealing, the analysts  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS FOR SALE  </P> <P> The Resolution Trust Corp. has put 14 thrifts up for sale, including Mercury  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Assets are in millions.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:3.65IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

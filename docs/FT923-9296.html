			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Walker takes steps to avoid bankruptcy SOLICITORS acting for Mr George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, yesterday put forward proposals in the High Court in the hope of avoiding his being declared bankrupt. Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, completed a Pounds 1.6bn refinancing package in March this year. TSB Bank, one of the banks which lent to Mr Walker personally as well as to the company, had asked for an order of personal bankruptcy against him. The petition cited claims in excess of Pounds 9m. The court appointed Mr Raymond Hocking, an insolvency partner at Stoy Hayward, the accountants, to examine the proposals and report to the court on August 19. Mr Michael Coleman of Harkavys, Mr Walker's solicitors, said: 'Mr Walker believes that he has put forward, with the assistance of his family, proposals which will benefit his creditors and thus their shareholders beyond that which they would have achieved had he been made bankrupt'. 'He sincerely hopes that his creditors will carefully consider the proposals being put forward on his behalf and agree to them.' Mr Coleman said he could not give any details of the proposals. The thirty minute hearing was conducted in private and Mr Walker did not attend. TSB Bank said it had sought the order for bankruptcy after exhausting all other possibilities. It said it was acting unilaterally in the best interests of its shareholders. Mr Walker and his family are thought to owe far in excess of the Pounds 9m claim the TSB Bank is making. In 1989 trusts acting for his children paid Pounds 50m for four vineyards which were acquired from the company. In 1990 Mr Walker and his family borrowed to finance a Pounds 27.5m purchase of convertible bonds issued by the company in the early stages of its refinancing talks. The bonds have since been converted into shares in the company. These are now valued at a fraction of their original cost. Brent Walker's latest accounts show that Birdcage Walk, owned by trustees on behalf of Mr Walker and his family, had held 12.4m shares, 3.7 per cent of the capital. However, Birdcage Walk had gone into liquidation and the company had not received any notification from the liquidator about the stake. Mr Walker had made a Pounds 20m claim against the company and its banks when he was ousted from his executive role in May last year. However, the company said yesterday that no progress was being made on these claims.</p>

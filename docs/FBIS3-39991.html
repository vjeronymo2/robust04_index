Van den Broek briefed  Prime Minister Papandreou on his contacts in Skopje, where he  will return tomorrow before going back to Brussels.  Correspondent Konstandinos Dhimtsas has the following report  from Maximos Palace.    [Begin Dhimtsas recording] EU Commissioner Van den Broek  will  have a new meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow as the most important EU  initiative on Skopje unfolds. The EU commissioner reportedly  told the prime minister that in Skopje he found a climate of  goodwill to resume the dialogue with Greece under the auspices  of the United Nations. He also presented a letter from Gligorov  to Papandreou.    The main points of Gligorov's letter are: Skopje seeks a  dialogue on all the issues on the foreign ministerial level in a  third country under UN auspices. If Greece does not revoke the  sanctions against Skopje, Gligorov said, his country will file  an appeal to the UN Security Council and the CSCE.    In a statement, Foreign Minister Papoulias described  Commissioner Van den Broek's effort as positive. We hope, he  said, that it will continue. The EU commissioner said the EU is  in full agreement with Greece and Gligorov agrees that good  neighborly relations are essential for the survival of his  statelet. Prime Minister Papandreou's reply to EU Commission  President Jacques Delors is being drawn up in the prime  minister's office. In his letter, the prime minister will  support that taking counter measures against Skopje is a  political issue. The letter will also stress that the measures  that concern the national sovereignty, history, and security of  our country cannot be seen as issues of customs or trade.  Papandreou will also outline legal arguments stressing that  Greece's decision does not violate international or EU law and  will recall that Greece has signed no accord on surrounding  states.

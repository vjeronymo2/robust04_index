			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / CSO publishes first country breakdown of invisible trade The UK runs large invisible trade deficits with the rest of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, but these are offset by big surpluses elsewhere in the world, according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, Peter Norman writes. The CSO's first ever country-by-country breakdown of Britain's invisible trade, covering services, investment income and transfers, showed that in 1992 the UK ran a deficit of Pounds 3.94bn with the rest of the EU and one of Pounds 3.22bn with the EFTA countries. But surpluses elsewhere produced a positive balance of Pounds 4.79bn on the global account. The UK had invisible surpluses of Pounds 4.39bn with Japan, Pounds 2.26bn with the US and Pounds 1.59bn with Australasia. Inside the EU, the UK ran a Pounds 4bn surplus with Italy, but deficits of Pounds 1.86bn with the Netherlands, Pounds 1.26bn with Germany and Pounds 1.18bn with Spain. Economic Trends No 488, June 1994. HMSO. Pounds 13.25.</p>

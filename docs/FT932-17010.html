			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hanson cuts stake in Wassall half its interest - in Wassall for some Pounds 14.5m. It is left with a holding of 4.04 per cent. It took a minority holding in Wassall in 1988 when Mr Christopher Miller and Mr Philip Turner, former executives at Hanson, and Mr David Roper acquired effective control. Mr David Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said Wassall was now well established. 'We continue to have a high opinion of Christopher Miller and the Wassall management team. In cash terms the sale recovers virtually the whole cost of our investment in Wassall'.</p>

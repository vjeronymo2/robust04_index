			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christian Democratic Party Spokesman Ondrej </F> Turek: The Czechs and NATO Entry"]    [Text] Some domestic commentators have joined the foreign  critics of the approach taken by the Czech Government, which  refused all notions of a joint, or at least a coordinated,  approach by the Visegrad Four countries to NATO. Terms like  "arrogance" and a "mean trick" are flying about, together with  appeals for solidarity and warnings that by this attitude we may  lose our last allies. Nevertheless, these daring statements are  not based on any rational arguments. However, it is precisely  rational thinking and a cool head that we most need today in the  tumultuous region of Europe, particularly in its Eastern and  Central parts.    The stand of the Czech Republic is not a struggle for petty  prestige, as one reporter called it, but responsible behavior.  If we succumbed to pressures for a close coordination of the  approach to NATO with all of the Visegrad countries, we would be  making an error. Unfortunately, it is true that we are more  likely to become NATO members after we manage to separate  ourselves from the irrational vision of a Visegrad self-help  association, after no one dares to include the Czech Republic in  East Europe, and after we really prove that we are a prosperous,  and especially a stable, democratic state. I believe it is  better to have as a partner, even if relatively later, the  entire Western civilization than, immediately, several  unreliable riders en route to the same destination. I am sorry,  but Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary have let themselves be pushed  into the role of three drowning men who are trying to grasp the  coattails of a fourth one. The representatives of the Czech  Republic, however, do not belong to those who cannot realize  that three drowning men are too much for one rescuer. It must  be hoped that the drowning men know how to swim, at least a  little.    Someone could object: What about our sense of solidarity?  Should we help them, after all? I believe that the notion of  solidarity is not at all appropriate in the present situation.  How can we help Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia? How else but  verbally? I believe that no one wants us to condition our  admission into NATO Samaritan-like by a [demand for] the  simultaneous admission of all of the other Visegrad partners.  That would be an inexcusable gamble with the security of the  Republic because such a statement would slow down our admission  into NATO. It could even block it completely because who knows  what is going to happen in East Europe over the next few years?    Claims have also been made, as another argument for the  coordination of the proceeding of the Visegrad Four, that, after  the partition of Czechoslovakia, the West does not want to  tolerate any further disintegration of the Central European  region. I do not understand what the issue is here. In the  instance of the partition of Czechoslovakia, it was an execution  of the will expressed by the majority of citizens in the 1992  elections, a commendable avoidance of a Yugoslav-type tragedy,  and simply an act that is impossible not to respect, one that  must be commended.    And the unwillingness to dissolve the Visegrad Four? This  fear is again rather irrational and not at all supported by the  evidence. Are the Western countries at all interested in  maintaining an integral bloc in the Central European region?  Could the Polish or the Slovak elections, for instance, or the  expected outcome of the elections in Hungary have changed  something in their attitude? If so, would the possible interest  in keeping the Visegrad countries close together be in or,  rather, against the interests of the Czech Republic--that is,  against expeditious admission to NATO?    It is interesting that all of the consequential foreign  policy makers in the Czech Republic--the president, the prime  minister, and the foreign minister--have reached a rare accord  regarding the approach to NATO. It shows that, when the going  gets tough, when Czech national interests are at stake, the  political representatives can unite. The guarantee of the  security of the state and, therefore, admission to NATO really  is the number-one national interest.</p>

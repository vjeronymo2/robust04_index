			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The editorial board of  the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation got through  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) the  political treatise "The Future of the Nation Viewed From  Anecdote of Pyongyang" authored by Kim Son-pil, a professor of  political science at a university in Seoul, and broadcast it on  June 12.    He recalled that his friend told him that when a member of  the Seoul delegation to the Red Cross talks in Pyongyang, 20 odd  years ago, asked a girl who looked to be around 15 years old how  much the foundation stones of the statue of President Kim  Il-song erected on Mansu Hill weigh, he said "the weight of the  foundation stones of our father Marshal Kim Il-song's statue is  the same as the total weight of the hearts of the 50 million  people in the North and the South."    He wrote that what she said reflected the whole of the  North,  represented the mentality of its people and showed the true  appearance of its society and the great potentials of its system.    Noting that what the people think about the statue of their  leader and its foundation stones is a symbol of the  singlehearted unity peculiar to the North, he said:    According to my knowledge gained through various channels,  the North is the only country in the world that has actualized  the political administration based on the unity of the people.  In the North the intention of the leader is precisely the  intention of the people and what the people think is what the  leader thinks. The people say as intended by the leader and the  latter shapes politics as desired by the former.    The leader's politics is, so to speak, the aspiration and  will of the people. The leader takes care of the destiny of the  people and shapes good policies for the people and the people  remain faithful to the leader, entrusting their destiny to him.  The secret of the North's singlehearted unity lies in that all  the people have become one in everything.    When a journalist who came to Pyongyang from Seoul to cover  the North-South dialogue in the 1970s asked an old woman how  many members Premier Kim Il-song' family had, he answered "the  members of our premier's family number 50 million." When the  North-South dialogue was being held in the 1990's, a journalist  from Seoul asked an old man where the Chong-il peak was. He  answered: "Chong-il peak is in Mt. Paektu. The Koreans must  know of Mt. Paektu and Chong-il peak."    The remarks of the old man are interpreted as meaning that  the Koreans must know of the greatness and extraordinariness of  supreme commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Chong-il.    In Western countries, supreme commander Kim Chong-il is  praised as the greatest hero in the world who has become a  bright light in the east predicted by Indian poet Tagor to  illumine the universe, and created an oasis in the world as dry  as a desert due to the lack of the leadership ability of  statesmen in the present times.    The loyal heart of the people in the North in upholding and  following the leader has become all the warmer while years  passed by from the 70s to the 90s, and it has grown in eight now  when the numbers of the nation have grown to 70 million than in  the period when they totalled 50 million.    Such a singlehearted unity is unimaginable in the South.    It is a foolish dream to hope for a harmony of the people in  the South where there is not a great man.    The anecdote of Pyongyang also tells that only a great man  enjoys the loyalty of the people.    In Pyongyang blessed with two great men there is a  philosophy  and politics for the nation. The North has an ideological  wealth for living its way and by itself. It is the political  spirit peculiar to the North in the limelight of the planet to  shape independent politics, neither depending on outside forces  nor bowing to the pressure of foreign forces nor wavering in the  western or eastern wind in the world where the big-power-first  logic is forced.    In my opinion, the political philosophy and political spirit  of the North have been so strong and steadfast that they are  lauded by all the people. The North is now overcoming  single-handed the pressure and blackmail of the United States  and its Western allies not to be reduced again to other's slave  and not to be subject to others. This spirit of the North looks  far greater than that of the Koyro dynasty, a powerful country  which lasted a thousand tears.    The singlehearted unity of the North is the greatest wealth  of the nation. Such a unity in which all the people are united  with the same purpose and obligation and harmonized with each  other on the basis of virtues is a product of the extraordinary  leadership of secretary Kim Chong-il. With this unity, the  North, being a half of a divided small country, demonstrates the  might of its political force, making dignified remarks to  Western powers when it feels it necessary to do so, and keeping  silence like a rock when it should do so. Such prestige and  power of the nation which had never been seen in its history  spanning [word indistinct] years are feats performed by  secretary Kim Chong-il.    The leader being great, the history of the nation has been  correctly established, the society enjoys abundance and the  people have become beautiful in the North.    What is most difficult in the world is to make the people  beautiful, I dare say. It is not difficult to make a [word  indistinct] or build an industrial complex. But all sorts of  hard works or a bible or a doctrine are not enough for making  the people true human beings.    The North is the only earthly paradise on the globe which  has  resolved this human-historic task.    Noting that the human-historic question where lies the  future  of the nation has already been answered by the Pyongyang  anecdote,the author of the treatise says:    It is the irresistible trend of the time that the people's  mind tends toward the true leader of the nation.    The author concludes:    Public-minded South Korean people, though they are in the  South, have their mind in the North. The mind tending towards  the North -- this is the trend among the South Korean people who  see through the future of the nation.    The political art of President Kim Il-song in his eighties  and secretary Kim Chong-il in his fifties are combined together  to strike the world with admiration.    Think that this is a light illumining the future of the  nation.    Therefore, the foundation stones of the statue of President  Kim Il-song on Mansu hill in Pyongyang weigh as much as the  hearts of the 70 million fellow countrymen who follow the two  great men, the hearts of all the people who believe in them as  in heaven. In other words it is the weight of the universe.    The future of the nation lies in the North.</p>

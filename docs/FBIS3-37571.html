What Will They Water: Bare Rocks or Plowland?"]    [Text] Abdudzhalil Samadov, the new prime minister of  Tajikistan, has paid an unofficial working visit to Moscow.    Samadov is a 44-year-old economist from an academic  scientific background, a specialist in textile production, one  of the most civilian sectors there is, he has the "bearing" of a  desk-bound scientist, and at the same time he is...a chess  player! Furthermore, he is a chess master. In 1965 the present  Tajik premier played Anatoliy Karpov. This was at the junior  championship of what was then our united country.    The visit was devoted entirely to the principles and  implications of Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone. It is  no exaggeration to say that this fundamental question will  determine the fate not only of the lifeless economy but also of  the whole of Tajik statehood. That is why Russia has offered  Tajikistan far easier terms than it has offered the other  Central Asian states.    Before his departure for Dushanbe, Prime Minister A. Samadov  received our correspondent. Here is what he said:    [Samadov] I have done the rounds of the leaders of Russia's  ministries and state committees, scientific and business  circles, and Federation Council and State Duma deputies so as to  get them to understand the difficulties which await our economy  in 1994. And also to discuss the first steps in multifaceted  Russian-Tajik cooperation on the basis that Tajikistan has been  defined as a state belonging to the ruble zone. The task ahead  of us is to create a socially oriented market economy.    [Lenskiy] Abdudzhalil Akhadovich, how do you assess the  current living standard in Tajikistan?    [Samadov] The fall in the living standard of the people, who  have endured two dreadful years, the war, and its aftermath, is  not a foundation on which you can talk about rapid successes and  transformations. But the government does not want to appear to  be at a loss before the people, it knows its people and it  believes in their strength. Tajikistan's future will depend  primarily on peace.    [Lenskiy] On what terms is Russia inviting Tajikistan to  join the ruble zone?    [Samadov] It is too early to talk about terms. This is a  process which has only just begun. A group of Russian experts  is flying out with us to Tajikistan today to determine the  timing and details of the transitional stage and, most  importantly, the mutual responsibility which the two states are  assuming.    [Lenskiy] So this is not a one-shot event, as many people in  our country think?    [Samadov] This is a lengthy and difficult process. It is  important that both sides have the will to realize their plans.    [Lenskiy] Last year Tajikistan was granted a credit of 120  billion. Has that made it possible to revive the economy  perhaps a little?    [Samadov] The last thing that we intend to do is simply to  fritter that money away. Only the minimum resources are being  channeled into supporting the low living standard which exists,  mainly into the purchase of grain. The bulk of the credit has  been used to restore the activity of production structures so as  to step up commodity exchange with the CIS countries, first and  foremost with Russia. Some 87 percent of our economic ties are  with Russian enterprises.    [Lenskiy] In what sectors of the national economy is the  closest cooperation between our states envisaged?    [Samadov] We are ready to supply our Russian partners with  as much raw cotton as possible. And we will ask Russia to  supply us with energy sources and chemical products for  agriculture.    [Lenskiy] As is well known, trainloads of freight destined  for Tajikistan have been blocked in the past few days on the  Uzbek-Tajik border. I have heard diplomats say that this is  because your neighbors are jealous at your integration into the  ruble zone....    [Samadov] I do not think that this is Uzbekistan's official  position. We will sort things out. At the level of bilateral  relations.    [Lenskiy] You are often criticized for not holding a  dialogue with the internal opposition....    [Samadov] We have begun progress in that direction. We are  holding consultations with other countries within the framework  of the CIS and the United Nations. We realize that it is hardly  going to be possible to settle anything without such dialogue.    [Lenskiy] Each month 7,000 Russian-speakers leave  Tajikistan. A further 120,000 are still living there. But  within a year or two there could be none left. Does such a  prospect worry you?    [Samadov] Of course it does. But it is not only Tajikistan  which has to take measures. It is up to the whole Commonwealth  to help to stabilize the political situation, ease the tension  on the border, and bar the way to armed groupings once and for  all.    It is not just Russians who are leaving but Tajiks too --  hundreds of thousands have already left their homeland. We  await the return of all who once lived here and who call  themselves Tajiks.</p>

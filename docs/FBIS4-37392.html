			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statment issued by "an official source"; place and date not </F> given]    [Text] The Republic of Yemen has followed, with concern,  the statement made by the official spokeswoman of the U.S. State  Department in Wahington last night. In the statement she spoke  about assertions received by the U.S. Administration from the  Government of the Republic of Yemen that the Armed Forces will  not enter into the city of Aden.    The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to affirm  that it previously informed the Governments of the United States  and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that the Government of the  Republic of Yemen will delay the entry of the Armed Forces, the  forces of unity and legitimacy, into Aden to chase the remnants  of rebellious secessions, who are using the civilian citizens as  human shields, if it finds an appropriate political solution  based on ending the rebellion, holding dialogue within the  framework of the Republic of Yemen, on adhering to its  Constitution and constitutional legitimacy resulting from the  elections of 27 April 1993, and on stopping interference in  internal Yemeni affairs to end the war and stop Yemeni bloodshed.    The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to remind  all that the continuation of the present situation, the  continuation of secession and violation of constitutional  legitimacy, and the continuation of arms and military hardware  supplies to secessionists to prolong the conflict call on the  Government of the Republic of Yemen to shoulder its national and  constitutional responsibility to end the secession. It finds  itself forced -- in accordance with its constitutional and legal  right -- to deal with the violators of constitutional legitimacy  in the appropriate way and in any part of the Yemeni territory.    The Government of the Republic of Yemen hopes that brothers  and friends will understand this.</p>

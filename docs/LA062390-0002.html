			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE DROUGHT: CONSERVATION;  </P> <P> SIMI TO CONSIDER EMERGENCY PLAN TO SAVE WATER  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider adopting a mandatory water  conservation ordinance that would only be implemented in the event of an  emergency, officials said.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which supplies water to  areas of the east county, has urged all of its customers to adopt water-saving  ordinances so that they will be prepared if cuts in their water supplies become  necessary, said Ron Coons, director of Simi Valley's Department of Public  Works.  </P> <P> Water district officials said Friday that they will reassess statewide drought  conditions next month to determine if any cuts are necessary.  </P> <P> "If we cannot voluntarily conserve water, then this may be prudent for us to  do," Coons said of the possibility of implementing the mandatory measures.  </P> <P> The city has already taken some actions to reduce water usage. Earlier this  month, the council voted to require all new construction projects to use  ultra-low flush toilets and urinals. The city is also providing water-efficient  shower heads free of charge and continues to send out notices urging residents  to voluntarily conserve.  </P> <P> In addition, Councilwoman Ann Rock said, the city several years ago undertook a  major capital improvement program to reduce the amount of water leaking from  city pipes from about 12% to 4%.  </P> <P> "I think we have done a great deal," Rock said. "What else we can do depends on  the severity of the drought. It may be that sometime in the future we are going  to have to mandate. We're pretty much dependent on what the Metropolitan Water  District is going to tell us."  </P> <P> Coons said city staff had consulted with water officials as well as business  people in the community to get their assistance in putting the mandatory water  conservation ordinance together.  </P> <P> Should the need arise, the mandatory ordinance would be implemented in three  phases, with each phase requiring a public hearing before it could take effect,  Coons said.  </P> <P> Penalties for violations of the ordinance would range from a simple warning to  fines and other stringent measures, such as requiring customers to install  water efficient shower heads, he said.  </P> <P> In the first phase of the ordinance, residents would be prohibited from  watering their lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and watering would only be  allowed every other day. Residents would not be allowed to fill fountains or  ponds except with recycled water, and restaurants could not serve water unless  it was requested.  </P> <P> The second phase of the ordinance would include limiting the watering of lawns  between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. every third day, Coons said. Water-dependent  industries, such as commercial nurseries and golf courses, would be required to  water before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Phase three would involve a 20% reduction in water usage by all residents. Some  restrictions would include watering lawns by bucket or by slow-drip irrigation,  city officials said.  </P></p>

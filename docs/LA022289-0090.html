			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COMPUTER NETWORK DEBUTS WITH DELUGE  </P> <P> City Hall in Santa Monica was swamped with calls Tuesday from more than 150  people eager to register for the city's new computer network.  </P> <P> The network, hailed as an innovative way to connect the public with its  government, enables Santa Monica residents to use their personal computers to  plug into a wealth of information on city events and issues.  </P> <P> Users of the network can sign on to read City Council reports and agendas, find  out how to get a building permit and see what books are available in the  library. A resident who is hooked up can computer-message complaints or  comments into City Hall and expect an answer, right on his or her computer  screen.  </P> <P> The system went "on line" as scheduled Tuesday, and the first member of the  public to become a user signed on shortly after noon.  </P> <P> Michael Hill, a neighborhood activist credited with first suggesting the idea  to city leaders, "accessed" the system and found a message awaiting him from  Information Systems Director Ken Phillips:  </P> <P> "Welcome aboard," the message said. "I hope you find it useful."  </P> <P> Hill then whipped off a couple of messages to Phillips and City Manager John  Jalili, congratulating them on their work.  </P></p>

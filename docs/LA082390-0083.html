			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISABLED WORKER CLAIMS JOB BIAS;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: THE LAKEWOOD WOMAN, BORN WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS, FILES  DISCRIMINATION ALLEGATIONS OVER HER FIRING FROM A HOSPITAL.  </P> <P> A 40-year-old Lakewood woman born without arms and legs claims she was fired  from a job as head social worker at a Long Beach hospital because  administrators there objected to her turning pages with her lips.  </P> <P> Diane DeVries, who earned a college degree with a pen pressed between the stump  of her right arm and her face, filed a discrimination charge last week with the  state Department of Fair Employment and Housing in Los Angeles in an effort to  win back the $12-an-hour job at Long Beach Doctors Hospital.  </P> <P> "I felt like a dirty sock they just threw aside," said DeVries, an affable  woman who earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA in 1987, despite a  congenital birth defect that left her with two small stumps for arms, and no  legs. "I have lived a basically normal life. Most of my friends are not  disabled. This brought to the surface the fact that I am different. That's just  never happened before."  </P> <P> Hospital Administrator Thomas V. Olson said he decided DeVries should not  return to work at the 43-bed hospital because she was observed turning the  pages of hospital documents with her mouth, a practice he and two other doctors  considered a health hazard.  </P> <P> "This is an infection control situation. We can't permit that. We have  standards here to protect our patients and our people," Olson said in a recent  interview. "I feel sorry for the lady, but I just don't think that behavior  could be allowed here. I was thinking not only of other people, but of her,  too."  </P> <P> DeVries' attorney, Larry Minsky, says she is capable of turning pages with the  stump of her arm rather than her mouth, but the hospital never bothered to ask  her.  </P> <P> Minsky contends that the hospital violated a state law requiring that employers  "reasonably accommodate" disabled workers to help them perform a job.  </P> <P> "If the practice is found to be medically unacceptable, then the proper thing  to do is to talk to her like a human being and say, 'Hey, is there another way  of doing that?' " the attorney said.  </P> <P> Without the job, DeVries says, she cannot pay the $550 rent on her apartment  and faces commitment to a nursing home, a downward spiral from which disabled  people do not easily recover, she said.  </P> <P> "When you're in a nursing home you lose your Social Security benefits. You  can't get a place to live without your Social Security benefits and you can't  get your Social Security benefits without an address," she said. "It's a  Catch-22."  </P> <P> DeVries, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood, said there were  few days in her life as memorable as Thursday, June 28, when she woke up to  report to her first day on the hospital job as director of social services. She  arranged for her personal attendant to help her shower and dress early enough  to catch two buses and arrive at the hospital at 8:45 a.m.  </P> <P> For the first time since she left Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey --  18 years old and determined to be independent -- DeVries says her life had come  together. She had a college degree, a one-bedroom apartment in Lakewood and a  job counseling hospital patients not unlike herself.  </P> <P> "The only way I was going to lose that job was if I quit -- so I thought," she  said.  </P> <P> Four days later, on the Fourth of July, the hospital relayed a message that her  services were no longer needed.  </P> <P> "We can only assume they don't wish to have people with handicaps in and around  the facility, that they don't want people with the 'look' of Diane," said her  Long Beach attorney, Minsky. "This is Neanderthal."  </P> <P> Marta Fernandez, a Century City attorney representing the hospital, said no  discrimination laws were violated because DeVries was officially employed by  Associated Social Resources Inc., a Los Angeles firm that places social workers  in hospitals. Long Beach Doctors Hospital had contracted with the firm to fill  the position.  </P> <P> In addition, Olson said, the hospital had not agreed to take DeVries on  permanently, but had brought her in to fill in for a vacationing social worker.  That position has since been filled permanently, however, he said.  </P> <P> DeVries insists that the position given to her was permanent, with the salary  to begin at $12 and increase to $14 sometime afterward. She said janitors had  even built up a desk so she would be able to write.  </P> <P> DeVries, who previously worked as a counselor assisting disabled people for an  agency in Paramount, said she has been unable to find work since she lost the  hospital job.  </P> <P> Fernandez confirmed this week that she had received the discrimination charge  filed by DeVries.  </P> <P> Associated Social Resources, the placement firm, also was named in the claim,  which said the agency complied with the hospital administrator's request that  DeVries be removed from the job. The agency's director, Meryl Stern, refused to  comment.  </P> <P> Officials at the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing in Los Angeles  said they are awaiting a response from the hospital and will then begin an  investigation, which could take up to a year to complete.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the department will attempt to negotiate a settlement to the  dispute. If that fails, Minsky said, a lawsuit will be filed.  </P></p>

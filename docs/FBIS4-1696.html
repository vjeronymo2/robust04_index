			<p>BFN     [Text] Jilin has made great efforts to promote overall,  coordinated reform of the labor system for the region. It  recently designated Siping, Liaoyuan, and Changchun cities and  Yongji, Huadian, Linjiang, Sanchazi, Hunchun, Qian Gorlos,  Qianan, Jian, Tonghua, Daan, Zhenlai, and Tongyu counties,  cities [shi], and districts as the first pilot areas to test  regional coordinated reform. Major parts of the reform are as  follows: First, the labor contract system will be applied to  all staff members and workers of all state-owned, collective,  foreign-funded, shareholding, and private enterprises in these  areas. Second, the wages of all the enterprises will be subject  to overall regulation and control. The total amount of wages  will be linked to economic performance. Enterprises have the  decision-making power for their own distribution. Third,  old-age pension and unemployment insurance will cover all staff  members and workers of urban state-owned, collective,  foreign-funded, shareholding, and private enterprises, and a new  and unified pension distribution method will be implemented.  Fourth, the labor force exchange markets and their service  function will be improved so that the markets will fully develop  their basic role in the development, utilization, and  distribution of labor forces. Through the reform, enterprises'  transformation of the operating mechanism will be promoted, and  their quality and economic efficiency will be raised in an  all-round manner. The experiment of the first group of pilot  cities and counties will be completed at the end of this year.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rumours of Sorrell's departure denied - Refinancing appears to offer best hope for WPP THE IDEA that WPP's banks are seeking the removal of Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, as part of the price for agreeing a new financing package for the Dollars 1bn-indebted international marketing services group, was roundly denied yesterday Mr Paul Judge, a recently-appointed non-executive member of WPP's board and chairman of Food From Britain, the British trade support body, said yesterday: 'I have heard no suggestion from the banks that Mr Sorrell should change his role.' He added that the role of chairman and chief executive would not be merged, though it was becoming increasingly likely that Mr David Ogilvy, WPP chairman, now 81, would probably retire soon. Mr Rupert Faure Walker of Samuel Montagu, WPP's advisers in its bank negotiations, said: 'I have seen only total support for Mr Sorrell, both among the banks and within the operating companies. There is no intention of any of the banks to see a change of chief executive.' On Friday evening WPP announced that the co-ordinating committee - Bankers' Trust, Barclays, Citibank and JP Morgan - of its 28 member banking syndicate, had agreed in principle to a rights issue, the proceeds of which would be used to reduce the group's debt. Under the terms of the proposal, which must now be put to the syndicate and existing shareholders, the banks could end up owning slightly more than 50 per cent of the group's equity. The Dollars 1bn debt could be reduced by as much as 25 per cent. The latest re-financing package follows a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 558m) restructuring package completed in April 1991, which saw WPP incurring a 'success fee' of slightly more than Pounds 10m payable to its banks. The latest package will cost the company a similar amount. WPP has to repay or refinance Dollars 400m of its debt by June 1993 and repay the remaining Dollars 604m four years later. It is unable to offer any dividend payments at least until June 1993. By coming up with a new measure to keep WPP going, the banks appear to have decided that other options, such as forcing disposals, would not have produced attractive returns. In March WPP stated its intention to sell Scali McCabe Sloves, a US agency, as well as some market research subsidiaries. Mr Sorrell said at the time he hoped to raise some Dollars 200m. However, buyers have so far failed to materialise. The rumour that Mr Sorrell might be forced to leave or switch roles had gained ground in the last couple of weeks. Mr Sorrell declined to comment on his position yesterday. A banker involved in the negotiations said yesterday: 'Each of the 28 banks in the syndicate have some 10 people involved in the negotiations at some level. It is not surprising that some of that group look at WPP, see it as a problem on their books and want to find a single individual to blame. 'But those private views do not represent the thinking of the most senior figures in each of the banks involved.' Analysts took the view that the removal of Mr Sorrell would not be sought by the banks at this stage, if at all. But some argued that WPP's board needs a new senior executive presence to act as a counter-weight to him. Analysts also believed that there was a good chance of the rights proposal being backed by the banking syndicate. Mr Richard Dale of Smith New Court said: 'The steering committee will not have gone this far without feeling there is a good chance of it going through with the rest of the banks.' If the new proposal does get the full syndicate backing, then it is unlikely that shareholders will resist it. By the end of June, Mr Sorrell and WPP will probably have bought more breathing space. However, given that most estimates for increased advertising spending are still very low - perhaps an increase of 2 per cent throughout the world this year - WPP may still have to cut costs further, before the drama is played out.

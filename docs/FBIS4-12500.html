			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> negotiating delegation to the Cairo talks, by Faridah  al-Shubashi on 8 April; place not given; from the weekly "The  Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation in Cairo: What is your position, or  specifically the PLO's position, on the 'Afula and Ashdod  operations?    [Sha'th] We have a clear position, namely, that the peace  process should end all acts of violence by both parties. All  PLO factions have committed themselves to this issue. However,  the problems, violence, and crimes committed by the Israeli  settlers-- and we have not forgotten the Hebron massacre and,  afterward, the massacre committed by the Israeli Army itself in  Gaza--all this creates an atmosphere that escalates violence on  both sides. In the 'Afula operation, not only Israeli civilians  were killed, but Palestinians on the same bus were also killed  or wounded. Consequently, we announced our denunciation and  severe regret at this operation. We, however, linked it to what  happened in Hebron and Gaza, and we insist on the fact that the  way out of this continued escalation is commitment to the dates,  signing the peace agreement, and creation of a new situation  that will prevent the settlers' violence and, consequently, ban  the violence carried out by all parties.    [Al-Shubashi] But, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, it seems that the Tel  Aviv leaders have realized the matter, or understood the  message. What about the negotiations? In the negotiations with  the Israelis, have you touched on the recent developments?    [Sha'th] No. The Israelis decided to leave the negotiations  on Wednesday, based on a notification sent in advance to us.  We, however, did our best to deter them from doing so. We told  them: How can the agreement be ready for signature on 13 April,  now that you are leaving the negotiations for three and one-half  days out of the remaining five days? This makes it impossible  to sign the agreement on 13 April. We can only view this as  procrastination. The Israeli delegation insisted on leaving the  negotiations. This decision was made prior to the 'Afula  operation.    [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Can we avoid linking this  recent Israeli behavior -- namely, not to expedite the  withdrawal or fulfilling the pledges stipulated by the  Declaration of Principles -- on the one hand and the state of  despair prevailing among the Palestinians in the occupied  Palestinian territory on the other? Furthermore, wouldn't this  situation create concern over attempts to curb the role of the  PLO?    [Sha'th] In fact, the feeling of anger that prevails in the  Palestinian arena is caused by Israeli practices carried out by  settlers. It has become clear that the crimes and massacres by  settlers have never been hidden from the Israeli Army. The  inquiry has gradually revealed collusion and disregard in terms  of controlling the settlers themselves.    We also found that the Israeli Army itself follows double  standards. The violence practiced against the Palestinian  people by the Israeli Army is not less than the crimes  perpetrated by settlers. All this, in addition to the  procrastination in reaching an agreement on the date set in the  agreement we signed in Washington, create a state of anger and  complaints in the ranks of our people.    Moving ahead toward assuming power, achieving Israeli  withdrawal, the arrival of the Palestinian force and authority,  and changing the situation on the ground will create a state of  satisfaction among our Palestinian people. This was clear in  Gaza. When Israeli withdrawal began and the groups of deportees  returned there was a clear and remarkable change among the  Palestinian masses in Gaza. This is natural. Without this, the  anger, complaints, violence, and counter-violence will continue  in our occupied territory.    [AL-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, what is the way to get out of this  vicious circle represented by Rabin's hesitation, the situation  in the occupied territory, the frustration of the Palestinian  people, and the eroding credibility of the PLO and the  Palestinian leadership represented by President 'Arafat? How  will the PLO overcome the situation so it will not reach an  impasse?    [Sha'th] The peace, which we began in Madrid, and, then, the  signing of the accord in Washington, must be implemented on the  ground to gain support from the Palestinian and Israeli masses.  We have been trying to end the talks at the set time. It is no  secret to say that we have worked day and night over the past  two weeks, particularly following the signing of the Hebron  agreement, to accomplish the mission on the set date. We have  prepared detailed plans for the entry of the Palestinian police  and for Israeli withdrawal, and groups of deportees have  returned home.    There is no doubt that we want the lists of deportees and  prisoners to include all the sons of our people with all their  factions. However, those who returned this time were not only  from the historical political leaders, but also from the heroic  leaders of the intifadah who have returned to lead the daily  activities in the Palestinian street to receive the Palestinian  police and authority and to change the situation on the ground.    Therefore, we tried to break this deadlock through intensive  work on the level of the talks and on the level of the  Palestinian police so that we enter on the fixed date. I do not  see any other way to break the deadlock except this one. We  need Arab and international support to achieve this. In other  words, the solution lies in accomplishing the preparatory steps  and entering the homeland as soon as possible.    [Al-Shubashi] What is your assessment of Peres' saying that  Israeli withdrawal would be accomplished at the end of April?    [Sha'th] The problem is that we can longer see any respect  for any set date. If the matter is clear and the agreement this  time is firm we will have another opinion. We have enough  flexibility to accept dates that are very close to 13 [April] if  such dates are decided for purely practical reasons. However,  we no longer trust these dates. We want these dates to be  respected in order to accept any new steps for the future. The  coming date now is 13 April, so we, as well as Minister Peres,  should support any necessary effort to reach this date. During  the telephone call which Minister Peres held with [Egyptian]  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, I spoke personally with him at his  request and at the request of brother Minister 'Amr Musa. Peres  tried to respond to our call for intensifying the talks and  agreed on sending the Israeli delegation today, Friday, [8  April], for at least one day so as not to waste time. The  delegation will come again on Sunday. A few hours after this  agreement, the office of Prime Minister Rabin denied this matter  and claimed that he knows nothing about it and that the Israeli  delegation cannot go to Egypt on Friday.    I believe that many things should be accomplished before  restoring the credibility of Israeli dates on which they agreed  with us.    [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

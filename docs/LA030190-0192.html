			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;LS' SHARE OF HOME LOAN MARKET SHRINKS;  </P> <P> FINANCING: MORTGAGE BANKING FIRMS AND BANKS ARE GETTING A LARGER PIECE OF THE  RESALE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA, A SURVEY SHOWS.  </P> <P> Savings and loans in California continued losing their share of the home  lending market to banks and mortgage banking firms in 1989, a California Assn.  of Realtors survey shows.  </P> <P> The survey of about 1,000 association members released Wednesday showed that  S&amp;Ls funded 41% of first mortgages on homes and condominiums the realtors  sold, down from 47% a year ago and 59% in 1987. The association said mortgage  banking firms increased their share to 44% from 41%, giving them the largest  percentage of any industry group. Banks nearly doubled their share from 1987,  to 11% from 6%.  </P> <P> But industry executives cautioned not to make too much of the association's  survey because it measured a narrow segment of the business. As a result, they  said, it probably understates the role of banks in home lending and may  overstate the role of mortgage banking firms, which sometimes take loans to  banks to be funded.  </P> <P> Still, the survey is in line with other studies nationally, providing further  evidence that thrifts have lost their historical place as the nation's  principal lenders of home loans. The reasons include increased competition from  banks and mortgage bankers, combined with a severe industry shakeout that has  forced even some of the healthiest thrifts to shrink to meet tough new capital  standards that require a bigger cushion against losses. Hundreds of other  thrifts nationwide have been taken over by regulators, sold or closed.  </P> <P> The survey included only realtor members of the association, and the response  rate was 10% to the 10,000 surveys sent out asking them to describe financing  details of their recent sales. Because the respondents were realtors, nearly  all the sales involved existing homes.  </P> <P> That would understate bank activity in home lending because builders of new  homes frequently use their own sales staff instead of realtors and often work  directly with banks to help buyers finance purchases. The survey also does not  include the refinancing of homes or home equity loans, two areas where  California banks have been particularly aggressive lately.  </P> <P> Jonathan E. Gray, a savings and loan analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.  in New York, said another factor that may distort the market share figures is  that adjustable-rate mortgages, a specialty of savings and loans, were less  attractive in 1989 than they were in 1988. ARMs are less appealing when  interest rates are falling, as was the case during much of last year.  </P> <P> Although the overall S&amp;L industry is losing its share, the trend does not  necessarily mean that all thrifts are making fewer loans. It probably is more  the result of the inactivity of troubled thrifts.  </P> <P> Indeed, other numbers compiled by the TRW/Comont market research firm show that  Great Western in Beverly Hills in 1989 had the largest share, 7.5%, of loan  originations of any institution in the state as measured by dollar volume.  Following Great Western were two other healthy thrifts, Home Savings of America  in Irwindale and World Savings in Oakland.  </P> <P> Mortgage banking companies continue to play a bigger role in funding home loans  in California. They specialize in making and selling real estate loans, often  working closely with realtors and builders. Some of the largest firms in  California are Imco Realty Services, Weyerhaeuser Mortgage, Countrywide Funding  and Directors Mortgage.  </P> <P> Norman P. Anderson, senior vice president with Riverside-based Directors  Mortgage, said 1989 was especially busy for mortgage bankers. He said that was  in part because of falling interest rates, which caused many home buyers to  seek fixed-rate loans from mortgage bankers. Many thrifts are increasingly  shunning fixed-rate loans because they are unprofitable when interest rates  rise.  </P> <P> WHO MAKES HOME LOANS?  </P> <P> Strict new federal rules are causing savings and loans' share of the mortgage  market to shrink. Mortgage bankers and commercial banks seem to be the  beneficiaries.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P> <P> 1989:  </P> <P> Savings and Loans: 40.9%  </P> <P> Mortgage Bankers: 44.1%  </P> <P> Commercial Banks: 11.3%  </P> <P> Sellers: 1.2%  </P> <P> Others: 2.5%  </P> <P> 1984:  </P> <P> Savings and Loans: 55.4%  </P> <P> Mortgage Bankers: 30.2%  </P> <P> Commercial Banks: 4.8%  </P> <P> Sellers: 6.4%  </P> <P> Others: 3.1%  </P> <P> Note: Data is gathered from realtor members of the California Assn. of Realtors  and may overstate the share held by mortgage bankers and understate commecial  banks.  </P> <P> SIX-YEAR TREND  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Source  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Savings and loans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 55.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 58.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mortgage bankers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Commerical banks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sellers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Others  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China  [BOC], the state foreign exchange bank, reported here today its  increased foreign exchange deposits and assets volume and said  that its credit policy in the new year would stress economic  efficiency while avoiding credit risks.    The bank revealed that its foreign exchange deposits hit  27.84 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1993, of which 9.2  billion U.S. dollars were individual savings.    This represents an increase of 18 percent and 50.7 percent  respectively, compared with the previous year.    BOC's overseas branches also did brisk business in 1993,  with  the deposits in these branches expanded to some 59.9 billion  U.S. dollars and the total assets value risen to over 120.7  billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year.    However, "we should stress economic efficiency, and the  ability of repayment should be the important yardstick in  extending loans," said Wang Qiren, the bank's new president,  when addressing a working meeting attended by BOC's branch heads  across the country today.    According to Wang, the bank's credit priorities in 1994  would  still be given to some enterprises which have been the country's  big hard currency earners, some efficient state enterprises, the  basic industries and infrastructure construction projects.    The bank would try to ensure the credit supply of  foreign-funded enterprises, said Wang.    Lending to enterprises with poor productivity or out-dated  techniques, as well as money-losing firms would be strictly  controlled, as such loans would assume more risks.    The president asked the branch officials not to provide a  penny to new capital projects which have not been licensed by  the central authorities.    Starting this year, China introduced a new foreign exchange  rate system characterized by a single and floating exchange rate  for the Chinese yuan.    Under the system, enterprises and units must sell all their  foreign exchange earnings to the state banks and buy hard  currency from the banks with necessary documents.    To ensure necessary and sufficient supply of foreign  exchange, the Bank of China will set up special sections to  examine the validity of the documents.    It will also set up a unified foreign exchange rate with  certain floating range on the basis of the benchmark rate set by  the central bank to guide the foreign exchange business in its  branch offices across the country.    Wang Qiren revealed that this year, the bank will provide  services to individual Chinese who are doing foreign exchange  trading.    However, the service would first open in  economically-developed coastal regions and with prudence, said  Wang.    He urged BOC branch offices to mobilize enough RMB  [renminbi]  yuan to ensure the converting of foreign exchange certificates  (FEC) and the settlement of hard currencies.</p>

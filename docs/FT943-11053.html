			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Japan car sales rise for second month A further sign of revival in the Japanese economy came yesterday with figures for vehicle sales in July which showed a rise from a year earlier for the second successive month, the first time this had been achieved since October 1990. Total vehicle sales were up 2.4 per cent with cars ahead 1.5 per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. Truck sales were up 4.6 per cent, their fifth monthly gain in a row. For the calendar year so far, however, vehicle sales remained 3 per cent below levels of the first seven months of 1993. And elsewhere in Japanese industry, positive data remained hard to come by. Construction orders for June, announced yesterday by the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, were down 3.4 per cent from a year before, the 17th consecutive decline. The federation noted, however, that orders from manufacturers were up 8.7 per cent. Orders from the private sector as a whole fell 3.1 per cent while public sector orders were down a sharp 12.9 per cent, reflecting the delay in the passage of the annual budget brought about by the country's political turmoil.</p>

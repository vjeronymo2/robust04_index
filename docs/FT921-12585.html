			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Anniversary arguments THE Nationwide Anglia insists (a) that a second year instalment for a Tessa can only be paid on or after the anniversary of the account opening. I thought it could be paid after January 1 1992 if the account was opened in 1991 and (b) that the second year instalment can only be Pounds 1,800 less whatever interest has accrued from the first year. I say it is the full Pounds 1,800. The anniversary is the earliest date for the second instalment which can be the full Pounds 1,800 without interest on first year instalments. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

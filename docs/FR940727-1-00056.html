			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A further comparison of the results of these calculations indicated that, under the proposed NUMARC methodology, 23 sites would have had bills equal to or higher than the flat fee, averaging approximately $90,000 more than the flat fee. Forty-seven sites would have had bills lower than the flat fee, averaging approximately $42,000 less than the flat fee. An analysis of the results using the proposed NUMARC methodology also indicated that the size of a site's bill was, in most instances, directly related to the biennial exercise cycle; i.e., the bill was higher if a site had an exercise in FY 1993, and the bill was lower if a site had not had an exercise in FY 1993. Thus, a majority of the bills below the flat fee in FY 1993 would be higher than the flat fee in FY 1994, and vice versa. Over a two-year period the bills would average out to an amount reasonably close to the flat fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the results of the above calculations, FEMA believes the flat fee to be fair and equitable because (1) although under the proposed NUMARC methodology, more bills were below the flat fee than were above it, those bills lower than the flat fee were, on the average, considerably closer to the flat fee than were the bills higher than the flat fee, and (2) the flat fee would eliminate the extreme year-to-year fluctuation in bill amount due to a site's position in the exercise cycle, and, thus, each site's bills would be more equitable in size over any given biennial cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FEMA's services primarily are provided in support of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the NRC and FEMA published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 47996), and regulations issued by both FEMA (44 CFR parts 350, 351, and 352) and the NRC (10 CFR parts 50 and 52). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiological emergency response plans and exercises are evaluated using joint FEMA&hyph;NRC criteria, NUREG&hyph;0654/FEMA&hyph;REP&hyph;1, Revision 1 and Supplement 1. When State and local governments do not participate in the development of an emergency plan, the licensee may submit a licensee offsite plan to the NRC. Pursuant to the MOU, the NRC can request that FEMA review a licensee offsite plan and provide its assessments and findings on the adequacy of such plans and preparedness evaluated under Supplement 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All funds collected under this proposed rule would be deposited in the U.S. Treasury to offset funds budgeted for FEMA's REP Program. In response to a FEMA request for a waiver from the Department of Treasury's cash management provisions of the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, the Department of the Treasury granted FEMA a waiver from the I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, requirement to bill within five days of service. A waiver was not granted to allow 45 days for payment of bills by licensees. However, if the authority for the proposed revised interim rule is enacted, the Department of the Treasury will grant a one-time exemption to the 30 day payment requirement in order to permit licensees to pay the FY 1995 bill, which would be issued in November 1994, in January of 1995. Also, the Department of the Treasury requested that the user fee rule provide for the use of electronic billing and payment mechanisms. FEMA worked with the Department of the Treasury to effect these procedures and now provides for payment of bills by electronic transfers through Automated Clearing House credit payments. The Department of the Treasury publication I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000 has been recently revised to require, under section 8025.30, all funds to be collected by electronic funds transfer when such collection would be cost-effective, practicable, and consistent with current statutory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> because the rule would not apply to a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Small Business Size Standards, 13 CFR 121.601, Division E, Major Group 49, as amended, 57 FR 62520, December 31, 1992, and would not be expected (1) to have significant secondary or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities, nor (2) to create any additional burden on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and FEMA Regulation, 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations, that this proposed rule would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would not be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review. It would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. The proposed rule would not create a serious inconsistency or interference with an action taken or planned by another agency. It would not materially alter the impact of entitlements, grants, or loan programs, nor would it raise novel legal or policy issues. To the greatest extent possible the proposed rule would adhere to the regulatory principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has not been reviewed under the procedures of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would not contain collection of information requirements and would not be subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Federalism assessment under E.O. 12612 has been prepared and a copy is available for inspection and copying for a fee from the Rules Docket Clerk, address noted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 354 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Disaster assistance, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear powerplants and reactors, Radiation protection, Technical assistance, Offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 44 CFR chapter I would be amended by revising part 354 to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 354_FEE FOR SERVICES TO SUPPORT FEMA'S OFFSITE RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 354.1&blank;Purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 354.2&blank;Scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 354.3&blank;Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 354.4&blank;Assessment of fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 354.5&blank;Description of services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 354.6&blank;Billing and payment of fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

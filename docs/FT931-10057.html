			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Russian bank and government squabble as inflation soars RUSSIA'S government and its central bank are engaged in a fierce war of words over who is responsible for the economic deterioration, as the country teeters on the brink of hyperinflation. Mr Anatoly Chubais, vice-premier for privatisation, yesterday hinted that President Boris Yeltsin would take action against the central bank after accusing it of 'adventurism'. Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, retorted in parliament - to which he is officially accountable - that he had only created money at the government's request. At the heart of the dispute is the question of central bank independence. Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for economics and finance, would like the central bank to perform its prime function of defending the currency, even if it means cutting off funds to the government and stopping the flow of cheap credits to industry. He says 'a balancing act' against hyperinflation has 'no chance' unless Mr Gerashchenko sets targets that are in line with the government's anti-inflationary goals. He also wants it to increase its discount rate, now at 80 per cent, to a 'market rate'. 'The central bank should be renamed development bank. . . . they do not want to act like central bankers,' he told the Financial Times. 'They should be prodding me to cut the budget deficit, not me telling them what the discount rate should be.' But there would be severe social and political consequences of such a tough policy, and the central bank does not want to take the blame. 'Somebody will have to take the responsibility,' Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor of the central bank, said in an interview yesterday. 'If we don't give credit to the Moscow power station to pay salaries, the lights will go off in this office tomorrow.' The government, whose various ministries have sanctioned many of the credits to enterprises, must also keep good its promises to start structural reform of the economy. While he does not believe it is realistic to expect lots of inefficient enterprises to close, Mr Fyodorov is determined to do his share. He wants to restrict state spending, increase revenues and force enterprises to make efficient use of state help.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Noranda back to the black with CDollars 44m A weak Canadian dollar, lower interest rates and improvements in some commodity prices helped Noranda, the Canadian resources group, return to profitability in the first quarter, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Earnings were CDollars 44m (USDollars 31.8m), or 18 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 31m loss, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 1.4bn from CDollars 1.25bn. Last year's figure includes a CDollars 66m loss on the sale of Noranda's controlling stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the forest-products group. Mining and metal operations turned from a CDollars 3m loss to a CDollars 17m profit, due to higher output and improved aluminium and gold prices. Operating earnings from forest products rose to CDollars 27m from CDollars 16m, and from oil and gas to CDollars 23m from CDollars 11m.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Property: Signs of life stirring in house and home - A climate encouraging steady investment UK residential property, which in recent years has been a burden round the necks of many investors, is becoming an area worth looking at again. The widely publicised problems of many individuals, who are suffering negative equity with mortgages higher than the value of their property, and companies burdened with debts should not distract potential investors from current opportunities. Housing market activity and foreign investment appear to be picking up. One sign that the market is far from dead was the recent sale of the newly renovated 9 Tregunter Road, Chelsea, for about Pounds 8m. And Far Eastern confidence in the prime market in the core of London seems to be strong: nine houses at Cambridge Gate, overlooking Regent's Park, have been sold on a 150-year lease to Singaporean developers. They aim to convert the property into flats and houses with a development value of more than Pounds 30m. Foreign money has been attracted into the prime market since the revaluation of the pound, after its departure last year from the European exchange rate mechanism. Overseas purchasers now account for about half of the prime market, and are estimated to have invested more than Pounds 500m in central London. Agents report a rise in residential land prices in and around the capital. But could investors and developers be mistaken in their optimism? Although the prime market depends, to a large extent, on cash-rich foreign investors, it cannot be entirely separated from the UK market as a whole. The residential market is driven by first-time buyers. Next year, the number of 28-year-olds - the average age of a first-time buyer - in the population is set to peak, as the effects of the 1960s population boom work their way through. This group contains many who have been resisting home ownership since 1988. It is also the section of the population most likely to have children, and to want a family home. But this market includes those who can wait a little longer for a home and those whose domestic requirements have changed while they have been waiting to buy. As a result, in the medium term, the UK residential market is likely to be more mature and more stable then in the 1980s. A steadier demand for homes should reduce the likelihood of the market overheating - and produce the ideal climate for the overseas investor. The stability of the market does not preclude opportunities to make profits, but developers will be expected to provide larger units and sell them for less. So even though building costs are low at the moment, developers' margins will be squeezed. While the market remains weak, developers have to increase building density to maintain profit. It is a happy coincidence that the Department of the Environment has indicated in recent Planning Policy Guidance notes a shift in attitude towards residential development in inner urban areas. In March 1992, PPG3 (Housing), for example, emphasised the importance of developing urban sites to take pressure off green belts. Local authorities were told that, where city-centre sites showed no realistic prospect of redevelopment with existing permission, they could redesignate the site for housing use. The draft revision of PPG13 published earlier this year further emphasised the desirability of inner-city living. Stressing the government's wish to 'reduce the need to travel', the paper identified that there was a relationship between low residential densities and increased travel, particularly by car. The DoE has indicated it will encourage higher-density developments at or near public transport facilities. Until now, many London authorities have adopted lower density standards  - as low as 70 habitable rooms per acre (hra). As long as there is no loss of amenity and good use is made of existing public transport, developers can make residential developments profitable. Sites in London around King's Cross and Paddington Basin, for example, could offer this potential. One part of the market that could be set for revival is residential lettings, which have traditionally proved unpopular with investors, particularly institutions. Now that a proportion of the population defers the purchase of a home, legislation exists to protect landlords and higher building densities may be permitted, investors should not ignore opportunities in this sector. Even the requirement, often dreaded, to provide affordable housing could be turned to the advantage of developers who enter into partnership schemes. Sectors must be correctly identified and targeted: the costly mistakes made in Docklands in the last boom illustrate the danger of missing the target. Some of the demand from overseas investors is being met through the change in use of commercial sites and buildings to produce new residential accommodation or by developing outside the traditional residential core. Such sites could provide prime residential property and secondary accommodation to sell and to let. The government, by signalling its desire to house people closer to the workplace, has given many of those holding redundant commercial sites a way out of problems. In addition, since the recent Budget, when the option of depreciating property assets for tax purposes was removed, there is no longer anything to be gained by holding property. Moreover, it is now possible to finance residential schemes, whether large schemes for rented accommodation or small, high-value developments to be pre-sold in the Far East. Residential property can also be efficiently managed as a long-term investment. Many developers and investors have already taken the plunge and acquired buildings and sites, driving up land prices, yet there are still many opportunities for those who can identify and provide what the occupier really wants.

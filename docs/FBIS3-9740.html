Speaking to journalists in Gdansk on Monday Moczulski added  that "the coalition is actually in pieces today." In his opinion  "the conflict between the president and the Democratic Left  Alliance (SLD) is actually a conflict between Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak and SLD Leader Aleksander Kwasniewski which has  its roots in the case of former Deputy Prime Minister and  Finance Minister Marek Borowski. [no closing quotation marks as  received]    The KPN leader sees the weakness of the SLD in the  alliance's  lack of additional candidates for ministerial posts. This was  the cause of putting forward Dariusz Rosati, connected to the  notorious affair of the Foreign Debt Servicing Funds (FOZZ), to  replace Marek Borowski after his resignation as deputy prime  minister and finance minister.    Moczulski forecasts "a great social commotion to take place  within either a few or several months" which would bring about  the collapse of the ruling coalition, vain attempts to form new  government and early parliamentary elections.</p>

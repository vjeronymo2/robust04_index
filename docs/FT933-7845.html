			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Technology: A mould breaker - Advances in chromium plating may have far-reaching implications for the car industry Five years ago, Diesel Marine International received a telephone call out of the blue from Nissan, the Japanese motor manufacturer which was building a press shop for its car plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, England. 'They were interested in our chrome-plating tank,' says David Batie, director of DMI, based in nearby North Shields and one of the largest industrial chromium platers in Europe. 'They said they couldn't possibly press car panels without chromium-plating the dies.' This, says Batie, was news to DMI, part of the Newcastle-based Torday &amp; Carlisle group and a long-established supplier of new and reconditioned parts for marine diesel engines. However, five years later DMI is enthusiastically expanding its links with Europe's car and truck industry to exploit an opportunity that could transform both it and its parent company. The story combines technology, differing cultural attitudes in the European and Japanese car industries, and environmental and cost issues in car production. Pressings was always the poor relation in the European car industry, says Batie. There is only one cast-iron die, and its associated blankholder and punch, for each panel and it is kept going throughout a model's production run with welded repairs to mend cracks, fill holes and keep it to the right shape. Damaging a die beyond repair is a serious matter for a car company - it would take months to make a new one. So any new approach was greeted with extreme caution. In the 1970s, the advantages of chrome-plating press dies were understood - cheaper, easier-to-machine iron could be used under the chrome, and the dies would last longer - but the process could not be perfected. Producing an even layer of chrome across the contours and cavities of a car die was difficult, and getting the chrome to stick to a mixed surface with all the repairs and modifications was also hard. The idea was quietly dropped. Typically, though, the Japanese motor manufacturers, in co-operation with chromium-plating companies, kept going. Overall product quality, consistency and cost savings from 'lean manufacturing' were factors. On top of that was the competitive environment. More frequent model changes and shorter production runs meant more dies, giving an incentive to find cheaper production methods. But the biggest spur, says Batie, came in the mid-1980s with the more widespread use of zinc-coated steels to reduce corrosion. The zinc powder would stick to the cast-iron die, causing pimples on the body panels. Large presses which can cost up to Pounds 5,000 an hour to run would regularly be stopped for 15-20 minutes for the dies to be cleaned. Typically, too, the solution has not come about through any quantum leap in technology by the Japanese, but through perseverance over 20 years in perfecting the chromium-plating process, adjusting the variables such as the positioning of anodes to achieve a very thin micron layer of chromium across the die surface. Encouraged by Nissan, which was keen to have a local chromium-plating company working for it, DMI took a licence for the process in 1989 from Japan's Koka Chrome Industries, which has worked for Nissan on the process over the past 17 years. DMI is receiving dies at its North Shields plant, at its Dutch plant in Zwolle and has a sub-licensee in Barcelona. It dechromes and rechromes the dies in about two days and returns them to customers. Batie says putting chromium on a die has a number of advantages beyond cutting the initial die cost. The chromium can act as a wear indicator if the grey iron shows through. The die can be quickly rechromed before welding is needed and consistency in the pressing can be maintained. The shininess of the chromium surface works much better with zinc-coated steels, says Batie, but the chromium also has a natural 'lubricity' which is important for environmental reasons. Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are tightening up on the use of lubricating oil in industry, but the chromium dies remove the need to lubricate the steel and prevent it tearing and splitting as the die punches into it. New 'laser-textured' steels, designed to give a high finish with minimum paint, are particularly difficult to 'draw' without lubrication when using a normal cast-iron die, says Batie. DMI is already working regularly with all the Japanese car manufacturers in Europe and Rover, Renault and Saab. It has reached differing stages of contact with several other groups, and has also chromed dies for the German pressings subcontractor Benteler. The process has generated immense interest in the industry, says Batie, although this has not always been turned into business. Some companies still remember past difficulties with chromium-plated dies, or are tackling the problem differently by using specially-hardened cast iron. But, in a European motor industry that has learnt so much from Japanese manufacturing techniques, the background to the process gives DMI credibility. Even in Germany, the motor industry's problems have forced engineers to become much more receptive to Japanese ideas. The challenge for DMI, and for Paul Torday, chief executive of the parent company, is to work out how quickly to expand the service. The chromium-plating plants have to be reasonably close to the customers, yet each need several clients to be economical. For this reason, and because effluent problems associated with the use of chromic acid and other chemicals used in chromium-plating make it difficult to obtain a licence for a new chromium-plating plant in Europe, Torday believes DMI is most likely to expand through acquisition or joint ventures. It is considering a plant near Paris and another in the south of France for the Italian market. The new business could account for as much as half of DMI's turnover - currently Pounds 18m - in three to four years, excluding possible non-automotive markets such as white goods.</p>

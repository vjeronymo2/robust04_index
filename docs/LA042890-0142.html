			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> EVERYBODY WINS IN SPECIAL GAMES  </P> <P> About 540 athletes from central and north Orange County received gold medals  after participating Friday in the Special Games at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Two students at Cal State Fullerton began the games in 1986 as a  less-competitive version of the Special Olympics, said Mary Ann Faley, one of  the games' volunteer organizers.  </P> <P> "Our emphasis in this is they are all winners," Faley said. All participants  are awarded gold medals and T-shirts no matter where they finished in the  various events.  </P> <P> This year, the special athletes competed in a softball and Frisbee toss,  several running races, a long jump and an obstacle course. About 300 volunteers  from the university and the community helped supervise the event.  </P> <P> After the competition, athletes were treated to an afternoon barbecue, with  food and supplies donated by local companies.  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / GrandMet makes new charge on sale of US canneries Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, has agreed to sell its US vegetable canning plants to streamline the operations of its Green Giant brand. A similar move on the frozen side of Green Giant, the leading US brand, has helped it to increase market share. The deal will entail a Pounds 42m charge in the current year only a week after GrandMet announced at its year-end results that it had identified all such restructuring charges for the 'foreseeable future'. Although it had left open the possibility of small charges arising on transactions, the timing surprised the City. 'It is a little bit niggling to have this stream of restructuring charges. It's typical of GrandMet,' one analyst said. GrandMet's Pillsbury subsidiary is selling six largely seasonal plants to Seneca, a New York-based company with canneries across the US. The UK group will receive Pounds 46m over the next 15 years. Pillsbury will take the charge for closing another four plants. Pillsbury estimates that economies of scale from the deal will save it Pounds 21m a year, plus releasing Pounds 172m in fixed and working capital. Pillsbury will retain control over seeds supplied to farmers, which it said was the key element in Green Giant's quality. Pillsbury will retain the brand, marketing and distribution of the canned vegetables. 'We are in a position to concentrate on product development and marketing and let our processing partners do what they do best,' Mr Paul Walsh, Pillsbury's chief executive, said. Canned and frozen vegetables account for equal shares of a Dollars 4.3bn-a-year US market. Green Giant is number one and growing in frozen but number two to Del Monte and declining in canned. Seneca's greater geographic spread will help protect Green Giant from bad crops in the Midwest where its canneries are based.</p>

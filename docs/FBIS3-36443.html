He has voiced this view in an interview with INTERFAX  on the eve of a two-day session of that CIS body, opening in St.  Petersburg on February 8.    "The Interparliamentary Assembly is an alien body, we have  Russian parliament and do not need anything more", the leader of  the second largest Duma faction remarked. "The assembly's  founder Ruslan Khasbulatov is in the "Lefortovo" jail, that's  where the whole assembly belongs, there are vacant cells there",  he said.    Zhirinovskiy stressed that, the assembly and other CIS  bodies  consolidate "the dismemberment of Russia's territory". The LDP  leader, as he has repeated over and over again, regards the  entire territory of the former Russian Empire, Finland included,  as genuinely Russian land.    In his opinion, Russia should stay out of pacts with the  states that dropped out of the USSR. In his opinion, these  countries should rejoin Russia as provinces, because such an  ally for Russia would be, as he put it "a chimera beyond  control." "No power can be stable without a single center",  Zhirinovskiy claims.    When the Duma discussed on Friday whether to send a  delegation to St. Petersburg or not, Zhirinovsky spoke out  sharply against the Russian parliament's participation in the  CIS body. The lawmaker Vyacheslav Marychev (St. Petersburg),  suggested sending there those who "pounded Russian Parliament"  in October 1993. "Let Lukin (Yavlinskiy's bloc -- IF) and  Braginskiy (the "Russia's Choice bloc -- IF) go there, for  Zyuganov and Rybkin there is nothing to do there", he declared.    During the crisis in Moscow last October, the Duma Speaker  Ivan Rybkin and the leader of the Communist Party's faction  Gennadiy Zyuganov were inside the White House together with the  deputies of the Supreme Soviet, dissolved by Boris Yeltsin's  decree.    Despite resistance from the Zhirinovskiy's faction, most  lawmakers decided to send a delegation of five Duma members with  Rybkin at the head to St. Petersburg.    A delegation of the Federal Assembly, the Upper House of the  Federation Council, will be led by its Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko.    Both leaders figure in the list of candidates to the post of  Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly.</p>

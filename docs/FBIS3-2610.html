This is the first economic law which has not been drafted  by the executive branch but by experts organized by the National  People's Congress. It will replace the Provisional Regulations  Governing the Issue and Trading of Securities previously  promulgated by the State Council and local regulations on  securities trading promulgated by Shenzhen and Shanghai, thus  erecting a national legal framework in securities.    The introduction of the Securities Act is naturally related  to the mainland's fast developing and booming securities  markets. By the end of 1993, there were already 122 listed,  joint-stock companies on the mainland, six major companies  listed outside China, and 51 securities companies across the  nation, and the number of shareholders reached some 25 million.  Moreover, over 13,000 enterprises across the country already  utilize the shareholding system, with the total amount of shares  amounting to 208.6 billion yuan, and many of these companies are  hoping to be listed or are pooling funds to expand production.  It is known that mainland enterprises are also planning to  issue 5.5 billion yuan of stocks this year.    In the meantime, the number of negotiable securities of all  types keeps increasing. According to statistics, between 1981  and 1993, negotiable securities issued on mainland China  totalled 432.3 billion yuan, of which 138.9 billion yuan were  short-term state treasury bonds; 39.7 billion long-term state  treasury bonds; 20 billion yuan special government bonds and  indexed bonds; 40.7 billion yuan state investment bonds  (including state construction bonds, state major construction  bonds, and capital construction bonds); 96 billion yuan in  corporate securities, 61 billion yuan of financial bonds; and 36  billion yuan in enterprise shares.    On the other hand, owing to the unsound system, some  unpleasant things have occurred in the securities investment  market; for example, one shareholder committed suicide following  great losses due to his failure in securities speculation after  obtaining an overdraft from a local securities company. His  wife then brought a suit against the securities company,  demanding reasonable compensation. Therefore, the question of  whether or not shareholders should be allowed to speculate in  future by taking out overdrafts has arisen, and this needs to be  standardized by the Securities Act.    A bigger issue is the fact that state-owned enterprises are  gradually changing to the shareholding system and are listing  one after another. Given the fact that "state-owned shares" are  tokens of public ownership, should we legislate to protect them  to prevent the state from losing controlling power over those  enterprises? In the process of drafting the Securities Act,  people have argued greatly about it all along. Professor Li  Yining, who was head of the drafting committee and who is the  deputy director of the Law Committee of the NPC Standing  Committee, disclosed not long ago that the question of whether  or not state shares should be protected should ultimately be  decided in keeping with the laws of the market economy; that in  stressing competition, we should not determine power by the main  body of shares; and that all investors should be on an equal  footing. Therefore, the Securities Act provides that state  shares, corporate shares, and personal shares should be treated  equally without discrimination. Another question over which  there has been a comparatively big difference of opinion is  whether or not the trading of securities should be allowed  outside the floor [of the exchange]. It was finally decided  that there was a need to set up roadside exchanges [chang wai  jiao yi suo 1034 1120 0074 2496 2076] outside the major  exchanges but that these sites must first be approved. If  roadside exchanges are banned, this will surely hinder the  development of the shareholding system and will aid the growth  of underground securities trading, and will thus produce many  loopholes. In addition, there is also the question of whether  or not civil servants should be allowed to buy and sell shares.  It was finally decided that it was inappropriate to lay down in  the Securities Act any clauses preventing any person from buying  and selling stocks. As for whether or not civil servants can  buy and sell stocks, provisions should be made in other laws,  regulations, and policies.    According to Ji Xiangyu of the Exchange Department of the  China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, the  forthcoming Securities Act includes a national central clearing  system. The variety of the central clearing system should  include listed A shares, futures, bonds, and debentures in the  initial stage. At a later stage, it should also include B  shares, corporate shares, funds, foreign shares traded in China,  and other financial varieties to be expanded in China in the  future. As for the shareholders of the national central  clearing company, he said that membership for foreign banks  could be considered, but holding rights must absolutely be held  by the Chinese side.    We can see, therefore, that the formulation and introduction  of the Securities Act really has great significance.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NCAA TIGHTENS ACADEMIC RULE FOR FRESHMEN  </P> <P> NCAA Division I delegates reversed themselves today and toughened Proposition  48, which governs freshman academic eligibility standards.  </P> <P> By a vote of 163 to 154, the large schools eliminated the partial qualifier  category, which pertains to high school graduates who meet only part of the  eligibility standards. About 600 partial qualifiers have been admitted each  year for the last three years, an NCAA staff member said. The new provision  takes effect Aug. 1, 1990, and will not affect anyone now in school.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the same schools defeated the proposal 159 to 151, but it is not  uncommon for delegates to reconsider items.  </P> <P> Proponents argued that eliminating the partial qualifier would "send a stronger  message" to high school students and teachers that they must emphasize academic  achievement in order to play at NCAA schools.  </P> <P> A partial qualifier is a high school graduate whose overall grade-point average  is 2.0 but who fails to meet minimum test score requirements or post a 2.0  average in required college preparatory courses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bias Alleged  </P> <P> Opponents said eliminating the partial qualifier would tend to be hardest on  inner-city youths and those from disadvantaged backgrounds who, they believe,  generally score lower on standardized college entrance exams.  </P> <P> Several black delegates criticized the elimination of the partial qualifier as  showing bias against minority students.  </P> <P> "It's unfair not only for minorities but for persons of low income," said Al  Avant, athletic director at Chicago State University. "But whether or not that  proposal passed, Proposition 48 is a failure. It's just an attempt by the NCAA  to look good."  </P> <P> Jean Chandler-Williams, faculty representative of Clark College in Georgia,  also viewed the action harshly.  </P> <P> "It's typical of the exploitation of minorities by the NCAA," she said. "I see  that all the way down the line."  </P> <P> The change occurred a day after the delegates to the 87th NCAA convention  decided to keep the three-year-old Proposition 48 rule intact, either defeating  or withdrawing several measures to alter freshman eligibility standards.  </P></p>

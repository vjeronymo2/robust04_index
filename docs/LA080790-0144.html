Ray Welch said the age of the baby was not immediately known. He said  police were first alerted by an anonymous call at 1:30 p.m. Monday that there  was a dead baby "in a container" near the apartment complex. At the direction  of another witness, officers searched a large bin used for commercial waste,  Welch said.  </P> <P> Welch said officers enlisted the help of a local sanitation crew to empty the  Dumpster. After sifting through debris for two hours, Welch said, the body was  discovered at the bottom of the Dumpster.  </P> <P> Anaheim homicide detectives tracked down Baena after questioning residents in  the vicinity, Welch said.  </P> <P> At the apartment complex, residents said Baena was a gentle-natured woman who  baby-sat for Maria Candidad Romero's three children.  </P> <P> Romero said that she did not know Baena had been pregnant.  </P> <P> "She hid it," Romero said.  </P></p>

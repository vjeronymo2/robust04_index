			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Sizewell critic withdraws concerns THE leading critic of a computerised safety system being developed for the Sizewell B nuclear power station has withdrawn his concern about the design. Professor John Cullyer, professor of electronics at Warwick University and a leading figure in the British Computer Society, says he is satisfied that the Pounds 25m system will be acceptably safe. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate has yet to approve the system, but expects to do so within months. The change of mind by Prof Cullyer, chairman of the society's systems task force, follows a seminar arranged by the Royal Academy and addressed by speakers from Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generating company building Sizewell B. Prof Cullyer said yesterday that more details about the system had been given and he was no longer worried. The society task force, however, was not due to meet for another two weeks. Prof Cullyer could not say whether it would come to the same conclusion. The society has criticised secrecy surrounding the design of the complex computer system, which will be one of the main lines of defence against an accident at Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised-water-reactor nuclear power station. The system, being designed by Westinghouse of the US, involves 300 microprocessors and 98,000 lines of computer software code. Design details will remain secret for commercial reasons.</p>

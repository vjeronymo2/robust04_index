			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Longer dates rise DEALERS IN sterling markets continued to take the view yesterday that UK base rates would be cut again before the summer, writes James Blitz. However, although the rate for one-year sterling cash traded well below 6 per cent yesterday morning, the market took a more cautious view of rate moves after the currency fell below DM2.40 against the D-Mark. In the morning, one-year money was bought as low as 5 3/4 per cent. Also, the Dec-ember 1993 short sterling contract opened at 94.45, which assumed that three-month money at the end of the year would be at 5.55 per cent. That prices in a 50 basis-point cut in the UK by the close of this year. Later in the day, however, several factors forced dealers to reconsider the assumption that there will be big rate cuts this year. There were worries that the currency's weakness against the D-Mark and dollar would endanger the UK chancellor of the exchequer's targets for reducing price inflation. Some dealers also argued that, if base rates did move down to 5 per cent, the chances of another reduction following that one would be very slim because of the dangers of inflation. In other words, 5 per cent base rates would bring back a positive money market yield curve. That assumption was clearly felt by futures dealers as they pushed the December contract down 24 basis points to stand at 94.21 at the close, which assumes that three-month money will be at 5.79 per cent by the end of the year. The June and September contracts priced three-month money in at 5.63 per cent by the close. The futures market is effectively saying that UK base rates may rise in the last three months of this year. The same retracement was seen in the cash market, where the one-year rate rose back to 6 15/16 per cent by the close. Three-month money finished at 6 5/16 per cent from a previous 6 3/16 per cent. The rise was partly due to a big shortage of Pounds 1.3bn in the discount market which proved difficult to remove. The March French franc contract tumbled a further 27 basis points on growing signs that France will find it hard to reduce its official interest rates. Calm surr-ounded the French currency, but the weakness of the punt and the Bundesbank's intransigence over rates have raised new fears.</p>

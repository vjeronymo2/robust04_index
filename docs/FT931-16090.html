			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / W Australia election next month THE Labor government of Western Australia yesterday called an election on February 6, clearing the way for a possible federal election in late February or March. Mrs Carmen Lawrence, the Western Australian premier, said there had been 'no pressure' for a February election from the federal Labor government in Canberra. However, the announcement removes a major obstacle in the way of an early federal poll if Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, decides not to wait until the government's three-year mandate expires in June. Federal Labor officials had feared that the unpopularity of the Western Australian government would hurt the federal government if the state election was delayed until mid-year. Government strategists hope the early state election will allow disillusioned Labor voters to register a protest against Labor before returning to the party in the federal election. Western Australia is likely to be crucial for the federal government, which will need to retain four highly marginal seats in the state to win the federal election. Labor has ruled Western Australia since 1983, but has lost support in the wake of revelations of close relationships between state government officials and Perth businessmen such as Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt former entrepreneur. The so-called 'WA Inc' revelations led to the resignation in 1990 of Mr Peter Dowding, the then premier, and the sacking of Mr Brian Burke, a former Western Australian premier, as Australian ambassador to Ireland. Mr Burke, who led the state party to power in 1983, is expected to appear in court in Perth two days after the election to answer criminal charges relating to the WA Inc revelations. Labor has recovered some support since Mrs Lawrence replaced Mr Dowding but is widely expected to be defeated by the conservative Liberal/National party coalition.</p>

It is in such times that the ability of  government officials, who support the nation, to manage a crisis  matters greatly. Yet the question is whether Japanese officials  have such an ability.  <H5>  Grave Blunder in Economic Measures </H5>   The Japanese economy is about to start a countdown toward  its  destruction. Three years have passed since the "Great Heisei  Recession" started early in 1991 following the collapse of the  "bubble economy". The current slump is certain to be the worst  and the longest recession since the war, lasting longer than the  36-month recession of the second oil shock.    The causes of recessions up to the second oil crisis were  external. It was as though business, in its declining phase in  the cycle, caught an extremely bad cold which developed into  pneumonia.    In contrast, the current "Great Heisei Recession" occurred  because the Japanese economy had become fat through the bubble  economy. It is, so to speak, suffering from adult diseases.  Adult diseases do not worsen suddenly if an accurate diagnosis  is made and proper treatment is given in the early stages. If  one's constitution is improved carefully, the diseases are not  so frightening.    Nevertheless, the authorities' diagnosis of the state of the  economy was definitely wrong, and the cure was always one step  behind. As a result, financial institutions, the heart of the  Japanese economy, have suffered arteriosclerosis because of  their bad loans which are now said to amount to 100 trillion  yen, and the sharp fall in stocks is causing cardiac infarction.    Now, it has come to the point that an economic panic could  happen any time. The Japanese economy now requires crisis  management in the intensive care unit.    The name Masaru Yoshitomi, former director general of the  Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] Coordination Bureau, has to be  pointed out, though this cannot mend the matter now, as the  person responsible for further deteriorating the situation by  making a definitely wrong diagnosis and choosing wrong measures  to deal with the problem. Yoshitomi should be held highly  responsible, because he was not just a mere economist at that  time but the director general of the EPA's Coordination Bureau,  an important post for coordinating economic measures and foreign  economic policies within the government. While I am sorry for  Yoshitomi, his judgment is hopeless because, when the fall of  the economy was evident to everybody in the spring of 1992, he  was still saying publicly, "Where do you see a recession?"  citing the tight labor market.    Corporations and financial institutions' latent profits were  lost in 1990 due to the steep fall of stocks when careless land  loans became bad loans one after another as a result of a sudden  attempt to stop the bubble economy by Bank of Japan [BOJ]  Governor Yasushi Mieno.    Then in 1991, scandals involving securities and financial  institutions came to light successively, withering business  sentiments at once.    Such a trend in the overall economy must have been totally  invisible to Yoshitomi.    In May 1992 when Yoshitomi was repeatedly saying, "How can  you say that we are in a recession when the unemployment rate is  slightly higher than 2 percent and the ratio of job openings to  job seekers is higher than 1:00?," the Business Sentiment Index  of Principal Enterprises in the BOJ's Tankan [Short-term  Business Survey of Enterprises] was 124.    The index is an index of companies that said business is  "bad" subtracted from those who said it is "good." The figure  124 is comparable to the number at the worst period when the  recession brought on by the yen's appreciation in the first half  of 1987 was causing a stir in society.    In spite of such an index, Yoshitomi was attempting to  somehow produce the longest economic growth, exceeding the 57  months of the "Izanagi Boom," during his term in office. Thus,  making an objective diagnosis was downright impossible for  Yoshitomi.    Takao Akaba, former vice minister of the EPA, once said in  an  interview with this writer, "The economy has a long-term big  wave and a short-term wave. This wave was a big one in the  economy's expansion phase. So the wave was still at a high  level even after the economy peaked and was on the downturn.  That explains why the shortage of labor looked serious and  people were confused in thinking that the economy was still  expanding."    A crisis occurred immediately after Yoshitomi insisted, "the  economy is still expanding though its speed has slowed."    From mid to late July 1992, the Nikkei average declined more  than 2,000 yen in ten days, and dipped below the 15,000 yen  level on 11 August.    Although some people think Germany's interest rate hike in  July triggered the situation, the definite statement of Mamoru  Ozaki, who took office as vice minister of the Ministry of  Finance [MOF] in July, that "deficit-covering bonds will not be  issued" had an effect. The market, which had been expecting the  government's pump-priming measures, was disappointed and reacted  negatively.    When the Nikkei average falls below the 15,000 yen level,  financial institutions and business corporations holding  high-priced stocks will have to face enormous losses.    Alarmed by the situation, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  strongly directed the MOF and the BOJ, which had been saying  that the economy was all right, to work out measures to maintain  stock prices and to stimulate the economy.    But, Miyazawa, who advocated a positive financial policy,  and the MOF officials, who put the rebuilding of the  government's finances above anything else, were not getting  along well with each other. Just before settling on the  "economic stimulus package" in August 1992, Ozaki, who had just  become vice minister, is said to have telephoned a certain  out-of-office economist who is close to Miyazawa to ask him to  convey his message to the prime minister. A crisis can never be  handled when the MOF vice minister cannot see the prime minister  in person, and has to ask an economist who is not in the  government to relay his "real intention" to the prime minister.    Anyway, at this time, since the government announced its  "monetary policy for the moment", business operators were  relieved and the market stabilized again. However, this  "tentative policy" was just postponing solving the issue by  allowing, so to speak, "leaving out" losses on accounts in which  the loss of stocks did not have to be redeemed in the September  midterm earnings report, but could be postponed until the  settlement of accounts in March 1993.    Thus gaining time, the government tried to bring the economy  back with the largest ever "pump-priming package," worth 10.7  trillion yen. Although the amount of the package was big, the  "fresh water" contributing immediately to a rise in the economy  was not more than 3 trillion yen. Still, these two policies  were effective temporarily, and the Nikkei average recovered to  the 20,000 level, avoiding a crisis.    However, since the diagnosis was fundamentally wrong, the  policies could only work as first aid. If the economy is young,  possessing potential for growth, it can be revived vigorously by  giving it a nutrient like public works, even if the economy  weakens temporarily due to overproduction. But for the current  Japanese economy, which suffers from adult diseases developed by  gaining fat, providing a nutrient cannot bring back its health.    After all, the economy deteriorated further instead of  getting better, and the MOF only maintained stock prices from  beginning to end by carrying out the so-called PKO (Price  Keeping Operation). That is, the MOF managed to keep stock  prices by buying stocks, using public funds such as postal  insurance and savings, while pressuring life and nonlife  insurance companies not to sell their stocks.    Because of that, the market became a completely managed  market in which dynamic trading was confined, and the market  itself was dead.    Speaking of public funds, not much could be expected based  on  the amount of funds for investment. Also, it was obvious that  the artificial stock prices were maintained by controlling  selling. Also, everyone knew that once the underpinnings were  removed, stock prices would go down.    It is better not to carry out such a measure if the tricks  of  the authorities are so clear.    At that time, MOF senior officials Ozaki; Nobuyuki Teramura,  director general of Banking Bureau; and Tadashi Ogawa, director  general of Securities Bureau, concentrated only on making the  numbers consistent through the PKO because they were afraid the  fall of stock prices would cause the loss of nominal latent  profits, and lead to the failure of financial institutions.    But, they were also trying to expand their colonies using  the  taxpayers' money. The best example is that the MOF sent former  Banking Bureau Director General Masateru Yoshida with a dowry to  the almost failed Hyogo Bank to be its president .    The bud for rebirth can only be seen after what has to be  removed is removed. Nevertheless, since the MOF officials  concealed the actual condition with a stopgap measure, suspicion  and the fear of recession prevailed all the more, shrinking  consumption. In that respect, it cannot be helped if they were  criticized for amplifying the crisis.    At any rate, they had continued to deceive the market, and  Ozaki retired in July 1993. Also, Ogawa was transfered from  being director general of the Securities Bureau to chief of Tax  Bureau. Teramura was left to continue to carry out the makeshift  measures to save the banks.    Ozaki and Ogawa's successors, MOF Vice Minister Jiro Saito,  and Securities Bureau Director General Shohei Hidaka seemed to  continue the stopgap measures.    The listing of JR Eastern Japan stock on 26 October 1993 is  illustrative. The authorities' intention must have been to  direct the desire of the general public, which is naive about  stocks, to the share market by listing the well-known JR Eastern  Japan stock, and thus raise stock prices.    In fact, the market must have been moving according to their  scenario until the initial transaction price of JR Eastern Japan  was pushed up to 600,000 yen, by setting the initial offering  price at 380,000 yen and creating an atmosphere that made the  stock scarce. But, individual investors, who had learned  distrust from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock  case, did not buy.    As a result, only sophisticated semiprofessionals, in  expectation of a high price just after the listing, bought JR  Eastern Japan shares for short-term profitmaking. Because of  that, once the stock reached a high price, the sell orders  flooded in the next day, and JR Eastern Japan stocks fell in  reaction. Since the fast sell orders for the JR Eastern Japan  had swamped the market, the computer broke down and the trading  of the stocks was suspended. Most investors were not able to  sell their JR Eastern Japan stocks even though they wanted to,  and had to hold the falling shares.    In addition to the steep fall of JR Eastern Japan stock,  other stocks declined substantially also. This is because the  semiprofessional investors bought the shares of JR Eastern Japan  by selling their holding stocks, not using new funds. Under  circumstances in which the daily trading volume continues to be  at the 100 million level, one tenth of the volume at the time of  the bubble economy, if JR Eastern Japan stock absorbs 1 trillion  yen from the market, it will immediately be the start of a steep  decline.    This is like forcing a patient to run who is suffering from  cardiac infarction by giving an injection of a stimulant.    November's trading started to fall. The Nikkei average  dropped nearly 3,000 yen in a month, and on 29 November it  temporarily fell below 16,000.    This sudden fall is attributed mainly to the attempt of  financial institutions suffering from the recession to make a  profit by selling stocks while, in a way, strangling themselves.    When the average falls below 16,000, there will be some  banks  which cannot meet the BIS [Bank for International Settlement]  rule. In that case, the average will decline to 12,000 at once,  because investors will sell their stocks at a loss before prices  hit bottom. Then, the latent profits of city banks will be  lost, and the Japanese economy will have heart failure, leading  to a series of large-scale bankruptcies.    While this was a crucial moment for crisis management, there  was still no sign that an economic stimulus package has  materialized.    Do bureaucrats consider the PKO, control of selling, and the  raising of stock prices by listing a new stock, which are  obvious stopgap measures, to be crisis management?    The Japanese economy will be in serious trouble unless  government officials work on crisis management seriously by  cutting out the affected parts and let the pus out, and  sacrifice oneself to carry out deregulation.    The economy has been Japanese officials' strongest area, but  MOF officials, who are supposed to be the most brilliant, are  not able to cope with the structural change at all.    Still, the situation is more serious.    In addition to economic problems, crisis management related  to the nation's security needs more attention, and this is where  the bureaucrats' weakest point is revealed.  <H5>  Farce of Unorchestrated Ministries </H5>   The issues of North Korea's nuclear and economic sanctions  have now become critical.    North Korea continues to reject inspection of its  facilities,  suspected of developing nuclear arms.    Having lost any further means, Hans Blix, director general  of  the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke at the UN General  Assembly on 1 November 1993 to urge North Korea to accept IAEA  inspections. The assembly adopted a resolution, demanding the  inspection of North Korea's nuclear sites by an overwhelming  majority.    On 3 November, immediately following the UN resolution, then  U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, during his visit to Japan,  said, "Economic sanctions are an option if diplomatic means  fail." In other words, taking the issue to the Security Council  and adopting a resolution to impose sanctions against North  Korea is the only alternative left for the IAEA if the UN  resolution is ignored by North Korea. Of course, it depends on  the result of the planned third round of the bilateral talks  between the United States and North Korea.    What will happen if economic sanctions are imposed on North  Korea? "It is a serious matter. If economic sanctions are  adopted by the United Nations, North Korea will take it as a  declaration of war as it has warned repeatedly. Since that  country faithfully carries out what it says, we must expect the  worst-case scenario if economic sanctions are imposed." (Satoshi  Morimoto, senior researcher, Nomura Research Institute).    Morimoto is a specialist who, as former chief of Security  Policy Section in the Foreign Ministry's Information Analysis,  Research and Planning Bureau, supervised "the second operation  room" which specialized in gathering and analyzing military  information at the time of the Gulf war.    "If the worst happens, the effect will be far bigger than  that of the Gulf war. A large number of displaced persons may  come to Japan, and missiles may come flying at Japan. In that  case, local self-governing bodies on the coast of the Sea of  Japan should also prepare for an emergency. At any rate, the  worst case has to be expected and every possible precaution has  to be taken. Imposing economic sanctions on North Korea  requires much preparedness," Morimoto said.    A first-rate crisis management system is needed indeed. The  imposition of sanctions on North Korea inevitably involves the  danger of leading to war. However, what happens if Japan,  fearing the possibility of war, objects to economic sanctions  when the issue is referred to the Security Council? Japan will  be criticized by the international community as the country that  supports North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.    Already, some in the United States are displeased with the  large flow of people, goods, and money going from Japan to North  Korea, and even say that "Japan's money and goods are enabling  the North's development of nuclear arms".  <H5>  Conveying Information to the Prime Minister: A Secret Strife </H5>   As a matter of fact, the United States unofficially asked  Tokyo, "to discuss what kind of contribution is possible for  Japan when economic sanctions are imposed" in the fall of 1992.  But there is no sign that the Miyazawa administration took  concrete actions afterward.    Then early in 1993 the issue of "special inspection" of  the nuclear waste and storage facilities near Yongbyon came to a  deadlock, and in February the IAEA referred the matter to the  Security Council. North Korea, in response, stiffened its  attitude and threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). On 12 March, North Korea  actually announced its pullout from the NPT. The withdrawal  automatically takes effect three months after the announcement.    Once North Korea leaves the NPT, legal grounds to demand  that  it accept nuclear inspections will be lost, and use of force  will be the only means left to stop its development of nuclear  arms. This means imposing economic sanctions, and if this does  not work, then military action will be taken.    On 29 May when the deadline for North Korea's withdrawal  from  the treaty was near, North Korea test-fired a missile toward  Japan. Also, it restricted the entry of foreigners and Koreans  living in Japan, and prepared troops for action, showing an  attitude of not budging an inch.    Since an emergency had occurred in the targeting of Japan, a  crisis management system should have been announced immediately  as a matter of course. However, the government offices  concerned did not even hold a liaison conference, much less  manage a crisis. Each ministry and agency did not try to do  anything to cope with the situation and kept their information  to themselves. Also, the Miyazawa administration, presiding  over such bureaucrats, did nothing either. Even worse, they did  not try to inform the public, while they knew what was going on.    Needless to say, in a democracy, government cannot make any  important decision without gaining a national consensus. To win  a consensus among the people, the right information has to be  provided first.    If a crisis had arisen on the Korean peninsula in late May  1993 while the public had not been informed about it, the  government would have been unable to come up with a single  measure to handle the situation, and Japan would have fallen  into great confusion.    North Korea's test-launch of a missile was made public when  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara "leaked the news at his  own discretion" on 11 June, two weeks after the incident.    This was too late. A situation should not exist in which the  people, as the sovereign, are informed of nothing while Japan's  security is threatened by a crisis. If the bureaucrats had  possessed such a common-sense recognition, each ministry should  have brought in its information to the Cabinet Security Affairs  Office, discussed measures, and informed the people that a  crisis was approaching, even if Prime Minister Miyazawa did not  make any decision, being too cautious.    However it was not until late October, five months after the  missile incident, that the "Joint Council for Information  Liaison and Coordination" was formed, in which the director  general level officials from each ministry brought in and  discussed their information regarding the North Korean nuclear  issue.    Only after that did officials in charge from the MOF, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the  Ministry of Transportation [MOT], as others visit a specialist  to learn about North Korean issues.    Moreover, this "council" is not at all a place to discuss a  scenario for managing a crisis.    Legally, Japan's crisis management is to be handled by the  Security Council of Japan in the cabinet. However, the Security  Council did not meet during the Gulf war to discuss measures to  deal with the situation, though it was onvened to discuss the  mid-term defense program.    The Security Council consists of the prime minister as  chairman, the ministers of foreign affairs and of finance, the  chief cabinet secretary, the chairman of the National Public  Safety Commission, and the directors general of the Defense  Agency and the EPA. Because the council has become a ritualistic  conference to give authority to a conclusion reached in advance  by ministries doing the groundwork, it cannot deal with an  emergency situation.    Under this Security Council is the Cabinet Security Affairs  Office which is for coordinating the ministries' administrative  work related to national defense.    Under this system, this office is responsible for managing a  crisis so the cabinet can cope with an emergency situation.  Naturally, the previously mentioned "Joint Council for  Information Liaison and Coordination" should also be chaired by  the chief of the Cabinet Security Affairs Office to have  ministries submit their top secrets, and evaluate and analyze  them. Then, the results should be reported to the chief cabinet  secretary. Nevertheless, the office is said to have no such  ability nor the power to do so.    "There are no uniformed personnel, who are military  specialists, in the office. So a correct analysis of the  situation cannot be expected. Moreover, all the members of the  office including the chief and the councilors, are on loan from  other ministries, so the views of the central government office  cannot be coordinated." (Sachio Genkawa, former Ground  Self-Defense Forces Eastern District Commanding General).    Thus the "Joint Council for Information Liaison and  Coordination," which should discuss a scenario for crisis  management, has become a place for merely exchanging  information. Since the evils of a vertically divided  administration have clearly come to the surface, the council has  become a place for learning about other ministries' information  while protecting one's own ministry's top secrets.    The ministries' guarding of information to protect their own  interests is quite astonishing. The biggest trouble for the  nation's security is that there are secret strifes in the stages  of conveying information to the prime minister. When the  ministries want to tell the prime minister something, it has to  be relayed through the prime minister's private secretaries.  The judgment of those secretaries is very important because  they manage the prime minister's heavy schedule, and decide the  priority of the information to be conveyed.    Among the five private secretaries, one of them is the  longtime secretary of a politician who became the prime  minister, and the remaining four are career officials sent from  the Foreign Ministry [MOFA], the MOF, the MITI, and the Police  Agency, respectively. Those who are appointed private  secretaries are all considered to be future vice ministers.    These four secretaries are responsible for communicating  with  the prime minister for other ministries besides their own. For  example, a private secretary sent from the Police Agency will  also cover the Ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Welfare,  and the Defense Agency. All ministries and agencies are covered  by the four secretaries. So, it is relatively easier for the  MOFA, the Police Agency, the MOF, and the MITI to keep their  secrets since they can convey information through their own  secretaries.    In contrast, a secret of the Defense Agency, even if it is a  real top secret, will be known by the Police Agency before it is  conveyed to the prime minister. It is all right when the source  of information to be conveyed is clearly identifiable as the  Defense Agency, but if it is not so, then the Defense Agency  will try to relay the information to the prime minister without  going through the secretary from the Police Agency. For  example, the Defense Agency will use a director general  transferred to its Agency from the MOF to influence the  secretary from the MOF.    Then the secretary from the Police Agency, out of suspicion  and fear, will try to obstruct the Defense Agency's  communications with the prime minister....    Although this is about what could happen -- and it does not  mean that it is always the case -- it is problematic because the  above situation is more likely to occur as the importance of the  information increases.    In the Defense Agency, there are also career officials on  loan from the MOFA, the MOF, and the Police Agency. Yet the  true top secrets are said to be conveyed to the prime minister  through an official from the Defense Agency in the Cabinet  Information Research Office which is directly connected to the  chief cabinet secretary so that the secrets will never be known  by officials from other ministries. The situation is far from  discussing a crisis management measure by bureaucrats bringing  in information.    To avoid such secret strifes, the function of the cabinet in  integrating the ministries has to be strengthened.    In fact, there was an attempt to strengthen the cabinet so  that a fair crisis management system could be implemented. In  July 1984, the Nakasone cabinet, in response to the second  provisional committee on administrative reform's report,  integrated the Administrative Management Agency with parts of  the Prime Minister's Office to form the Management and  Coordination Agency. At that time, Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda decided to  strengthen the cabinet's comprehensive coordination function,  since they were worried that crisis management was impossible  under the vertically divided administrative organization.    The late Ichiro Nakanishi, a member of the House of  Councilors, was appointed as minister without portfolio in  charge of crisis management, and the Crisis Management Measures  Office was established under him in which a bold plan to  strengthen the functions of the Cabinet Information Research  Office was drafted.    "Information from all ministries will be coordinated by the  Cabinet Information Research Office..."    Nevertheless, the plan was crushed in an instant by  opposition from all ministries, which were alarmed over the  expanding power of the Cabinet Secretariat.    What can be said when the crisis management system needed  for  protecting the nation was killed due to the ministries' own  interests?    Regarding the imposition of economic sanctions on North  Korea, the MOFA said, "Saying something about it will stir up  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, so we cannot even say  whether we are discussing a measure or not."    The Police Agency also said, "Nothing can be said. If I say  something, that disqualifies me as the person in charge of  crisis management."    Although both ministries seem to have some kind of measures,  the MOFA, the MOF, the Police Agency, the Defense Agency, the  MITI, and the MOT are not cooperating, and they do not seem to  be capable of implementing a comprehensive crisis management  system at this point. Crisis management is for protecting the  nation. It is not something for ministries to fight over based  on their own interests.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Conservative Party has described as the  culmination of the government's total capitulation, the visit of  a high-level Pentagon delegation to help integrate South  Africa's defense forces. In a statement the party's deputy  leader, Dr. Willie Snyman, wanted to know which country in the  world would tolerate a foreign superpower interfering with its  defense force's internal affairs. He was reacting to an  announcement that an American assistant defense secretary, Mr.  Charles Freeman, would lead a 10-member Pentagon team to South  Africa. The delegation is scheduled to meet representatives of  the government, the defense force, the Transitional Executive  Council, the ANC [African National Congress] and other  organizations.</p>

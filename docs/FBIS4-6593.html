			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Minnie Cadlina] </F>   [Text] Senator Ernesto Maceda (NPC-Nationalist People's  Coalition) yesterday urged the government to resume an all-out  war with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's  Army (CPP-NPA), who, he said, are not really interested in  negotiating for peace.    In pushing for the resumption of hostilities with the  CPP-NPA, Maceda said it is time for the government to take a  hardline position with the communist rebels since the peace  talks have been dragging for two years now with no substantial  agreements.    "It has come to a point where we should ask whether we are  getting anywhere with the peace process with the NPA," he said.    Maceda, chairman of the crime committee, made the statement  in reaction to a radio message of "Comrade Roger" Rosal  commander of the Melito Glor Command, accusing President Ramos  of "coddling criminals" in reference to Leopoldo "Comrade  Hector" Mabilangan.    He said Ramos should not let the accusation pass as he urged  the president to order the deployment of six to eight battalions  around Mt. Banahaw in the Sierra Madre mountain "to flush out"  Rosal, who has admitted masterminding Mabilangan's killing.    Mabilangan was sentenced to death by a "people's court"  which  found him guilty of involvement in kidnapping and carnapping  activities.    He said government should stop worrying about committing any  act that would jeopardize the peace negotiation since even the  communist rebels are not interested in pursuing the peace  process.    "I say we scrap it (peace negotiatian) and resume an all-out  war with the NPA," he said.    "They (CPP-NPA) have no public support anyway and they have  become less dedicated in their ways. They have turned to  banditry," he added.    Asked if he was not worried about derailing the peace  process, he said, "what is there to derail? There is nothing  happening."    It would be recalled that Maceda reportedly became a target  of the NPA in 1989 for alleged corruption.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Police may be forced to co-operate on Nadir THE TRUSTEE in bankruptcy to Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, is considering using court orders against senior police officials who, he claims, have failed to co-operate in his efforts to trace assets. The proposed action by Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson Rhodes, came after refusals by the police to answer allegations that they were aware of the location of some of Mr Nadir's assets. Meanwhile, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that it had decided not to bring a case against Mr Nadir in connection with allegations that he had attempted to bribe a senior judge. It said it had concluded that there was 'no credible evidence' to support suggestions that Mr Nadir had attempted to pay Pounds 3.5m to Mr Justice Tucker, who was scheduled to hear his fraud trial last month. The CPS said it had decided not to continue the action following receipt of a report from the Metropolitan Police last Friday at the end of a 'lengthy investigation'. The CPS added that Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher, who are believed to be in northern Cyprus, had made the original allegations of a conspiracy involving Mr Tucker, Mr Nadir, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, who is Mr Nadir's lawyer, and Mr Wyn Jones, suspended assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Ms Welsher admitted a year ago to have held a painting valued at Pounds 400,000 which is claimed by Mr Nadir's trustees and is now believed to have been removed from the UK. The police had contacted Ms Welsher but Mr Cooper said that they refused to provide him with any information on her or the painting's whereabouts during the past year. Under section 366 of the 1986 Insolvency Act, the police could be forced to answer questions. Those covered by the court orders could include Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Glendinning and Mr George Staple, head of the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Nadir was due to face trial last month on 13 charges of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 34m, but he broke his bail conditions and fled to northern Cyprus in May this year. Mr Nadir yesterday accused the British authorities of perverting the course of justice and said he intended to sue the SFO, the director of public prosecutions, Scotland Yard and others.</p>

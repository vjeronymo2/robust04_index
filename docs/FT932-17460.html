			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Danes protest at fish quotas Danish fishermen have called a halt to all fishing as a protest against inadequate EC catch quotas and cheap fish imports from non-EC countries, writes Hilary Barnes from Copenhagen. Fishermen said yesterday they will blockade any ferry companies which allow trucks carrying fish or fish products from Norway and Sweden on board, for transport elsewhere in Europe or to Danish processing factories.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / MMC urged to open household supply market THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission is considering a call from British Gas's competitors for the liberalisation of the household gas supply market in its review of the industry. But this is countered by consumer groups and some North Sea oil producers who urge caution in changing the present structure. In a Financial Times survey of evidence to the commission which is due to present its report to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, on April 30, all of British Gas's main competitors say they want to enter household sales. Many of the regional electricity companies - most of which have set up gas supply arms - are eager to enter the market, but other competitors want a phased introduction of competition. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, suggests a system under which the supply contracts for British Gas's 92 districts are franchised to companies. Most of the gas marketing companies believe it is not necessary to break up British Gas as Sir James McKinnon, the regulator, proposes. But 13 of the 25 main competitors have told the commission that the company's pipelines should be sold. British Gas has suggested hiving off pipelines to a separate subsidiary under its ownership, but this does not go far enough for many competitors. 'We will never be sure that we are paying the same tariffs for transporting our gas along British Gas's pipelines until they are under separate ownership,' said the head of gas sales at one of the regional electricity companies. But other companies such as United Gas, which has supply deals with six regional electricity companies, is urging the commission to decide whether to remove British Gas's mono-poly over domestic sales before it addresses structural changes in the market. Consumer groups such as the Gas Consumers' Council remain sceptical of the benefits from breaking up British Gas and from introducing competition to household sales. The council has told the commission that, while it supports the principle of consumer choice, its view is that 'the domestic gas consumer is well-served by a privatised public gas monopoly in a regulatory system'. Similarly, the Major Energy Users' Council, which represents large industrial consumers, said: 'The market is too large, too complex, too important to all of us to have academic solutions thrust down our throats.' This is a view supported by some North Sea oil and gas producers such as Shell who value the strong purchasing power British Gas has wielded in North Sea gas fields. Other competitors urge caution. 'The domestic market must open up, but we've got to talk through the issues raised about supply obligations and safety,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica. British Gas has argued strongly against opening up the household supply market, claiming that prices would rise rather than fall. It is for the commission to weigh up the arguments for and against liberalising the household supply market and then the government will decide whether to follow its advice. But if it decides against opening up the market, many suppliers will be disappointed.</p>

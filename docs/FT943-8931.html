			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Bank Negara signals end to tough battle Exhausted, bruised and battered, Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has hung up its gloves after a seven-month battle against currency speculators. At the end of last week Bank Negara lifted all remaining restrictions which have prevented foreigners holding short term money in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar. The move applied to a range of monetary instruments, from private debt securities to bankers acceptances, Malaysian government securities to mortgage-backed bonds. The restrictions were the last of a broad package of measures introduced at the beginning of the year to mop up excess funds in the financial system and prevent the build-up of inflationary pressures. Malaysia's buoyant economy and a stock market which rose 98 per cent last year were partly responsible for the big inflows of funds. However, the catalyst for the imposition of restrictions was a sudden rush into ringgit by the world's currency speculators. Ironically Bank Negara itself was the main cause of the sudden appetite for the Malaysian currency. 'It's been a long and tough fight,' said one Kuala Lumpur money trader. 'Many speculators were badly burned when the restrictions came in. But Bank Negara's reputation has taken a bad beating as well.' The trouble began at the end of last year when the central bank bought in large quantities of US dollars to revalue its reserves and reduce year-end book losses caused by the bank's own multi-billion dollar speculation on the foreign exchange markets. In 1992 Bank Negara lost MDollars 9bn (Pounds 2.27bn) in foreign exchange dealings. Forex market losses in 1993 were officially put at MDollars 5.7bn. Senior monetary officials now privately admit that the end-1993 manoeuvre was a serious error. While it boosted the book value of Bank Negara's foreign currency and gold reserves in ringgit terms, it also caused the Malaysian currency to fall sharply - from an average of around 2.54 against the US dollar for most of 1993 to 2.73 early in January. The world's money traders were quick to see an opportunity. They realised what Bank Negara had been doing and, judging that the ringgit was considerably undervalued, waded into the Malaysian currency. As a result Bank Negara faced trouble on two fronts. Not only was it having to mop up yet more amounts of funds coming into the country: it was also in danger of losing control over its own jealously guarded currency. By mid-January Bank Negara was hitting back with the first of a series of restrictions designed to defeat the speculators and 'capture all inflows of funds from abroad.' These included imposing a negative interest rate on foreign held ringgit accounts. The measures sent shockwaves through the currency market with traders moving swiftly to offload ringgit positions. Some were badly burned as they tried to take on Bank Negara. For several weeks the ringgit stayed in the doldrums, only slowly gaining strength on the US dollar. By early June the Malaysian currency had risen to around 2.60 to the US dollar. After the lifting of the final restrictions last Friday the ringgit was trading at around 2.56. However, Bank Negara's victory against the speculators has only been achieved at a considerable cost. The bank's international reputation had received a severe battering due to the foreign exchange fiasco. Imposition of the recent restrictions raised a few eyebrows in the international banking community. Malaysia has prided itself on its liberal and outward looking economic policies. Such restrictions were not seen to be in keeping with worldwide moves towards a more liberal financial regime. Within Malaysia, Bank Negara's moves were blamed for causing nervousness among foreign fund managers. The flow of foreign funds into the Kuala Lumpur market declined sharply in the first few months of this year. Money market analysts say Bank Negara now feels that the currency whirlwind has passed. US interest rates are rising but falling in Malaysia: there is now less foreign demand for the ringgit. 'It's been a difficult time for Bank Negara,' said one Kuala Lumpur merchant banker. 'But then its own actions were in many ways the cause of so many of its problems. I'm sure a few lessons have been learned.'</p>

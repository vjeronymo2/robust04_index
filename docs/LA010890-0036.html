			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY OF PIGS PRESS STRATEGY RULED OUT FOR REAGAN;  </P> <P> MEDIA: RELATIONS WITH JOURNALISTS HAVE BECOME MORE ADVERSARIAL SINCE THE  KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. PRESS SECRETARIES HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR TACK.  </P> <P> When the Iran-Contra affair began darkening the Reagan Administration's  horizon, Ronald Reagan's advisers hoped to calm the political storm by stealing  a page from one of the most famous presidential mea culpas in recent history:  John F. Kennedy's apology for the Bay of Pigs debacle.  </P> <P> As recounted by Reagan press secretary Larry Speakes last weekend at a UC San  Diego symposium that featured 10 former White House spokesmen, Reagan's aides  hoped to duplicate the manner in which Kennedy effectively defused the 1961  controversy by firmly and immediately shouldering the blame for the botched  Cuban invasion.  </P> <P> A quick check of the historical record, however, persuaded the Reagan team that  what had been a brilliant strategy in 1961 would be a dismal failure a quarter  century later -- a difference owing less to distinctions between the two  episodes than to the evolution of a markedly more adversarial relationship  between the press and the White House.  </P> <P> With Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger filling in details, Speakes  recalled how Kennedy had accepted responsibility for the Bay of Pigs but  refused to answer questions about the specifics of the incident on the grounds  that it was "not in the national interest." Indicative of press-presidential  relations of the period, reporters placidly accepted that explanation -- and  Kennedy's popularity subsequently soared.  </P> <P> In the intervening years, however, Vietnam and Watergate introduced "a  flowering of contempt" to the press-presidential relationship, said Ron Nessen,  press secretary for former President Gerald R. Ford. Well aware of reporters'  lessened deference toward the President, Speakes said he quickly realized that  Kennedy's public-relations approach to the Bay of Pigs "just wouldn't fly" for  Reagan and the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> "We attempted to convince the President to say, 'I take full responsibility,' "  Speakes said. "But we knew that in this day and age . . . we would have never  been able to say, 'It's not in the national interest to talk anymore about it.'  We couldn't have gotten away with what Kennedy was able to do 30 years before."  </P> <P> Speakes' explanation of Reagan's handling of the Iran-Contra affair was one of  dozens of insightful, often humorous recitations of how presidents faced  crises, large and small, as recalled by the 10 men who served as their primary  White House spokesmen.  </P> <P> During Saturday's three-hour wrap-up of the unprecedented gathering of press  secretaries from six past administrations, stretching from Kennedy through  Reagan, the former spokesmen discussed their successes and failures at image  management with about a dozen professors, journalists and former White House  officials.  </P> <P> While conceding that the lessons of 1961 must be reevaluated in light of the  dramatic changes in how the press now covers the President, Salinger argued  that Kennedy's unflinching willingness to accept blame for a major failure  remains a valid prototype for responses to controversy.  </P> <P> "If in the first two or three days of the Watergate story, Richard Nixon had  gone on television and said, 'I made a stupid mistake' . . . and he fired a  couple of people, Watergate would have never happened," Salinger said. "It  would have been a thing that would have gone away if he had accepted the  responsibility for it."  </P> <P> Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler, however, dismissed that theory as overly  simplistic. Nixon's response to the burgeoning controversy that grew out of the  break-in at the Democratic national headquarters and ultimately cost him his  office, Ziegler said, was influenced by the lingering impact of earlier or  continuing woes such as the Pentagon Papers case and Vietnam -- in particular,  by the considerable enmity that had developed between Nixon and the press  because of those matters.  </P> <P> Insider anecdotes from the former press secretaries yielded glimpses into  presidential personalities certain to fascinate armchair psychologists.  </P> <P> Lyndon Johnson, for example, insisted on personally approving any statement  issued on behalf of the White House and was infuriated by premature leaks of  Administration actions, sometimes changing planned appointments because of  them, said Bill Moyers, one of his three White House spokesmen.  </P> <P> Once, Johnson, angered by a news story in which a U.S. senator had been mildly  critical of him and searching for a proper reprisal, seized on Moyers'  suggestion that his press secretary publicly label the senator "obstreperous."  When the presidential rejoinder did not play well in the media, a furious  Johnson demanded of Moyers: "Who called him obstreperous?"  </P> <P> "You did!" a startled Moyers replied. To which Johnson shouted: "I can't even  spell the goddamn word!"  </P> <P> One of the more intriguing challenges that faced each of them, the press  secretaries said, involved knowing when to take the President at his word and  when to ignore a presidential command, often issued in the heat of the moment.  Or, to frame the dilemma another way: What should a press secretary do when the  President has a dumb idea?  </P> <P> "We've all faced situations when you need to interpret the President," admitted  Jody Powell, press secretary to former President Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> The consensus among the former spokesmen is that the best approach is to delay  public action on such occasions, stalling in the hope that the President's  anger will pass or his better judgment will return. For example, when Johnson  instructed Moyers to fire a top aide and inform a prominent newspaper columnist  of the dismissal, Moyers did neither. Later, when Johnson asked him what he had  done, Moyers simply said neither man had been home when he tried to call -- and  never heard about the matter again.  </P></p>

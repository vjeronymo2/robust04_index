			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Record UK assistance THE SPECTRE of Black Wednesday returned to the money markets yesterday as the Bank of England provided record assistance of Pounds 3.95bn. The help reflected a gilt repo agreement set up to balance the books following the UK central bank's failed attempt to prop up the pound on September 16, writes Peter John. Aware that the money market was unable to cope with the massive scale of government intervention via normal channels it set up a special gilt repo on September 18. A number of clearing banks were unhappy with the gilt repo rates. That disenchantment meant that a new opportunity offered by the Bank yesterday to roll over funds until February 1 attracted little interest and the Bank was forced to repurchase heavily. However, the early forecast shortage of Pounds 4bn, later revised to around Pounds 3.95bn was successfully taken up prompting one money market operator to comment; 'The system coped particularly well in exceptionally difficult circumstances.' Another said; 'It just goes to show that the daily miracle is still working.' Because of the size of the shortage the Bank was using all the weapons in its armoury yesterday. While it normally offers only short-dated band 1 and 2 bills it was yesterday providing longer dated band 3 and 4 bills. Nevertheless, the size of the shortage, combined with various economic indicators and pressure from overseas banks forced bank rates higher. Dealers responded to hints from Germany that interest rates would not fall further as well as the latest rise in M0, the narrow measure of money, which is seen as removing pressure on the government to cut UK rates. Also, Japanese banks have been, according to at least one dealer, 'voracious takers of funds' ahead of their financial year end and that buying has pushed inter-bank rates above the level that reflects the inflationary trend. The overnight rate was squeezed up to nine per cent at one stage, purely on technical factors, while the more representative three-month money hit 7 7/16 per cent before closing at 7 3/8 per cent. Short sterling was also under pressure with the March contract experiencing heavy turnover of more than 40,500 contracts and moving down 25 percentage points to 93.31, signalling some doubt over a continued fall in interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX TIME  </P> <P> It's that horrible time of year we all know as tax time again. And, as usual, I  begin scurrying around looking for every conceivable and even a few  inconceivable deductions.  </P> <P> If only the IRS and our congressional representatives would think about the  absurdity of the situation. Why, when a taxpayer claims on his/her W-2 form  submitted to the employer what he/she is in fact entitled to, should that  person then have to dig, scrounge and scrape for deductions in order to  compensate for the government's failure to deduct the appropriate revenue from  the beginning?  </P> <P> If the IRS could just say, "OK, you claimed X dependents which you are entitled  to and we took Y dollars from your paycheck. Thank you, we're even."  </P> <P> No. It probably makes too much sense.  </P> <P> JOHN V. FLORES  </P> <P> Colton  </P></p>

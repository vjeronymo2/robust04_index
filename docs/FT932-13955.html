			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Observer: Pecking order What could almost be called an official attempt to put the VAT among the pigeons is being contested by lone Lancastrian Martin Gartside, watched by beady eyes across the UK. Unless he wins his appeal against the tax order Oldham's local council has slapped on his pigeon loft, his fellow fanciers could face similar bills nationwide. The council, for which he works when not serving as secretary of the Border Amalgamation of Racing Pigeon Societies, claims the tax is due because the loft is half a mile from his home. He argues that the loft's inhabitants are properly classed as poultry, and so exempt from the tax. If he didn't prefer to race them, he could kill them and eat them, he says. It remains to be seen whether he is counting his chickens before they are hatched. Although the tribunal hearing the appeal has reached a reserved verdict, no date has been set for the judgment to be handed down.</p>

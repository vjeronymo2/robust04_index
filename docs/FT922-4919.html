			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HunterPrint Pounds 3.85m in loss and warns on year HUNTERPRINT, the specialist printer which new management is trying to turn round, yesterday announced an interim loss and said previous forecasts of profits for the full year were premature. The company, which came close to collapse before a refinancing and management shake-up 15 months ago, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.85m for the 26 weeks to March 31, compared with a Pounds 4.68m loss in the corresponding period. Mr Geoff Eades, who took over as finance director in January, said there was little prospect of a profit for this year. 'We may have raised expectations too early,' he said. Depressed margins, which have remained worse than anticipated, were to blame for the result. Because of recession, large contract printers have entered the spot, or one-off, market in which HunterPrint specialises. Turnover increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 28.8m. Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said order books were 43 per cent higher than a year ago, and new business wins included a 1.5m copies-a-week contract for the Sunday People colour supplement. Operating losses were contained at Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 4.29m). Interest costs were little changed at Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.64m). Borrowings increased slightly to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27m) on shareholders' funds of about Pounds 3.5m. The company was cash negative for the period, although it generated cash during the first quarter. Mr Eades said. Losses per share were 2.15p (3.89p). Again no dividend is being paid. There was a retained loss of Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 4.61m retained loss).</p>

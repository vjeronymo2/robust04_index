			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg nurtures new optimism - The fall in the financial rand has burnt foreign investors in 1992 The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is finishing the year as it started - on an optimistic note. But the optimism is based on fragile fundamentals and the market is still vulnerable to a downward correction. The overall index closed yesterday at 3,303, 12.9 per cent up on the year's low of 2,924 reached on October 16, 11.8 per cent below the high of 3,749 reached on June 5 and about 4 per cent below where the index closed last year. The recovery has been on the back of an 11 per cent rise in the industrial index from the October low, and a 15 per cent rise in the mining-financial index in the same period. Analysts, while not discounting another fast start in January - the overall index rose by 8 per cent in the first two weeks of 1992 - are cautious about the outlook for 1993, with few predicting a real return from equities. If 1992 has been a poor year for local investors, then it has been a disaster for foreigners. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, South Africa has been the worst performer this year in dollar terms, falling by 37.5 per cent. This is wholly attributable to the financial rand, the currency used by foreign investors. The currency ended 1991 at R3.17 to the dollar - a discount of 13.5 per cent to the commercial rand. Concerns about the political situation and a perceived flood of offshore investments by South African companies saw the currency weaken dramatically during the third quarter. Yesterday it closed at R4.76 to the dollar, a discount of 37 per cent to the commercial rand. The features of the JSE during 1992 were twofold: first, the very weak performance of mining and commodity stocks. This trend, reflecting weak growth in the main world economies, was most vividly exemplified, and exaggerated, by the precipitous fall in the price of the market's bellwether stock, De Beers, after the announcement in August of disappointing results and a likely dividend cut. Secondly, the equity market was overshadowed by a very strong bond market, driven by a build-up in liquidity on account of the weak economy, increased cash flows from individuals and institutions, and exchange control. The performance of the market during 1992 can be broken into four phases: a quick start in January, with the gains reversed by April; phase 2, until early June, saw the market rise to its peak; phase 3, until mid-October, saw the market lose 22 per cent from its highs; while phase 4 has been the upturn since October. The market's downward correction, which commenced in June, was an overdue reaction to domestic and international economic gloom, weak international equity markets and the political fragility in South Africa. The puzzle has been its subsequent upturn. In mid-October, there was still a broad consensus that the market was more likely to end the year lower rather than higher. What has changed? Mr Peter Trengove Jones, equity strategist at the stockbrokers Simpson McKie, cites three factors: an improved political mood, with greater evidence of pragmatism from the main players; better than expected economic figures from the US, and Wall Street doing well; and the familiar hothouse effect on the JSE which accentuates change in sentiment. He argues that the market has still got a downside risk in the short term, a view endorsed by Mr Tony Gibson of the Cape-based Syfrets group. He anticipates a downward correction in the first quarter, the likely catalyst being US stocks moving lower on perceptions of an impending interest rate rise. Mr Gibson says he doubts whether equities will outperform the 2-4 per cent real return which a medium-dated gilt will provide in 1993. Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Asset Management says short-term movements of the market have become totally unpredictable. He remains cautious in outlook on account of the uncertain fundamentals. 'To make money out of equities in 1993 you're going to have to be extremely selective,' he says. Foreign investors, after their recent experience, are likely to remain wary. Mr Trengove Jones says investors are only willing to take a punt on the market. He says the mood is very 'hands-off' as far as medium-long term investment is concerned, since the volatility of the financial rand is a 'major turn-off'. Investors are taking the view that even if they read the market correctly, they remain at the mercy of the currency.</p>

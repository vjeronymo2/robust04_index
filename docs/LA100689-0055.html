The court found 11 men and two women guilty of murder, kidnaping and other  crimes during the 36-hour occupation of the La Tablada army base, 16 miles west  of Buenos Aires. Seven others, among them a 64-year-old Capuchin friar, were  sentenced to 10 to 20 years for being accomplices to the 50 guerrillas who  overran buildings at the base.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Construction Spending: Spending for new construction dipped in June but showed  signs of stabilizing after a volatile first half, according to a study by F. W.  Dodge, a financial information division of McGraw-Hill.  </P> <P> Dodge said its index of new construction contracts fell in June to 153 from 156  in May. Spending for new construction totaled $240.72 billion in June, compared  to May's $245.71 billion. Despite the overall decline, Dodge found evidence  that construction spending was leveling off after having fallen to a four-year  low in April as builders found financing harder to come by.  </P></p>

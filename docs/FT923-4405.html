			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Europe stays out of step THE European 'triumphs' of the past few days will look very odd in the history books. First the Bank of England reminded us that it still has some of its old, low cunning, got out the banners and the brass band, and went long on sterling. The markets cheered. This gesture is meaningless in economic or even in financial terms. The effect of the official currency borrowing is exactly the same as the effect of using our own reserves, or even of leaving the Germans to use theirs, as they are obliged to do under the EMS arrangements: it saves interest, but will lose on capital if sterling is revalued. However, it knew its markets: they were longing for anything, even an empty gesture, to celebrate. This might have made a nice curtain-raiser for the finance ministers' meeting in Bath had not the US produced some simply dreadful employment figures, and cut dollar interest rates still further. But the ministers could not allow this reminder of reality to disturb their agenda. Despite a possible triple-dip across the Atlantic, and the EC's sharp downward revision of its own modest growth forecast, the ministers agreed to make things worse. They accepted an unchanged German policy of sado-monetarism as a concession, and agreed to go on trying to deflate any 'weaker' economy which still shows some signs of life. Not one word about growth. It could almost be a plot to secure a French Non, and save a lot of ministers from having to eat a lot of words. This collective obsession with the problems of the 1980s would be easier to understand if it were general; it is hard to break out of a world consensus. The fact is, though, that the consensus has moved, and the change will in due course make European policy intolerable even to its authors. The Americans have for several years pursued a determined policy of devaluation  -and this remains quite explicit. After the rate cut on Friday, a Fed governor was on hand to explain to the Press that this would further weaken the dollar, and so help exports. Competitive devaluation was the standard slump remedy of the 1930s. In those days it was a zero-sum game; now it is unilateral, and moderately effective, because nobody else is joining in. It has not yet produced a strong US recovery, partly because European demand is falling even faster than the US can gain competitiveness; the US machine tool industry, for example, recently reported a 30 per cent fall in export demand, although home orders are rising. But the US still enjoys some growth, despite flat incomes, swingeing defence cuts, and a debt crisis. What is more, US inflation is still falling. The US authorities seem to remember what they learned in first-year economics: that in a recession, devaluation does indeed change the terms of trade. This truth is denied to our own gurus, still guided by models full of data from a different age. They should go back to school. A different example is being set on the other side of the world: the Japanese have rediscovered Keynes. The Y10,700bn Comprehensive Economic Measures announced the week before last are the real thing, much more ambitious than expected. This is an emergency package designed above all, admittedly, to save the banking system; but it is also liable to transform the economy. For the Japanese Ministry of Finance this marks a U-turn on a truly heroic scale - something which makes the Volcker monetary relaxation of 1982 look cautious and half-hearted. It shows, not for the first time, that the Japanese system can change strategy sharply when required. The US central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole last month, which concentrated on growth strategies, was a straw in the same wind of change, which would soon turn to action if Clinton wins. Europe, though, is likely to sit this one out, too uncompetitive to share in a US recovery, irrelevant to a Japanese infrastructure programme, and too depressed internally to mount its own recovery. Sooner or later the pfennig will drop. Until then, aggressive international diversification looks like the cautiously responsible policy.</p>

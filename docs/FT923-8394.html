			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UN told of extensive human rights violations by Iraq THE United Nations Security Council was scheduled last night to hold a special session to hear charges of massive violations of human rights by Iraqi forces against the country's Shia population in the southern marshlands. The Council was expected to consider despatching UN observers to the area to maintain continuous monitoring but this would require Baghdad's co-operation. Mr Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister now serving as a UN rights investigator, recommended in an interim report last week that 'some credible mechanism' be established to ensure that the Iraqi government halted the repression. Acting alone and making occasional visits to the country, he could not himself adequately fill that role. A positive response by the government to the proposal would indicate a commitment to stop the violations and refusal could only increase fears that the attacks would continue. Mr van der Stoel, who was to testify at the Council meeting, said there was convincing evidence of heavy shelling of Shia villages. Measures to stem the assaults were 'of utmost urgency.' The western powers accused Iraq of ignoring a 16-month-old Council resolution condemning mistreatment of civilians and called for an end to all repression, including human rights violations against Kurds.</p>

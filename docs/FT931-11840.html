			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Still standing after all these years: The City Corporation survives because of its medieval flummery serves a practical purpose Once again the City of London is in the dock. It is being forced to defend one of the most bizarre yet integral of its institutions: the City Corporation. The corporation - the local authority for the 'square mile' - fears that the home secretary's plans to amalgamate Britain's small police forces could spell doom for its constabulary, the smallest in the country. Such alarm has always been misplaced in the past, but it is resisting tenaciously all the same. The City Corporation is a remarkable relic of a bygone age. It lives on because its medieval flummery serves a practical purpose - selling the nation and City; and because its instinct for survival, and enlightened use of its wealth, has kept it one step ahead of its pursuers. 'Looking at the three great medieval institutions left in England,' says Mr Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Unit at the London School of Economics, 'I would stake money on the City Corporation outliving the monarchy and House of Lords. It's amazingly resilient in its own defence.' If the corporation did not exist, no one would think of creating it. In Dickens's day, more than 100,000 lived cheek-by-jowl in the stinking City lanes and alleys he immortalised. Nowadays, the square mile has only 5,000 residents, largely yuppies and executives with pieds-a-terre in the Barbican complex. No other inner London borough has fewer than 135,000 residents; and neighbouring Westminster has to service at least as many commuters as the City. To govern its 5,000, the corporation has 132 common councilmen and 25 aldermen (the latter elected until retiring age), a ratio which if applied to Birmingham would yield 31,000 councillors (it has 117). A number of antiquated franchises give non-resident businessmen votes, and even allow members of the City's 100 livery companies - successors of 11th-century religious and social fraternities - a voice in the selection of the Lord Mayor. All of which makes the corporation an easy object of ridicule. But, says Mr Travers, 'as a provider of local services, it is a model to which other councils ought to aspire; and it has to be seen as a national, as much as a local, institution.' In its local authority capacity, the City runs a primary school. It has an excellent library service, including a dedicated business library. Its 800-strong constabulary is the ultimate in community policing, and is widely acknowledged to have a first-rate fraud squad. If its planning committee is not short of critics, royal and common, controversies such as that over Paternoster Square are not unusual for councils regulating development in sensitive historical areas where people still have to work. But even with the City's health service and the Old Bailey, both of which it manages, the corporation's responsibilities hardly justify a separate local authority. Most of its claim to existence depends upon its wider role in London and the state. Its assets are tradition and wealth. The ancient ceremony, complete with tricorn hats, costumes, even swords and axes, which adorn every mayoral function at Guildhall and Mansion House - the latter currently undergoing a Pounds 20m restoration - are an established part of British state pageantry. The Lord Mayor spends his year in office entertaining and being entertained. 'That, more than anything, exemplifies the uniqueness of the City; we arrange it all closely with the Palace and the Foreign Office,' says Mr Adrian Barnes, the Corporation's Remembrancer, a kind of master of ceremonies. With tradition comes influence of sorts. Abroad, the Lord Mayor is often mistaken for 'Mr London'. Since no one else but the environment secretary can claim that title, it gives no offence. Last year's Lord Mayor, Sir Brian Jenkins, spoke out for Maastricht's proposed European Central Bank to be located in London, taking the City's case to Brussels and across the continent. The corporation is more cautious about projecting itself at home. It kept its head down in the 1980s, anxious to avoid the political cross-fire over the abolition of the Greater London Council. However, under the leadership of Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of its important policy and resources committee since last year, the corporation has taken a higher profile. Its latest initiative is a 'one-stop shop' for potential overseas investors in the capital, an idea it is pioneering with Westminster and the Docklands Development Corporation. As to wealth, the corporation owns more than a quarter of all the property in the square mile, and has a large portfolio beyond (about 900 properties in all). With a private income of Pounds 33m this year, it has ample scope to play the benevolent patron. Furthermore, relative to the size of its resident population, its local tax income - which is separate from its private income - is far larger than that of other authorities. For uniquely, it is not obliged to put all its income from non-domestic rates into the national pool, a privilege worth Pounds 32m last year. The corporation distributes its largesse to causes accumulated over a century and more. The oldest are its three food markets - Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for meat, Billingsgate for fish - for which the City has been responsible since the Middle Ages. It met a large part of the bill for moving Spitalfields to Leyton, and Billingsgate to Docklands, and is spending Pounds 40m on upgrading Smithfield to meet EC hygiene standards. Of more recent origin are the City's various schools. The corporation owns and manages three public schools, including the City of London Schools for Boys and Girls, for both of which it has built new premises in the past 20 years. It is also owner-governor of the internationally renowned Guildhall School of Music and Drama, which takes 700 students from 40 countries. Then there are 9,000 acres of forests, commons and open spaces in and around London. Epping Forest, Burnham Beaches, Highgate Wood, Queen's Park, West Ham Park and various commons in Kent and Surrey all sport the City logo. They are mostly acquisitions of the 1870s and 1880s, when the corporation, anticipating the Green Belt movement, acted to safeguard open spaces on the fringes of the capital, securing an Act of Parliament giving it power to acquire land within 25 miles of the City for the 'recreation and enjoyment' of the public. Hampstead Heath's 700 acres are the latest addition, a share of the former GLC's spoils. It was a shrewd move by the City: in its first year it footed Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 2.4m bill for the heath's upkeep, which other boroughs could have ill afforded. The jewel in the City's Crown is the Barbican Centre. Opened 20 years ago, its assemblage of theatres, art galleries, cinemas, concert halls, bars and restaurants is London's largest art forum. The corporation funds the Barbican to the tune of Pounds 11m a year, plus repayments of nearly twice that on capital. It also subsidises the centre's two resident companies - the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Shakespeare Company - by about Pounds 2.5m this year on top of their state funding. Like all patrons, the corporation's relationship with its proteges is often tense. Relations with the RSC have been particularly frosty: Baroness Detta O'Cathain, the Barbican Centre's director since 1990, spent much of her first year in a war of words with Mr Terry Hands, the RSC's then artistic director. But the baroness, used to fraught negotiations from her previous job managing the Milk Marketing Board, lauds the corporation as patron. 'They are not obsessed with continuously packed houses,' she says. 'We can afford to be both Classic FM and Radio Three.' Last month, the entire centre was devoted to a festival of Scandinavian arts - an artistic and box office success, but requiring large subsidies, including a Pounds 300,000 grant from the City Corporation. The Barbican, too, is undergoing refurbishment at the corporation's expense. One of the baroness's main concerns is to give the centre a proper entrance. The most complex maze in London, it currently has 123 ways in and out but no identifiable entrance or intelligible signposts. Much the same could be said of the corporation itself. With wealth, tradition, and a myriad of functions and activities, it is more than the sum of its heterogeneous parts, and has friends in most corners of the Establishment. Says Mr Travers: 'If it survived the 1980s, the corporation should have no problem with the next seven centuries' - with or without a police force.</p>

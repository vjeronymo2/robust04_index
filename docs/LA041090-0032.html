			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> CAL STATE BOARD TO REVIEW PAY HIKES  </P> <P> A month earlier than previously announced, the California State University  Board of Trustees next week will review the large and controversial pay raises  for 27 top university officials -- including the 43% salary hike, to $195,000 a  year, given to Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds. Trustees are to meet in special  session at the Oakland Airport Hilton on April 20, the day after a committee  meeting on the issue at the same location.  </P> <P> Those raises, which took effect Jan. 1, have been denounced by faculty,  students and the state legislators for their size and the secrecy surrounding  them. Cal State officials contend that the raise for Reynolds and the hikes  between 21% and 28% for the other administrators bring salaries in line with  those at comparable institutions around the country.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent dances to a transatlantic rhythm BOURSES danced to overseas tunes yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. With the painful exception of Milan they rose on overnight performance on Wall Street and in Tokyo, kicked up further on a good start for the Dow yesterday, then subsided as the Americans took a slightly harder look at their own problems. FRANKFURT was strong in the pre-bourse, higher at the close with an apparent accent on dividend plays, and showed some strength in the afternoon on a strong bond market before the fall on Wall Street brought prices back again. Institutional investors were slow to move, but turnover climbed from DM5.5bn to DM6.5bn as the FAZ index rose 4.41 to 699.74 at midsession, and the DAX put on 12.35 to 1,768.61 at the close. The apparent dividend plays were Volkswagen and Mannesmann, up DM102.0 to DM388.50 and DM9.80 to DM302 at the close. VW went ex a DM11 dividend after hours and fell to around DM374 in the post-bourse; Mannesmann, which does not go ex until Monday, held its ground. However, Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler observed that earlier weakness in VW this week had also been blamed on the dividend - that foreign shareholders did not want it since a tax credit makes it more valuable to German shareholders - and said that yesterday's rise was also merited on yesterday's slightly higher first-half profits, and the prospect of cost reductions in the second half. The other headline stock of the day was Deutsche Bank, up DM9.10 to DM706 at the close, DM709 in the early afternoon on bond price gains and back to DM704 later as Wall Street took its toll. PARIS had a volatile day, breaking above 1,900 momentarily on news of a cut in US interest rates which sent the bond market sharply higher. But Wall Street's equally fast drop sent share prices spiralling down by the close. The CAC 40 index closed 7.40 lower at 1,873.52 in improved turnover of FFr2.96bn. Generale des Eaux was the most active issue of the day, rising FFr14 to FFr2,229 in 290,480 shares. A block of 200,000 shares was crossed at FFr2,190. Elf, ex dividend, dropped a net FFr8.60 to FFr351.50. Paribas gained FFr5 to FFr349.90 on news that it would make a profit from the sale of its stake in Matra Communication. The luxury goods group, LVMH, continued to fall, losing FFr18 to FFr3,761, as investors were worried about the gloomy outlook for the industry. MILAN continued to slide as domestic investors continued to sell, worried by the weakness in the bond market and by growing currency devaluation fears. Dealers also reported residual foreign selling, and spoke of a 'crisis of confidence' in the stock market. The Comit index fell 6.24 to 444.51, its lowest since February 1988, in turnover estimated at L90bn after L99.3bn. Fiat dropped L125 to L5,090 at its official close and fell to L5,045 later on. Italgas lost L3 to L2,799 in spite of notes from several brokers reassuring investors that gas supplies from Algeria were unlikely to be disrupted. The stock sank to L2,765 later. ZURICH rose on active demand for chemicals, and insurers on hopes that Swiss interest rates would follow those in the US. The SMI index closed 9.3 higher at 1,854.6. Ciba-Geigy led the active list on foreign buying, the bearers rising SFr14 to SFr679; Roche certificates added SFr30 to SFr3,370. Insurers were led higher by Zurich certificates, SFr21 firmer at SFr874. AMSTERDAM was unable to resist the downward pressure coming from Wall Street and surrendered most of its early gains. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.2 at 122.8. The brewer Heineken was the day's best gainer, closing Fl 1.40 ahead at Fl 168.70 but volume was thin. MADRID held on to close 0.60 higher at 236.05. Constructions stayed weak according to Mr Peter McGahan of Schroder Securities, banks offered a little encouragement with both rises and falls, and the mainstay was Telefonica which ended Pta25 better at Pta1,090. Asturiana Del Zinc was quoted Pta275 higher at Pta2,125 after Wednesday's apparent Pta800 fall, but Mr McGahan said that the latter move was due to the company going ex-rights. STOCKHOLM decided that it was technically oversold and the Affarsvarlden General index rose 10.5 to 917.4 after several days of decline in low turnover and waning interest. Skandia, the insurer, a poor performer in the first six months of this year, recovered SKr4.50 to SKr103, compared with Monday's low of SKr94, on rumours of an imminent solution to the prolonged issue of the Norwegian company, Uni-Storebrand's stake in the Swedish company. OSLO slipped to a new 1992 low, depressed by continued concern about interest rates in Norway and weak corporate earnings. The all-share index fell 2.7 to 393.2 in turnover of NKr174m. Uni Storebrand A shares remained weak, losing NKr1 to NKr30. ISTANBUL slumped in heavy profit-taking after eight days of gains which brought the index close to its five-month high. The 75-share index ended at 4,244.66, down 197.94.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1136.30  1137.98  1138.44  1137.53  1137.45  1138.12  1140.45  1134.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1140.95            Day's Low  1133.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jul 1       Jun 30        Jun 29        Jun 26        Jun 25    1132.36     1139.30       1141.48       1145.05       1148.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEE FOR RAZING LOW-COST LODGING ON COAST  RISES  </P> <P> Property owners who want to demolish low-cost lodging in Santa Monica's coastal  zone, which includes nearly all properties between Ocean Avenue and the beach,  will have to pay $8,000 per room to do so under a new ordinance recently passed  by the City Council.  </P> <P> The fees will go into a fund that would be made available to groups that want  to develop low-cost lodging in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The ordinance defines low-cost lodging as rooms costing less than $80 per  night.  </P> <P> Councilman Ken Genser abstained from the discussion and the vote because he is  employed by American Youth Hostels Inc., which has applied for low-cost lodging  subsidies in the past. The measure was approved by a 4-2 vote, with council  members Christine Reed and Herbert Katz voting against it.  </P> <P> The state Coastal Commission, which regulates building in coastal zone areas  throughout the state, has a $5,000-per-room fee in effect, and gives such fees  collected within Santa Monica to the city for development of low-cost lodging.  City Manager John Jalili said the council would have to receive commission  approval to implement the new fee.  </P></p>

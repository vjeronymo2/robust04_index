			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / French shipyard confirms Swan bid Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French shipbuilder, last night confirmed it intends to make an offer to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipyard which has been in receivership since May. The French company recently beat Swan Hunter in the fight for a Pounds 50m Oman patrol boats order. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of English subsidiary CMN Support Services, said: 'We intend to make an offer subject to the preconditions being sorted out.' It was hoped to keep on most of the present workforce.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NESTLE'S NEW ACCENT;  </P> <P> FOOD: THE COMPANY WILL CONSOLIDATE ITS U.S. OPERATIONS UNDER A NEW LEADER, THE  FORMER CARNATION PRESIDENT. THE IDEA IS TO COMPETE BETTER WITH THE GIANTS.  </P> <P> Grocery shopping would probably fail to show up on a typical teen-ager's Top 10  List of Things to Do. But for a young Tim Crull, shopping for food was  something to look forward to.  </P> <P> "As a teen-ager, I used to love to go to supermarkets. I'd go shopping for my  mother. I still go to the stores . . . looking for what's new. To me it's part  of the game."  </P> <P> These days, the 59-year-old president of Carnation Co. is a player in one of  the toughest games around: the $475-billion U.S. food industry.  </P> <P> Beginning tomorrow, Crull becomes an even more formidable opponent as he takes  charge of the far-flung companies -- including Carnation, Stouffer Foods and  Hills Bros. Coffee -- that make up the U.S. holdings of Swiss foods giant  Nestle.  </P> <P> Nestle, by combining its U.S. subsidiaries under one corporate umbrella, hopes  to create a company large and diverse enough to survive in the food industry  big leagues during the 1990s.  </P> <P> While the consolidation may be a long and complicated process that could result  in layoffs, industry analysts say the move will help Nestle regain lost ground  in some key businesses and remain competitive in the tougher times that lie  ahead.  </P> <P> Despite more than $6 billion in annual sales, Nestle USA is dwarfed by giants  such as ConAgra, with 1989 sales of $15.5 billion, and Phillip Morris' Kraft  General Foods subsidiary, the nation's largest food firm, with more than $22  billion in revenue during 1989.  </P> <P> "Nestle is starting to realize that results have been somewhat sluggish in the  U.S.," said food industry analyst Nomi Ghez at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. "They  have not been taking full advantage of their size.  </P> <P> "Reality is forcing them to look at these opportunities more aggressively. They  have very strong brands in the U.S., but in the last two or three years, they  have been losing market share in very important categories."  </P> <P> Some of the lost ground has come in the frozen food area, where Stouffer's Lean  Cuisine has been battling inroads made by ConAgra's Healthy Choice line. In the  coffee business, Nestle's Hills Bros. division contends with an increasingly  aggressive Kraft General Foods.  </P> <P> The Friskies Pet food division has come under severe competitive pressures  lately, analysts say. Carnation's foray into the infant formula business has  also fizzled, and the company, over the objections of pediatricians and  advocates of breast feeding, will begin advertsing its Good Start formula  directly to mothers, beginning in January.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Nestle, like other food companies, must cope with a recession  after the boom years of the last decade.  </P> <P> "The '80s were a very awesome time for the food industry," said Ronald B.  Morrow, a food and tobacco industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;  Co. "In the '90s, costs are increasing. Some areas (such as cereals) are  slowing down. It will not be as robust as the '80s."  </P> <P> Timm F. Crull, an easygoing man who joined Carnation in 1955, knows of the  challenges and is preparing Nestle USA and its employees for them. The move  toward a more aggressive, fast-lane approach is reflected at Carnation's new,  post-modern headquarters in Glendale, where employees are still trying to  figure out the meaning of avant-garde works created by California artists.  That's a big departure from the prints of Carnation ads that decorated the  walls of the company's former Wilshire Boulevard home.  </P> <P> "It's a statement of what our company is and wants to be," Crull said of the  company's bold new tower and works of art. "The art here is to give our  employees a creative environment to work in."  </P> <P> As chief executive officer of Nestle USA, Crull will oversee the single largest  national market for Nestle, which had worldwide sales of nearly $31 billion in  1989. While Crull minds the food business, Chairman James M. Biggar will tend  to the Wine World division and Stouffer Hotels &amp; Resorts.  </P> <P> Nestle's much-applauded consolidation efforts have already begun. Last June, it  consolidated all its food service divisions at the Glendale office. It is now  in the process of merging the distribution networks.  </P> <P> "Nestle has many sales forces in the United States," Crull said. "Do we need  seven sales forces or can we do it better with two or three? These will be  things we will review."  </P> <P> So far, no employee has lost a job as a result of the consolidation. But Crull  says he cannot guarantee jobs in the long run. "We don't really know" if people  will be laid off, he said.  </P> <P> The advantages of Nestle's efforts outweigh any short-term difficulties,  analysts say. Kraft and General Foods, for example, were able to cut costs by  $300 million to $400 million the first year after their merger. A larger,  consolidated operation "also gives you more muscle with the (retail) trade and  better chance to get shelf space," said Ghez.  </P> <P> Crull is eager to begin reaping the benefits of consolidation. "By putting them  together, we will have a lot of synergies that will make us a lower-cost  producer. It will also give us more advertising dollars that will make us more  competitive with the Procter &amp; Gambles and the Kraft General Foods  companies."  </P> <P> Besides cutting costs, Crull seeks other advantages. "We can move the strong  brands into other areas, which is more difficult to do when you have separate  companies. Stouffers is very strong in the frozen food business, but there is  no reason why they can't be in the refrigerated business, which Carnation has  done very well with, with their Contadina Fresh."  </P> <P> In fact, the Contadina line of refrigerated pastas and sauces has been a major  success for Carnation, proving highly popular with young consumers who crave  fresh, gourmet-type meals but lack the time and skills. Industry sales of  refrigerated items total about $400 million and are growing rapidly, Crull  says.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a lot of growth in refrigerated," Morrow said. "So there is  a lot of potential right there. That's kind of the future for Carnation."  </P> <P> Nestle USA's research and development operation will become more focused on  coming up with such products as Contadina Fresh -- originally developed by a  company that Carnation acquired -- that take advantage of changing demographics  and lifestyles.  </P> <P> Despite spending millions on research, food companies can still lag consumer  behavior, as Carnation discovered. In developing the Contadina Fresh line,  Crull said, researchers first believed that consumers would heat the sauce in a  pan. Instead, they popped it into the microwave to cut down on the estimated 12  minutes it takes to prepare a Contadina meal.  </P> <P> As a result, Carnation researchers repackaged a sauce container more suitable  for the microwave.  </P> <P> "American lifestyle is like a treadmill -- it gets faster and faster and  faster," said Crull. "People want that convenience to the point where they are  almost willing to sacrifice taste and quality. It's our responsibility to  develop products that maintain or improve taste and quality while giving them .  . . convenience."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NESTLE FACTS  </P> <P> Nestle S.A.  </P> <P> 1989 sales: $30.6 million  </P> <P> 1989 profit: $1.5 billion  </P> <P> Employees: 196,940  </P> <P> Factories: 421  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nestle USA  </P> <P> Annual sales: $6 billion to $7 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major divisions: Carnation  </P> <P> Brands: Carnation, Friskies pet food, Contadina, Coffeemate, Buitoni  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major divisions: Neslte Foods  </P> <P> Brands: Quik, Nestle Crunch, Nescafe, Nestea, Taster's Choice  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major divisions: Stouffer Food  </P> <P> Brands: Stouffer's frozen foods, Lean Cuisine  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major divisions: Hills Bros.  </P> <P> Brands: Hills Bros., MJB, Chase &amp; Sanborn  </P></p>

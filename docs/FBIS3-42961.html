			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Dreving: "President Approved Changes in </F> Government Staffing"]    [Text]    President Lennart Meri, in his presentation before  Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] yesterday, said that he will  confirm all the ministerial appointments submitted by Prime  Minister Mart Laar, even though he has reservations about the  proposed `overhaul' of the government.    Before signing the document, Lennart Meri said that, in  these  critical times, state interest must prevail over personal and  factional considerations. The president linked this requirement  to the NATO summit meeting taking place at Brussels.    The president said that innovations in the government have  been made at the wrong time and in the wrong manner.    Meri signed the resolution on changes in government staffing  at the lectern in front of Riigikogu. The president preferred  not to take questions from members of the parliament.    The president's statement to Riigikogu in connection with  the  overhaul in the government's staffing is published in full in  today's issue of PaEVALEHT.  <H5>  Mart Laar: President's Speech Made Several Valid Points </H5>   Prime Minister Mart Laar said at the press conference that  he  still does not know if `the president has declared war on him  him or not.'    "I have not declared war on the president," Laar maintained.    Laar also recalled that at meetings held between the prime  minister and representatives of parliamentary factions, before  the government `overhaul' took place, "the president did not  express his opinion in such scathing tones."    "The president's speech in Riigikogu made a number of valid  points, especially those referring to the tug-of-war between  Estonia's fictional characters Andres and Pearu," Laar conceded.    At the same time, Laar did not agree with the president's  contention that the `overhaul' was undertaken at the wrong time,  and in the wrong manner. Even presuming that Estonia is in for  tough times, it would still be better to face them with a  government that works in harmony, cooperates efficiently with  the parliament, and can pass all resolutions effectively," the  prime minister opined.    "We still have huge gaps in our legislation," the prime  minister said. Laar referred to the lack of several laws that  would guarantee the balance of powers and added that passing the  law for regulating the president's duties, now up for its second  reading in Riigikogu, and the peace-time law of state defense,  would make it possible to resolve the issues now being debated.    Commenting on the crisis that ensued, Laar said that even  legal experts from Germany had pointed out deficiencies in  Estonia's constitution.    "This is why it is possible that some changes will have to  be  made in the constitution," Laar said.</p>

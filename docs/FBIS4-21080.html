These  operations, carried out as part of the permanent campaign to  eradicate drug crops that is under way nationwide, were reported  by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic yesterday.    The institution of federal justice noted that its local  office in Durango State had reported the manual destruction by  federal agents of two poppy plantations on an area of 10,000  square meters in the community of Metates, part of the  municipality of Santiago Papasquiaro.    It added that an average of 10,000 plants with bulbs ready  for scoring, and, consequently, for collection of opium gum,  were detected on that site.    The Attorney General's Office announced that the Guerrero  local office had reported the discovery of a plantation of the  same drug in a ravine called "Paseo de la Noche Triste," in the  vicinity of the settlement of Polixtepec, in the municipality of  Leonardo Bravo. Covering approximately 40,000 square meters, its  plants were also ready for scoring, and for procuring opium gum.  The latter is the base for heroin, a drug considered 10 times  more powerful than cocaine.    The office added that, according to estimates made by the  federal agents, approximately 400,000 poppy plants were growing  on the site.    It also noted that, in a simultaneous operation carried out  in the same community, Federal Judicial Police agents discovered  and eradicated another poppy plantation growing on an area of  10,000 square meters and containing an average of 100,000 bushes.    The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, which was informed  of  the aforementioned cases, claimed that on the latter farm, about  300 meters from the first one, a man identified as Victor  Gonzalez Luna was arrested. He was the owner of the land and the  one guarding the crops.    Finally, it was reported that, based on preliminary  investigation 18-CHI-94, Gonzalez Luna was remanded to the  pertinent judicial authorities as a person presumed guilty of  crimes against health in the form of poppy growing, and any  others that might result.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Labour warning on council tax EXTENSIVE appeals against the valuations carried out for the council tax are likely to dog the introduction of the new property-based tax next April, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow local government minister, warned yesterday. Publishing the valuation figures for each district authority, Mr Straw said that the combination of being able to make easy comparisons between houses and of the notable differences between the bills each band would face provided much more of an incentive to appeal than any time under the former rates system. Even if those appeals were rejected, the prospect of appealing increased the risk that people might delay paying the tax until they were certain what band their property would fall into, Mr Straw said. Labour warned that confidence in the valuations would be diminished by the wide range of overestimates and underestimates in the original figures released last year compared with the most recent valuation figures. The most recent figures, were provided last week by the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities after the Department of the Environment had decided not to release them. Underestimates are most notable in urban areas. In total, 45 English councils have total property valuations on which the tax will be based that are 10 per cent or more below the government's earlier figures. Nine councils in England have a total 15 per cent or more above the 1991 estimate, and a further 25 have a total 10 per cent or more higher than expected earlier.</p>

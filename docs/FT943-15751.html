			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (6): Supporters' clubs score a victory - Robert Graham examines a political transformation The idea of a successful political movement calling itself after a football slogan would have been laughed out of court a year ago. But today almost one in three voters are supporters of Forza Italia (Come On Italy]). The movement was spawned in January by Mr Silvio Berlusconi as the vehicle for the media magnate's political ambitions; and this is essentially what it remains. Forza Italia has yet to define itself as anything other than a Berlusconi supporters' club run by former members of his Fininvest business empire. Is Forza Italia then the harbinger of a new political phenomenon - a 'light' party? Ideologically bland, it has moved where Mr Gianni Pilo, Mr Berlusconi's pollster, has identified the electoral preferences to be. The emphasis is shifting away from the interplay of parties to the satisfaction of voters' needs. Compared to the traditional concept of Italian parties with their highly politicised and cumbersome party machines, Forza Italia carries little baggage. If the new premier sustains his popularity, Forza Italia could be the catalyst that welds together all the heterogenous forces in the centre and on the right. Its financial resources, backed by Mr Berlusconi's fortune, give Forza Italia a lead over all its rivals. The Forza Italia coalition will be one of the two future blocs that many observers see as the inevitable consequence of Italy adopting a first-past-the-post voting system. The other bloc will be a broad left or centre-left alliance. The process began in the March 27-28 general elections which were essentially between the 'Freedom Alliance' of Forza Italia, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI-National Alliance on the one hand and the six-party Progressive Alliance on the left. The centre parties were squeezed. If Mr Berlusconi's bid for political power had failed, Forza Italia would have probably disappeared as quickly as it arose. But the party picked up over 20 per cent of the vote and increased this to 30 per cent in the June elections for the European parliament. The addition of some 10 percentage points of the vote in less than two months is the single largest swing in Italy's postwar history. Until the March elections Italy was unique in western Europe for the near-absence of a floating vote and the electorate's loyalty to its chosen parties. For instance, the Christian Democrats and Italian Communist Party (PCI) consistently accounted for almost two-thirds of the vote until the 1987 general elections. The biggest swing experienced by the PCI was a 7 per cent increase in vote in 1976 (against 1972); while the most the Christian Democrat vote fell was 8 per cent in 1953 (against 1948). Even today, on the left the old PCI vote has held steady in percentage terms at around 26 per cent. Three-quarters of the PCI vote has merely gone to its mainstream successor, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and a quarter to the hardline Marxist rump, Reconstructed Communism. The PDS has survived because the leadership realised the need after the collapse of the Berlin Wall to transform itself into a social democrat party. In contrast, the Christian Democrats and their allies in government were shattered by the impact of the corruption scandals that begun to be unearthed in 1992. Their raison d'etre had been to prevent the PCI coming to power and once this disappeared there was nothing to replace it. The well-organised PDS was the first to understand that the new electoral system encouraged the formation of alliances. It formed a Progressive Alliance to fight two rounds of municipal elections in June and November last year and did spectacularly well. Save for the League stronghold of Milan, the Progressives made a clean sweep of the big cities. Before Mr Berlusconi entered politics in January, the PDS looked set to walk away with the March general elections. Significantly, Mr Berlusconi moulded his campaign round the need to prevent the left coming to power. But his remarkably quick success was due to the way he both inherited and exploited the space formerly occupied by the conservative centre and the right. A debt-burdened and demoralised Christian Democrat party dissolved in January. The bulk, representing the centre and left, formed the Popular Party (PPI), so resurrecting the name of the Christian Democrats' forebear in the 1920s. Their idea was to be a compact Catholic grouping, whose strength would be to act as coalition brokers between the left and the right. The remainder of the Christian Democrats decided to form a right-wing Catholic grouping, the Christian Democratic Centre. A small slice of the old Christian Democrats had already jumped ship during 1993 to make common cause with Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader who split from the party in March last year. Unlike the PPI, Mr Segni saw himself as the leader of a broad-based coalition drawn from both left and right. However, his refusal to strike a deal with either the PDS or the Progressives ensured that he ended up without real allies. In turn, this opened the field to Mr Berlusconi himself. Mr Berlusconi courted the PPI but was spurned. So he was forced to make common cause with odd bedfellows - the regionalist Northern League and the Mussolini-inspired MSI. Despite their differences, none had been part of the traditional power structure: all had escaped the stigma of corruption. In contrast, the PPI and Mr Segni's Italian Pact in the centre suffered because they appeared ready to play old political games: wait for the election result and then act as brokers to form the next government. This miscalculation cost them dear and they must now decide whether to pursue a lonely vigil in the hope that the Berlusconi star will wane or become part of a broader alliance on the left or the right. Their bargaining power would be greater in making a deal on the left. The PDS and its allies (Greens, Socialists, Democratic Alliance, The Network and Reconstructed Communism) appear to have a voter ceiling as long as they fail to broaden towards the centre. Mr Achille Occhetto, who resigned as PDS leader in the wake of the European elections, was not prepared to remove Reconstructed Communism from the Progressive Alliance, aware that they accounted for 7 per cent of the vote nationwide. But they are an electoral liability. The nature of alliances will be the main political theme for the next year or so, and the subtext will be the identity of parties. Small parties such as the Republicans, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals have all but disappeared. They can obtain parliamentary representation only by forging local alliances and will no longer be able rely on proportional representation, which may be completely eliminated at the next election. Practical differences on policies are disappearing and it is hard to see what most parties even pretend to stand for in this post-ideological age. Even the MSI on the right is being sucked towards the mainstream, burying its nationalist and corporatist sentiments. This fast-changing picture imposes great responsibilities on the leadership of both the main groupings on the left and right, the PDS and Forza Italia. The PDS has the organisation but lacks the flair. Forza Italia has the flair but lacks the organisation. Mr Berlusconi fostered the idea of supporters' clubs, which could be formed by almost any group that identified with him. Some 15,000 clubs now cover every part of Italy. Each tends to regard itself as autonomous. To achieve some coherence, a separate national organisation was set up, based in Rome. This controls the political activity of the party and its candidates, and leaves the clubs with social and support functions rather like a new string of rotary clubs. Indeed, many Forza Italia activists have sprung from such clubs. A more formal party apparatus may be inevitable. Only this will enable Forza Italia to outlive Mr Berlusconi.</p>

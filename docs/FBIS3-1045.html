He said he found Dr. Buthelezi's  remarks upsetting. This report from Ronel van Zyl and cameraman  Faan van Zyl.    [Begin recording] [Ronel Van Zyl] Speaking at a news  conference in Randfontein, Mr. de Klerk rejected allegations  that an uprising, similar to that which occurred in  Bophuthatswana last week, was being planned for kwaZulu.    [De Klerk] We did not work together with the ANC [African  National Congress] to topple ex-President Myngope. The de facto  situation was that President Mangope lost control. We went in  there to stabilize the situation.    [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk gave the assurance that contingency  plans had already been drawn up in the event of problems arising.    [De Klerk] I am happy that we have basically in place what  we  think might be needed to keep the situation under control should  something erupt there, but it is a potentially dangerous  situation.    [Van Zyl] Meanwhile, Mr. de Klerk, as leader of the National  Party [NP], paid an historic visit to South Africa's biggest  black township, Soweto. Residents and street vendors of Dube  and Kwezi were caught unawares by the NP convoy. Mr. de Klerk  made two spontaneous stops to canvass votes. No vivas, no NP  posters, but also no sign of intimidation. An inquisitive crowd  gave Mr. de Klerk a friendly welcome. He was evidently pleased  by his reception.    [De Klerk] A kind lady gave me this apple. That is the  spirit that we need in South Africa. I've been overwhelmed with  your friendship.    [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk said the NP would fare much better in  black townships than generally expected. He said he was  jubilant about the results of a recent telephone canvassing  campaign. He wrapped up his Soweto visit with a private lunch  for NP candidates. Other stops were a breakfast meeting with  business people and a visit to the Rand Afrikaans University.  Students gave him a huge cake for his 58th birthday tomorrow.  Another stop was soft selling the Johannesburg Stock Exchange,  where he offered this advice.    [De Klerk] Think deeply and carefully and look very intently  at the economic policy of the various parties.    [Van Zyl] Showing his concern for smaller businessmen Mr. de  Klerk stopped at a the local shoe shiner, a necessity on the  long and dusty road to election day. [end recording]</p>

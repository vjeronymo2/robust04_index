			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: More qualified view of EC social security entitlements Sir, I found your article 'Innocents Abroad' (April 3) most informative. However, some statements made therein might be misinterpreted and should be clarified. First, the co-ordination of social security systems was achieved in 1958. Consequently it is misleading to state that 'some progress' was made on the co-ordination of social security systems in the early 1970s. It is equally misleading to state, without qualification, that: 'A British worker claiming unemployment benefit in France is entitled to the same treatment as a Frenchman.' To qualify for French unemployment benefit, such a worker would have to be insured under French law immediately prior to becoming unemployed. In addition, he would have to fulfil all the conditions for entitlement to this benefit under French law. An unemployed British worker who wishes to go to France to seek employment has no right to French unemployment benefit but could have his UK benefit exported to him there for a period of three months. With respect to pensions, there is no obligation imposed upon the country of origin of the migrant worker to pay a proportionate amount of his pension. Still less does community law create a system of 'winners and losers'. The system is designed to ensure that beneficiaries receive those benefits which they and their employers have paid for. A pensioner gets, from each of the member states in which he has been insured, a pension the amount of which is calculated in accordance with the number of contributions he has paid under the law of that state. Your article might be interpreted as meaning that the pension entitlement of a migrant worker is that of the country in which he retires regardless of where he has worked. Finally, while the portability of occupational welfare schemes is a problem, it is not correct to state that 'efforts to harmonise such schemes were scuppered last year by the EC'. It is not the intention of the Community to harmonise either social security or occupational welfare schemes. Its ambitions are confined to achieving the portability of benefits, a matter which does not require harmonisation.

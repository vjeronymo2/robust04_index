			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Lisbon shares claim overruled A Portuguese court has made a landmark ruling against a group of former shareholders seeking Es20bn (Dollars 114m) from the government in compensation for the loss of holdings nationalised following the 1974 revolution. The ruling in the first compensation case to reach a conclusion is a victory for the centre-right government, which is facing at least three other important claims in the courts. After a bitter legal battle that began in 1987, a Lisbon civil court ruled against the claim by five former shareholders in 10 companies, including eight banks, that were nationalised by a Communist-led government in 1975. The group sought Es20bn in compensation based on the market value of their shares at the time of the nationalisation and an additional compensation to make up for monetary depreciation. But the court ruled in favour of a government proposal to pay them only Es1bn. Mr Joao Rocha, one of the former shareholders, said they would take their case to the court of appeal in Portugal. They are already pursuing a legal action against the Portuguese state at the European Court in Strasbourg. In what Mr Luso Soares, a lawyer for the group, described as an historic case, they had succeeded in moving their claim out of Portugal's administrative court system into the civil court. But judges there ruled that nationalisation was a political act that did not require the state to compensate former owners in full or pay interest on delayed compensation payments. Other cases before the courts include a claim by Mr Luis Champalimaud, an entrepreneur, for Es1bn in compensation for the loss of holdings in 13 nationalised companies, and a claim by Mr Sergio Geraldes Barba for a similar amount in compensation for the nationalisation of Socarmar, a fishing company he owned. A ruling in favour of any of these claims would be likely to trigger a rush to the courts by other investors and former owners who lost their holdings in the nationalisations of 1975. Most of the state takeovers of Portugal's financial and industrial companies have been, or will be, reversed by a reprivatisation programme that began in 1989. However, although the government has already reached out-of-court settlements with most foreign former shareholders, expropriated Portuguese investors are still fighting for what they consider adequate compensation.</p>

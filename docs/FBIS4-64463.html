			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Federal Labor Minister Norbert Bluem: "A High </F> Standard of Living Must Be Constantly Safeguarded Through High  Performance"]    [Text] The economy is there for the people, and not vice  versa. This basic philosophy of the social market economy has  come under pressure to prove its worth in the course of  international economic developments. We are able to produce an  increasing amount of goods, at increasingly cheaper prices, with  an increasingly smaller work force. And what stands at the end  of this scenario: one part of the work force doing highly  qualified jobs, one part working but nevertheless poor, and the  rest without work but "provided for?"    In this situation it deserves our respect that U.S.  President  Clinton asked the economics, finance, and also the labor  ministers of the seven major industrial nations to gather into  "conclave" to discuss a single issue: Jobs. For once, far away  from the traditional ritual of world economic summits, where  participants only discuss interests, inflation rates, monetary  relations, budget and balance of payments deficits. These are  undoubtedly decisive macroeconomic parameters on which  investments and economic growth depend not only at the national  but the international level.    Yet with any investment and growth one must also ask  whether,  and what kind of, jobs will be created. Employment provides  possibilities for life, guarantees participation in the social  processes, creates personal and social security, and allows  people to show solidarity for others. New technologies, new  structures, new demands for qualification -- all this is seen  not as progress but as threat, unless they provide the ground  for new jobs.  <H5>  Germany Comes Second in Unemployment Rate Statistics </H5>   The situation in the industrialized nations is serious. As a  result of the international recession, unemployment has reached  terrifying dimensions. Nobody would challenge the total that  was presented at the opening of the G-7 Jobs Conference in  Detroit. Yet, as far as the question "What must be done?" is  concerned, the German delegation did not come empty-handed.  After all, we are fighting unemployment with enormous political  and financial expense. And by international standards, our  situation is not quite as bad as the self-torturing debates on  Germany as an investment center would have us believe.    Here are two facts in this connection:    1. Regarding the unemployment rate, Germany comes in  excellent second place -- behind Japan, but still ahead of the  United States, which had often been presented as "employment  wonderland."    2. Germany's fine position as far as unemployment among  young people is concerned is particularly noteworthy --  particularly thanks to our excellent system of apprentice  training, where modern theory and practical work in the  enterprises guided by the market have established a constructive  symbiosis.    The condition for overcoming the employment crisis is that  people go along with it. People must not feel that progress and  change are a threat but rather a positive challenge. However,  to be able to come to that, man has to be given the means to  hold his own in the process of technological-structural changes  and take an active share in these changes. And, if at one point  he is unable to do so, if he loses his job, he must be protected  against social decline.  <H5>  Social Partnership Is an Important Advantage for Germany </H5>   Labor market policy, as we have developed it here in  Germany,  fulfills both of these tasks. It allows for and maintains  people's ability to overcome the changes -- among other things  through information, consultation, training, and mainly through  professional qualification. Labor market policy is therefore a  bridge between the economic and social spheres, an indispensable  addition to economic and financial policy.    Our labor administration technique, which combines singly  handly both areas of labor market policy, namely the active  shaping of labor promotion and social unemployment benefits and  is financed through the contribution payments of employers and  employees, met with great interest. Self-administration, which  is based on the technique, is an expression of the comprehensive  effort of the social partnership to be the decisive element of  our social and societal structures. This is strengthening social  peace, and for other countries [this represents] a German  advantage as economic center that must not be underestimated.    The great efforts of social partners at the enterprise,  industry, and labor levels, under the current critical situation  in which we have to protect jobs, initiate the necessary  revisions of our policy, and set the course for higher  competitive strength and economic growth, have been noted with  interest. Our mature and time-tested culture of social  partnership is also an advantage for Germany as an industrial  center!    Including employers and trade unions in the implementation  of  labor market policy strengthens the attempt to reach joint  solutions. Thus, we also achieve a sensible balance between the  two sides of labor market policy, the economic and the social  sphere.    In some countries, however, forces are gaining the upper  hand  that are trying to get the job crisis under control through  radical cuts in social security, the underlying idea being: cut  costs, cut prices, create more jobs.    Examples for this can be found in the United States. Many  new jobs have been created there over the past 20 years. The  percentage of gainfully employed people greatly increased, and  it has been possible to tackle the employment problem better  then elsewhere. However -- as President Clinton frankly and  self-critically admitted in his opening address -- the  employment problem has been exchanged for an income problem.  The average workweek for American employees is longer today,  yet Americans do not earn more than they did 20 years ago. Many  of them belong to the so-called working poor. These are people  who, despite the fact that they have a job, are unable to  sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. This  kind of job creation cannot be a sensible objective. Why should  somebody work if he remains dependent on the state at the same  time? A gap must remain between work and poverty.    It was mainly this understanding that made President  Clinton take the initiative for the Detroit Jobs Conference.  Experiences were to be exchanged on an alternative to the  "working poor" employment model.    Germany was able to point to good experiences and results.  Due to the Federal Government's policy, some 3.3 million new  jobs were created by 1992 in the old laender, most of them good,  self-sustaining jobs with good pay and a clear distance from the  poverty line. Yet, sufficiently high wages are possible in the  long run only with adequate productivity, which is mainly  dependent on innovative products and procedures and the quality  of work. Here we are now reaping the fruits of decades of  efforts in vocational training and adapting the qualifications  of our gainfully employed to the challenges of  technological-structural change. All that has been  well-recognized by our friends and partners.    Yet, because of it, we cannot and will not mount the high  horse. High incomes and high quality social security systems are  the result of a healthy economy. In a world economy based on  the division of labor, an internationally outstanding standard  of living must be won and safeguarded again and again through  excellent performance. Worldwide changes in international  economic relations will lead to a new positioning of individual  economic areas. Only those who react adequately will be able to  maintain or improve their current standards. It is here, in the  flexible adaptation to new constellations, that Germany seems to  be experiencing a certain weakness right now.    One term that came up again and again in the discussions in  Detroit was "information superhighways." This new system of  information transfer will change the world. Just as with any  normal transport route it will engender development and  exclusion. Those who do not keep up will stay behind. If  prosperity and jobs are important, then we must not retire to  Podunk.    In Germany we will have to try as hard as we can to maintain  our scientific-technological competence, which has secured for  us excellence in the sphere of production, and use it to build  up and further develop a modern service sector. This is  certainly one area where we must catch up with the others.  <H5>  No Single Recipe But No Isolation Either </H5>   And we will have to make working hours more flexible, not  only for the better coordination of production and sales or for  better utilization of available machinery. It is also a  question of working hours that allows for better coordination of  the job with other vital individual needs. Considering the many  people who are condemned to idleness it is narrow-minded and, at  the same time, we continue to force millions of employees to  work more than they actually want to or can. The age at which  elderly colleagues have been asked by managements to retire  prematurely is also inhuman, and these age levels are being  continually forced down. When I presented my German view of  this unfair development in Detroit, the other ministers agreed  immediately. In virtually all industrialized nations the  mentality of writing off elderly employees has begun to prevail,  one which eliminates experience and other qualities from the  economic process. The developments of the past 20 years have led  us into a dead-end street from which we must quickly find a way  out.    All in all, Detroit was the successful attempt to emphasize  to the international public that employment is the main target  of all spheres of policy related to the economy. Still,  considering all the international interrelations and  interdependencies, one thing was clear: The basic situation and  the economic and social framework conditions are so different  from one country to the next that single and patent solutions  are not possible and would not be helpful.    Nevertheless, in view of the miserable international job  situation, the path of national-egotistical isolation has to be  ruled out. This was the unanimous opinion voiced by all  participants. No country will be able in the long run to secure  prosperity and employment unless it is included in the  international division of labor and unless there is global  growth.    Employment is a result of the efforts of all parties  involved  in economic activities, not least the business community. It  was this community that American Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich  warned before the opening of the conference to cease their  frenzy for lean companies and dismissing people. The  businessman will not be judged by the extent to which he reduces  the work force but by what he does with the "capital" of the  work force. Bake instead of slaughter! This was Reich's motto.  This appeal should reach across the Atlantic.</p>

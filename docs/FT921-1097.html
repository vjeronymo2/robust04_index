			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Asylum-seekers find refuge from the lunatic fringe ONE NIGHT last year a half-drunk teenager on the way back from a disco in the centre of Karlsruhe lobbed a makeshift petrol bomb over the fence. It set fire to the window-frame of one of the dormitories, and then went out. According to Karl Heinz Sieb, the burly, friendly deputy-director of Baden-Wurttemberg's central reception centre for asylum-seekers, this is the only disturbance the centre has had since it was built in 1990. Otherwise, Baden-Wurttemberg's Zentralanlaufstelle fur Asylbewerbe - ZAST for short - is a haven of tranquillity, with beds for 850, tidy courtyards, volley-ball pitch and table-tennis. The well-behaved and well-looked-after residents stand around, hands in pockets, clearly nonplussed at what for many is their first experience of European civilisation. Between 250-300 asylum-seekers arrive here every working day of the week. Although Romania and Yugoslavia account for nearly half the applicants, others come from further afield, from China, Turkey, Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, Sri Lanka. They are given new clothes, food, medical attention. They sleep on clean sheets in scrubbed, warm dormitories. They stay here for an average of three or four nights while their initial applications for asylum are processed. Then they are shipped out to the villages and towns of Baden-Wurttemberg, where they are billetted at the municipalities' expense until their applications are fully processed. This can take months, if not years. 'All they have to do is say the word 'asylum' and the whole process is underway,' says Mr Sieb. In the event most applications are rejected - only 6.9 per cent of the 256,112 applicants were granted asylum last year - but the process is slow. Mr Sieb is proud of the efficiency with which the centre deals with the initial applications, but his success in processing asylum-seekers causes problems for the rest of Baden-Wurttemberg. Every town with more than 1,000 inhabitants is obliged by law to find accommodation on the basis of 9.25 beds for every 1,000 inhabitants. The rest of Baden-Wurttemberg is not always as welcoming as Karlsruhe: in early January skinheads threw firebombs at a hostel housing 40 refugees at Waldkirch in Breisgau, near Freiburg. This time they did more than set a window-frame alight. Both doors to the hostel were on fire by the time the fire-brigade arrived and the residents had retreated to the third floor to escape the smoke. More than half of them ended up in hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, and one nearly died.</p>

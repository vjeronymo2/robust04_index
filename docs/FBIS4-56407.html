			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- The U.S. Government has  impeded Cuban Foreign Ministger Roberto Robaina from  participating in a panel discussion organized by a U.S. media  company by not granting him the necessary visa on time.    Robaina was invited to visit the city of Atlanta by Turner  Broadcasting Corporation [TBS], the consortium that operates  CNN. The corporation invited Robaina to take part in the seminar  it organizes annually. The seminar is attended by  representatives of clients worldwide.    This information was confirmed to PRENSA LATINA by Cuban  Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who explained that  Robaina had planned to speak about the situation in his country.  Alfonso noted that the list of guests included UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev.    The journalistic event began on 1 May. Robaina should have  traveled on 29 April. Because of this, he requested the visa  from the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba 25 [word indistinct]  earlier. TBS executives also contacted the U.S. State Department  about this matter.    Alfonso said, however, time went by without news on the  granting of any visa, and on 28 April, faced with the  impossibility of travel caused by the delay and a lack of  explanation from Washington, the Cuban Foreign Ministry had to  withdraw its passports from the U.S. Interests Section.    Curiously, the spokesman noted, the next day, in Washington,  the U.S. Secret Service went to the Cuban Interests Section  inquiring about bilateral cooperation to guarantee Robaina's  personal security during his stay in U.S. territory.    There was never any answer to the visa request and no  information was given to Cuba regarding a situation that  prevented the Cuban foreign minister from attending a meeting to  which he had been invited.    Alfonso said the U.S. Government's position represents a  continuation of a policy through which it denies the principles  of freedom of expression it claims to defend.</p>

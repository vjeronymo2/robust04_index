			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (8): Buy-outs back on the agenda - Eastern Europe MANAGEMENT and employee buy-outs are back on the eastern European agenda. Fears that 'red directors' would profit from new free market economics as privatisation fever gripped the region, have faded and the extent of buy-outs - especially for small to medium sized firms and spin-offs from large state firms - seems greater than earlier indications would suggest. The widespread ability of managers associated with the former communist regimes to acquire their firms in so-called 'nomenklatura buy-outs' produced considerable resistance to the phenomenon. However, it is now recognised that, in many cases, such managers are the only available entrepreneurs for such a deal. Information on buy-out activity in eastern Europe is difficult to obtain. As well as an unknown number of nomenklatura buy-outs, several thousand hundred buy-outs of retail premises and small workshops have been completed. In Russia, half of the smaller sales - an estimated 6,500 transactions  - have involved buy-outs. Similarly, in Romania, 270 out of 1,100 smaller activities sold up to October this year were to employees. But apart from those in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), buy-outs of sizeable enterprises have so far been limited. By June this year, of the total 8,175 privatisations carried out by the Treuhandanstalt (THA), the German state privatisation agency, 18 per cent were buy-outs and about 1 per cent were buy-ins. Over 1,100 buy-outs have involved companies with fewer than 100 employees. However, large buy-outs are possible with two of the largest to date being Anhaltiner Stahl und Anlagenbau (Asta) and Industriemontagen Leipzig. The Privatisation Law in Poland allows for a procedure of 'liquidation' whereby a buy-out occurs when incumbent management and employees create a private enterprise to lease state assets. The original state-owned enterprise is subsequently wound-up. By October 1992 more than 450 out of a total of about 800 sales were buy-outs. In Hungary, around 20 buy-outs are estimated to have been completed under the recently introduced self-privatisation legislation, with its emphasis on foreign trading companies and services. In Romania four companies have been selected to be sold through management buy-outs as part of a pilot privatisation project, three of which have so far been completed. In Estonia, two of the first seven pilot privatisations (Sami and Mareta) were full buy-outs and four others (Baltika, Valga, Voit and Talleks) were buy-outs in which management and employees were obliged to leave minority stakes with the state or to sell them to the general public. Slovenia, which under its initial Draft Privatisation Law gave pre-eminence to buy-outs, has seen them completed via several routes. Seven have been completed in the past 18 months through arrangements whereby workers councils transfer ownership to the privatisation trust which then sells the shares back to the employees. A further 17 have involved privatisation through the internal acquisition of shares using the old Yugoslavian legislation. Most, however, have occurred through the 'drop-down' method in which a newly created company owned by management and employees buys or leases the assets required from the old company. Finance can be a problem in the completion of buy-outs in eastern Europe in the absence of established venture capital firms and where management lacks the necessary personal resources meet down payments. The so-called 'E-credit' guaranteed by the National Bank makes it possible in Hungary to obtain loans for buy-outs on favourable terms. In order to obtain the credit management must pay at least 10 per cent of the purchase price with their own resources. Elsewhere, down payments range from 15 per cent in Slovenia to 30 per cent in Romania. In the former GDR, to help solve the problem of limited personal finance, a programme of Eigenkapitalhilfe (equity support) of loans up to DM1m were introduced for managers wishing to acquire at least 20 per cent of a firm's equity - as long as this amounted to less than 40 per cent of the total invested. The valuing of enterprises presents problems, it is difficult to satisfy political demands that assets are sold at a fair price without bringing the privatisation process to a grinding halt as the limited staff of privatisation agencies struggle to investigate fully each deal. The result has been the development of decentralised or self-privatisation. In September 1991 self-privatisation was introduced in Hungary principally for smaller firms. Buy-out teams have to provide an independent valuation of the company using a government-approved consultant. The consultants have to give priority to management and existing employees. Maintaining their reputation and position on the government's list gives consultants an incentive to make a fair valuation. This can be difficult in an uncertain environment where incumbent managers may try to influence the apparent value of a business. A number of countries now insist on an auction but outsiders may be unwilling to bid against incumbents. Attempts to deal with the problem of undervaluation in the privatisation of former GDR assets include purchase price adjustment and clawback clauses if the enterprise is sold within a relatively short period or without accompanying property. In addition, penalties can be incurred if investment and employment guarantees made by the purchaser are not met. The pilot privatisation buy-outs in Romania have also made use of clawback arrangements whereby purchasers are not allowed to sell land and buildings within a 10- to 20-year period. If they do, all proceeds above the inflation-adjusted figures in the initial buy-out contract are clawed back by the state. Uncertain conditions in many markets pose questions about the viability of MBOs. For this reason, buy-outs are frequently only considered as options for viable firms. Western industrial partners who can provide capital and marketing expertise may be unwilling to buy unless they can obtain majority control - something management may be unwilling to concede. Identifying suitable buy-in managers where a buy-out is not feasible also presents problems, as the THA found when it launched such a program in January. Of the more than 1,000 enquiries received from interested western managers, less than 50 are expected to acquire a suitable target. However, a small number of buy-ins by western managers have taken place, the largest being the estimated DM409m buy-in of Elpro and TGE by a partnership of three ex-Mc Kinsey consultants and three industrialists. The future of buy-outs in eastern Europe is also linked to the development of voucher schemes. The political benefits of voucher-based mass privatisation schemes for some segments of the population has frequently caused problems for the advocates of buy-outs. Both schemes can co-exist for different sized companies and recent developments indicate that it may be possible to include both elements in the privatisation of a particular firm. A minority of shares in a company can be acquired through vouchers, including the possibility for employees to exchange vouchers for shares in their company, with the majority of the shares being sold at auction to incumbent management and employees. Taken with signs that delays in passing privatisation legislation are coming to an end, the indications are that buy-outs are set for considerable growth throughout eastern Europe. However, great care still needs to be taken in balancing incentives for management and employees to take the risk, with continuing public concern about the nature of such deals.

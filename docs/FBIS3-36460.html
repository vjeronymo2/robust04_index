			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The market reforms of the  past two years have not yielded the expected results. This was  not due to some individual mistakes, but due to the incorrectly  chosen course of switching over to a market economy by "shock"  and monetaristic methods. This conclusion is contained in a  report, drawn up by the Economics Department of the Russian  Academy of Sciences and the international "Reform" fund. The  report analyses the current situation in the Russian economy and  outlines new approaches to reforms.    Continuation of the chosen course, the authors of the  document claim, will produce "disastrous consequences" and drive  the country into an impasse. The Russian economy is in a  critical state already today. The production slump has reached  40 per cent, and the total volume of investments has dropped by  150 per cent. Moreover, the production slump is of a universal  character and has affected the most technologically advanced  sectors of economy. Most alarming is the fact that depreciation  of fixed production assets has reached 60 per cent, which is the  limit, after which the country's production potential is bound  to collapse. "In view of the fact that the key role in the  ongoing inflationary processes is played by the inflation of  outlays," the authors of the report claim, "it is impossible to  combat it by purely monetaristic methods, because restrictions  on the amount of money in circulation and reduction of the  budget deficit will obstruct rational structural changes and  aggravate the production slump."    Proceeding from the results of a complex analysis of  practically all the spheres of the national economy, the authors  of the report have drawn the conclusion that it is not only  necessary to correct the course, but to work out new approaches  to the strategy and tactics of the socio-economic reforms in  Russia. In their opinion, stabilisation measures, like the ones  used by many countries in such situations, are most expedient in  this case, too. This must include some short-term measure to  effect state control over prices for raw materials and railway  carriages. The state must also pay its debt to individual  sectors of the national economy and to other spheres of economy.  The correlation of prices and the level of wages must then be  normalised by means of a conciliatory process.    According to figures furnished by the Economic forecasting  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and used in the  report, the general rate of inflation could be lowered by 8-10  per cent a month as a result of such measures. Prices could be  "adjusted" to fixed correlations in most sectors within two or  three months. Parallel with this, it appears expedient to  introduce progressive taxes for excessively high profitability,  to toughen sanctions for tax evasion, to reassess the fixed  assets and to grant tax exemptions to the part of the profits  used for accumulating fixed assets. As a result of all these  measures the level of inflation may be lowered to 3-5 per cent a  month within a period of four or five months. The proposed  solution, the authors of the report believe, is one of the  possible ways to resolve the problem which, if ignored, may lead  to serious economic consequences.</p>

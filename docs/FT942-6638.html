			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: The captain plays a straight bat - Cricket / Teresa McLean meets Mike Atherton and finds a tired, careful young man A cold morning, an almost empty Lancashire ground, a cup of grey coffee  - I was not surprised Mike Atherton looked tired. After all that Test match excitement, an interview in this setting was likely to feel a bit flat. Nevertheless, he smiled, wearily, and said: 'Fire away.' I asked him, first, what he thought of the press. He considered the question. Atherton talks cricket like he plays it, keeping quiet while he thinks and when he has no more to offer. His answer was careful. 'Generally, I think when you start a new job that they give you a bit of a honeymoon period. At the end of last summer and for most of the winter, I think they've been pretty fair with me. A little bit of 'amateur at bed-time' about some of the players at one point: I thought some of the criticism was a bit unfair and I said so after the (Test) in Barbados. But, on the whole, not too bad.' Atherton is obviously a man with battle plans for all occasions, including publicity. He does not talk with any suggestion of confidentiality or intimacy: he simply gives his views. To know more about what lies behind them, you would have to know him better which, I suspect, would not be easy. 'Do you like being captain of England?' I asked. 'It's been an enjoyable experience so far (although) I'm sure there'll be tougher times ahead. I'm not going into it thinking, you know, I must be captain of England at all costs. I'll give it my best shot and if I get slapped down or get the sack, then so be it.' Whether Atherton really is so resigned to his fate, whatever that might be, is hard to tell. At present, he is captain of England and his batting seems to thrive on all the pressure that brings. The harder the going, the harder it is to get him out. His defiant 144 in the second Test at Georgetown, Guyana, is just one among many examples of this on the recent West Indian tour. Then, too, only time will show if his leadership also thrives on a struggle as did that of Ray Illingworth, England's clever captain in the late 1960s and early 1970s and now the chairman of selectors - Atherton's overseer. Or whether it will wilt under the strain, as did the plain leadership of his predecessor as captain, Graham Gooch. Both Illingworth and Atherton - who looks younger than his 26 years - are strong characters, and an element of disagreement over the teams they choose is inevitable. It might even be a good thing so long as it does not make either of them resentful when they fail. I think Atherton would enjoy proving himself with a team not entirely of his choosing; fighting against the odds within the system. Also, it would give the team more freedom, not feeling they belonged to a one-man band. Atherton had no doubt that Gooch was an asset in the team, not a rival, but agreed it had been an advantage in taking over when things were in a bad way. 'Yes, I think so . . . Graham had had some successful years, but we'd just been beaten by Australia and India so we were at a fairly low point. Hopefully, the only way you can go is up and I think, hopefully, people will give me a little bit of time.' Time for what? 'The most important thing that has come out of my time as captain so far is learning about the players, about their character, whether they're up to it . . . you know, when the going gets tough, who comes through and who doesn't' Preferring not to name anyone specifically, Atherton declared himself keen to get the best out of all his players this summer. 'We should do well in the early part of this summer. We've got the ability to beat New Zealand if we play well.' He was more guarded, but also more enthusiastic, about South Africa. 'That series should be a very enjoyable and competitive one . . . I think it'll capture the public's imagination. They've already sold out the tickets for all the matches.' At this point I dropped my handbag, which spilled its bits and pieces all over the floor. Atherton picked up one or two of them for me, a bit uncertainly. Somehow, it was almost a relief to see him for a moment with his composure slightly ruffled. It would be sad to think that he has learnt to defend himself completely against all spontaneity. I have no doubt, though, that he does well to guard his natural privacy. He was non-committal about the personal pressures of top-level cricket, mentioning only the large number of meetings as something he found particularly annoying. But he did say that a short sabbatical every so often might be a good idea. 'The programme over the next two or three years is a very tiring one. People who are involved in international cricket, after three or four years, might find themselves in need of a couple of months off. But that's not the case yet.' Not a bad plan, but one which the cricket authorities would probably find a nightmare to put into practice. At least they can rest easy that Atherton is happy so far and continues to be dedicated to Test cricket - which he describes as 'the real test of a top-class player'. He did not just smile, he beamed, without pausing for thought, when he told me that while the short, highly-strung character of one-day cricket can sometimes make it more fun, 'the real number one is Test cricket. All the players prefer Test cricket'. A set of good, hard fights this summer, brightened with some victories, should bring out the best in Atherton, with hopes of more, tougher and better things to come.</p>

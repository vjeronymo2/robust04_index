			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Rebrov: "Uranium for the Bomb"] </F>   [Text] "Special Folder," "Top Secret" -- documents with  this classification have for many years been treated as the most  classified. The uranium epic is one of these. In the late 40's  and early 50's, it grew to be the meaning of work and of life,  and if you will, even the fate of a whole generation, thousands  and thousands of people who were later called  atomshchiki. The story of the production of uranium  for the atomic bomb preserves the names of talented and brave  people, victors in a duel with the dangerous unknown and with  uncertainty.    The events and the documents I want to talk about help us to  understand the times and the task, and along with that, also the  people who accomplished it. To some this may seem a boring,  harsh, functional chronicle. So be it. But it is interesting and  exciting, and it seems to me not just for history, but also for  today. In general, everything associated with atomic weapons is  reminiscent of a detective novel: Tension and dynamics of  action, critical situations, suspicions, mysterious codes,  puzzles, and questions.  <H5>  The Starting Point </H5>   August 17, 1945. On this memorable day for the People's  Commissar of Munitions, Boris Lvovich Vannikov (a Friday),  Stalin summoned him and asked how much time was needed to  develop an atomic bomb. Vannikov was evasive. "I think," he  began, but then, glancing at the morose face of the  generalissimo, he continued resolutely, "I can't say."    "Yes, you're right," Stalin nodded. "But that means we have  to hurry."    The clock of fortune of many scientists, designers, and  construction engineers was started that day, and began ticking.    But then, purposeful work had been started even earlier at  Kurchatov's Laboratory No 2 (codename LIPAN -- Laboratory of  Measurement Instruments of the Academy of Sciences). Before  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however, the physicists had no serious  external incentives. After a talk with Stalin, Vannikov met with  Kurchatov. The talk lasted for more than three hours, and as  early as September 5, 6 and 10, "closed" conferences were held  at the laboratory, to which a narrow circle of scientists was  invited. I.V. Kurchatov, G.N. Flerov, A.I. Alikhanov, I.K.  Kikoin, P.L. Kapitsa, L.A. Artsimovich, A.F. Ioffe, and A.P.  Aleksandrov reported on the "status of scientific research and  practical work in the field of utilization of atomic energy." At  that time the number-one task was set, to select the optimal  method of "separating isotopes" to produce enriched uranium. The  37-year-old professor Kikoin was appointed project director.    Stalin made Vannikov the coordinator for development of the  new field. By all appearances, there were two reasons. The first  was that Stalin trusted Vannikov. The second was that the leader  feared that the methods of Beria in this case might not work.  For that reason, while making the head of the NKVD the "problem  chief," he gave a lot of authority to Vannikov. Soon the First  Main Directorate (PGU), "Atomic," was established in the  Sovnarkom [Council of People's Commissars].    Today, when possible deadlines for development of something  new are discussed, they are given in years. Then the count was  in days, weeks, months. To speed up the design workups and for  the transition to serial production of special equipment for the  uranium project, two major defense plants were brought in: The  Leningrad Kirov (formerly "Putilovskiy") Plant, which in the war  produced heavy tanks and turbines, and the Gorky  Machine-Building Plant, where they made artillery weapons. Of  course these were monster plants, where thousands of highly  qualified engineers and blue-collar workers toiled. But they did  not have the slightest idea of gas-diffusion machinery,  especially since at that time the machines themselves were a  "complete unknown" for many physicists, as is evident from the  documents.  <H5>  An Imported Wind </H5>   At this point, when a painstaking selection of the way to  "separate isotopes" was under way, a book by Professor G.D.  Smith appeared in the U.S., "Atomic Energy for Military  Purposes." It also had a second, more intriguing name: "Official  Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb Under the  Supervision of the U.S. Government." Via intelligence channels  the book was immediately sent to Moscow and translated. Interest  in the unusual publication was even stronger because the author  was an active participant in the "Manhattan Project."    The book was studied most carefully at Laboratory No 2. The  suspicion arose: Might this be "disinformation?" Before  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, i.e. before August 1945, all atomic  matters of the U.S. had been kept in the strictest secrecy, and  now suddenly there were such revelations in September.    By then, there were no special revelations. Professor Smith  was sly. The scientific and technical details were submerged in  the laudatory outpourings of the author, and when the logic of  his discussions demanded specifics, there would be the  apologetic phrase: "For reasons of secrecy, we cannot say," etc.  Nonetheless, the "grain" was found, and with it the physicists  received confirmation that the path they had chosen was the  right one. It was clear from the text that "serious study of the  diffusion method had begun in the U.S. in mid-1941," and the  fact of receipt of secret information from the British was  recalled, where work had been done on gas-diffusion separation  in 1941-1942. So there was something behind this, especially  since the Americans used enriched uranium in their bomb.  <H5>  Installation D-1 </H5>   So it was gas diffusion.    On 1 December 1 1945, a government decree was signed on the  development of installation D-1 (this was the designation of the  gas-diffusion plant). An area close to the village of  Verkh-Neyvinsk was chosen as the construction site. This was in  the Northern Urals, comparatively close to the former  Sverdlovsk. In the 18th century, the famous Demidov had built a  small metallurgical plant here on the bank of the Neva. There  was a rail spur nearby, and an electrical transmission line, and  the incomplete hulk of an aviation plant had an area of fifty  thousand square meters. Most importantly, the woods concealed  the then almost unpopulated region from outside eyes. The decree  strictly defined the deadlines: 1948 for the start of operation  of installation D-1, and 1949 for operation "of the whole plant  system."    The construction work was directed by General A.N.  Komarovksiy (his rank was "shock defense" general). The work  continued around the clock, and around 30 thousand construction  workers of the MVD's Glavpromstroy [Main Directorate  of Industrial Production] were involved in building the plant.  Every day a report on the progress of affairs at the secret  installation landed on Beria's desk.    The Chief Designer of the Special Design Bureau No 1 of the  Kirov Plant, Nikolay Mikhaylovich Sinev, recalls: "Today the  technology for producing highly enriched uranium has been  brought to perfection. But then. . . there were moments when  some of the managers and designers doubted their success. The  time factor was pressing. What would the diffusion plant be  like, what sort of equipment was needed? At the start of 1946,  no one knew exactly."    In April, 1946, A.I. Churin was appointed the director of  the  still unbuilt plant. Before this he had worked as the chief  engineer of Uralenergo [Ural Energy]. Within two  years he was relieved of his post, and then after a short time  returned again. But all this was later on. . .  <H5>  Wandering in the Labyrinth </H5>   In January 1946, Professor I.N. Voznesenskiy was given the  task of designing a 24-stage diffusion machine. In parallel a  30-stage variant was considered (codename "NVK"). The second  project was transferred to Gorky (plant director Gen. A.S.  Yelyan), where it was discarded. They began to produce finished  items, and two aggregates had already been built when it became  clear that this way was a dead end.    Storm clouds gathered. Moscow demanded explanations. And  what  could they answer, if no time was given for profound  development, and the trial and error method was fraught with  failures? They switched to single-stage machines. But the  failures kept on. Someone had the idea -- couldn't this be  economic sabotage? Unable to withstand the stress and the  nervous tension, Voznesenskiy died suddenly.    The machines of the Gorky design bureau were codenamed "LB"  (Lavrenti Beria), and later were called "OK" (special  construction), while the Leningrad ones were designated by the  letter "T." The entire plant complex was supposed to consist of  56 stages, 1,000 diffusion machines, an automatic control  system, and auxiliary engineering services. At the start of  1948, special trains with the first items (called "reserved"  trains in the traffic schedule) began to arrive at the rail yard  of installation D-1. Assembly, installation and connecting in  stages began.    I won't try to explain the complexity of the technology for  producing highly enriched uranium. Special aggregates and  electrical equipment, sensitive monitors and meters, reliable  automatic systems, materials resistant to the aggressive media,  vacuum units, and special bearings and lubricants were required.  I will only say that to produce one kilogram of uranium of the  necessary concentration, it was necessary to expend 600 thousand  kilowatt-hours of electricity.    The bearings "broke." On thousands of machines. Their  replacement required exhausting work, day and night. Suspicion  of the management section of the laboratories and services  increased, "voluntary informers" appeared. Work became a  terrible ordeal -- that was impossible, don't touch, that's not  permitted. And what was permitted, how correct was it? Everyone  who was associated with installation D-1 signed non-divulgence  papers and was deprived of the right to transfer to other work.  The most unpleasant occurrence was in mid-1948. It was not  possible to achieve a 90% concentration of uranium. The  reason  was decided on at once: there was a shortage of "separating  potential." And a solution was found: "Finish building the  technological system, and add another thousand separating  stages." But how could they do this, if project D-1 had not  called for such reconstruction?  <H5>  The Shadow of Trouble </H5>   The Leningrad design bureau No 1 proposed a variant. On 17  August it was reported to Vannikov. Boris Lvovich, standing  behind his people completely (the words of Academician Lt-Gen  Ye.A. Gegin), approved the project, but with this stipulation:  "Calculate everything again, with a reserve, we won't give  additional time to correct mistakes." They calculated again.  Everything worked out. They began to work, and then. . .    At the end of September 1949, a special train traveled down  the Moscow-Sverdlovsk road. Three passenger cars were unhitched  and pushed to the Verkh-Neyvinsk region. They were parked on the  railroad tracks opposite the building which housed the managers  of the starting installation, who were in agony.    Among the arrivals was the "problem chief," L.P. Beria, the  chief of the PGU B.L. Vannikov, member of the special council  General A.M. Petrosyants and others. They began to look into the  causes of failure of an assignment of special state importance.  Beria kept taking notes and rechecking the names of those who  spoke. Vannikov's position, and the proposal on "technical  finishing" from the chief designer Sinev made it possible to  soften or divert the threat. However, it was not possible to  avoid "organizational conclusions" and personnel changes.    Deep autumn of 1949. Installation D-1 gained productive  capacity (it was designed to produce just grams of uranium per  day). All difficulties were seemingly past, but the  concentration of "output product" did not exceed 75%, and  they  had to have 90%! What to do? Again the feverish search.  They  decided to do further enrichment at a then already operating  unit in the Urals, which had been developed under the  supervision of L.A. Artsimovich. It used the method of  electromagnetic enrichment.  <H5>  The Push to the Future </H5>   All the work on the uranium project was of priority  importance. It was not possible to discuss every problem, and  they popped up like mushrooms in the rain, at sessions of the  Central Committee or Council of Ministers. The necessary decrees  were prepared by members of the Special Committee, and Beria  affixed Stalin's signature to them.    All the same, installation D-1 did produce uranium for  atomic  weapons. Fifty-six stages of 7,040 machines plus other special  equipment operated without failure. After the first plant, D-3,  D-4 and D-5 came on line. Science-intensive industry of the 20th  century was gaining force.    Our first atomic bomb was tested on 27 August 1949, at 0230  hours. It had a plutonium charge. It was called RDS-1. What did  this number code mean? First I thought of this expansion:  "Stalin's rocket engine." Actually it was different: "Russia  does it herself."    I named the names of only a few out of many, by no  means because their merit was any different. All of them,  privates and generals, technician/trouble-shooters and chief  designers, laboratory assistants and academicians, were  accomplishing one task, accomplishing it together, aware that  their fortunes were uncertain and belonged to the state. They  had a goal and no illusions. Today, probably, there are many  people for whom this chronicle will be a first revelation.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Patten sparks new tests dispute: Teaching unions angry at government's national curriculum date announcement MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, provoked another confrontation with teachers' unions yesterday by setting a date for next year's national curriculum tests for 14-year-olds in England and Wales. The tests were widely boycotted by teachers this year, and are the subject of a wide-ranging review by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. Earlier this week two unions announced that their boycott would continue next year unless the Dearing review produced substantial changes to the workload of the tests. Mr Patten yesterday announced that next year's tests would take place in the week starting May 9. The tests took place in June this year. The change in date was first suggested by Mr Patten last month in a speech to the conference of the National Association of Head Teachers. It was greeted with jeers. The Department for Education said that the change had been made following direct requests from the unions. It will avoid timetable clashes with GCSE exams. Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, described the move as crass and ham-fisted. 'Mr Patten's pre-empting the whole review,' he said. 'It seems to me to undermine the position he's taken ever since the review was announced.' He added that Sir Ron could still recommend the abandonment of the tests. The National Union of Teachers took a similar view. It said it would expect the education secretary to wait for the interim report  - due in a couple of weeks  - before making announcements about the date of the tests. Mr Patten was guilty of 'political interference' and 'consistently undermining the independence of the review'. Writing in yesterday's Times Educational Supplement, Sir Ron said he had found a consensus that the curriculum was over-prescribed, and would look into the scope for greater use of external moderators of teachers' own assessments.</p>

He  pointed out: In recent years, nongovernment exchanges between  the two sides of the strait have become increasingly active.  Exchange activities of various kinds and forms have taken place  constantly on both sides of the strait. Those exchanges and  contacts have enhanced understanding and affection [gan qing  1949 1906] between people of the two sides. They are conducive  to developing relations between the two sides, and the good  results will benefit both sides.    He said: In past exchange activities, a small number of  officials among the Taiwan authorities had come to the mainland  to take part in exchange activities in a private capacity. We  have always taken a attitude welcoming such activities.  According to a recent report by Taiwan newspapers, the Taiwan  authorities will relax restrictions and allow Taiwan officials  to go to the mainland for cultural and educational exchange  activities in the name of academic or mass organizations. We  express our welcoming of this decision by the Taiwan  authorities. Meanwhile, we hope that officials of the Taiwan  side, when they come to the mainland for exchange or other  nongovernment activities in a private capacity, will first  contact the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the  mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  so as to let concerned departments on the mainland provide  necessary asssitance. This will enable such exchange activities  to be conducted in a smooth and proper manner and to achieve  good results.    The spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office said: We hope the  Taiwan authorities will adopt a similar attitude to promote  exchanges between the two sides of the strait, further relax  restrictions, and allow mainland officials to go to Taiwan to  take part in exchange activities in a personal or private  capacity.</p>

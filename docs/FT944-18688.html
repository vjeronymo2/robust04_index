			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Ministers to probe savings and investment Finance ministries of the world's big industrial countries decided yesterday to investigate the outlook for world savings and investment, in the hope that this might shed light on current, high, real long-term interest rates. The Group of Ten countries adopted a proposal by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, to launch such a study. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said that the European Union's council of economics and finance ministers (Ecofin) would also investigate how different tax regimes affected savings and capital investment in the course of Germany's current six-month presidency of the EU. The linked questions of high long-term interest rates and savings and investment were raised in Saturday's meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven countries (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada). The debate was taken further in a meeting yesterday of the G10 (the G7 plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and so 11 countries in fact) and the policy-making interim committee of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Clarke told the committee that savings and investments were running perhaps two to four percentage points lower than in the 1960s and early 1970s, when they both accounted for about a quarter of world gross domestic product. Also, real interest rates were at historically high levels, up by one to two percentage points against the average for most of the period since 1945. The chancellor said the industrialised countries needed a consensus on what to do, because very large new investment opportunities, in prospect in Asia and Latin America, would increase claims on savings. More such claims might soon emerge in former communist countries and South Africa. Mr Clarke said steps must be taken to reduce the financial demands of governments on markets by reducing fiscal deficits. This theme was taken up vigorously by Mr Waigel. The German minister pointed out that total government debt, in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), now averaged 70 per cent of GDP and was 25 percentage points higher than at the start of the 1980s. Mr Waigel said a determined medium-term consolidation of industrial country budgets was the 'central pre-requisite' for reducing global imbalances between savings and investment and hence reducing high real interest rates. He said Germany was showing the way and would probably bring its annual deficit/GDP ratio below 3 per cent this year and thus sooner than expected. Yesterday, Mr Clarke underlined that free international capital flows and the global capital market were a boon to the world economy. He rejected the idea of re-imposing capital controls or re-creating formal exchange rate links between leading currencies. UK officials said the G10 study would be taken forward by the ministers' deputies and would also involve the IMF and the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. They hoped for an interim report by the IMF meeting in Washington next spring. At the G7 meeting on Saturday, ministers decided to involve the central bank governors more closely in their discussions, so as to increase the governors' understanding of the impact of financial markets on their economies. Commenting on long-term interest rates after the G7 meeting, Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor, said he and many of his colleagues thought that bond markets were exaggerating the dangers of inflation.

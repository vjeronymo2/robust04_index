			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Euro-sceptics a misnomer Sir, Why does the FT and the British media in general continue to describe the anti-Maastricht element in the House of Commons as 'Euro-sceptics'? They are anti-European and should be described as such. Simon Feacey, Lohweg 24, 63075 Offenbach, Germany</p>

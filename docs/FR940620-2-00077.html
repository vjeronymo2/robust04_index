			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to permit (a) cash invested in the Joint Account also to be invested in (i) VRDNs with demand features providing for maturities of up to 30 days or one month and (ii) securities (other than VRDNs) exempt from federal and/or state income tax with remaining maturities of up to 60 days (collectively, ``Tax-Exempt Securities''), (b) commercial paper and U.S. Government Securities held in the Joint Account to have remaining maturities of up to 60 days, and (c) repurchase agreements held in the Joint Account to have maturities of up to 60 days. The amended order also would add MFS Municipal Series Trust and MFS Municipal Income Trust as named applicants and permit an existing or future investment company (and all existing or future series thereof) not currently advised by MFS to participate in the Joint Account if MFS or an existing or future company controlled by or under common control with MFS becomes an investment adviser to the investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Tax-Exempt Securities include short-term tax-exempt demand obligations that have a variable or floating interest rate and an unconditional right to demand payment of the unpaid principal and accrued interest within 30 days (or one month). The variable or floating rate features of such securities provide for the readjustment of the interest rate to a rate then prevailing for similar instruments so that such securities reasonably can be expected to maintain a market value that approximates the par value of the notes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. While none of the existing Funds are tax-exempt money market funds, if a tax-exempt money market fund contributes cash to the Joint Account, such cash will only be invested in securities that qualify for purchase by a tax-exempt money market fund under rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Repurchase agreements are entered into with securities dealers and banks which are on the Advisers' approved list for repurchase agreement counterparties (the ``Repo Approved List''). The Repo Approved List was compiled by securities analysts and other employees of the Adviser based on such persons' assessment of whether the counterparty is financially responsible. The Repo Approved List is reviewed by the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of each Fund (the ``Governing Boards'') at least annually, although a Fund's Governing Board is not required to pre-approve a counterparty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Adviser for each Fund will determine whether to invest assets of such Fund in repurchase agreements, Tax-Exempt Securities, U.S. Government Securities or commercial paper (collectively, ``Short-Term Investments''). The existence of the Joint Account will not affect the decision of whether to invest in Short-Term Investments except to the extent the Joint Account had available to it a particular Short-Term Investment which was not otherwise available to a particular Fund and, on the basis of yield, credit worthiness, and liquidity, offered a competitive investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Each Fund will have the ability to purchase commercial paper, U.S. Government Securities, and repurchase agreements through the Joint Account consistent with its investment objective and policies. In addition, each Fund will have the ability to purchase Tax-Exempt Securities through the Joint Account consistent with its investment objective and policies. Each Fund may, but is not obligated to, invest not only cash which in the absence of the Joint Account would remain uninvested but also cash which in the absence of the Joint Account would be individually invested in Short-Term Investments pursuant to a Fund's investment objective and policies. Transactions in the Joint Account will be recorded and monitored pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Prior Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1(a), taken together, prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such a person, from participating in any joint enterprise or arrangement in which such investment company is a participant, without an SEC order. Rule 17d&hyph;1(b) provides that in passing upon applications under section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1, the SEC will consider whether each party's participation in the proposed joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

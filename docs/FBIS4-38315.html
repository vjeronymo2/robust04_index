			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Natasha Bukhari] </F>   [Text] While Minister of Tourism Muhammad 'Adwan believes  that having any kind of contact over tourism with Israel at this  stage is "premature" businesspeople in the trade think otherwise.    "We have to deal with matters in an open-minded and  pragmatic  manner," says Muhammad Imam, general manager of International  Tourist Travel Services, adding that in view of the tangible  progress on the Jordanian-Israeli peace track, Jordanian travel  and tourist agents have to start communicating with the Israelis  to prepare for any future bilateral agreement on tourism in the  region.    Mr. Imam adds that "we should not act like ostriches and  hide  away from reality." The reality, according to him, is that  Jordan's tourism cannot survive without coordination with  Israel, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and the Palestinians.    Dr. 'Adwan maintains that matters concerning tourism in the  region will only be discussed in current peace negotiations.    While informed sources in the tourism business told the  JORDAN TIMES that Jordan was represented in a tourism conference  in Tel Aviv on June 13, Dr. 'Adwan said that he "had no  knowledge of it, has not been consulted (on the issue), and  therefore, (he) can deny it."    The Israeli daily newspaper, HA'ARETZ, said last week that  five Jordanian businessmen were scheduled to attend the  conference for which "Jewish businessmen were queueing."    The tourism business sources, who asked not to be named,  said  that there was no harm in participating in such "friendly and  beneficial" conferences to hear the "other point of view."    Mr. Imam said that since "we sat with the Israelis in  Madrid,  Washington and will be doing so in Aqaba next month, it is no  big deal to meet with them in the occupied territories for  business pruposes."    He said he believed preparations should start by providing  the "proper" infrastructure for tourism-related projects in  Petra, the Kingdom's main attraction, and by establishing other  bridges linking both the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel  to Jordan.    "We want tourists coming from the Holy Land to come and stay  and not just use Jordan for an excursion," said Mr. Imam.</p>

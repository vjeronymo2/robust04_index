			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Ministers at loggerheads over timetable for legislation Ministers are considering including fresh legislation to reform the Child Support Agency in next year's legislative timetable. The debate over its reform is taking place at a time of wide-ranging differences between cabinet ministers on whether plans for virtually all radical legislation should be shelved in favour of measures designed to rebuild a reputation for competent government. With the process of whittling down the long list of bills proposed by individual government departments about to start in earnest, proponents of various controversial measures are arguing that the next parliamentary session provides the last chance to enact proposals before the next general election. In addition, with an election likely in 1996, they believe it is too risky to leave projects such as CSA reform, Post Office privatisation and an 'omnibus' privatisation bill (which would remove the need for separate 'paving' legislation before each sale of public assets) until the session starting in autumn 1995. But their views are opposed by consolidators. In the case of the Child Support Agency the consolidators argue that it is not yet clear what changes need to be made. Earlier this year the government introduced a number of modifications in the way the agency functions. These included enabling absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance to pay bills in stages. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has said he is determined not to be 'rushed into further, inappropriate changes'. With the government already committed to a wide-ranging pensions bill, the next session could be a busy one in the Commons for social security ministers. They are also expected to share responsibility with colleagues in the Department of Employment for a bill implementing the proposed job seekers' allowance, to replace income support and unemployment benefit from 1996. Other likely candidates for inclusion are a bill paving the way for the abolition of Health Service regional authorities and another criminal justice bill related to alleged miscarriages of justice. Officials expect this to be much more tightly drafted than this year's criminal justice bill, which was used by MPs to force votes on a range of home affairs-related issues. Ministers are also considering whether to include a bill setting up a new environmental protection agency, in line with a manifesto commitment, and a Northern Ireland police bill, in a move that would be welcomed by unionists. A housing reform bill - probably including the abolition of rules allowing people classed as 'statutorily homeless' to receive an automatic right to a council house - is a further candidate, as is a bill to bring British Summer Time into line with European time. Government business managers involved in drafting next year's timetable face the added complication of needing to make allowance for a European bill to permit the enlargement of the Union. There is still no indication of when ministers will be able to come forward with legislation, included in the last Queen's Speech, giving force to changes in the European Union's system of own resources. This will increase Britain's contribution to the EU budget in line with the agreement reached at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992. It will be opposed by Eurosceptics. Officials suggest the government may seek to increase its room for manoeuvre by omitting any explicit reference to Child Support Agency reform from the Queen's Speech but including the usual catch-all clause committing the government to 'other measures'. This would increase pressure on business managers to keep short the list of bills specifically identified in the speech.</p>

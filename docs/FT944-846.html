			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Sex, taboos and the selfish gene - Andrew Clark reviews the premiere of 'Lolita', Shchedrin's new opera staged in Stockholm Lo, Lola, Lolita] First came the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, alternately scandalising and seducing its readers when it first appeared in the late 1950s. Then there was the Stanley Kubrick film starring James Mason and Peter Sellars. Now we have the opera - written by Rodion Shchedrin, conducted by his Russian compatriot Mstislav Rostropovich, and staged by Sweden's Royal Opera in Stockholm. Lolita is the story of a middle-aged man's fixation for an under-age girl, set in suburban America around 1950. It is both sick and psychologically fascinating. Sick, because the idea of a 40-year old man having sex with a 12-year old nymphet, and killing the rival who steals her, is an affront to conventional morality. Psychologically fascinating, because it raises issues which puritanical Christian society likes to put a cap on - such as the war of the sexes, the 'selfish gene', and why an ageing male should be attracted to a female at the most productive stage of her sexual development. For the reader, the power of Lolita lies in the fluency and elegance of Nabokov's English prose (which he later translated into his native Russian). For the theatre composer, its appeal is more down-to-earth: it deals with a girl, distantly related to Carmen and Lulu, who so obsesses a man that the only way he can rid himself of her is to kill. Shchedrin (b1932) is not the first composer to see the novel's dramatic potential. Leonard Bernstein apparently wanted to write an opera with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as Humbert Humbert, the European emigre who tells the story from his death-cell. But Bernstein never pursued the idea. Perhaps it was the intellectual quality of the story-telling which put him off, or the difficulty of casting a nymphet. Nothing so mundane entered Shchedrin's mind. He simply went ahead, not even stopping to think about literary rights. That was the first headache in the run-up to the Stockholm premiere. The Nabokov estate had already sold the rights for dramatic adaptation to Hollywood for a new film, and was threatening legal action if Shchedrin's opera was performed in a major world language. Thanks to that stand, Lolita can be sung in Swedish, Serbo-Croat or Swahili, but not English, Russian or German. The estate even banned the circulation of an English libretto - though only Nabokov's words are used - and insisted on editorial control of the Swedish programme. The novelist's son, Dmitri, who is the main beneficiary of the estate, attended the premiere and his presence excited curiosity. More problems arose when Swedish child protection campaigners tried to force the opera's cancellation, claiming that paedophile acts on stage would encourage sexual abuse. Eskil Hemberg, the Royal Opera's director, put up a spirited defence on national television, saying no-one had called for the suppression of The Ring just because it portrayed incest and murder. 'If we can't show human failure on stage, there's no future for opera,' he said. 'Theatre must cover the problems of society. An opera house is a university of feelings - it is our job to demonstrate those feelings on stage, and let our audiences make up their mind.' The opera itself is well-made but unsensational. Shchedrin dispenses with the book's European prelude, ignores all minor characters and incidents, but retains the flavour of Nabokov's word-games. Each of the three acts is a flashback from Humbert's cell, where he is haunted by visions of the jury (male chorus) and Clare Quilty, the man he killed. This gives Quilty a prominence which, in the book, he lacks until the final pages. It also gives Humbert a false aura of remorse. Shchedrin's music runs for nearly three and a half hours. Acts 2 and 3 sag, not just because the story itself loses its early frisson, but because there is insufficient dramatic and musical contrast. The three orchestral interludes could easily be cut; so could the banal ditties for two butterfly/bunny girls, which have period flavour but hold up the flow. Otherwise Shchedrin shows a musical adroitness to match his political reputation as former head of the Russian composers' union. He uses flute choirs and sustained lower strings to cultivate a languid, almost gloomy atmosphere, occasionally interrupted by outbursts reminiscent of a Shostakovich scherzo. The lyrical tone-painting bears a whiff of Barber and Copland; an unvaried lento conjures the monotony of transcontinental car travel. Voices are never covered. The most memorable music is a naive Sancta Maria for boys' choir, haunting Humbert's cell and recalling the lost world of his tragic first love. The Royal Opera was lucky to find an ideal interpreter for the title role. Lisa Gustafsson, a 25-year old student, had most of the qualities Nabokov so eloquently describes: the 'high voice, turned-in toes, agile giggling legs and schoolgirl thighs'. In short, she looked and sounded like an emotionally immature pubescent, before transforming herself into a dowdy, pregnant teenage housewife for the penultimate scene. The baritone Per-Arne Wahlgren made a plausible Humbert - less Nabokov's weak-willed roue than a repressed New Englander in mid-life crisis, hitting the bottle and ultimately resorting to rape. It is a long role, but not vocally exacting. Laila Andersson Palme played Lolita's mother as a big-bosomed, predatory red-head. Bjorn Haugan sounded comfortable in the high dramatic tenor role of Quilty. Ann-Margret Pettersson's staging served the work well. The simulated sex scenes lacked the poetry of the book, but only a prude would object. John Conklin's representational sets, inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper and the American Surrealists, were full of period detail - gas-pumps, lipstick tubes, cigarette packets and patterned sofas. Rostropovich unfolded the score with loving care, but the result was too slow and self-effacing. Performances continue till February 10.</p>

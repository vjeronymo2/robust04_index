			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: The end of a chapter at Jardine Matheson - The group is delisting from Hong Kong's stock exchange It might have been the stuff of a novel by the late James Clavell. After Jardine Matheson, the international trading house, provided such a rich source of material for his pot-boilers on Hong Kong - Taipan and The Noble House - its delisting from the colony's stock exchange at the end of this month would surely have been a source of inspiration. The theme is clear. Jardine's decision to delist because it did not want to fall under Chinese regulation after the colony's transfer to China in 1997 is seen by many as a mirror image of a broader British decline in Hong Kong. The company rose to pre-eminence under British rule: now that rule is on the wane, so too are Jardine's fortunes, according to this view. The idea the Jardine Matheson group of companies is 'leaving Hong Kong' was reinforced by the current bid by Trafalgar House, the UK construction and shipping group, for Northern Electric, the UK power company. Trafalgar is effectively controlled by Hongkong Land, a Jardine company. But the notion is hotly contested by Jardine's senior managers. They maintain 60 per cent of the company's profits derive from Hong Kong and China. That will remain the case for some time to come. They employ 56,000 people in Hong Kong and note that Hongkong Land would not be planning a multi-billion dollar investment in the colony's container port if Jardine were 'leaving'. Another, more dominant view in the financial community is that Jardine's management has taken a 12-gauge shot gun, carefully aimed it at its collective foot, and pulled the trigger. The company, according to this view, has frittered away a reservoir of Chinese goodwill towards it, and unnecessarily handicapped itself for life after 1997. That the Chinese have put an effective halt to its development of the container port is seen as evidence of this. These observers point out that Jardine could have built on the contacts of Sir John Keswick, the uncle of Henry and Simon who today run the group from London, who was an intimate friend of Zhou Enlai, China's revered prime minister under Mao. Instead, since 1984 when Henry and Simon moved the company's domicile to Bermuda, Jardine has gone out of its way to cock a snoot at Hong Kong's incoming landlord, the observers say. It seems not a day passes without some mainland Chinese criticism of the company in the colony's press. Most recent was the commentary which appeared in Bauhinia, a monthly magazine published under auspices of the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong. Bauhinia contrasted Jardine's behaviour with that of other British companies, such as Swire, Hongkong Telecom, Inchcape and Hongkong Bank. Jardine was portrayed as 'fearful' of 1997 and lacking confidence in Hong Kong after the transfer. Mr Alasdair Morrison, Jardine taipan in Hong Kong, says of the bad atmosphere surrounding the company's relations with China: 'You have to separate rhetoric from the underlying business reality. 'I was recently told during a visit to Beijing that we were welcome to do business in China,' he adds. 'Business there has been going well. We have more than 60 joint ventures and a number of new ones were finalised in the past six months. We are expanding our trading and services business in China, and Hongkong Land is looking to invest in property. Our joint ventures in China employ about 10,000 people.' Turnover, including associates of the group, is about USDollars 1bn. Of the associates he mentions the most important is Trafalgar House. It is doing big business on the mainland, but Jardine Matheson only owns a net 4.57 per cent of the company. That said, Jardine, of all the big British companies based in Hong Kong, is probably doing most in China. It has interests in motor vehicle distribution, aviation and shipping, trading and distribution, and engineering and construction. More than its interests in China, many analysts like the spread of Jardine's businesses, and, against a background of rising interest rates, the low debt on its balance sheet. The combination of diversified businesses and low debt, together with forecast earnings' growth of between 14-15 per cent over the next few years, leads many to rate Jardine as a good 'defensive play'. 'I put out a 'buy' recommendation a week ago because it is so cheap,' says Mr John Godfray, conglomerates analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong Kong. But even Mr Godfray concedes many clients do not want to know about it. 'It's not an index stock,' he says. The Jardine group has lost its position in the Hang Seng index of leading Hong Kong stocks. This month, Jardine Matheson, and three others in the group, were deleted from the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for Hong Kong. It will, however, remain a constituent of the Hong Kong index of the FT-Actuaries World Index. The Keswicks' attempt to insulate the group from an unwelcome takeover has, from Morgan Stanley's point of view, made the Jardine group effectively stateless. It will not be included in any other Morgan Stanley index, not even the one it calculates for Singapore - the market to where Jardine hopes its Hong Kong share trading will migrate. Morgan Stanley says the act of inclusion or exclusion of a stock from one of its indices has a short-term impact on share price performance, although the long-term impact is negligible. Jardine hopes so. The company has spent a considerable sum on informing shareholders of the end to Hong Kong trading. This includes footing the HKDollars 2m (USDollars 259,000) cost of transferring all Hong Kong registered shares to Singapore, to ensure the market for its shares does in fact migrate to Singapore. An elaborate, and to the shareholder costless, set of procedures has been established to ensure shareholders can deal in Jardine stock. Mr Neil McNamara, Jardine company secretary, says: 'There will be no day that an investor cannot trade Jardine Matheson or Jardine Strategic shares because the scrip is in transit.' But the fact remains that the natural market for Jardine's stock is Hong Kong. Up to 85 per cent of the worldwide turnover in its shares occurs in Hong Kong, with the rest in London. Like the Chinese state enterprises listed in New York, the company might find trading in its shares evaporates and its share price languishes. Unlike those companies, however, Jardine can be reasonably confident that Hong Kong stockbrokers will continue to research the company and its prospects. The long-term refuge of its share price lies, therefore, in the efficient operation of the market; its shareholders have to hope the market, spotting a mis-priced stock, corrects it.</p>

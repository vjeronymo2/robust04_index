			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jovial Rantao and John Soderlund] </F>   [Text] An ANC [African National Congress]-led government  would wrest mineral rights from mining houses and place them in  the hands of the State, ANC president Nelson Mandela stated  openly yesterday.    South Africa's minerals belonged to the State and mining  companies should lease the right to exploit these and pay  consideration to the State, he told mineworkers on the last day  of the National Union of Mineworkers' national congress in  Pretoria. The people would own the mineral rights, with the  State acting as a custodian, he said.    This idea was first mooted by the ANC in its Reconstruction  and Development Programme recently, and was met with widespread  concern. The gold index plunged 98 points, to 2060, in one  trading session, but recovered following Mandela's statement  that the initial announcement was "unfortunate."    He seems to have come full circle in response to changes in  legislation which became effective this year. Mandela accused  the Government of transferring ownership of mineral rights to  mining houses once aware that a new order would replace them.    "This was a conspiracy between mining houses and the NP  [National Party]. But we will not allow that to happen. A  democratic government will change every agreement between the NP  and the mining houses." And the right to mine should not be  exclusive to mining houses but should be extended to  individuals, he added.    In a wide-ranging speech, Mandela said an ANC government  would honour the right of workers to unionise and strike. "It  will be the first duty of an ANC government. The right to  strike is a democratic right of workers through the country," he  said.    In a stinging attack on the NP, Mandela said the party did  not have a conception of how to serve all South Africans. "They  don't know what it is to serve everyone."    Mandela paid tribute to the police, from the upper echelons  to the Internal Stability Unit, especially in Natal. "We have  men and women who are committed to the building of a new South  Africa. Their problem is politicians who do dishonourable  things."</p>

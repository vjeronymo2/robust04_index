			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata on Saturday [30 April] expressed his concern over the yen's  sharp advance against the U.S. dollar, describing the current  yen-dollar exchange market as "speculative."    The premier made the remarks after the U.S. currency plunged  against the yen to the record low of 100 yen at one stage in New  York on Friday.    "The yen's drastic movements are undesirable. Foreign  exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals," he said.    Responding to a question about the reasons for the strong  yen, Hata said, "market players are speculative ahead of a  series of holidays in Japan. Higher long-term interest rates in  the United States are also behind the current gain in the value  of the yen."    At their emergency gathering, Hata's cabinet colleagues in  charge of economic issues earlier agreed on the need to enhance  dollar- supporting intervention to help the economy continue its  steady recovery from a long recession.</p>

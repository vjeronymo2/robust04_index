			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dangerously Escalated Serbian </F> Provocation"]    [Text] In regard to information on latest incidents on the  Macedonian-Serbian border, Macedonian Defense Minister Vlado  Popovski held a press conference last Friday, June 17.  Reflecting the border situation in the past year, Minister  Popovski said Serbian-caused incidents have occurred often in  the last three months. Seven incidents were registered in June,  the same number of incidents occurred in May and five such  incidents took place during April, which is a high percentage of  a total of 19 incidents since January 1991. The minister  divided the incidents into two types: First, entering on the  Macedonian territory by Serbian troops, and secondly, incidents  between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Serbian patrol units.  The recent Serbian MiG 21 plane violation of the Macedonian air  space is also an example of border incidents in this year.    In most cases, the Macedonian border is crossed by Serbian  patrols, who enter as deep as up to 300 meters on to Macedonian  territory, but they stayed longer then usual near the place  called Cupino Brdo and the observing post Straza, Minister  Popovski stressed. At the place called Golem Tapan, Serbian  troops established a telephone communication with their base in  Serbia.    The Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] has sent a protest note to the Yugoslav  authorities on all the incidents, but the reply has always been  a denial of such reports.    What really causes concern, the minister said, is the fact  that Yugoslavia considers the Macedonian-Serbian border to be  only administrative. This border, Popovski reminded, was  regulated by the First Constitution of the People's Republic of  Macedonia, and upon a conclusion by a joint Macedonian-Serbian  committee, back in the period of 1945 to 1948. All peak  elevations had been marked even then and the Serbian side never  had a dispute over borders with Macedonia. It was the  Macedonian side that questioned two points -- the place of  Serupa and the junction of the three borders of Albania,  Macedonia, and Federal Yugoslavia, as well as the Prohor  Pcinjski monastery.    The Macedonian Army, evaluating the character and danger of  such incidents, undertook measures of forcing Serbian patrols  out of Macedonian territory. At this moment, there are eight to  12 Serbian soldiers at the post of Straza and the Macedonian  Army troops are only 100 to 150 metres away. The mechanism of  peaceful forcing Serbian soldiers out of Macedonian territory  has thus far been efficient, although both sides have pointed  guns at each other at all times. As for the peak Straza, it is  decided to make an effort to resolve the situation through  diplomatic means, but if it fails, the Macedonian side will have  to take the peak over and will do so. Besides this, authorities  in Yugoslavia, as well as the United Nations and CSCE will be  informed on the whole situation with a thorough documentation.    In a wider sense, the incidents could also be interpreted as  an attempt to activate another political factor in Macedonia,  especially before the upcoming census and elections, Popovski  stated. This pressure is complemented by the Serbian Church  threats to introduce cannon measures against the Macedonian  Church. If the old confrontation topic of Serbs being allegedly  endangered in Macedonia is added to all this, Popovski said, it  could be easily explained as an organized mechanism of political  and psychological pressure on Macedonia. Answering reporters'  questions, Minister Popovski gave some further information.  Firstly, he pointed out these incidents must not be interpreted  as an aggression, despite the fact some Serbian troops have  stayed longer on Macedonian territory; secondly, the Macedonian  side will ask the international community to get involved in  defining this border; and thirdly, Macedonia will request, in  the context of the newly emerged situation, that the  international community lifts the arms embargo.</p>

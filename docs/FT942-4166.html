			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: World Fluids start to 1994 'disappointing' The board of World Fluids Holdings, the specialist chemicals and additives manufacturer, yesterday warned that trading for the first four months of the current year had been disappointing and well below expectations. The company pointed out, however, that this was in common with most companies operating in the sector, where oil prices affected their results. The statement was in response to a recent sharp fall in the shares, which earlier this year touched 40p, but yesterday stood at 18p.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S DEBUT IN DIVISION I A MIXED SUCCESS  </P> <P> All things considered, Cal State Northridge's initial foray into NCAA Division  I competition this season turned out rather well.  </P> <P> The women's volleyball team, the first Northridge team to open play this season  after the school moved to Division I in all sports except football and men's  volleyball (the latter is already in Division I), split two matches Friday in  the Arizona State tournament in Tempe.  </P> <P> Northridge lost its opener to Texas Tech, 15-13, 15-7, 15-12. However, CSUN  defeated Arizona State, 15-13, 15-3, 16-14, in the afternoon match of the  five-team, round-robin event.  </P> <P> Marianne Dixon had a team-high 14 kills for Northridge in the opening match,  and teammate Patricia Fitzsimmons added seven. Kathleen Dixon had six kills,  Nancy Nicholls and Michelle Swalec each had five and setter Beth Welch had 34  assists.  </P> <P> "The intensity level was not high enough in the first match," Northridge  assistant Mora Kanim said. "We got it together in the second match."  </P> <P> Against Arizona State, Kathleen Dixon had a team-high 11 kills and Welch had  five kills and 29 assists.  </P> <P> Northridge will play Northern Arizona at 11 a.m. today and will face UC Irvine  in the afternoon.  </P></p>

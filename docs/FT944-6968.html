			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: The conservatory as a year-round asset - The joys of spending the winter under glass The conservatory first became popular with Victorian industrialists who, as they began to travel, developed a passion for exotic blooms and exuberant foliage and needed to devise ways of nurturing these delicate plants through Britain's dreary winters. Glass-houses were the answer and as glass became less and less of a luxury, as techniques for casting and building with iron developed, their popularity spread among the bourgeoisie. As an essential ingredient in Victorian romance (how many love affairs began to bloom behind the potted palms?) and a vital part of the social life of their day, they survived well into Edwardian times. However, as they became more accessible and attached to smaller and smaller houses, they became too workaday for the rich and gradually fell out of favour. It was not until the mid-1970s that interest in building conservatories began to revive. Peter Marston, who started a company that is now called Marston &amp; Langinger in the early 1970s, says that when he first started purveying the notion of conservatories he often had to explain 'that we did not build music schools' so very unfamiliar had the idea become. It remains as true now as it was in the last century that conservatories come into their own most magically during the long, grey winter months. And they offer us a means of making indifferent summers bearable, with the illusion of being in a garden, surrounded by lush greenery. Conservatories also make entrancing settings for parties - summer or winter  -and now that they are once again in fashion (after the en-suite bathroom and the hand-painted kitchen, a conservatory, it seems, is next on the home improvement list) there is a proliferation of accessories - everything that the well-dressed conservatory requires. For those thinking of embarking on building a conservatory or for those who already have one but are looking for ways of improving it, Peter Marston has written an authoritative guide: The Book of the Conservatory*. He also has some excellent ideas for making them an all-year-round household asset. The most important relate to double-glazing and heating, essential for those who want a tropical illusion in the midst of a British winter. The Victorians went in for vast boilers and radiators and seemed to have been blessed with a happy unconcern for heating costs. These days double-glazing and insulation are the key, if heating costs are not to be astronomical. All that should then be required is a simple extension of the domestic central heating system - ideally with separate controls so that the conservatory can be heated independently at night. Under-floor heating is ideal and Marston &amp; Langinger has developed a system which uses extremely elegant cast-iron floor grills, wonderfully reminiscent of the intricate ironwork that so characterised those first Victorian designs. As the winter nights set in, the sense of summer coolness and light can be replaced by a cosier feel with rugs on the terracotta or stone flooring, cushions and throws can be added to sofas and chairs (see the photograph here) and blinds which in the summer keep out the glare can, in winter, be used to keep warmth in. For winter evenings and parties, there is nothing more beautiful than candlelight but lanterns are probably safer and there are plenty to choose from. Peter Marston developed a range of furnishing accessories specifically for conservatories, because so many of his customers found that once they had the structure there was no single source of appropriate accoutrements. The Marston &amp; Langinger shop at 192 Ebury Street, London SW1 is one of the best places to start looking. Here are lanterns of every kind, from the pumpkin-shaped one photographed here to the hanging star or the Moorish-inspired version. The shop also offers the wickerwork furniture that seems appropriate for a light-filled setting, with the throws and cushions that will transform it in winter. But for an inspirational glimpse of the extra dimension that a well-designed and enchantingly furnished conservatory can add to living, I recommend Peter Marston's book - the colour pictures are inspirational. They feature every mood from sunny cool and tranquil through to exotic, rich and intricate. Particularly useful is the glossary of suitable plants and how to look after them, the practical advice on the things you really have to get right from the beginning - such as flooring, heating, double-glazing - and the lists of designers, builders and suppliers of furniture, jardinieres, hanging baskets and all the other trappings that the new owner will find himself obliged to buy. *Published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, 176 pages, Pounds 18.99, available by post from Marston &amp; Langinger, George Edwards Road, Fakenham, Norfolk NR21 8NL.

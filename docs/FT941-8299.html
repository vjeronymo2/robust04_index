			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Sharp increase in van financing Sharp increases have been recorded in the number of used and new commercial vehicles being bought on hire purchase, providing a clear pointer to returning confidence among small businesses, John Griffiths writes. Statistics from HPI, the credit-monitoring organisation, show that finance agreements in January on new light commercials jumped 77.2 per cent last month on a year-on-year basis. Finance agreements on new trucks rose by 63.8 per cent on January last year. Finance agreements on used light commercials, mainly Ford Transit-type panel vans and those based on cars, rose by 46.7 per cent and on used trucks by 63 per cent. The increases in finance deals are well in excess of those for the new light commercial vehicle market as a whole, indicating that bigger operators have yet to start replacing their fleets on a large scale. Total sales last month of new panel vans rose by 12 per cent compared with a year ago, but those of new light vans were down 12 per cent.</p>

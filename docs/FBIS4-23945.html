			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Joaquim Chissano by announcer </F> Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mashokwe] The first question I would like to ask  you is: The days before the end of apartheid -- Mozambique's  contribution. How would you sum it up?    [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together.  Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the  liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912.  We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our  liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back  in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the  '60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements  with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region,  including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together  with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in  Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that  the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the  Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom  and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of  apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation  movements.    We got independence before South Africa and we continued to  offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on  the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times  were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in  Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the  regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the  other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put  pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle,  but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political  field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and  in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement.  We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be  present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We  were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the  liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the  independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe,  Namibia, and South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a  feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have  contributed to a worthy cause?    [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt  that  I have given all my best, because when I speak about  coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to  be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in  Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see  how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise.    [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms.    [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese  terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it  happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at  transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition  with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia.  Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task,  primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause  of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to  forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this,  because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom  of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact  Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and  destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces  and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of  Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of  destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen  to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in  Rhodesia.    [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free  and  a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa  to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power?    [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that  we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing  that the success of one is the success of the other, and we  should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should  help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as  heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not  only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the  region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a  region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a  harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit  of all in the country.    We will not demand that the countries which are more  advanced  should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more  developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow  until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing  to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from  that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and  we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place  which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big  potential of resources.    Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the  richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to  coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going  to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already  we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this  constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the  spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard]    [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South  African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to  kill President Samora Machel then?    [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African  Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in  the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this  is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for  instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken  Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues  was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who  were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border  into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with  an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would  not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National  Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring  these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight  from here, and together with the South African officers who paid  the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by  officers from the South African defense forces. And there are  some who did not believe in change even after the change of  government here. There are some who continued giving headaches  to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned  by government or not, the possibility of having South African  security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services,  this is a strong possibility.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile  to  have signed the Nkomati Accord?    [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of  all it has decreased the direct participation of the South  African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it  has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the  minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started  thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about  business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created  within the white community in South Africa because they had to  judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they  started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and  Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment  for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the  world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that  in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good  because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South  Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western  countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the  Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the  struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened,  because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had  to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the  change of tactics of struggle against apartheid.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and  thanks for giving us your time.    [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome.    [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed,  have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be  corrected and how will that be corrected?    [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a  program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding  all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services,  health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial  network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the  life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the  rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the  reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea  factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which  were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite  mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities.    We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads  towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is  somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia,  Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland  and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are  calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals,  trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen,  which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other  Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not  black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the  past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already,  the foreign investment, and through all this process we are  going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people.    As you know we have more than 1 million people who were  refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people  who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people  have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no  real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment  in some projects but also through these investments we are going  to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself  will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the  training of personnel. The human resources development program  is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers  in the civil life is very important and again here it's about  creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their  own projects, their own initiatives.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total  peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your  government's position, but why should a South African business  person go and invest in an unstable area now?    [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some  acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as  they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in  South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We  cannot speak about the same amount of instability.    In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite  mines in which there is a South African company which is  participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which  was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put  a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not  there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all  away and so the mine is operating without need of special  security. It has got the normal security which all mines have  and there is a factory there. The people are living in the  area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started  exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace  since October 1992.    We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of  course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish  demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting  unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create  some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are  going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in  South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much  weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war.    I can say there is peace and economic activity has started  and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there  with big projects. Some other British have investments. South  Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so  investments are already there.    [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans  used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques?    [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because  Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of  apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid  because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have  racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was  worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant  separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have  development. [60-second advertising break]    [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the  other parties that the government was not satisfied and the  government wanted that this question and the other questions  which were not answered that they should be addressed,  therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the  inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the  inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we  want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and  that questions have been answered. If we find that was it  someone outside South Africa we will be glad.</p>

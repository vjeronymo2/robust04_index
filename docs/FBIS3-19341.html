For the armed  forces and the Ministry, which initially requested an increase  of 3 to 5 percent on the basis of the 100.4-billion-franc  spending obligated in the 1994 budget, this certainly is no  great prize. However, with this pledged increase over the next  few years, the defense budget actually constitutes an exception  to the multiyear Law on Public Expenditure Control, which  stipulates a 0.5-percent decrease in all state budgets.  Initially, the Budget Ministry had requested that equipment  spending in the miliatary program law be reduced by 1 percent  instead of 0.5 percent. [passage omitted]</p>

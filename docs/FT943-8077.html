			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Recovery in housing market remains slow The fragility of the housing market recovery was further underlined yesterday as figures released by the Building Societies Association reflected another month of mixed fortunes for mortgage lending. The statistics showed unexpectedly good news for societies in terms of retail savings, but the unpredictability of savings patterns in recent months led the association to adopt a cautious tone. New net lending totalled Pounds 1.16bn in July, only slightly higher than the Pounds 1.15bn recorded in June, though up by a more significant 14 per cent on July last year. This appeared to be a sign of an improved market share for societies, rather than the strengthening of the market as a whole. The British Bankers' Association reported that mortgage lending by banks was weaker in July than it had been the previous month. Allowing for securitisation - which involves the selling of 'packages' of mortgages to a company acting as a financial vehicle which issues bonds against them - banks' new mortgage lending was Pounds 593m last month, against Pounds 652m in June. Another indication of the slow growth in the housing market is published today in the monthly survey from the House Builders Federation. This found demand for newly built homes still rising last month, but at a much slower rate than earlier in the year. There was less encouraging news for societies in terms of net new commitments in July. These figures, which are for loans agreed but not yet made, are seen as an important forward-looking indicator, since they are a guide to the lending that will be undertaken in the next couple of months. Societies' net new commitments totalled Pounds 3.22bn in July - higher than the Pounds 2.94bn equivalent figure for the same month last year, but down by 10 per cent on the Pounds 3.58bn figure for June. The numbers of net new commitments showed a similar pattern. Some 54,000 commitments were made last month, compared with 60,000 in June and 52,000 in July last year. Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said that while the figures were 'moving in the right direction, it is still too early to claim that a sustained recovery is under way'. He was also wary of sounding too optimistic about the retail savings figures for societies, even though they showed an unseasonal net inflow of Pounds 286m in July. That was in sharp contrast to the net outflow of Pounds 104m in June and of Pounds 61m last July. Mr Coles described the inflow as encouraging, and suggested that the higher rates being offered by societies on three- to five-year investments might have been responsible for at least some of the improvement. He emphasised, however, the continuing fierce competition in the retail savings market from vehicles such as unit trusts and Peps. 'Given the overall current levels of interest rates and the desire of investors to seek higher (although more risky) returns in the equity markets, the recent volatility in building society retail savings is expected to continue,' he said.</p>

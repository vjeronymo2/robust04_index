			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Equity Issues: Woolworths to lead activity with ADollars 2.4bn offering THE international capital markets continue to show a steady stream of international equity offerings and equity-linked deals from corporate names around the globe. Woolworths, the Australian retailer, will open its ADollars 2.4bn share issue to the public tomorrow, with the shares expected to be priced at between ADollars 2.15 and ADollars 2.45. Meanwhile, investment bankers expect the heavy flow of issues from Latin American to continue. While investors are focusing on the sale of 35 per cent of YPF, the Argentine state-owned oil group, other names are expected to tap the markets, possibly before the summer holiday season. Market sources said that Grupo de Desarrollo Mexicano, a large Mexican construction company, is expected to announce an initial public offering (IPO) to raise about Dollars 250m. Another Mexican construction group - Tribasa - is also understood to be considering raising funds in the international capital markets. Investment bankers claim there are several possible deals emerging from Asia, with Samsung Electronics of Korea expected to launch a Dollars 150m Global Depositary Receipts issue soon. In the Euro-convertible bond sector, Goldman Sachs launched a Dollars 150m deal for Home Stake Mining, the North American mining company. The proceeds will be used to refinance existing bank debt. The seven-year convertible bonds have a coupon of 5.5 per cent.</p>

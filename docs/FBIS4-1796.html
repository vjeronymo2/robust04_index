			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other  judicial-related activities in the PRC monitored by Hong Kong  Bureau during the period 15-28 March. The source and mode of  processing are given in parentheses at the end of each entry.  Certain reports deemed more significant may have been filed  separately, in which case the summary will include the serial  number of the separately filed item.    As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month  PRC crime reportage focused on no single issue.  <H8>  INTERNATIONAL </H8>   In the Russian city of Grodekovo, 20 km from Suifenhe in  Heilongjiang Province, about 3,000 Chinese do business in the  peak season. Four gangs can be identified among them, namely  the "Harbin group," the "Wuchang group," the "Yanji group," and  the "Hunchun group," which prey on their compatriots and extort  money from them. On 22 September 1993, the head of the criminal  investigation section of the provincial public security bureau  led 16 criminal investigation detectives to Grodekovo, with the  consent of the Russian side. As a result of the joint operation  by Chinese and Russian police, 40 persons who had committed  crimes outside the border were arrested. (Summary) (Hong Kong  WEN WEI PO in Chinese 20 Mar 94 p b4)    Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, border  trade has developed rapidly, while transnational crime such as  drug and gun trafficking have also become more rampant. Since  last June, the People's Armed Police Guangxi Border Detachment  has mainly cracked down on guns and drugs. In half a year, they  have cracked 152 drug and gun cases; seized 1,463 guns of  various kinds, including 217 army guns, 7,179 rounds of  ammunition, and 418 hand grenades and antitank grenades; seized  69,037 grams of opium and 7,099.4 grams of heroin; crushed 49  gangs specialized in gun and drug trafficking; and arrested 239  criminals involved in gun and drug crimes. Guangxi party Deputy  Secretary Ding Tingmo said that Guangxi has a coastline of over  2,000 km, and that the crackdown on transnational crimes along  the border will be a long-term task. (Summary) (Hong Kong WEN  WEI PO in Chinese 14 Mar 94 p b2)    Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi, National People's Congress deputy  and commander of the Yunnan Armed Police Corps, in an exclusive  interview with a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE staff reporter on 21 March,  said that in 1993 armed police and public security authorities  in Yunnan cracked over 4,000 drug cases, 27 of which were cases  of armed drug trafficking; seized five tonnes of heroin and  opium; and arrested over 6,000 criminals, 473 being sentenced to  death. He said that the drug problem is still very serious in  Yunnan. Trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the  following new developments have been observed:    -- A rise in major drug trafficking cases. After making some  money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits by  engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or more.    -- A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Last year,  Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military firearms, 13 other  firearms, and 50 hand grenades.    -- Better organized means of trafficking. Drug trafficking  using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty. Criminals  use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate with one  another and transport drugs through such methods as relaying or  sending traffickers and drugs separately.    -- An increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to come only  from the Golden Triangle, but are now infiltrating into China  from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns Honghe  and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from Laos  and Vietnam.    -- An increase in drug traffickers from other provinces.  Last year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers  from other provinces, and the number of provinces and autonomous  regions they came from increased from 22 the previous year to  27. Most active were drug traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang,  Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang.    Si Jiuyi explained that as Yunnan borders on Vietnam, Burma,  and Laos, the residents in the border areas share customs and  languages with those three countries, and the border markers are  not very clear, posing enormous difficulty for antinarcotics  operations. Drug traffickers have such slogans as "You can  execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may  stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the  rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the  families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another  problem is that antinarcotics operations are short of funds and  manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a  drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle.  In the end, the criminal got away in a car.    Si Jiuyi said that the Yunnan Armed Police have steadily  increased the number of cases cracked over the years. Many  armed policemen have received awards. Two of China's 10 Young  People of the Year were antinarcotics heroes from Yunnan. Over  20 members of the Yunnan Armed Police were killed in  antinarcotics battles over the past few years. (Summary)  (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 0701 GMT 21 Mar 94)  (filed as hk2903092194)    Officials in charge of public security departments in 11  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including  Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning and Shanghai, gathered in Shanghai to  discuss with representatives from the Hong Kong police force the  fight against organized crime committed by triads. The meeting  was held amid the budding of some Hong Kong underground groups  in the Mainland. Participants believed that the strengthening  of cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong police was  necessary. The director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of  the Ministry of Public Security stressed that underground forces  from outside the borders were in no way sheltered in the  mainland. All members of illegal groups were harshly punished in  accordance with the law once they were found guilty of  committing crimes inside the Mainland.

(Summary) (Beijing FAZHI RIBAO in Chinese 23 Feb 94 p 1) (filed  as hk1703141194)    The state council recently promulgated regulations on the  protection of computer systems. They apply to all systems in  the country, covering construction of buildings for computers,  the putting on record of connections of systems with overseas  entities, a unified practice for prevention of viruses and other  data related to viruses, and the issuing of permits for the  exclusive sale of antivirus safety products.

Around 70 to 80 percent of 400,000 computers across the  country have been infected once with a virus. Some scientific  research institutes and higher learning institutes have had all  their computers infected. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN  SHE in English 0352 GMT 19 Mar 94)  <H8>  PROVINCIAL </H8> <H5>  Anhui </H5>   Anhui's campaigns against serious crime in recent years have  seen 6,300 big cases discovered, over 20,000 criminals caught,  and more than 3,400 gangs smashed. There were campaigns against  stealing in Hefei City, against possession of tools and weapons  for criminal purposes in Huainan City, and, together with  Jiangsu, Shandong and Henan, against crimes along the Chiang  Jiang. In fighting road robberies, 3,615 criminals were  arrested and 606 criminal rings destroyed. In the struggle  against the abduction of women and children, 26 criminal dens  were destroyed, 422 abductors arrested, and 660 women and  children freed. The Ministry of Public Security and the  All-China Women's Federation cited Anhui on several occasions  for its notable achievements. Severe punishment has resulted in  social order being much improved, promoting reform and opening  up and economic development. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN  SHE in English 0351 GMT 19 Mar 94)  <H5>  Guangdong </H5>   At the 6 March provincial work meeting for chief procurators  at provincial and city levels, the chief procurator emphasized  continuing to focus on major cases. The key to the  anticorruption struggle would be continuously dealing with cases  involving workers of party and government organizations and  judicial, administrative, law-enforcement, and economic  administrative departments.    In January procuratorate organizations filed 235 economic  criminal cases involving corruption and bribery for  investigation, of which 190 were major cases, accounting for  80.6 percent of all cases filed and involving a total of 6.42  million yuan. (Summary) (Guangzhou Guangdong People's Radio  Network in Mandarin 0400 GMT 7 Mar 94)    On 18 March, 90 persons in charge of the Army, Navy, and Air  Force units in Guangzhou; the People's Armed Police; and public  security organs attending the forum on managing servicemen and  Army vehicles in Guangzhou inspected passing Army vehicles.  Guangzhou Railway Station was the first stop in the move to  crack down on "bogus Army vehicles, bogus Army car plates, and  bogus documents" by Guangzhou Military Region. Four or five  bogus Army vehicles were found. All the owners were outsiders  pretending to be servicemen to solicit customers. A coach  driver shouted for customers in the name of "a hostel run by  Guangdong Military Command," but he was seeking customers for  Tangxi Hotel. In Tianhe District a black Lexus car was stopped,  and the "bogus lieutenant" admitted that he was with a taxation  bureau. The inspection teams found six bogus Army vehicles in  Guangzhou Railway Station, Guangzhou Boulevard, and Guangyuan  Road East. Eleven bogus soldiers were found, four overloaded  Army vehicles were detected, and six Army trucks could not  produce sufficient documents. (Summary) (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO  in Chinese 20 Mar 94 p a5)    Last year Guangzhou City police seized 145.3 kg of heroin  and over 3.9 kg of "ice" and investigated and punished over  6,500 people involved in drug trafficking and drug abuse.    Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau seized 1,425 guns of  various kinds (of which 57 were designed for military use) and  3,237 bullets last year.    Last year, more than 32,000 people in Guangzhou were  involved  in gambling and were punished, and more than 9,700 people were  investigated for being involved in prostitution, patronizing  prostitutes, procuring prostitutes, and harboring prostitutes.    The total value of goods and money confiscated by the  Guangzhou police in criminal cases amounted to more than 310  million yuan.    A Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau report said that the  social order situation in Guangzhou remains quite grim. The  number of serious criminal cases is increasing steadily, the  damage resulting from organized crime is increasing day by day,  and some criminal gangs are becoming underworld societies.  Manifestations of the "seven vices" rise and fall. Road and  fire accidents occur frequently.    The number of cases of missing cars is increasing. Last  year, 965 cars and more than 6,600 motor cycles were stolen in  Guangzhou.    This year the Guangzhou police will make great efforts to  improve Guangzhou's social order and will curb the momentum in  the rising number of major and serious cases, will send more  policemen to patrol the streets, will arm traffic policemen so  that they can take care of both traffic and social order, and  will strengthen the management of people from other localities  and mobilize the residents to set up "small security zones" to  promote the comprehensive improvement of social order.

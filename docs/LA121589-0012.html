			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CHARM, DIGNITY, EXPERIENCE WIN TIARA AT DIFFERENT KIND OF PAGEANT  </P> <P> Nervous pageant contestants whisper among themselves as one woman walks to the  microphone to answer questions from the judges. Radiant in flowing pink  chiffon, she gives her best advice to young people today:  </P> <P> "Get your education. Be honest. And do unto others as you wish to be done by.  That's what my mother taught me when I was a child."  </P> <P> For Mary Jane Rich and her fellow Carson pageant competitors, that was a long  time ago. But it's what qualifies them for this new type of South Bay pageant,  where senior citizens show that being young isn't everything.  </P> <P> No tap dancing, juggling or opera singing under these spotlights. Audiences  won't see a swimsuit all night.  </P> <P> Instead, the women -- and, in some rounds of the pageant, the men -- show  examples of their best handicrafts, read original poetry, talk about their  lives or just try to make the audience laugh.  </P> <P> At the first of six preliminary rounds before the grand pageant in February,  life experience won out. Carson Retirement Center's oldest contestant,  84-year-old Estelle McGowan, took the tiara on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "Just because you're a senior citizen doesn't mean you lose your talents,"  pageant coordinator Mary Lynn Ahsmuhs said. "You don't have to sing and dance  to have a lot to offer."  </P> <P> Ahsmuhs, a co-owner of the Beltone Hearing Aide Center in Torrance, said she  recently moved to Los Angeles from Oklahoma, where retirement pageants are an  elaborate, statewide tradition.  </P> <P> The enthusiasm of the Oklahoma contestants prompted her to try this year to  create a similar program in the South Bay.  </P> <P> "You really don't have to see performing talents. Hobbies are a God-given  talent they can do with their hands," Ahsmuhs said. "All we ask is that they do  something that shows their expertise."  </P> <P> McGowan, a professional seamstress for more than 60 years, took the honors by  showing off both her sunny personality and her colorful crochet projects. She  sells her crafts but charges only what the yarn cost, "because I love to make  people happy."  </P> <P> During the group interview with judges before the pageant, McGowan was far from  a picture of intense competition. Her salt-and-pepper hair neatly braided and a  silk-flower corsage pinned to her favorite blue dress, she sat crocheting  contentedly with yarn that flowed from a knitting bag she had made for the  front of her metal walker.  </P> <P> She stopped her needlework long enough to tell judges why she spends so much  time with her crochet hooks and yarn.  </P> <P> "I can't do nothing else, so it's a nice pastime," McGowan explained, laughing  lightly. "I pray every morning for the Lord to let me do something useful, and  people like these things, so I do this."  </P> <P> During the pageant, McGowan, who is bent from arthritis, shuffled carefully to  the microphone. She showed off the bright orange and pink blocks of an afghan  in the making, purple and white booties and a pink butterfly refrigerator  magnet.  </P> <P> Carole Ware, activities director for the Carson Retirement Center, said it took  some talking to get residents interested in the pageant.  </P> <P> "At first they were saying, 'Beauty pageant? We're no beauties,' " Ware said.  "We wanted to remind them they still have charm, they still have dignity. The  things they used to do, they still can do."  </P> <P> Eventually, seven women agreed to participate. One become ill just before the  pageant and had to drop out.  </P> <P> The six at the pageant seemed a little perplexed by the fuss.  </P> <P> "I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't have a talent but to laugh,"  60-year-old Dot Spindler, a retired bookkeeper, told the audience.  </P> <P> The three judges -- Andrea Reeder, administrator of the Miss Torrance Pageant;  Art Alvarado of Bay Harbor Hospital and Eric Bennett, an account executive for  Senior World Magazine -- read recommendations from center staff members and  chatted with contestants before making their decision.  </P> <P> Ahsmuhs told them to rate contestants in the areas of hobby or talent,  personality, contributions to their retirement center and life philosophy.  </P> <P> When the time came to award the crown, there were none of the tears and squeals  common to television beauty pageants. The winners were announced in traditional  style -- runners-up first.  </P> <P> Despite her modesty, Spindler won the second runner-up award -- a beauty  makeover at a local salon.  </P> <P> As first runner-up, Francis Lapham -- who told the audience about the porcelain  and rag dolls she makes -- won a free dinner at Denny's in Torrance.  </P> <P> McGowan, the center's new queen, will enjoy a free dinner at Tony Roma in  Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> Contestants greeted the pronouncements with calm, pleased smiles but had little  to say afterward.  </P> <P> Five more preliminary pageants will be staged in the next two months at  Huntington Retirement Center, Vermont Retirement Center, Torrance Retirement  Center, Villa Sorrento and Pacific Inn in Torrance. The final pageant will be  at Pacific Inn on Feb. 10.  </P> <P> "We are starting out small, but we know this is going to catch on," Ahsmuhs  said. "You can just see a gleam in their eye. They think, 'People are going to  get to see and notice me because of what I've done in my life.' You can't match  that."  </P></p>

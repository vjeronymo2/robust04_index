			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Non-Japanese to be an md at Komatsu Komatsu, the Japanese construction equipment manufacturer, has appointed Keith Tipping as managing director of its Birtley plant near Gateshead. Tipping, 46, one of Komatsu UK's earliest recruits at Birtley in 1986, is the first non-Japanese managing director of a Komatsu manufacturing plant anywhere in the world. On October 1, he succeeds Toshitake Suketomo, who returns to Japan to take overall responsibility for Komatsu's recently formed International Division for construction equipment. Suketomo will also become non-executive chairman of Komatsu UK. Tipping's appointment comes at the end of a difficult 18 months for Komatsu UK; the recession's impact on the construction industry forced the shedding of 80 jobs at Birtley and the plant made a Pounds 6.62 loss in 1991. But with the first UK-designed Komatsu excavators now in production at Birtley, Tipping believes prospects are becoming muchbrighter. His appointment follows a restructuring of management roles following the departure in June of personnel director Clive Morton, now with Northern Electric. Tipping plans to continue Komatsu UK's commitment to community involvement - and its Japanese-style morning physical exercises for the plant's 350 employees.</p>

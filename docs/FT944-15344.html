			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / HSE to license weapons plants The atomic weapons establishments at Aldermaston, Hampshire, and Burghfield, Berkshire, are to be subjected to licensing by the Health and Safety Executive, the government announced last night, Kevin Brown and Ivor Owen write. Mr Roger Freeman, the junior defence minister, said the government accepted 'in principle' the HSE's recommendation that the plants' immunity from safety licensing should be removed. The announcement, at the end of a Commons debate on defence, followed the release on Monday of the executive's first published annual reports on four nuclear weapons plants. The HSE report on Aldermaston revealed that production of warheads for the Trident submarine system was shut down last year after an incident. Earlier, Mr Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, said the government would curb spending on the homes provided for senior officers and seek cuts in entertainment costs. A government motion approving the defence budget was approved by 321 votes to 32 following a rebellion by Labour leftwingers who voted against the government in spite of instructions from the Labour front bench to abstain. A Labour resolution condemning the government for failing to carry out a comprehensive defence review was defeated by 304 votes to 273, a government majority of 31. Two Conservatives from constituencies with defence establishments voted with Labour. The defence ministry has paid Pounds 28.8m in compensation to female officers and other ranks dismissed because they became pregnant, the government said last night.</p>

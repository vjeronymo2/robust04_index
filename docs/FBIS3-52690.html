			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel and the PLO have agreed to renew the Taba  negotiations on Palestinian self-rule. They are expected to  resume at the beginning of next week. The joint statement was  released this morning in Jerusalem and Tunis. It says the talks  will be held on the basis of the Declaration of Principles  signed in September and the controversial Cairo understandings  reached last week.    In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the joint  statement means that the border issues and the size of the  Jericho enclave are no longer up for negotiation. David Ze'ev  reports:    [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  was cautious this morning. The bitter taste of crisis was still  strong, but the foreign minister also spoke in no uncertain  terms: Israel's right to maintain security control over the  external borders to Jordan and Egypt from the self-rule areas  remains intact, as does its objection to enlarging any further  the Jericho area as was if not agreed upon, at least understood  in last week's Cairo understandings. The joint statement was  signed by Peres for the Israelis and by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas] on behalf of the Palestinians.    Foreign Minister Peres said the Palestinians have learned  that when Israel says it will not back down from its security  needs, it means it. And this time, said Peres, PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat would be best advised not to overrule this joint  statement.    [Peres] I think that if this will be done, we will lose  credibility in the eyes of everybody. I was told that this is a  decision that was taken by the action committee -- I do not know  exactly the name of the institution -- and it is collective  responsibility.    [Ze'ev] This is only one stage. Now the negotiations have  to resume in Taba. How far are we from the implementation of  the Gaza-Jericho First accord?    [Peres] Depends upon the amount of difficulties we may  encounter as we go along. If it will go smoothly, it can be  done in weeks. If we shall again encounter some very  complicated issues, this will take more time. But I believe  that all of us intend to work continuously so we shall really  arrive at a conclusion at the earliest possible date. The land  is not burning. We are not operating under fire. We are  operating under reason.    [Ze'ev] There is room for some maneuvering. Foreign  Minister Peres said Israel has agreed to the PLO's demand for  what were described as stylistic changes to the Cairo  understandings, but otherwise on the agenda, said Peres, will be  the transfer of civilian authorities in a number of areas;  security on the roads; and the details concerning the size and  authority of the Palestinian council that will be in place to  supervise matters once the self-rule arrangement is implemented.  The foreign minister said he believes the existing difficulties  could be resolved, but he preferred not to project whether  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First arrangement will be  completed on schedule by April 13th.

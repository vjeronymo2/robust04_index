On Tuesday [8 February], Zhirinovskiy told Czech Television:  "If Vaclav Havel is not pleased by my possible visit (of the  Czech Republic), then I'm also not pleased that a playwright can  become a president. It's not right." Zhirinovskiy said this  after he had confirmed that he had received an invitation to  visit the Czech Republic from the Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC).    Zhirinovskiy also predicted that in ten years there would be  no more Moravia or Sudetenland. "In ten years the entire Czech  nation will be cursing Havel, just like the Russian people are  cursing Gorbachev," he said. "Vaclav Havel will die and in ten  years young Czechs will be cursing him. (Because the Germans)  will force them to speak German, they will force them to forget  their mother tongue, they will force them to go to German  churches and clean the boots of German officers."    In his regular Sunday radio speech, Havel said: "Mr.  Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he therefore can  come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will be up to him  what he will say here and whether or not our authorities will  consider it appropriate to expel him eventually.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Inspired Indonesia YOU MIGHT have thought there was hardly a corner of the world that had not been plundered of its most vibrant, charming, useful or desirable features. In London, the wares and cultural icons of most countries are displayed in one store or another. Liberty has, however, managed to find somewhere that manages to spring a few surprises: Indonesia. Of course, such fabrics as the beautiful batik and ikat have been available in Britain (although in limited form) for some years, and anyone interested in design will be familiar with their rich patterns. But Liberty has managed to assemble a vast collection. There are rare old batiks from the royal courts; expensive, naturally, and collectable. There are traditional batik designs in blue and white which can be bought by the length as well as a range designed specially for Liberty by Linda Garland, who uses old pieces of batik as her inspiration (all somewhere between Pounds 8.95 and Pounds 9.95 a metre). The fabrics also have been made into throws, cushions, and used as coverings for books, boxes and other daily objects. Liberty's buyers must have had a high old time putting this collection together. They travelled into the heart of Java to find furniture which has survived generations. There are benches made from huge slabs of teak; tables and armchairs hewn from a single piece of wood; wooden chests; beds on wheels; teak plates and bowls; and highly-decorative painted pieces. There are marvellous carved and painted small trunks - at around Pounds 95 each, and about 2 1/2 by 1 1/2 ft, they would make good coffee or lamp tables. There is a very small collection of the highly sought-after Javanese furniture made by the Dutch East India Import Company (now known as VSO Company furniture, and very collectable because of its rarity). For example, a large cupboard - about 8 ft tall by 4 ft wide, and useful for storing clothes or textiles - sells for about Pounds 995, while another matching pair is Pounds 1,500. Less expensively, there is Balinese silver which, with prices starting as low as Pounds 10, is excellent value. Those who have been to Indonesia will enjoy the exhibition for the memories it revives, as well as the beauty of the wares. Those who have not are likely to be charmed by this glimpse of another very different world. I suspect that few will come away without buying something. The 'Indonesia' exhibition is in the basement of Liberty, Regent Street, London W1, until May 7.</p>

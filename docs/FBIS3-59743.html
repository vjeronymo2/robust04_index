			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has firmed  up its approach for building the legal policies to allow the  large scale light emission facility ``SPring-8'' to function as  a facility open to outside organizations. Spring-8 is being  built by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI,  Akikazu SHIMAMURA, director) and the Institute of Physical and  Chemical Research (RIKEN, Minoru ODA, director) at the Harima  Science Park City in Hyogo Prefecture. The STA has clarified the  system for the maintenance, management and use of SPring-8, and  the goal is to make a world class nuclear research facility that  is a Center of Excellence which will provide the light emissions  necessary for basic research in broad range of science and  technology fields such as materials science and life science.  The budget related to this proposal will be presented at the  next normal meeting of the Diet for the following fiscal year.    SPring-8 is a facility in which electrons accelerated up to  eight billion electron-volts are continually circulated in an  accumulation ring with a circumference of 1,436 meters.  Researchers fervently hope that light be will shed on the  1/100,000,000 cm world by using the emitted light that is  generated whenever the orbit of the electrons is bent. The beam  lines which will put out the emitted light will be made widely  available not only to Japanese industrial, academic and  governmental institutions, but also to research organizations  abroad.    Currently, the group responsible for construction is the  Joint Team for the Planning and Promotion of the Large Scale  Light Emission Facility, which is jointly composed by JAERI and  RIKEN. &yen;38.5 billion in business expenses has been invested  up to the current fiscal year, and budgets will be appropriated  successively every year up to the actual joint opening in FY  1998. Because ``it appears that construction is making smooth  progress,'' (Yoshishige ARATA, Director of the Bureau For the  Promotion of Science and Technology), the current action is to  set the pace for the fulfillment of the utilization system based  on legislative policy. In the current Research Exchange  Promotion Law, there seems to be difficulties with fully opening  SPring-8 to extramural organizations.</p>

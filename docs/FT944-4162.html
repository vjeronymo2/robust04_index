			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Exchange stamps on rumours - Share trading The Stock Exchange again demonstrated yesterday its commitment to force companies to make public statements when there is an unexpected surge in trading in their shares, Robert Peston writes. Yesterday's victim was SG Warburg, one of the Exchange's own member firms. After a flurry of trading in Warburg's shares when the market opened at 8.30am, the merchant bank was forced to announce - a week ahead of schedule  -that it is in merger talks with the US investment bank, Morgan Stanley. However the rumour sweeping the stock market which led to this surge made no reference to Morgan Stanley. The speculation was that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was about to launch a tender for 14.9 per cent of Warburg. The previous day there had been a rumour linking Warburg with JP Morgan - speculation that has surfaced several times over the past few years. The announcement of the actual transaction being negotiated by the two banks was made at 10.48am. Prior to that, 2.1m Warburg shares had been traded, almost four times the total for Wednesday, a typical day. Because of this unexpected increase in trading volumes, the Exchange had telephoned Warburg's stockbroker, Cazenove, at around 9am, to inquire whether there was a reason to put Warburg's shares on 'indicative' status. That would have temporarily relieved market makers, the wholesaler of shares, of their obligation to deal at prices quoted on the SEAQ computerised share price system - and would have been a signal to the market that a statement would be coming. Before the shares went indicative, at 9.35am, Cazenove contacted its client, Warburg - which then woke up the management of Morgan Stanley in the US.</p>

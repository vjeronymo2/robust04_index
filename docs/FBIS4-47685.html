			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC officials Humphrey Khoza, Pieter </F> Cronje, and Kumi Naidoo at the media center at Gallagher Estate  in Midrand -- live]    [Excerpt] [Khoza] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and  good morning to you, South Africa. This morning, we are going  to once again give you an update on the elections so far,  particularly the counting process and progress. However, before  we start I am pleased to say that we sincerely hope we will be  getting here a number of commissioners to come and give you  geographic details in terms of what happened during the voting  process during the two, three days in some areas, and also bring  you up to (?speed) about specifics of counting stations in their  respective provinces.    Before we proceed I am now going to hand you over to my  colleague on the extreme left, my left that is, Pieter Cronje,  to give you the latest results as we have them. Over to you,  Pieter.    [Cronje] Good morning. The latest results as at 11:14 AM for  the National Assembly are as follows: PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress], 27,915; Soccer Party, 1,649; VF/FF  [Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front], 95,994; WLP [Worker's List  Party], 622; WRPP [Women's Rights Peace Party], 1,661; XPP  [Ximoko Progressive Party], 677; ACDP [African Christian  Democratic Party], 14,585; ADM [African Democratic Movement],  1,073; AMCP [African Moderates Congress Party], 7,107; AMP  [African Muslim Party], 3,087; ANC, 1,267,462; DP [Democratic  Party], 62,771; DPSA [Dikwankwentla Party of South Africa],  2,772; FP [Federal Party], 2,940; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party],  70,364; KISS [Keep It Straight and Simple Party], 1,284; Lusap  [LUSO-South African Party], 625; MF [Minority Front], 1,710; NP  [National Party], 814,260; Rejected, 43,214. And the total, as  at 11:14 AM today, 2,421,772.    I also have for you ladies and gentlemen a statement:  Yesterday afternoon, the commission of the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] took an important decision to release  results as soon as they became available. That is at a point at  which the results were still formally unverifiable. The  separation of the verification process from the process of  compilation of the results was successfully completed by about  10:00 PM last night. As a consequence of which the flow of  results began to increase exponentially. Where the count had  formerly stood at about 30,000 late yesterday afternoon, the  position unverified, is presently approaching 5 million,  enabling a clearer picture of trends to emerge, and we believe  easing the minds of the electorate about the flow and ultimate  success of this second stage of the electoral process.    Nevertheless, the commission is of the view that the process  should be completed by tomorrow night, and further efforts are  being made to speed up the process of delivering unverified  results. The verification process continues as a parallel  process, and the results of this process will be fed into the  commission's determination of the freeness and fairness of the  result.    Outstanding issues will continue to be dealt with after the  formal announcement of the result, and these issues may cause  minor, if not marginal adjustments to the final picture. Such  adjustments are not expected to affect the overall picture. By  last night this adjustment of the counting process had  dramatically improved the flow of results to the electorate, and  as things stand this morning results known are already showing  the development of clear trends nationally and in certain  provinces.    Three major provincial counting centers, those are Pretoria  Show Grounds, and Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], in the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and at the  Durban Expo Center in Natal, are expected to begin delivering  their results during the course of this morning. As these  centers kick into the process, we expect the counting flow to  increase substantially, moving the results process much closer  to finalization.    There has also been some questions about the issue of  reconciliation, and for an explanation of that I hand you to my  colleague Kumi Naidoo.    [Naidoo] There have been several questions with regard to  reconciliation. I will just read the questions out the way that  they are put to us first, and then give you the response. The  first question was....    [Announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] We'll just take my  voice over of what's happening at the press conference there,  just to remind you that as far strictly the results are  concerned, if you sense a small discrepancy in what we already  know and what we hear from the IEC press conference, it is  simply because by virtue of the fact that our results are  slightly ahead--so that discrepancy that you sense is simply  because you're ahead of the IEC official announcement there, so  keep staying with us.    [Naidoo] Officials acting together with the party voting  agents at a particular counting center. Where there is  consensus with the regard to those ballot boxes that have not  yet been reconciled then the counting can proceed with regard to  those specific ballot boxes. Where there might be objections by  any political party, then there is an objection form, prescribed  form, where such objections will be noted. The important point  to note is that these ballot boxes will be separated out and  will be (?recorded) separately in the count.    The second question was: Does this mean we won't know if  extra ballot boxes stuffed with ballots of unknown origins get  slipped into the count? The answer to that is no. We will know  because of the specialized voting station stamp for each voting  station. The voting station number will be on the ballot paper  statement which will be prepared by the presiding officer and  will be checked with the ballots in that particular box.    Thirdly, does this mean we won't know if ballot boxes have  been stolen, mislaid, or lost? The answer there is no, we will  know, because the reconciliation of the ballot boxes itself is  seen as part of the registration and receipt process of the  ballot boxes, which you remember yesterday we said there was a  first phase of the counting process, and that will still  continue. The reconciliation process that the judge referred to  last night, deals primarily with the reconciliation between the  ballot paper statements per ballot box, and the contents of that  box.    Fourth: Has any other election in the world being conducted  without reconciliation? In the elections with a voter's role  reconciliation processes are fairly standard. Countries with an  established electoral system generally have voter's lists.  However, with regard to countries without a voter's role, at  this stage we are not able to confirm whether there are other  similar precedents. We are consulting with our international  commissioners for a speedy answer with regard to this query.    The next question: Where do all the unmarked ballot papers  go now? They are secured at a safe place immediately after the  count. The act provides for the commission to assess all the  returned electoral materials and to destroy them after 30 days  have passed after the count. This would include not only ballot  papers but various other types of forms and other stationary  that cannot be used again.    The next question is when will these unused ballot papers be  counted? These will be done at the counting station and is part  of the documentation that will be worked on by the counting  centers' staff, after the vote itself is done.    And the question that leads on from that is: Will the IEC  try to trace the so-called missing ballots? The answer to that  is yes, and as you probably know already, the IEC has already  instituted two investigations, an internal and an external one.    Okay, there were some additional questions which arrived a  bit late, and I will just respond to them now: What is the  difference between rejected votes and spoilt votes? My  understanding is that there isn't a difference. So, It's just a  issue of terminology. The next question I don't know how to  answer? How did voting go in the hostels on the Rand? Was it  peaceful or tense? I'm not sure whether you can actually have a  peaceful election, and be tense at the same time. But  indications are that there was no reports of violence, and that  elections proceeded smoothly on the hostels generally. [passage  omitted]</p>

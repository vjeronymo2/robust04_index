			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / IMF entry some way off for republics IT could take at least nine months for Russia to become a member of the International Monetary Fund despite the launch of its radical price reforms, western diplomats and officials said yesterday. Apart from statistical difficulties - 'depending on which exchange rate you use to measure Russia's economic wealth, it can be ranked either with the United Kingdom, Holland or Colombia', explained one western expert - there are also likely to be objections from existing members which risk being supplanted in the IMF's pecking order. Another problem is avoiding offending individual commonwealth republics by admitting say, Russia, long before Ukraine. In a significant shift in policy, the Bush administration supports full membership of the IMF for Russia and other reformist republics as soon as possible. The shift recognises that the IMF is best placed to shoulder the burden of direct financial aid and to offer expert advice on a comprehensive reform programme. The IMF's main task now is defining individual republics' so-called quota - this determines a member's capital in the Fund and by definition the amount of money it is allowed to withdraw. The US, with the largest quota, has the biggest influence on the outcome. An IMF team arrives in Moscow next week for a three week mission to help draw up a shadow economic reform programme for Russia - embracing other essential reform elements such as a budgetary and monetary policy. The first opportunity for discussion of IMF membership for Russia and other republics will come at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in New York soon. The ministers are expected to discuss Soviet economic problems as well as western interest rate policy. The former Soviet Union's economic troubles will dominate another international gathering when the Soviet Union's 18 main Paris Club creditors meet in Paris today to finalise an agreement deferring repayment of principal on long and medium-term debts. Agreement has so far been held up by US demands that Russia should publicly promise not to prop up the foreign banking subsidiaries of Vnesheconombank, debt manager for former Soviet republics. The US is saying that this would be a waste of money saved by western debt concessions, but the demand for a public disavowal of the banks is opposed by European countries with such subsidiaries on their territory, such as Germany, France and Britain.</p>

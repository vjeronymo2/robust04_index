			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong kong, May 27 (AFP)--A leading human rights  monitor rounded on President Bill Clinton on Friday [27 May] for  renewing China's preferential trade status, lashing it as "one  more capitulation" that would imperil dozens of activists for  democracy. The organisation, Human Rights Watch/Asia, scorned  Clinton's assessment that China had complied with several  conditions on human rights that he linked to renewal of  most-favoured-nation status, which gives Chinese goods lucrative  customs access to the US market.    "Far from improving, the overall human rights situation has  significantly worsened in the year since (Clinton's) executive  order (on MFN conditions) was issued," the group said in a  statement issued here. The decision was "one more capitulation  on human rights," the statement said.    "President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on  China to improve its human rights practices," said Sidney Jones,  Human Rights Watch/Asia's executive director. "Clinton has left  his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while  the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed,  uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by  this decision."    Human Rights Watch/Asia -- formerly known as Asia Watch --  enjoys a strong reputation as an independent monitor of human  rights in China. Earlier this month, it released a report  documenting what it said were the cases of several hundred  protesters, seized in the crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy  movement, who remain behind bars.    The statement issued Friday said the leading dissidents,  workers and religious activists would now be more vulnerable to  persecution and arrest, given that Chinese leaders "understand  that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade."  "Dozens of dissidents had their trials or sentences postponed  while the Chinese government awaited Washington's decision," it  said. "Now they can happen with little fear of persecution."</p>

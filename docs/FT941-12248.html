			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / European bourses surge to record closing levels European equity markets yesterday swept to record highs after an active day's trading, writes John Pitt. Bullish sentiment was helped by a combination of factors: resolution of the political crisis in Tokyo; good inflation data from the US on Friday; an agreement restricting world aluminium production; and strength in car stocks after the BMW-Rover deal. Records were set in the UK with the FT-SE 100 index of leading companies rising 1.3 per cent, to finish up 44.4 at 3,491.8; in France, where the CAC-40 index added 1 per cent; in Switzerland, where the SMI index set its fifth consecutive high; and in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Stockholm. Only Germany failed to outstrip its previous best, although the Dax index gained 2 per cent. With hopes of a cut in European interest rates this month, further gains are expected this week.

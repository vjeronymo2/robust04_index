			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Emergency package to create jobs in Spain SPAIN'S socialist government, which faces one of the most serious unemployment problems in the European Community, yesterday announced an emergency package of job creation measures. The package, which will be debated in parliament next week, is a belated response to a sharp rise in unemployment which set in last autumn. Unemployment figures released earlier this month revealed that nearly half a million jobs were lost during 1992, bringing the total number of jobless to a record 3.05m, equivalent to 20.06 per cent of the labour force. Yesterday's package includes fiscal benefits for medium and small companies, new guidelines on apprenticeship schemes and incentives for companies with part-time employees. It also includes a provision for extending by one year the three-year labour contracts that cover about a third of Spanish workers. Under existing labour regulations companies have either to dismiss an employee when a contract expires or offer permanent employment. Government officials said the measures, partly financed by EC cohesion funds and European Investment Bank loans, will have no impact on the restrictive 1993 budget, which is intended to lower the government deficit and inflation in order to meet convergence targets ahead of European monetary union. The government insists that the peseta will remain within the European Monetary System and the Bank of Spain has intervened throughout the week to keep the currency in the middle of its 6 per cent fluctuation band within the exchange rate mechanism and close to Pta72 to the D-Mark.</p>

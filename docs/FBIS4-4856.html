			<p>BFN     [Text] Mito, April 6 KYODO -- Ibaraki Gov. Masaru  Hashimoto received more shady political donations during the  election campaign last September in addition to the one already  revealed, well-placed sources said Wednesday [6 April].  Hashimoto received a total of 1.05 million yen from a surveying  company and the president of a construction firm, both in  Ibaraki Prefecture, which had obtained contracts from the  prefecture.    Hashimoto was criticized at the prefectural assembly last  month for receiving 1.5 million yen from Sumitomo Heavy  Industries Ltd., which was involved in a bribery scandal  concerning the garbage disposal facilities in Tsukuba.    The Sumitomo contribution was suspected to be illegal since  the Tokyo-based company was a contractor for the prefecture's  public works projects. Hashimoto later donated 1.5 million yen  to a public organization and revised his report on political  funds during the election campaign.    According to an investigation by the prefecture, Hashimoto  received 50,000 yen from the Ibaraki surveying firm, which  received contracts from the prefecture. He also received a  contribution of 1 million yen from a construction company  president, but this was apparently not illegal because it was  made by an individual.    Hashimoto said it was a "simple, elementary mistake," and  has  already revised the declarations concerning the two donations in  his campaign financial report.    Hashimoto was elected governor last September to succeed  Fujio Takeuchi, who was indicted on charges of taking bribes  from Hazama Corp., a major construction firm.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Both ways - Ballot Box The FT Election Share Index drew a mixed bag of phone calls on its first day yesterday: a broker and a radio station wanting to quote it, and a constituent commenting ever-so-politely on its place in the index. The company concerned is BET, which made a lot of play a year or so ago of its role as a one-stop supplier of business services. This led brokers to argue that profits might suffer if BET had to pay a Labour national minimum wage to its armies of cleaners and security guards, and qualified it for a place in the Conservative win/Labour defeat section of the index. Yesterday's phone call pointed out that BET also has a UK construction arm, which might benefit from a Labour government's infrastructure spending. Nice try: BET wins a small prize for attempting to position itself as the first each-way bet of the campaign.</p>

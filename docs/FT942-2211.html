			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japan to make loans to S Africa The Japanese government is to extend its first ever sovereign loans to South Africa. The credits will be part of a package of measures expected to be unveiled by the prime minister, Mr Tsutumo Hata, at next month's summit of leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples. Foreign Ministry officials said a mission would leave for South Africa later this week to look at specific projects for infrastructural investment. The total value of the loans on offer would be decided after the mission's report. Likely areas for investment included telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. The package of measures will also include up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 329m) in trade and investments insurance over the next two years, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). Miti officials said the decision is in response to a recent US request that industrialised nations increase aid to Pretoria for its economic rehabilitation programme under the presidency of Mr Nelson Mandela. The move comes at a time of growing interest by Japanese companies in South Africa. Several utility companies and trading houses have established trading links since sanctions were lifted in 1991. Last month Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading companies, established a joint venture with Associated Manganese Mines to exploit new mines. Japan is South Africa's fourth largest trading partner. Until recently the country was one of the few in the world to have a bilateral trade surplus with Japan. But the slump in Japanese domestic demand has been reflected in a sharp fall in imports from South Africa. Last year, Japanese exports totalled Dollars 2bn while imports were Dollars 1.9bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The information department of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Republic told a KHOVAR correspondent that  armed groups of the Islamic Rebirth Party of Tajikistan have  assembled in the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan close to the  residential areas of Darvoz and Shugnan rayons and the Khorog  city of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast of Tajikistan.    Their aim is to cross over to the territory of Tajikistan  and  wage armed struggles in the future against the government forces  and to reach the Khoburabot Pass. Mercenaries from other  countries are also included in the armed groups.    Leadership of the Afghan province of Badakhshan, including  its military commander Abdol Khalid (Basir), are not doing  anything to stop the movement and operation of the armed groups  on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.    Explaining the situation, the headquarters of the group of  Russian border guards in Tajikistan said that decisive measures  will be taken against the armed groups attempting to violate and  cross the border.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Guinness deal goes flat for LVMH  -Shareholders will be seeking an explanation When two companies announce a deal and one sees its shares dive down while the other's shoot up, the first company has a problem. This is the position in which LVMH, the French luxury goods group, found itself after last Thursday's announcement that it had renegotiated its seven-year-old cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks concern. Mr Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman, is spending most of this week trying to repair the damage. 'I thought the benefits of the agreement were obvious,' he says. 'But perhaps we should have done more to explain them.' The analysts who follow LVMH would certainly agree. The new agreement was announced at a London conference, organised by Guinness, with only one LVMH director present. The French group did not hold its own conference in Paris. LVMH, having seen its shares fall by 5.5 per cent to FFr3,815 from FFr4,037 by last Friday, summoned the Paris analysts to a briefing this Thursday. The shares promptly rallied on Monday and yesterday rose again to FFr3920 from FFr3840. 'We should be able to explain everything on Thursday,' says Mr Arnault. 'Better late than never.' In theory Mr Arnault's explanation ought to be fairly easy. The new agreement involves Guinness selling its indirect 24 per cent stake in LVMH to Christian Dior and Au Bon Marche (two other companies controlled by Mr Arnault) for Pounds 1.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and paying Pounds 902m to LVMH for a 34 per cent holding in Moet Hennessy, the latter's champagne and cognac business. LVMH has also agreed to reduce its Guinness holding (worth around Pounds 400m) from 24 per cent to 20 per cent by the end of June. Guinness should benefit by concentrating its LVMH investment in drinks, the area of the business it knows best, and raising Pounds 416m in cash. But Mr Arnault can also point to advantages for LVMH. Dior and Bon Marche will, after all, pay for the deal. LVMH will emerge with a slightly smaller stake in Guinness and enough cash to reduce its net debt from FFr15bn to FFr4bn. Why then have LVMH's shareholders reacted so badly? One reason was the group's misjudgment in failing to explain its side of the story. Another is that the deal should slightly dilute LVMH's earnings in 1995 and 1996. But the main factor is that Guinness's withdrawal leaves Mr Arnault in complete control of LVMH at a time of growing concern about his strategy. Mr Arnault, 44, made his name in the 1980s as an ambitious young businessman who planned to revitalise the anachronistic French corporate scene with his aggressive Anglo-Saxon tactics. 'Investors liked him because he was so different from the old French industrialists,' says Ms Marie-Laure Favre-Gilly, an analyst at Baring Securities in Paris. 'He really seemed to be financially-driven: always looking at the bottom line.' But analysts suspect that Mr Arnault has changed. They have long complained about his fondness for chic soirees staged by his fashion houses. The final straw was last year's acquisition of La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial newspaper. 'Why invest in newspapers?' says Ms Favre-Gilly. 'It makes him look like a megalomaniac.' Analysts are worried that Mr Arnault may spend the proceeds of the new Guinness agreement to finance other such deals for LVMH. Mr Arnault denies this. 'My sole preoccupation is the bottom line,' he says. 'I'm the biggest single shareholder in LVMH. All I care about is increasing our profits and our share price.' So why did he buy La Tribune? 'Because we also have a wider responsibility,' he says. 'This was a French company that could have fallen into foreign hands.' Is such a sentiment compatible with his professed obsession with profitability? 'Of course,' he says. 'La Tribune was a tiny deal. We bought it for a low price and we'll get a good return.' But Mr Arnault insists he has no intention of making more investments in newspapers. 'No one need worry on that score,' he says. 'I'm absolutely clear about our strategy. LVMH is the world leader in the luxury goods industry and that's where we'll expand.' His aim, he says, is to launch new products for the group's established brands and buy other luxury brand names that he can develop. He also plans to fill the gaps in LVMH's portfolio by buying businesses in fields such as jewellery. 'It's an attractive area for us,' says Mr Arnault. 'But we'll only move if the right company comes up at the right price. We're not in a hurry.'</p>

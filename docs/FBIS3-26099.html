			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F> (7812 5261 0079): "Chen Yun Favors Massive Party Rectification"]    [Text]The CPC Central Committee Secretariat  circulated a letter which Chen Yun wrote to the Political Bureau  after the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee. In the letter Chen Yun touched on 15 points, three  of which are essential-- specifically, first, corruption of the  party; second, the causes of corruption; and third, a suggestion  for party rectification.    Chen Yun is a typical CPC member who always bears the  party's  fate in mind although being confined to bed all year round.    He has racked his brains to find a way to save the party. He  has written to the central authorities again and again, and made  one suggestion after another.    In order to save the party, he has defended  Marxism-Leninism,  criticized the Deng line, and lodged objections, going against  the trend.    With the same motive, he recently did two things. First, he  wrote a letter to the Political Bureau; and second, he met and  talked with Deng Xiaoping in Hangzhou, where he was recuperating.    It is believed that he was trying to exert pressure by  writing the letter and through his talks with Deng. And one  cannot completely rule out the influence of these moves. In the  letter to the Political Bureau he did make some sensational  remarks too. After all Chen Yun still indulges in the illusion  of putting the clock back to 40 years ago.  <H5>  Chen Yun Is Afraid That the Party Will Lose Its Leadership </H5>   On 3 January 1994 the CPC Central Committee's secretariat  circulated a letter Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau after the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. A brief note was added by the CPC Central  Committee Secretariat upon the circulation of the letter: This  letter Comrade Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau fully displays the absolute devotion of a  revolutionary of the older generation to the cause of the party  and the people and his utmost concern for the development of the  party. We suggest that you conscientiously review your  departments' conditions against this letter. Doing so will be  beneficial to the party's work. The secretariat has circulated  Chen Yun's letter, in the form of a special document, among the  party committees of all the ministries, departments,  commissions, and committees of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council, as well as the party committees of all the  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central authorities.    As disclosed by the document, Chen Yun pointed out in his  letter that the party's high priority task under the present  complicated and drastically changing international circumstances  is to build the party well and to pay greater attention to party  building. If the party does not take care of the party ranks,  they will become disunited, the party will lose its coherence  and combative force, hence the people's support and its  leadership.  <H5>  "Localism and Factionalism Are Prevalent" </H5>   Chen Yun touched on 15 issues:    1. As far as party building is concerned, people lack a firm  political orientation, and they think that politics is nothing  but empty talk.    2. People have basically overlooked the value of Marxist  theory in the new period and its importance as a guide for the  party in its work.    3. Not only non-Marxist ideologies exist within the party,  but also an anti-Marxist tendency and ideological trend is  prevailing.    4. In the past few years, the party basically gave up its  efforts regarding ideological work as well as education and  propaganda on Marxism.    5. As far as propaganda on reform and opening up is  concerned, the party's propaganda department has overlooked  propaganda and education on socialist morality and style.    6. Now the political quality of the ranks of party and  government cadres and the spirit supporting them to work for the  cause of the people and the party have seriously deteriorated.    7. The party spirit and sense of organization and discipline  on the part of party members, including old party members, have  become unprecedentedly blunted.    8. Localism, individualism, and factionalism have been  prevailing and spreading unchecked among local party  organizations and departments, which has weakened the party's  centralized leadership and the comprehensive implementation of  the party's principles and policies.  <H3>  "It Is Suggested That a Comprehensive and Thorough  Consolidation of Party Organizations Be Carried Out" </H3>   9. Anarchism and liberalism have become common and serious  tendencies among leading party cadres.    10. Money worship of the capitalist world has corroded the  party's ranks, and the will power of CPC members has been  weakened amid peaceful evolution.    11. The role of party cadres and members in influencing and  educating their family members and relatives has become a very  prominent issue within the party.    12. Some party and government departments have become so  corrupt that not only the party's leadership has been weakened,  but also their corrupt practices have aroused grievances and  protests among the public.    13. It is suggested that both the central and local  authorities carry out a comprehensive and thorough consolidation  of party organizations to get rid of corrupt and degenerate  bureaucrats and to cultivate a fine atmosphere that will help to  promote the party and the people's interests.    14. It is necessary to select, from the central level and  localities, some upright and capable comrades of strong party  spirit and great resolution, including non-CPC members and  comrades of advanced age but still in good health, to replenish  discipline inspection commissions and supervisory commissions at  all levels.    15. It is suggested that the interim organization--"the  central leading anti-corruption office" be placed under the  direct leadership of the Political Bureau Standing Committee;  and that a thorough investigation be carried out for a period of  time, since this operation is a task of general significance and  top priority.    There are three keynotes in the 15 points raised by Chen  Yun--namely, first, corruption within the party; second, the  causes for corruption; and third, the suggestion for a party  rectification.  <H5>  Party Rectification Is Useless to Improvement of Party Style </H5>   The so-called party rectification means "to carry out a  relatively comprehensive and thorough consolidation with a view  to weeding out corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats." Chen Yun  has an extremely deep love for the party and is extremely eager  to save the party. However, cadres in Beijing who are well  informed of the situation do not appreciate Chen Yun's proposal.  Instead they make a mockery of Chen Yun's hidebound thinking,  saying that he is but "an old, stubborn conservative."    The CPC launched a few rounds of party rectification in the  past. Before its rise to power, there were two major party  rectifications, one took place from 1941 to 1945, and the other  in 1947-48. After its rise to power, party rectifications were  carried out during three periods, from 1950 to 1954, in 1957,  and from 1969 to 1971. After Mao Zedong's death, another party  rectification was conducted during 1983-87. During these major  party rectifications, hundreds of thousands of party members  were expelled from the party (238,000 party members were  expelled in June 1953 alone). But has party style ever been  improved and has party discipline ever been strengthened after  party rectifications? To be honest, the further the party  rectification goes, the more corrupt the party will be. Not to  mention the previous rounds of party rectification, but let us  take the 1983-87 party rectification as an example. This latest  party rectification urged "fighting against all kinds of abuse  of official power to seek personal interests." But after this  party rectification, abuse of official power for personal  interests has become more common among party members and cadres.  This in turn gave rise to the mass movement against official  profiteering, corruption, and privileges in 1989. Chen Yun now  picks a futile remedy and expects it to work as a miraculous  cure. This implies nothing but that the CPC has become so  corrupt as to be incurable.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Car parts sector faces slow growth The number of cars in the UK will grow by nearly 5m to just under 29m by the end of the decade, but there is no prospect of the replacement parts sector matching this growth, warns a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Demand by vehicle manufacturers for longer-lasting components is the most significant of a number of 'radical' changes within the sector that are already constraining growth, says the report. The EIU, in its first large-scale study of the replacement-parts sector for four years, has found that the market has shrunk slightly - mainly in the recession - since 1989. And in spite of a swiftly rising new-car market, the study predicts growth for the replacement-parts sector of less than 2 per cent a year between now and 1996. This would lift sales from an estimated Pounds 4.08bn this year to Pounds 4.34bn in 1996. Vehicle makers are demanding that some important components last the life of the car, the study says. Other components are also lasting longer, 'sometimes by as much as 100 per cent'. The study adds: 'Long term this may prove to be the single most important factor in determining the future of this market.' Profit margins are being squeezed by greatly increased competition, to the benefit of consumers. For example, vehicle makers have been forced to reduce their own replacement-parts prices to compete with independents. Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot have also opened up dealer-based 'fast fit' networks, in an attempt to wrest back business lost to groups such as Kwik-Fit Euro. The study has found 'decline or at least stagnation' in the parts distribution sector, with cash and carry outlets worst hit in terms of business closures. However, 'retail chains, superstores and service centres have not maintained their promised growth and their profits have suffered'. The UK Market for Replacement Car Parts: 1994 Edition.

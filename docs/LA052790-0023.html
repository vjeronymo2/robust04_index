			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL KILLINGS  </P> <P> It is virtually impossible these days to see a European film without animal  killings.  </P> <P> Saura stabs horses, Bertolucci shoots ducks, crushes cats and stabs pigs,  Chabrol beheads geese and others cut the throats of sheep and goats. In "Cinema  Paradiso," a heifer is knifed to death.  </P> <P> The Humane Society says it has no jurisdiction over European and Latin American  productions, but it should attempt to restrict the viewing of this unfortunate  suffering by warning animal lovers to stay away. Instead, we give the directors  Academy Awards.  </P> <P> ALEX GORDON  </P> <P> Vice President, Flying A Pictures  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

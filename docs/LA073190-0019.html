			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRANCES ROMIE; RETIRED PHYSICIAN  </P> <P> Frances Romie, a retired Canoga Park doctor who was one of the first single  women in California to adopt a child, has died in Tarzana. She was 68.  </P> <P> A general practitioner and surgeon specializing in gynecology and obstetrics,  she delivered thousands of babies during her career, which spanned from the  late 1950s until her retirement in 1988.  </P> <P> She died Friday of cancer, said her son Leonard K. Romie.  </P> <P> Born in Midland, Pa., Dr. Romie worked as a registered nurse and volunteered  her services during World War II, which inspired her to become a doctor. She  earned her bachelor's degree in science from UCLA in the late 1940s and  graduated from medical school at the University of Rome in the early 1950s.  </P> <P> Dr. Romie returned to the United States and opened her practice at her Canoga  Park house. She later tore down the house and built an office on the property.  </P> <P> In 1962 she adopted a son, Leonard, at time when unmarried men and women were  not commonly selected to be adoptive parents, said a spokeswoman with the Los  Angeles County Department of Children's Services. Four years later, she adopted  a second son, Jerry, whom she had delivered.  </P> <P> She is also survived by her brothers Anthony Romeo of Augusta, Ga., and Frank  Romie of Oxnard; a sister, Mary Artisti of Sharpsburg, Pa.; and a grandson.  </P> <P> A funeral service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Chapel of the Oaks, Oakwood  Memorial Park, 22601 Lassen St., Chatsworth. Burial will follow at the same  location. Gates, Kingsley &amp; Gates Funeral Directors is handling the  arrangements.  </P></p>

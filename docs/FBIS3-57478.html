On the Russian Foreign Minister's Visit to Beijing"]    [Text] Beijing -- The Chinese, it seems, are indeed  genuinely happy at the three-day visit by our foreign minister,  who arrived here on Wednesday [26 January]. Kozyrev promised to  visit Beijing three months ago but was delayed. He was not the  only one. The visit by Aleksandr Shokhin, head of the Russian  side of the Russian-Chinese Interstate Cooperation Commission,  has been postponed four times and now no one knows whether it  will take place at all.    Of course, it was our purely internal problems which were to  blame for all of this. But Chinese diplomacy, which has  recently been making progress in relations with the United  States, Europe, and countries in the Asia and Pacific region,  was painfully aware of a certain stagnation in dealings with  Russia and saw no Russian interlocutors even as high as deputy  foreign minister.    However, the two states have things to discuss. It is a  little over a year since Boris Yeltsin's visit to China, during  which over 20 agreements were signed, the majority of which are  not in operation.    Some agreements have brought unexpected results. The accord  on visa-free tourist exchange is in itself absolutely normal.  But in practice it has transpired that sometimes it is only the  tour guide makes it back to China.    Another problem that Kozyrev will probably have to discuss  in  Beijing is connected with the agreement, now in abeyance, on the  construction of a nuclear power station here with Russian  assistance. The accord on this was reached a year ago and the  Russian side, which is extremely interested in this major order  for its now idle "Energomash" plant, promised China a  substantial credit for this construction project. Since then  the Chinese, who incidentally have an acute need for electric  power, have not returned to this topic for a reason which  perhaps our foreign minister will try to find out.    Apart from everything else, during Kozyrev's visit to  Beijing  he is going to read a lecture on the fundamentals of Russia's  Asia policy at the Institute of People's Diplomacy. This is of  particular interest because there are those who think that  Russia does not have such a policy.</p>

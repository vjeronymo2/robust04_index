			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS WASTE HITS, FALL TO THE BLUE JAYS AGAIN  </P> <P> The Angels' performances are becoming as stale as summer reruns.  </P> <P> This is the plot: Reaching double figures in hits, the offense short-circuits  and reaches double figures in runners left on base. The Angels suffer for the  lack of one timely hit, one spark.  </P> <P> Except for a few minor details, their 4-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays  Wednesday night at the SkyDome was a replay of the Angels' 5-2 loss Tuesday  night. They collected 12 hits (compared with 15 on Tuesday) and stranded 10  runners, compared with 13 Tuesday. In both games they had runners on base in  every inning except the seventh.  </P> <P> "Getting that one hit, that's what separates the first division from the second  division," Brian Downing said. "They give you a run, you get it."  </P> <P> The Angel lost for the eighth time in their last 11 games and are 11 1/2 games  out of first place in the AL West.  </P> <P> "Eventually all these hits might turn into a bunch of runs," said catcher Lance  Parrish, who led off the sixth inning with a home run against John Cerutti  (5-6).  </P> <P> "Jack (Howell) is hitting, Wally (Joyner) has started to come around. We might  be on the verge of some tremendous streak. . . . (But) we can't keep getting 11  hits or whatever and getting two runs every day."  </P> <P> According to Angel Manager Doug Rader, two runs should have been enough to make  a winner of Jim Abbott (5-7). Toronto's two first-inning runs were unearned,  the result of a throwing error by Abbott on a short grounder by Tony Fernandez  that Rader said should have been played by Howell, the third baseman.  </P> <P> Abbott's throw bounced into the dirt in front of first base, where Joyner  juggled it but couldn't hold on. Fernandez went to third on Glenallen Hill's  double and scored on George Bell's sacrifice fly. Hill scored when center  fielder Devon White's throw home went into the stands on the third base side.  </P> <P> Rader also deemed the Blue Jays' second-inning run preventable. Ken Williams  doubled with one out and was breaking for third with Tom Lawless at bat. Howell  broke to cover the bag in case of a throw, and Lawless singled into short left  field to score Williams.  </P> <P> "The game came down to the appropriate thing not being done by one of our  infielders and not being able to drive in runs that are pretty much given to  you," Rader said.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Howell agreed. "You take any balls in that direction," he said.  "I was going forward, plus it's a tougher play with Abbott."  </P> <P> Despite not having a right hand, Abbott is an excellent fielder. His error was  his first this season.  </P> <P> "I thought it was my ball either way," he said. "The ball wasn't far off the  mound. I had a couple of choices. One was to field it with my glove and try to  do the switch (so he could throw with his left hand). I chose to field it  without the glove and be in position to throw. I fielded it cleanly. I just  hurried the ball and bounced it."  </P> <P> Pat Borders' run-scoring single in the third inning scored the Blue Jays' final  run. Abbott retired the next 14 batters.  </P> <P> "(Abbott) was very poised. He should be very proud of the job he did," Rader  said.  </P> <P> "It's kind of tough," Abbott said. "I just try to work hard and be consistent  in my approach. I've had some bad games, but I haven't been as consistent as  I'd like, and I hope to be a little more consistent in the second half."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Second baseman Johnny Ray went home to Chouteau, Okla., Wednesday after his  wife went into labor with the couple's second child. It's not yet known when he  will rejoin the club.  </P> <P> In his absence, Rick Schu started at second, Schu's fourth position this  season. Schu -- who has also played third, first and left field and is the  emergency catcher -- played capably until he bobbled two grounders in the  eighth inning. Neither cost the Angels a run. . . . Chili Davis missed his  second consecutive game because of back spasms but might return today. . . .  X-rays on Donnie Hill's bruised left ankle were negative, but it was too  swollen for him to play.  </P></p>

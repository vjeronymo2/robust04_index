			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday  acknowledged that there are Guatemalan settlers residing in  Belizean territory; however, he explained that no pressure has  ever been exerted on the peasants by Belize to get them to leave  the area. Land is being sought to transfer them into those  protected areas, he added. [sentence as published]    De Leon Carpio explained that his government's plan is to  have the families living in the Chiquibul region leave the area,  because it is a nature reserve. He added that studies are being  conducted with the authorities of the National Institute of  Agrarian Reform (INTA) to transfer these people to an area that  meets their basic living requirements.    Nevertheless, he reiterated that Belizean troops are not  driving these people out, as had previously been reported. He  also said there is no final deadline for the withdrawal of the  settlers.    "The government is taking all necessary measures for those  peasants to settle in lands that will enable them to raise their  crops. It is necessary for them to withdraw from Chiquibul,  because this is a national park. But certainly, it is not  because Belize is pressuring them to leave," De Leon Carpio  noted.    In light of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman  Antonio  Monzon assured that the Guatemalans will be transferred in  September to the Dolores municipality in Peten, located several  kilometers from where they are currently settled. He explained  that the trip will be sponsored by INTA, the Peten Land  Committee, and the National Fund for Peace.    This issue caused several reactions last week when Carlos  Asturias, former governor of the northern department of Peten,  disclosed that Belizean troops had set a 25 June deadline for  the settlers to withdraw from the area.    Asturias recently said the report had been received by a  parish priest in the region, explaining that a group of soldiers  who patrol the border area "are threatening them constantly."</p>

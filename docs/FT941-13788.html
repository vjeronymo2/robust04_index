			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Unsafe passage to the CIS Internal air travel in the former Soviet Union is fraught with difficulties. Cancellations, long delays and overloading of flights in some CIS states are frequent, particularly in the Trancaucasus. It is not known whether aircrafts are regularly maintained. Travellers are advised where possible to fly directly to their destination on an international flight originating from outside the former Soviet Union. But even this may be disrupted if a threatened strike by Russia's air traffic controllers goes ahead. The controllers complain that they often have to work with outdated and unreliable radar and communications equipment. Last week a Russian investigation commission said 'an extremely serious error' by an air traffic controller nearly caused a mid-air collision between two western jumbo jets over Russia's far east in late November. Once safely in the former Soviet Union, however, there are now few difficulties in conducting business in, for example, the oil-rich state of Azerbaijan, provided you avoid the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and border areas. The UK Foreign Office says it is safe to travel to Azerbaijan. Visitors to the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe say they have to cope with a nightly curfew, rising crime and power shortages. On arrival in Dushanbe declare all foreign currency and valuable items such as jewellery, cameras, computers, etc.</p>

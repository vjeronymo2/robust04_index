			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report, Sakuma, an adviser to the  Japanese Defense Agency, made bellicose remarks that in the case  of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, Japan cannot help but  do something for South Korea, and that it must look into coming  up with plans on how to cooperate with the U.S. Forces. His  grave remarks greatly agitate us and are an open challenge to us  that cannot be forgiven. These remarks clearly show the  Japanese reactionaries' criminal attempt to invade our country  again.    The Japanese right-wing reactionaries have defined us as  their first imaginary [kasangjok] enemy by babbling about our  non- existent nuclear issue and missile threat. Also, they have  made bellicose and absurd remarks by talking about a so-called  preemptive attack and saying that Japan would participate in a  war on the Korean peninsula.    Warmonger Sakuma, who even served as chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff of the Japanese Self-Defense Armed Forces, made  the bellicose and violent remarks once again under these  circumstances. This clearly shows the seriousness of the  Japanese reactionaries' move to seek an opportunity to invade  Korea again.    The Japanese reactionaries' such move is of concern to us  because Japan wants to act as a shock brigade backed by the  United States. This was proven by the fact that Sakuma loudly  babbled about cooperating with U.S. forces or providing it with  Japanese aid.    While DPRK-U.S. contacts have opened the prospect for  basically resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,  Japan has been looking for an opportunity to attack us with the  backing of our partner in dialogue. Where else on earth can we  find such indiscriminate remarks and acts?    However, the Japanese reactionaries are miscalculating. They  must fully remember that their indiscriminate maneuvers will  bring them miserable results. Therefore, they must not act  recklessly.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Talks on rice ban to open in Washington THE Japanese government is taking its first step to open talks with the US and EC over the country's ban on rice imports, a potential stumbling block to successful completion of the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Masami Tanabu, Japanese agriculture minister, will leave Japan today for talks in Washington with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and in Brussels with Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. Mr Jean-Pierre Leng, EC ambassador in Tokyo, called on Tokyo yesterday to lift its ban on rice imports and ease import restrictions on European farm and leather products. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, is to visit Tokyo next week for talks on trade issues. Mr Tanabu will reiterate his government's opposition to replacing the outright ban on imported rice with a system of tariffs, and will ask for rice to be exempt from Gatt provisions. However, the trip is mainly designed for domestic political consumption by farmers who provide vital electoral support for the ruling Liberal Democratic party. The government is intent on showing the farmers it is doing everything possible to maintain the ban. However, it is believed a majority of the LDP leadership recognises that eventually the government will have to compromise on the rice issue. The government is keen to delay a decision on the issue for as long as possible. But US and EC negotiators are likely to put pressure on Japan by telling Mr Tanabu that Tokyo's acceptance of tariffs would be a precondition for full multilateral talks to open in Geneva later this month. Mr Tanabu will also report to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, on the state of negotiations between the US and EC over agriculture and other issues.</p>

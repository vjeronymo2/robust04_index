			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The international civilian mission sent a team  of observers to Gonaives on 27 and 28 April to investigate the  claim that numerous people had been killed by the Army in the  Raboteau neighborhood. According to the military authorities in  the city, the events were caused by a group of terrorists led by  Arnault Mtayer, also known as "The Cuban" and an Aristide  sympathizer. He was reported to have attacked the Raboteau  outpost on 22 April to rouse the population to solidarity with  the rebels of Borgne. These attacks reportedly forced the Armed  to retaliate and to pursue the group of terrorists who were  attempting to escape by sea aboard small craft. Military  authorities pointed out that six persons died during the  operation.    The mission has not been able to collect convincing  testimony  or evidence to corroborate the Armed Forces officials' version  of the story. According to numerous pieces of information that  agree, it seems that, to the contrary, Army members were at the  root of the problem. As early as 18 April, two military  personnel, accompanied by a local leader of the Revolutionary  Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, fired shots at  Mr. Mtayer's home, which they subsequently ransacked. They  arrested his father, Ludovic Mtayer, 65.    On 22 April, soldiers in greater numbers invaded Raboteau  early in the morning. They attacked and plundered about 10  houses and assaulted their inhabitants before summarily  executing numerous people, whom they had driven out of their  homes, onshore and offshore in small boats. The victims  included travelers. [passage omitted]    The mission determined that at least 12 persons had been  shot  to death by soldiers wearing tactical unit uniforms. At least  one witness showed the observers mounds where six to eight  persons were reportedly buried. According to concurring reports,  bodies floating in the sea had been washed ashore. Members of  the Haitian Armed Forces had prevented the families from burying  them.    The observers reported that several people had been injured  during the military operation and that most of them had gone  into hiding, preferring to avoid hospital treatment for fear of  recognition.    Finally, it appears that the Roboteau neighborhood,  especially lower Raboteau, has experienced a massive exodus  following these events. The civilian mission very energetically  condemns the slaughter of innocent civilians in Raboteau, the  extent of which surpasses all other indiscriminate attacks  committed by elements of the Armed Forces since the arrival of  the mission in Haiti. It therefore requests that the High  Command begin a thorough inquiry to establish who was  responsible for this horrible slaughter.</p>

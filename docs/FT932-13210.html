			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / NUM to renew court challenge THE National Union of Mineworkers is to mount a further High Court challenge to British Coal's pit closure programme, claiming redundancy terms being offered to miners at nine threatened pits are in breach of an assurance given by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, John Mason writes. The NUM was yesterday given leave by Mr Justice Popplewell to seek a judicial review of the corporation's voluntary redundancy arrangements at the nine pits which form the second tranche in the closure programme. The hearing will be heard on May 5. The union is claiming British Coal is offering the maximum possible redundancy payments to miners who choose to leave before the end of the current consultation period over the pit closure programme. However, miners have been warned that those made redundant after the end of the consultation period will be eligible for only minimum payments.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark slips 27% as margins suffer MATTHEW CLARK, the wine and sherry producer which has carried out substantial restructuring during the past 18 months, reported a 27 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.22m. Operating profits fell 24 per cent to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 2.67m) on turnover, net of duty, 19 per cent lower at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 23.7m) during the six months to October 31. Turnover on continuing businesses was some 11 per cent higher, reflecting 'significant gains' in market share by the group's British wines, but operating margins were squeezed, falling from 14.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent under pressure particularly from multiple grocers. Earnings per share increased by 27 per cent to 16.4p (12.9p), reflecting the acquisition of the minority interest in JE Mather, the Stone's ginger wine maker. The interim dividend goes up from 5.75p to 6.5p. 'But for the restructuring, the group would not have been able to withstand the recession in such good shape,' said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. Disposal last October of IH Baker, the Australian distribution subsidiary, completed the reorganisation which has included the sale of the Sealark transport arm and a stake in Macallan-Glenlivet. Mr Aikens said that the group was now 'poised to move forward' by seeking to acquire other drinks brands - particularly cider or mineral water - in the UK. Since the period end, the group has formed a joint venture with Inver House Distillers to market and sell its Scotch whiskies, gin and vodka. However, Mr Aikens added that Christmas trading had been difficult with volumes just ahead of the previous year. Margins were still under pressure and there was no indication that the recession was nearing its end.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Investments that help you sleep well - Serious Money Where can you find a hiding place if you are scared by the inflation bogy? Utilities are tempting: their profits are linked to inflation, they have been very heavily sold because of regulatory fears, and they offer correspondingly good yields. But you need to pick the right utilities and the right companies, and they are relatively risky at the moment. Index-linked gilts and index-linked National Savings certificates are a safer alternative. Both guarantee you a real (inflation-proofed) return. But which should you choose? The current issue of indexed National Savings certificates (the seventh issue) offers a tax-free return of 3 per cent above the rate of inflation to those prepared to hang on for five years: there is no income as such. Both capital and income from index-linked gilts is inflation-proofed. And though any capital 'gain' is tax free, the income is taxed. So returns depend both on your inflation expectations and on your tax rate. At current prices, and assuming 5 per cent inflation, real (inflation-proofed) returns on most indexed stocks are around 3.3 per cent to people paying basic rate tax of 25 per cent. For people paying 40 per cent tax, the comparable figure is around 2.8 per cent. Unusually the shorter dated stocks yield much the same as longer dated ones - which normally offer more because of their greater risk. Note though that the two stocks with high coupons (nominal interest rates) have poor net yields, and should be avoided, particularly by higher rate taxpayers. Given how close their yield is to that on National Savings certificates, indexed gilts look the better choice for most people. First, gilts are far more flexible: you can sell when you want. Secondly, there is at least a chance of a short-term capital gain if the gilt market eventually recovers some of its nerve. Indexed gilts have fallen along with the others this year  -though by less. If you buy indexed gilts now you face two possible outcomes. If inflation worries persist, you can hang on until redemption, secure in an inflation-proofed yield of around 3 per cent. If inflation worries fade, you may be able to sell your indexed stock at a modest profit, and look for something else. Not perhaps the most exciting investment in the market. But if you are interested in sleeping well, you take Valium, not a pep pill. Many people think the UK equity market is cheap, but are scared of buying - because it might get cheaper still. Market timing is one of the hardest aspects of investment. Some of the most successful long term investors simply ignore it. But few ordinary people can sustain such Olympian detachment. So when will share prices stop falling? The stockmarket equivalent of the Delphic Oracle is technical analysis, or charting. Technical analysis is a way of predicting future price movements from past price movements. It often uses recurrent patterns as a predictive aide. Think of the charts as a shorthand description of the past behaviour patterns of investors. Chartists use these patterns to predict how investors are likely to behave in similar circumstances in the future. For example, most investors sell a share when it goes below their buying level. So heavy buying on the way up, is likely to be matched by equally heavy selling on the way down. Take Wall Street. We know that three-quarters of all the money in US mutual funds (the American equivalent of unit trusts) has been invested for less than three years. So if Wall Street takes another tumble, successive waves of selling by mutual fund investors could help it on its way until it reaches the level at which the first of these neophytes bought. We asked Robin Griffiths of James Capel to give us a chartist view of the London stockmarket. He reckons that now that the FT-SE 100 index has moved down through the 3050 level, it will keep falling until it bounces at 2800 or possibly 2890. That will probably be in September, and the subsequent recovery could be sharp. Why 2800? When sterling left the ERM in September 1992, the FT-SE 100 index took off like a scalded cat and rose by a quarter; then it yo-yoed sideways for six months, before a second steep climb. The bottom of that six month corridor was 2800. The top of the second climb was 3520. Chart patterns suggest that once a price has lost more than half an earlier rise, it will go all the way back to where it started. And FTSE has now lost more than half its rise from 2800 to to 3520. And why the alternative floor of 2890? This time we start measuring from the 2260 level of FTSE when sterling left the ERM. From this vantage point, shares are set to retrace half their subsequent gain. And the mid-point between 2260 and the 3520 peak is - 2890. This is not a Crash; it is not even a bear market. It is a setback, argues Griffiths. But do not expect a serious rally until gilts - which have led this fall - are generally perceived to have hit bottom. There may well be a small rally before then, but it will not last long. What will probably scupper it is the next sell-off on Wall Street. Wall Street's unusually prolonged rise suggests an unusually big correction in store. How seriously should you treat chart-based forecasts? The Delphic Oracle was always right. But fallible human interpretations of her meaning were often fatally misleading.</p>

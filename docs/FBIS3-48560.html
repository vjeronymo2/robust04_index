Both the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) should have been "more sensible" in  discussions that led to last Friday's rejection by the House of  the Councillors of the four political reform bills, said Takeshi  Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers  Associations (Nikkeiren).    If both parties fail to reach compromise by the end of the  current Diet session Saturday and the bills are scrapped,  Japan's international standing would be eroded substantially,  Nagano told a lecture meeting sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    The bills' scrapping is likely to spawn a sense of  disappointment in industrial sectors across the nation, possibly  putting added downward pressure on stock prices, a major gauge  of the health of the Japanese economy, Nagano said.    He said he hopes "from the bottom of my heart" that the  political reform package will pass the Diet through an early  compromise at a joint committee of both chambers of the Diet.    The stalled discussion on political reforms has prevented  the  government from formulating a new economic stimulus package, a  third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to finance the  package, and the main budget for fiscal 1994.    Turning to the coming spring wage negotiations with labor  unions, Nagano reiterated the Nikkeiren policy decided earlier  that it is virtually impossible for the management side to agree  to a wage hike for workers.    In view of the unabated worsening of economic conditions,  allowing a wage hike "easily" would endanger the maintenance of  employment, so businesses should give their top priority to  securing employment rather than hiking wages, he said.    The employment situation is deteriorating day by day, with  the number of idled workers standing at an estimated one million  to three million across the nation, he said. The actual jobless  ratio may have reached 5 to 6 percent, a level seen in the  United States and Europe, Nagano said.    It is "impossible" for management to agree to a 5 to 6  percent wage increase for fiscal 1994, which was recently  proposed by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo). He  said nominal wage levels for Japanese workers are the highest in  the world and they should give up a hike during the era of the  economic slump.    In the United States, business performance is picking up due  to drastic restructuring measures centering on a cut in  personnel costs, he said, noting that U.S. real wage levels have  dropped to those seen before 1960, after reaching a peak in  1972. He said the government should focus on deregulating  controls as a means to reduce Japan's consumer prices, also the  highest in the world. Such a step would enhance the standard of  living of the Japanese people, he said.    Nagano proposed anew that the government carry out an income  tax cut of 10 trillion yen "as soon as possible" as a way to  turn around the economy.    Raising the consumption tax to cover an income tax cut is  not  desirable in light of the current economic situation but if it  is unavoidable, such a hike should be delayed to "substantially  later," he said.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Mexican party talks collapse MEXICO'S centre-right opposition, the National Action Party (PAN), has walked out of talks on party finance reform in protest at revelations that a select group of businessmen has promised to give the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) hundreds of millions of dollars. The negotiations are intended to lead to a comprehensive new law on campaign finance that would cap party spending in elections and force parties to publish sources of their finance. The declared aim of the reform is to allow the opposition parties to compete more effectively with the PRI, which has run Mexico for 64 years. But, after it was revealed that some 30 prominent businessmen had pledged at a dinner last week to raise about Dollars 25m each for the PRI, the PAN appears to have had second thoughts about supporting the reforms. The governing party has argued that the money will go into a special trust to build up its capital and not be used directly in next year's presidential campaign. There would be nothing illegal about the donations but the opposition has argued they would give undue influence to a powerful group of businessmen. The fact that opposition parties cannot raise such amounts has also raised questions about the government's commitment to create a fairer political system. The PRI has said that the dinner last week was only one of many the party is holding to boost its finances, and that it will also be raising money from traditional supporters, such as the labour sector. Officials argue that the overtures to the private sector are a positive step in that the PRI would no longer be dependent on government money.

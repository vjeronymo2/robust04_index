Speaking on achievements of the NPC session at a reception  for Chinese and overseas reporters this afternoon, Premier Li  said that the NPC session has adopted his government work  report, affirmed the work of the government last year, approved  principles and tasks for this year's work, and passed a budget  law.    What is more important, the premier said, is that NPC  deputies unanimously stand for the principle of "seizing  development opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening  to the outside world, promoting development and maintaining  stability." The principle is a guideline for all work this  year, he said.    NPC deputies have reached "unprecedented consensus" on the  need to correctly handle relations among reform, development and  stability, he said.    The second session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session  of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference have provided "a reliable  guarantee for the fulfillment of various tasks this year," he  said.    The NPC session also demonstrated a democratic style of  work.  Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the  State Council joined many provincial-level delegations in  discussions, exchanged views on state affairs with deputies, and  heard criticisms and suggestions from them, he said.    "Both the number of meetings and contacts have set a  record,"  he said. "In short, this is a session marked by democracy,  pragmatism, unity and progress."</p>

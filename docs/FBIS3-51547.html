			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Dr. Miguel Angel Salaverria has  said our country has not yet received official notification of  the reduction in U.S. aid to this country. According to him,  since 1985 economic aid has declined and will continue to  decline until 1996, when it will disappear completely.  Consequently, the central government has prepared a series of  plans aimed at solving the situation in a firm and specific  manner.    [Begin recording] [Salaverria] Our plans have been made  taking into account the projected aid reduction. The news has  just been publicized, but we knew six to eight months ago that  aid would be reduced. Now, when you referred to an aid package  last year totaling over $200 million, this includes other forms  of aid and not direct aid.    For instance, during the war there were years in which we  received approximately $100 million worth of military aid. Now  we have no military aid, as we no longer need it because the war  is over. This may be the great difference in all this. Later,  military aid was cut to $90 million, $70 million, $40 million,  and so on. It was difficult to keep it at $13 million last  year. And now we are faced with no military aid, because we do  not have a war.    [Unidentified reporter] However [words indistinct]  reconstruction of the country [words indistinct] made calls to  help. Several governments offered assistance [words indistinct]  offers have not materialized. Does the Foreign Ministry [words  indistinct] to bring in this aid?    [Salaverria] Yes. This effort to receive aid offers is an  everyday task not only for the Foreign Relations Ministry, but  also for the Planning and Finance Ministries. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the official stressed that Salvadorans who have  relatives in Los Angeles, California, must advise them to appear  before the Federal Administration for Managing Emergencies,  known by its English acronym, FEMA, or call this institution at  1-800-525-0321, or call the Los Angeles Red Cross at  213-739-4543 to receive aid. Salaverria explained U.S.  institutions provide humanitarian aid to all persons, regardless  of their official immigration status, which basically is not  considered in determining humanitarian assistance to disaster  victims.</p>

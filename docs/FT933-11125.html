			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (12): This vicious circle must be broken - Education and Training POTENTIALLY, Wales in the year 2010 could be one of the most prosperous regions in Europe, but the greatest single threat to achieving that would be the marginalisation of Wales within a marginalised UK. That was the conclusion of a project group of the Institute of Welsh Affairs in its report Wales 2010: Creating our Future, published in May. Unless Wales prepared for the transformation in Europe of patterns of employment, there would be little available other than the type of low-skilled activity associated with the third world. 'Wales' competitiveness will depend, increasingly, on the quality of the people who work here,' the report said, stressing that education and training were crucially important to achieving the Wales 2010 vision. The report by the institute, which promotes research on policy issues affecting all aspects of Welsh life, added: 'Wales needs to break out of the vicious circle: low achievement by too many of its schoolchildren, leading to low level skills, leading to lower skill jobs being available, leading to reduced incentive to train. . .' It emphasised that far higher priority should be given to developing the skills of those already at work. While the UK workforce in general lacks skills compared with other European countries, it is a particular problem in Wales because so many of the skills that do exist - from the coal, iron and steel industries  - are in less demand or have been made redundant. Sir Wyn Roberts, minister for Wales, has said there needs to be a big increase in skills levels to compete with other countries. 'The success we have had in attracting inward investment, and the performance of both new and indigenous businesses, has shown the value of having a flexible and adaptable workforce,' he said. 'It has also underlined the need for us to increase the supply of skills in order to go on widening the economic base and develop a higher value-added economy.' Both male and female economic activity rates in Wales are the lowest in Britain, but those for women are increasing while those for men are falling. In 1991, only 81 per cent of the adult Welsh male population was seeking or in work, while for women the figure had risen to some two-thirds. In terms of people rather than percentages, it means that since 1979 there are 140,000 fewer full-time male employees, compared with 5,000 fewer female. Significantly, there are 54,000 more part-time women workers. A variety of initiatives is under way to raise the qualifications and skills of the workforce. One of the most imaginative is that of the Opportunity Shops being opened by Mid-Glamorgan training and enterprise council to advise people on educational and training opportunities. Five have been opened this year, and a sixth is imminent, with a total of nearly Pounds 1m to be invested in each of their first three years. The concept, says Mr Allen Williams, the TEC's chief executive, 'is to spread the message of training as widely as possible to all individuals in Mid-Glamorgan, with the slogan of bringing learning into the high street and putting it on the shopping agenda.' In the first eight weeks, the Bridgend shop alone has handled more than 850 inquiries. An important factor in raising skills is the role of colleges, and Mr Williams says the seven colleges with which the Tec has training contracts have become much more vocationally aware and are developing strong links with industry. In another initiative, Welsh Tecs in collaboration with the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, have launched this year the Wales Information Network, a database to allow employers to access training information on their own computer systems. Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the new chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, has made it clear that he regards as vital not just the creation of jobs, but of quality jobs. That requires employers to recognise the value of training and Mr Williams is not encouraged. 'Employers' attitude to training is downright poor, particularly as we are going through a recession which puts it at the bottom of their list,' he says. 'We have considerable difficulty in persuading them that investing in people is as important as investing in plant.' That has to change if the Wales 2010 vision of a flourishing Wales, at the forefront of European regions, is not to prove a mirage.</p>

The chetnik  advance was nevertheless halted by a successful counteroffensive  by our fighters.    The usual chetnik provocations also continued on the free  territory of Zvornik. However, demonstrating their courage, our  defenders have again been very successful. Today, the enemy  also pounded the city center of Olovo and the positions of our  defenders. Like all other attempts by the aggressor to breach  the lines of our defense, this one was also unsuccessful.    This morning, the chetniks opened sniper fire on Kasindol  street from the Bosut Barracks. The aggressor attacked Dobrinja  with infantry weapons from Nedjarici. Stup was attacked with  bombs fired from portable mortars. This was reported by the  Information Service of the 1st Army Corps.    The ferocity of the chetnik attacks in the zone of  operations  of the 3d Army Corps was offset by the defenders-members of the  Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, inflicting great  losses on them in manpower and equipment. They are also  liberating parts of occupied territories. Since it cannot do  anything else, the aggressor is shelling villages, towns, and  the civilian population. There have been no violations of the  cease-fire agreement reached by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in this region. The  truce is generally holding at other lines of separation.    In line with the agreement reached the day before yesterday  by the negotiating teams of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aggressor side, and the representatives  of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], three prisoners held by the  aggressor soldiers in Silos prison in (?Tarcin) were exchanged  for three civilians from Kula prison.    The process of exchanging prisoners is the first and the  most  controversial point in the Silajdzic-Krajisnik negotiations.  The realization of other points from this agreement did not  take place because of the lack of cooperation by the aggressor  side. So, the issue of Silos and the 189 missing Bosniaks, who,  according to their families, were taken by the terrorist chetnik  forces to an unknown destination, remains unresolved.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Management: Auditing the auditors - As the results season approaches, Andrew Jack looks at how to get the best out of the annual audit As auditors scurry to complete their work for companies with December year-ends, now is the time for directors to concentrate on getting best value for their money. Managers too often view the audit as a time-consuming, annual chore. But by negotiating fees, improving their internal planning, and asking the right questions, boards can gain considerable benefits from an unloved exercise. The first stage - which must begin long before the audit work gets under way  -is to agree a reasonable fee with the auditor. Growing competition between accounting firms and increasing concern among companies over fees means that auditors cannot automatically just add a percentage to the previous year's bill. One increasingly popular technique for keeping fees low is to threaten to put the audit out to tender. 'We have a fairly hard-nosed negotiation each year about audit fees with a view that we could always go to someone else,' says Roderick Paul, chief executive of Severn Trent, the privatised water company, whose audit firm is Price Waterhouse. 'The thought of changing is always there.' Background knowledge helps the process in this case. Paul and a fellow director both trained as accountants and so have an understanding of auditing from the other side of the fence. They also keep a close eye on the reported audit fees charged to their competitors. A second way to reduce audit fees is to be heavily involved at the planning stage, ensuring that the exercise best meets the company's needs and links most efficiently to its own systems and staff. That leads to an estimate based on the hours likely to be needed and the appropriate charge-out rates for different levels of staff and partners. Paul says he holds extensive discussions over the plan for the audit, which is agreed in advance with the executives and the company's audit committee. 'We consider to what extent it dovetails with the work of the internal audit department.' Michael Derbyshire, banking relations manager with Unilever, endorses this approach. 'One of the ways of keeping the bill low is to keep a tight ship with good internal controls,' he says. Ensuring that the company meets its obligations within the audit plan is an essential part of keeping costs down. Alan McFetrich, a senior partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, recalls a client company in the late 1980s which demanded that its audit fee of nearly Pounds 1m be reduced. The firm agreed to a bill of about half the price, on condition that its hours could be reduced through more efficient delivery of information by the company being audited. As it turned out, the client missed its deadlines and failed to deliver as agreed, hence increasing the amount of work the auditors had to do, and raising the final audit fee to more than Pounds 1m. Once the audit is completed, there are other ways to squeeze value out of the process. In particular, many executives and accountants point to the need for detailed discussion and recommendations for change. 'You ought to expect auditors to bring their knowledge of similar organisations and draw comparisons,' says Robert Sandry, a partner with Price Waterhouse. Martin Scicluna, a partner with Touche Ross, says: 'Ask the partners for their off-the-record views on the strengths and weaknesses of the business, systems and people, and for informal benchmarking with other companies, which they can provide on a no-names basis.' He adds that a good auditor should also draw the board's attention to the likely impact of future accounting, auditing and regulatory changes which might affect them in the coming year, giving them plenty of time to plan in advance. Most audits generate reports for management which highlight concerns raised during the work and make recommendations. But an academic survey published last year suggested that senior executives believe the letters are often repetitive and could be substantially improved. 'The profession has an awful tendency to obfuscate,' says Roger Davis, head of auditing at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'People don't want long, turgid reports but simple language that says things as they are.' The letter should, in any case, only be the starting point for a wider discussion. Derbyshire recommends that boards should consider how the audit worked. 'Where the auditors spent their time is quite revealing,' he says. On the other hand, he warns against treating auditors' views too seriously. 'Sometimes they get hold of the wrong end of the stick and the real problem is not what they highlight but something associated with it,' he says. Paul is also suspicious of auditors veering too far into offering wider consulting services, which may trigger conflicts of interest. 'We do pick up on their comments but we try to focus on the auditing issues such as the state of our systems,' he says. As a last resort, if the audit bill still seems too high, directors always have the option of sending it back and demanding a reduction. In the extreme, they can always seek arbitration through the professional accountancy bodies. As Paul says: 'Management gets the audit fee it deserves.'  --------------------------------- UK AUDIT FEE INCOME 1993  ---------------------------------                     Pounds million  --------------------------------- Coopers &amp; Lybrand              237 KPMG Peat Marwick              196 Ernst &amp; Young                  177 Touche Ross                    162 Price Waterhouse               153 Arthur Andersen                 82 BDO Binder Hamlyn               66 Grant Thornton                  40  ---------------------------------</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Daf buy-out decision is likely in two weeks THE future of the management buy-out bid for the Leyland Daf plant in Birmingham is likely to be settled within the next fortnight. Its chances of success have been improved by the decision on Wednesday of 3i, the venture capital group, to advance equity finance. Mr Ken Ogilvy, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said yesterday that detailed cashflow projections for the next six months of the plant's operations were being prepared for presentation next week to the credit committees of clearing banks and finance houses. Coopers is trying to pull together a finance package for the buy-out team led by Mr Allan Amey. Banks and finance houses are needed by the management buy-out team to provide the debt element of the financing package, which will also involve the public sector. The Department of Trade and Industry is understood to have been carrying out its procedures of 'due diligence' yesterday on an application by the management team for regional selective assistance. This is a subsidy available to Leyland Daf under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1982 to provide funds for modernisation in order to safeguard employment. The speed with which the DTI has been processing the application underlines the government's desire to keep open a plant in an area of high unemployment. If the joint receiver, Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, closes the plant it is unlikely to reopen. Orders for Leyland Daf vans tail away from mid April because of uncertainty about the future. Mr Ogilvy said: 'Much beyond that the order book looks pretty poor.' Dealers have been holding back from placing firm orders until the outcome of the buyout bid is clear. Mr Ogilvy said: 'We will not be in a position to strike a deal with the receiver for another week or so.' The attitude of the banks was crucial, but he felt that 3i's decision had put down a marker. 'It starts to focus everybody's mind that what might be possible is possible.' Mr Chris Rowlands, the Birmingham director of 3i, said the group's decision to invest 'will help to accelerate other components of the financial package'. Leyland Daf has 100 acres of land, but Mr Ogilvy warned that 'it is not easy to see a windfall' given the state of the property market. He had talked to 'one or two people', but could not see any sign of immediate speculative buying.</p>

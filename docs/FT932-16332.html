			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: GE Capital buys Reliance Group's life subsidiary RELIANCE Group, the insurance concern controlled and headed by Mr Saul Steinberg, is selling its life insurance subsidiary, United Pacific Life Insurance, to GE Capital for approximately Dollars 550m. UPL has around Dollars 6.2bn in assets and Dollars 680m in annual revenues, and its main business is the writing and marketing of annuity products through financial institutions and insurance agents. Reliance revealed last week that it had put the business up for sale, in an attempt to bolster its capital base. At that stage, Reliance said that it had two potential buyers offering to pay in excess of Dollars 500m, adding that one of these purchasers - putting up the lower amount - had begun litigation over the sale proceedings. Yesterday, Reliance said that the legal action was now being terminated. GE Capital is the financial services arm of General Electric Company of the US, and its assets exceed Dollars 92bn. The company noted yesterday that it had recently acquired GNA Corporation, which specialises in tax-deferred annuities. 'The combination of UPL and GNA will mean that we have an organisation with unparalleled marketing capabilities and more than Dollars 12bn in assets,' it said. GE Capital added that it expected the market for annuities and pre-retirement savings plans to double by the turn of the century. It suggested that the two acquisitions would 'position us as a major player in this growing market'. The sale to GE Capital - which will require regulatory approval - came as Reliance disclosed a Dollars 35.6m loss after tax in the 1992, compared with a Dollars 148.2m deficit in 1991. This partly reflected a Dollars 100m write-off on the sale of UPL, offset by a Dollars 40m gain on the earlier sale of the Frank B. Hall insurance broking business. Reliance said that its continuing operations - predominantly property-casualty insurance interests - made a loss of Dollars 43.2m, while the 'discontinued' life business made a profit of Dollars 57.3m. The group noted that results from continuing operations were below expectations because of record catastrophe losses and weak pricing in many commercial lines.</p>

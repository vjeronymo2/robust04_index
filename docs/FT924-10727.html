			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit downgrades hurt share prices INTEREST rate optimism was discouraged both in Frankfurt and London yesterday, and the UK stock market backed away ahead of tonight's important policy speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer. The downward slide accelerated following a spate of profit downgradings by securities analysts, with ICI hit hard by predictions that today's trading statement will disclose a fall of about one quarter in earnings for the first nine months of this year. The renewed cutback in profit forecasts came across the range of the industrial share sectors and reflected the perception that the recession in the UK may plumb new depths. One of the leading UK investment banks regards this week's heavy cutback in production by British Steel as a warning for the markets. Share prices opened lower and losses were quickly extended after hopes of a rapid cut in German interest rates were dashed by the unchanged minimum lending rates at this week's Bundesbank repurchase tender. The Bank of England's policies in the London money markets appeared to emphasise its message of the previous day - that no cut in UK rates was in the offing. The implications of this check to City hopes of another early cut in domestic interest rates was underlined by an interim trading statement from Marks and Spencer, one of Britain's leading high street clothing and food retailers. Although Marks' interim profits were higher, the board warned that consumer confidence remains low and that the second half of the year will be overshadowed by the effects on retail spending of persisting high unemployment levels in the UK. At least two trading programmes were identified in the market, with the first one clearly weighted towards the sell side but the second apparently more evenly balanced. However, once the bad news was in the market, shares steadied in London, helped both by a much-improved performance from sterling and also by a calm opening to the new session on Wall Street. At the close, the FT-SE Index stood at 2,650.4 for a final loss on the day of 19.4 points. Seaq volume of 517.2m shares, taking in at least one large share placing, compared with 551m in the previous session when retail business was worth Pounds 1bn, a return to the high volume levels of recent days. The stock market is effectively on hold ahead of tonight's Mansion House speech from the UK chancellor, in which he is expected to outline the government's economic policies in the wake of Britain's departure from the ERM network. But the stock market perceives that the chief test for government strategies will not come until next week when the Maastricht proposals will be debated in parliament. However, few City analysts expect Mr Lamont to announce a cut in UK base rates tonight; most believe that the next reduction in base rates will be held back until the autumn economic statement. Yesterday's recovery in sterling, which fell sharply at the beginning of the week, is likely to provide a suitable stage for a reduction in UK base rates.</p>

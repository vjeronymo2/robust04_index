			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Russians hopeful for G7 summit: Shokhin would like Dollars 2bn in loans. This time, will deeds match words? Russia is hoping this week's Group of Seven summit in Naples will yield smaller headlines but larger real support than it has received in the last two years - when vast sums were pledged at G7 summits but much less delivered. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy, said on Friday that Russia might gain access to as much as Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in extra loans this year - if the summit approved plans for the International Monetary Fund to allocate some of its own reserve asset known as the special drawing right (SDR) to developing countries and former Communist 'economies in transition'. The IMF board meets in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the SDR question. But monetary officials in Washington and leading west European capitals were uncertain whether there would be a consensus for an SDR allocation in time for the summit. There is general agreement among G7 countries that present arrangements are unfair to 37 recent Fund members such as Russia, which have never received an allocation of SDRs. But it remains unclear whether the IMF's 178 members can overcome the technical and political complexities holding up an early provision of SDRs to Russia and other disadvantaged nations. Such a provision is 'certainly an issue that is going to be discussed, and we hope positively, in Naples', a senior White House official said. Mr Shokhin said an SDR allocation would provide non-inflationary support for the budget and was urgently needed if Russia's political and economic reforms were to continue. While inflation had fallen further - to 6 per cent a month in June - production would continue to decline, albeit more slowly than the 25 per cent rate in the first part of the year, he warned. He also said Russia still had to construct an economic climate in which capital would be attracted back to the country from the west. Progress on inflation, cutting credits and raising interest rates to strongly positive levels has won praise from the IMF and of the financial community generally, and opened Russia to big IMF and World Bank loans. However, huge debts, pressures on the budget and the gradually worsening political atmosphere make western officials nervous of the future, and doubtful that a programme to stabilise Russia's economy and currency will be feasible this year - though that remains the official goal. But US officials insist that 'on Russia, there is not going to be a pledging session this year'. They say Dollars 30bn of the Dollars 43bn promised to Russia at last year's summit is already approved by G7 governments and the international financial institutions. Of the remaining Dollars 13bn, Dollars 4bn is available when Russia can conclude a standby arrangement with the IMF, and Dollars 6bn more in a currency stabilisation fund when Russia makes the rouble convertible. The SDR question has been on the international agenda for several years. But discussions so far have yielded no results because G7 members, led by Germany, have been unable to agree to a general SDR allocation to all IMF members along the lines of a SDR36bn (Pounds 33.8bn) issue proposed by Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director. Until now, a selective 'catch-up' increase has been ruled out because it would need an amendment to the IMF articles, entailing approval by holders of 85 per cent the IMF's membership votes and backing from the US Congress. The Fund is understood to have suggested a blend of general and selective SDR issues. Looking ahead to Naples, Mr Shokhin, now the longest-serving Russian minister and generally seen as a moderate reformer, laid most stress on Russia's access to the 'political G8' when the G7 admits Russia to talks on general political issues next Sunday. Russia will remain out of Saturday's 'economic G7', which will discuss world economic problems. He said that this 'step-by-step approach' was in Russia's interests, though he forecast that it would become involved in a range of economic issues in which its voice would demand to be heard. He said the Paris Club of creditor nations, at which Russia now appears as a debtor, should recognise it also as a creditor - since it is owed, he said, Dollars 140bn by developing countries. Mr Shokhin also made clear that he would push hard for further openings in markets the Russians still see as closed or only partly open to their goods. 'It's hard to reconcile declarations about partnership with discriminatory measures towards the Russian economy,' he said, instancing 260 discriminatory regulations against Russian goods in the US alone.</p>

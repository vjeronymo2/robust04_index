			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 7, IRNA -- The Islamic Republilc of  Iran has never delivered any weaponry for supporters of General  Farah Aidid of Somalia, an informed source at the Defence  Ministry said here today.    The source said circulation of such unfounded news is in  line  with sinister plots aimed at distorting the image of the Islamic  Republic of Iran in the world.    A former commander of the U.S-led multinational forces in  Somalia had claimed last Saturday that Aidid supporters receive  arms from Iran, Sudan and Iraq.    The source also denied claimes by an Arabic weekly that Iran  held clandestine talks with the Czech Republic for the purchase  of Russian weapons.</p>

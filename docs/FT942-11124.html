			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (9): Mission, start making money - Profile / Georges-Christian Chazot The past four months have been a baptism of fire for Mr Georges-Christian Chazot, Eurotunnel's chief executive. Appointed in January to turn a large construction project into a profitable transport undertaking, he has been faced with a succession of postponements to the start of commercial operations. As passenger and freight services on both tunnel shuttles and the long-distance through trains come on stream, revenues will start to flow but up to Pounds 100m of fares have been lost. Steering the Pounds 10bn project into profitability represents an enormous challenge. Covering interest charges alone will cost about Pounds 650m a year and the success of the whole venture depends on Eurotunnel both appealing to existing travellers and persuading new ones to cross the Channel. At the time of Mr Chazot's appointment Eurotunnel said it did not want him to be overwhelmed by the problems of the past but inevitably they have cast a long shadow. The move to Eurotunnel represented a high-profile move for a manager, who, for all his long experience of both industry and the service sector, was little known outside his native France. Nevertheless, Mr Chazot's career in international companies makes him well suited to handle the challenges facing Eurotunnel, commented one French banker. Educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and at the University of Florida, Mr Chazot acquired a degree in electrical engineering and a diploma in marketing. He then spent 14 years each at Schlumberger, the international engineering group, and CGE (now Alcatel Alsthom), the telecommunications company. Although both are large industrial concerns, Mr Chazot counts as one of his achievements the transformation of Saft, Alcatel's battery subsidiary, from a company with 'a culture of high-tech arrogance to a service-minded corporation'. From Alcatel Mr Chazot went to Adia, a Swiss temporary employment agency, running its French subsidiary for 18 months. This, he says, broadened his experience of working in the service sector. It also exposed him to a market place where price and margins were particularly important. Eurotunnel and the ferry companies say they are keen to avoid a price war but the huge increase in cross-Channel capacity represented by the tunnel makes fierce tariff competition almost inevitable. Mr Chazot's recruitment, at the age of 54, to Eurotunnel followed a search by teams of headhunters in London and Paris. Nationality was not a factor, according to Eurotunnel, which says it was looking for the best person for the job regardless of origin. Mr Chazot denies that he regards himself as particularly French. 'My basic business education was in the US for the first three years of my business life,' he says. Mr Chazot has not only had to cope with the problems of commissioning the tunnel's systems and its rolling stock. He has also had to make a mark for himself in a post previously filled by Sir Alastair Morton. Sir Alastair it was who brought a project riven by conflicts between contractors and customer back on course. He has stayed on as co-chairman, alongside his French counterpart, Mr Andre Benard, to resolve outstanding disputes and to prepare for the raising of another Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn of equity and loan finance. Professionally, Mr Chazot is devoting his time to a project which may put some ferry operators out of business. At the very least the tunnel will capture a large part of the ferry's market share. There is a certain irony therefore in the fact that Mr Chazot is a keen amateur sailor, though he has never sailed his 35-foot racing yacht, Eloisa, across the Channel. His present job has involved more journeys under the Channel than over it.</p>

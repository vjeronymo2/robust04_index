			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch breaks up steel side Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steelmaker, has broken its steel division into several independent companies in a further effort to push the business back into profit. The decision was approved at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board on Sunday, in spite of protests by the IG Metall union. It is angry that workers will have less say in the running of the business. Three new companies will be created for special steel flat products, special heavy sections, and long products. A fourth unit - tin plate - will become a joint venture run by Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker. Ostensibly, the changes fit the strategy outlined by Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, who has repeatedly argued that separate companies were needed to manage the various steel products, because their market conditions were so different. However, sources said the changes would also make further jobs cuts easier, as the independent companies would no longer be subject to the rules of Montanmitbestimmung, a form of workers' co-determination in the German coal and steel industry. The system is seen as an obstacle to faster restructuring of the industry. Managers at the independent companies have already indicated they will need far fewer staff to service overheads. This means that up to 1,000 of the 3,600 people working in administration at the existing steel division will lose their jobs. Management is also likely to be more effective. 'Each company will have to meet their own costs,' said Mr Jurgen Claasen, the Krupp Hoesch spokesman. 'In the past, everything in the steel division went into one big pot and it was difficult to tell what was working well and what was not.' Krupp first mounted an unusually secretive bid to take over Hoesch, its long-standing rival, in 1992. The dust had hardly settled on that acrimonious merger when it was decided to close the integrated steelworks at Rheinhausen, prompting massive union protests and further job cuts. The going is still tough in spite of the overhaul. The steel division is one of six divisions within the Krupp Hoesch group, representing about 35 per cent of external sales. However, the DM780m (Dollars 481.5m) loss it reported last year was its biggest, and it is expected to incur another deficit this year. Diluting workers' rights is likely to make life easier for management. The extensive workers' rights which exist in the German steel industry is the main reason why Riva, the private Italian group, pulled out of its planned purchase of Eko Stahl, the ailing east German steelmaker. The law says Montanmitbestimmung can only exist in companies whose primary purpose is to make steel. It, therefore, does not apply to companies who are merely 'processing' steel, as Mr Claasen puts it. IG Metall, however, says its lawyers are checking the decision with a view to taking the company to court. It argues that workers' co-determination must be guaranteed in companies which operate any form of warm production or rolling mills. The German steel federation said yesterday steel production in the first six months of 1994 had risen 9 per cent above the that for same period the year before. Orders were up 12 per cent. However, it warned that much of the new steel was being used to fill stockpiles, or was being exported. It said steel consumption in the all-important German market - which accounts for about 60 per cent of production - had risen just 1.5 per cent in the first six months.</p>

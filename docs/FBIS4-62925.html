			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larisa Troyan: "Yuriy Meshkov on the Phone: `I </F> Did Not Need To Be Too Rigid'"]    [Text] The somewhat mysterious and "incomplete" character  of the 7 May closed-door meeting in the Crimea between Ukraine's  acting Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy on one side and Crimean  President Yu. Meshkov, Deputy Prime Minister Ye. Saburov, and V.  Minin, minister-chief of the State Affairs Service on the other,  made those reporters who attended them, shrug their shoulders  helplessly. The latter failed to learn anything concrete, even  at the news conference held to review the results of the talks.    Given that a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent was not on  Yu. Zvyahilskyy's team, we had no other choice than to place a  telephone call directly to Yu. Meshkov. It was not easy to get  through. Meshkov spoke leniently and politely, but was as  taciturn as ever. He confirmed that in the spotlight had been  the issues of Crimea's economic independence, adding: "We tried  to remove the air of mutual distrust, although it was not my or  Yukhym Leonidovych's fault that such distrust existed." The  negotiations were held in a friendly atmosphere and, as was  underlined by Meshkov, Zvyahilskyy had demonstrated a desire to  understand the Crimean side's stance. Meshkov added: "Under  those circumstances, as you understand, I did not find it  necessary to be excessively firm." Not without content he  mentioned that relations between Kiev and Crimea, or rather the  Ukrainian and Crimean Governments, are entering the sphere of  normality and "taking an acceptable course."    I asked from what angle President Meshkov's notorious  decrees  had been discussed -- the ones that practically declared Crimea  a free economic zone. The Crimean president assured me that  Zvyahilskyy had not dictated anything or exerted any kind of  pressure. It should rather be said that there had been a quite  reasonable desire to coordinate ways to resolve common problems.    Summing up what was said by President Meshkov, the meeting  gave the two sides satisfaction and hope for further  understanding.    What has changed in Crimea since the adoption of the  economic  decrees? According to Meshkov, business circles of Ukraine,  especially its eastern regions, as well as other former USSR  republics, and foreign countries have dramatically increased  their interest in Crimea. There have been attractive proposals  on the part of large firms from Japan, Korea, the United States,  Austria, Germany, France, and other countries.    Why has the process of privatizing land been discontinued in  Crimea? Meshkov answered that land in Crimea is much more  valuable than in other regions: "One cannot treat a fine-wooled  lamb and a lousy sheep in the same way. Once land prices are  brought in line with world standards, we will carry out  privatization." This sounds logical!</p>

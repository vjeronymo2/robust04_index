			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / MMC findings set to be opened up Industry and consumer organisations will have more opportunity to comment on monopoly inquiry findings before the government decides whether to accept recommendations bythe Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Mr Michael Heseltine indicated yesterday. Speaking to the Confederation of British Industry in London, the trade and industry secretary said that consultation could be a vital step in weighing policy alternatives. He said that those involved had the benefit of knowing the full extent of the commission's analysis and findings. The procedure wasparticularly useful for reports which might lead to substantial change. Mr Heseltine said consultation on the recent gas report had proved invaluable in ensuring that his decisions were taken with the best possible knowledge of their likely effects. He rejected the recommendation that British Gas should be required to sell off its trading business by early 1997. Instead he decided that British Gas should operate its pipeline and trading arms as separate businesses. Pressure for the commission's broader findings to be opened up to wider scrutiny has increased in recent years.</p>

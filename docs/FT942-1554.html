			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa eases on 'neutral' budget proposals The budget had little effect on the country's financial markets, the initial reaction being that it was broadly 'neutral'. Among the proposals was a 5 percentage-point cut in corporation tax to 35 per cent. Brokers reported that gold stocks were aided in the afternoon session by a further advance in the price of bullion. The overall index receded 15 to 5,706, industrials declined 11 to 6,583 and the gold shares index dipped 2 to 2,243. Remgro, which had lost ground recently on fears that the budget might contain proposals lifting cigarette and alcohol taxes, improved 75 cents to R28.25. Among gold issues, both Vaal Reefs and Kloof lost R1, to R56.75 and R429 respectively. De Beers relinquished R1.25 at R113.75 on rumours that negotiations with Russia concerning the sale of diamonds had been called off. Barlows finished 25 cents softer at R35.25.</p>

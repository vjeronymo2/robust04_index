			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall replaced as trust manager THE BOARD of the European Project Investment Trust yesterday announced that it had appointed Murray Johnstone to replace Jupiter Tyndall as investment managers of the trust. The change is another setback for Jupiter Tyndall, the financial services group formed from the merger last year between Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin and Tyndall Holdings. Pacific Horizon, another trust managed by Jupiter Tyndall, is currently the subject of an agreed bid from Martin Currie Pacific, which will mean the loss of another management contract. However, Jupiter Tyndall has acquired, on behalf of its clients, an 11 per cent stake in European Project, and has informally proposed to the board that shareholders should be given the opportunity to sell their shares at as close as possible to asset value. Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, said that it was an important principle that shareholders should have this option if the management is changed. If European Project rejects the suggestion, then Jupiter Tyndall has the option of calling an extraordinary meeting to vote on the proposal. Mr Duffield said that Jupiter was surprised at the change of manager, given the performance of the trust. Association of Investment Trust Company figures show that the trust had the 3rd best (out of 13) asset performance of European general trusts over the year to March 31. Mr Jonathan Bradley, chairman of European Project, said that there had been pressure from shareholders to narrow the discount and expand the asset base of the trust. A proposal from Jupiter Tyndall to merge European Project with Jupiter European investment trust, and create a new split capital trust, had been rejected. Mr Bradley felt that Murray Johnstone's strong presence in the private investor market should bring in extra demand for the trust's shares, via savings schemes and personal equity plans, thereby helping to narrow the discount. Investment trusts have been very successful in attracting private investors over the last few years, a process which has reduced the discount to net assets on which trust shares have traditionally traded. Mr Bradley said that in future he thought it would be 'quite difficult for trust management companies that don't have some means of reducing the discount to be successful'. He added: 'The days of huge discounts and cosy sewn-up boards are over'. European Project's shares were only trading at a discount of 8 per cent yesterday but Mr Bradley said the discount had averaged 'in the high teens' for quite long periods and had only narrowed after the board had announced, on April 10, plans to change the investment management arrangements. Murray Johnstone has agreed to take a reduced fee of 0.5 per cent in the first year of managing the trust. In the following two years of its three year contract, the fee will be 1 per cent.</p>

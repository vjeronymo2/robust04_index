"We must thus prepare a solid blueprint for peace. We must  strive to establish a world free from the fear of war and  nuclear holocaust. In this context, North Korea's lack of  nuclear transparency is an ever more urgent issue," Kim told a  lecture meeting at Japan's prestigious Waseda University.    His remarks came one day after Hans Blix, director general  of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to a  meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea broke its  vow to allow IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear facilities.    Kim, dressed in a purple and black academic gown given to  him  by Waseda officials, issued the appeal in front of some 1,000  Japanese and South Korean students, academics and journalists  who packed the university's Okuma auditorium.    Minutes before, Kim was awarded the university's honorary  doctorate. Some 400 South Korean students are studying at the  university out of a total student population of 46,000.    During the president's speech, about 200 ultraleftist  radicals demonstrated outside the hall, demanding the  cancellation of the South Korean Government's plan to deploy a  Patriot antimissile system to counter North Korean ballistic  missiles.    The president, now on a three-day official visit to Japan,  denounced the Pyongyang government for defying the IAEA's  demands for full inspection of its nuclear facilities in  Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.    "It is depressing that North Korea continues to disregard  the  global demand for its nuclear transparency, casting a dark cloud  over the Korean peninsula and the future of the Asia-Pacific  region," the president said.    In his speech entitled, "A Blueprint for a New Asia and a  New  World," he said, "During this past century of Western inroads  into the East, Asia was thrown into a state of shock and  confusion. From that point on, Asia has been anxious to catch  up to Western civilization."    "Now however, the world's center stage is shifting to the  Pacific and East Asia is becoming the focus of world attention.  Asians should now reflect on themselves and see Asia in a new  light. We Asians must join hands to build a new Asia and a new  world as well," he said.    "Our two peoples should discard past prejudices for good and  accept each other with open hearts and minds. We should  honestly recognize the truths of history and have the courage to  accept their lessons. A nation that fails to learn these  lessons is bound to repeat past mistakes. We should join hands  to shape a fulfilling future based on mutual trust."    "To that end, young people of both countries, who are not  steeped in old attitudes, must take the lead. If our young  people march onward hand in hand, the future of the Asia-Pacific  region will be ever more peaceful and fruitful. Our future  hinges on their resolve and deeds," the president said.    In the afternoon, Kim delivered a speech at Tokyo's Waseda  University, where he elaborated on his vision of a "blueprint  for a new Asia and a new world."    Kim urged North Korea to accept unimpeded inspection of its  nuclear facilities to prevent an outbreak of a "nuclear  holocaust."    "We must strive to establish a world free from the fear of  war and nuclear holocaust," Kim told a lecture meeting at  Japan's prestigious Waseda university.

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO LIGHT RAIL  </P> <P> A July 13 article on the performance of American rail systems erroneously  quoted Sacramento's light rail ridership as 13,000 in contrast with projections  of 50,000.  </P> <P> Actually, in the final environmental impact statement, adopted just prior to  the commitment to build the system, the federally approved weekday ridership  forecast was 20,500. Current ridership is now over 21,000 daily boardings.  Rush-hour trains are crowded; additional cars are under construction to expand  capacity, and the system is generally considered a technical and political  success.  </P> <P> THOMAS G. MATOFF  </P> <P> General Manager, Sacramento  </P> <P> Regional Transit District  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not economic sophistry, but verifiable reality Sir, Stephen Beer (Letters, October 8) perpetuates a common misconception about the supposed impracticality of 'simple economic theory' by confusing two aspects of market behaviour. All market actors who seek returns want to be correct in their forecasts, not just those concerned for their political reputations. Such motivations are not only no guarantee of good judgment (witness former chancellor Norman Lamont's hapless performance on Black Wednesday), but are in fact irrelevant in considering markets' real utility as the best available collectors, processors, and disseminators of information. Mr Beer's 'casual observation' that 'most market participants can be wrong some of the time' in fact demonstrates this virtue. No single person or group will likely be right about the future, or even about very much of the present. However, in generating prices out of countless individual calculations, markets co-ordinate the limited bits of information that participants actually do have - and far more regularly and capably than any central institution. This is not sophistry, but historically verifiable reality. Yes, financial markets are full of small traders who blindly follow trends, which may themselves be based on unreasonable or unfounded expectations. Yes, they are prone to panics and the occasional disproportionate influence of a George Soros, and sometimes require correction. They are indeed imperfect and an inappropriate object of anyone's 'faith'. Nonetheless, their collective best guesses about future developments such as inflation are based on far more information than could ever fit into a brief on Bank of England governor Eddie George's desk. Distortions in markets are exceptional by definition, and they correct themselves as new or hitherto under-appreciated information comes to light. In central banks however, under the guise of 'correction', distortion is the name of the game. Casual observation suggests to me that such intervention is very rarely successful or beneficial - an odd foundation for such important and expensive institutions. Practical experience has exposed the folly of attempting to direct goods and services centrally. Why are we still willing to countenance similar discretionary power regarding bonds and currencies?

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Olivetti poised for growth, says chairman Olivetti, the Italian computer group, is entering a new growth cycle, Mr Carlo De Benedetti told shareholders yesterday. Mr De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, told the group's annual meeting that revenues increased by 6 per cent in the first four months of 1994, and orders by 11 per cent, compared with the equivalent period last year. Shareholders approved the issue of up to 250m shares as part of a convertible bond issue which will raise a maximum of L575bn (Dollars 3.4bn) for expansion. The issue, aimed at international institutional investors, is likely to be launched before the summer, through an international consortium led by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. One of the main targets for funding will be the development of the GSM cellular telephone network in Italy. Olivetti heads the international Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium which in March won the licence to operate the network. '(Olivetti) is preparing to reap the benefits of a sweeping structural reorganisation,' the group said yesterday. Last year, Olivetti lost L465bn, compared with a loss of L650bn the previous year, but increased sales for the first time since 1990 and cut net debt to L798bn from L960bn. Developing the GSM network is expected to cost the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium L3,000bn, of which Olivetti will provide roughly a third. This is in line with its stake in the joint venture, which includes Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis of the US, Mannesmann of Germany and Lehman Brothers. Within the last month, Olivetti has also set up a Dollars 280m stand-by credit facility with a group of international and Italian banks. Mr De Benedetti said the combination of the capital-raising exercise and the organisation of the stand-by credit confirmed 'the great confidence of the international financial community in Olivetti'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Indigenous Newsprint Industry Facing Crisis"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Janata Dal member, Mr.  Sharad Yadav, today drew the attention of the Government in the  Lok Sabha to the crisis caused in the indigenous newsprint  industry because of the relaxation in excise duty on foreign  newsprint.    Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Yadav said India  needed 5.5 lakh tonnes of newsprint and it was met by indigenous  production. Only one lakh tonnes was required from abroad.  Because of excise duty cuts, about three lakh tonnes of  newsprint had been imported and that had resulted in stockpiling  of 40,000 tonnes.    Mr. Yadav said that while Rs. 450 crores worth of foreign  exchange was being spent the inflow had caused distress among  the indigenous mills.</p>

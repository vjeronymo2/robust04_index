			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Xian, Chan Wai-fong and agencies] </F>   [Excerpts] More than 100 officials and staff of the China  Northwest Airlines last night turned Xian's Feitian Hotel into a  reception centre for relatives and friends of the 160 victims of  China's worst reported air crash on Monday [6 June]. [passage  omitted]    Before they left Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport] yesterday,  they complained that Chinese authorities had delayed telling  them about the tragedy, in which 10 other foreigners were  killed. They said they would be demanding "due compensation"  for the whole incident. Northwest offered each family US$5,000  (about HK$38,600) to cover the cost of their trip to Xian.    Relatives were holding meetings in their hotels early this  morning to decide what demands they would make for visiting the  site and claiming the bodies. "They haven't told us anything  yet, I just have to wait," said a Chinese woman from Beijing,  whose business colleague was killed when the Tupolev 154 crashed  soon after take-off from Xian on a regular flight to Guangzhou.  [passage omitted]    A spokesman for the Government of Shaanxi province said the  two explosions had been caused by the "breakup of the flight  deck" but denied there had been a fire.    An airline spokesman said the pilot had not made a mistake.  He said that just before the disaster, the pilot, in his  mid-40s and with 20 years of flying experience, had shouted that  he was losing control. "The plane was shaking as if from  violent turbulence -- listing at an angle of first 20, then 30,  then 40 degrees. Radar equipment had broken down," the  spokesman said. "The pilot could not hear the control tower,  though the control tower could hear him. He said he would take  the plane in for landing. Then the control tower lost  communications."    At the crash scene in the village of Mingdu, 30 km southeast  of Xian, three parts of a plane were clearly visible from  outside the barrier set up by security officials. The nose of  the plane could be seen lying flat in the gold-coloured wheat  fields that surround the small village. About one km away, the  plane's large white tail was stuck into the ground like the end  of a dart. [passage omitted]    A China Northwest spokesman said the airline was debating  whether to ground the remainder of its TU-154s for safety  checks. The airline operates more TU-154s than it does any  other plane. A Russian aviation source quoted by the ITAR-TASS  news agency said China had taken delivery of the jet in December  1986 and that it had been given a scheduled repair in 1992.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Tools to secure a future: Plans for vocational training at UK schools Southborough School in south London is swimming against the tide. Its 14-year-old pupils are offered vocational courses on top of their academic curriculum. But in the three years since it introduced this radical measure, the school has found it awkward to fit vocational training into the strict academic requirements of the national curriculum. The school is determined to persist. As one teacher remarked, 'it is improving standards because it means a more relevant and coherent curriculum for youngsters.' For the moment, Southborough's scheme is very much the exception to the rule. But this may be about to change. Government curriculum advisers plan challenging new vocational courses for 14-year-olds. They aim to create a new system of vocational qualifications that pupils and employers would find as attractive as the academic path towards A-levels needed for entry into higher education. Few dispute that Britain's vocational education system needs an overhaul. UK universities are internationally renowned for the quality of education they give the top 30 per cent of academic achievers. But vocational education has long been the poor relation. The absence of high-quality vocational education is reflected in Britain's shortage of qualified skilled workers, according to Professor Sig Prais of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Only 36 per cent of the British workforce has a vocational qualification, against Germany's 74 per cent. Professor Prais believes the lack of skilled technicians has harmed UK industry. Work practices are inefficient, and qualified graduates are sometimes 'wasted' doing jobs better left to trained technicians. The latest attempt to fill the vocational gap in the UK comes from Sir Ron Dearing, who chairs the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the quango advising on the content of school education in England and Wales. Sir Ron believes many teenagers have lost interest in academic study and gain little from their final years of compulsory education. This week, he suggested pupils aged 14 to 16 should be able to devote up to 20 per cent of their time at school to vocational courses. The aim would be to provide 'pathways' into vocational education and training after leaving school at 16. Sir Ron added the vocational courses should initially be in one of five subjects: manufacturing; art and design; health and social care; leisure and tourism; and business and finance. This list might later be extended. The courses would lead to an as-yet unnamed qualification that would complement, not replace, the General Certificate of Secondary Education now taken at age 16. Candidates could still take as many as seven GCSEs alongside the new qualification in a typical school timetable. Sir Ron is considering making passes in vocational subjects dependant on passing appropriate GCSE subjects. A pass in manufacturing, for example, might require a pass in GCSE science. The qualifications awarded for the new courses would count towards the General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ). This 'vocational A-level' is being introduced for 18-year-olds, amid controversy over whether it is rigorous enough to carry the same esteem as A-levels. Sir Ron plans to consult widely and run pilots for two years. But he already has considerable support among employers and teachers. He also seems to have the backing of the government which is keen to see an improvement in vocational education post-16. But the consensus in favour is not total. A leading critic is Professor Eric Bolton of London university's Institute of Education, a former chief inspector of schools. He warns the proposals risk recreating a stratified education system in which able pupils take academic subjects and the rest are fobbed off with vocational courses which would be perceived as inferior. 'Historically, whenever we've made these divisions in the past, they've become hierarchical,' he says. The 1944 Education Act promised a tripartite system of grammar schools, technical schools and secondary moderns with each enjoying parity of esteem. But grammar schools were soon perceived as offering a superior education, says Prof Bolton. Sir Ron responds to the danger that this could happen by declaring his determination to challenge the idea that vocational qualifications are inferior. 'I am all too conscious of the common tendency to consider the academic as first-rate and the practical applications of knowledge and understanding as second-rate. It is a tragedy that we have the value structures we do, and I rail against them.' A key to changing these values lies in persuading employers that the new vocational qualification will meet their needs, so that students believe it is worth working for. As Prof Bolton says: 'What makes German youngsters so interested in vocational qualifications is that they can't get into employment without them. If British employers made vocational education pay, youngsters would do it.' The portents are good: the Confederation of British Industry backs Sir Ron's proposals, saying they have 'the potential to transform young people's learning'. The CBI wants more employer involvement in the courses, as 'children do not learn about manufacturing by sitting for two years in a classroom'. And it believes there must be opportunities to 'mix and match' vocational training with academic study. Thus if Sir Ron can introduce a vocational qualification that employers are willing to pay for, the British education system may at last start turning out the skilled workers that continental education systems produce with apparent ease.</p>

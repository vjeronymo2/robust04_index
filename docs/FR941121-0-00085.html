			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Provisions of This Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have adopted the provisions of the October 7, 1992, proposed rule, with the following changes, which have been discussed above:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have revised proposed &sect;417.440(f) (``Notice of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care''). This proposed section required that, before giving notice of noncoverage, the HMO or CMP must obtain the concurrence of the attending physician. We have revised ``attending physician'' to ``its affiliated physician responsible for the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Proposed &sect;417.454 (``Charges to Medicare enrollees'') is revised to restore existing provisions that were erroneously removed in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have revised paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;417.620 (``Responsibility for reconsiderations; time limits) to require that the HMO or CMP issue the reconsidered determination to the enrollee, or submit an explanation and file to us, within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have revised proposed &sect;417.838(b) (``Actions that are not organization determinations'') by adding a new paragraph (3). New paragraph (3) specifies that a determination regarding services that are covered under the HCPP's agreement with us that the enrollee obtained from unaffiliated providers or physicians, in violation of the HCPP's enrollment agreement, is not an organization determination for purposes of administrative review procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above changes, in a number of sections, we made a nomenclature change by substituting ``HMO or CMP'' and its plural and possessive forms for the words ``organization'', ``organizations'' and ``organization's'', respectively. This change was made to use consistent terminology throughout part 417.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also have made technical changes and minor editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Paperwork Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 417.440(f), 417.605, 417.620, and 417.836 of this rule contain additional requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). HMOs and CMPs are required to notify beneficiaries if the HMO or CMP refers a request for reconsideration to HCFA. We estimate that this reporting burden will be approximately 5 minutes per case. Also, before a hospital discharge, HMOs and CMPs are required to provide Medicare enrollees with a written notice of a determination that an enrollee's inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary. We estimate that the reporting burden for an HMO or CMP that has not delegated the discharge decision to the hospital to provide the written notice of noncoverage to be approximately 10 minutes per notice; for a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP to complete a request for immediate PRO review of a notice of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary to be approximately 10 minutes per request; for the HMO or CMP to submit requested medical information to the PRO, to be approximately 1/2 hour per response. HCPPs are required to develop appeal procedures and inform Medicare enrollees of appeal rights. We estimate that it will take an HCPP 40 hours to develop these appeal procedures and 1 hour to process each appeal. A notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when OMB approval is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

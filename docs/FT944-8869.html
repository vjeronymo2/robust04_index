			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Italy launches Dollars 4.58bn eurobond issue Italy yesterday launched the largest eurobond issue of the year in order to complete its international borrowing programme for 1994. The issue takes the amount the country has borrowed on foreign markets this year to Dollars 11.6bn, making it the world's second-largest borrower on international bond markets. The Y450bn (Dollars 4.58bn) issue is the largest offering of yen-denominated bonds ever offered outside the Japanese government bond market. It is the high point of a four-year campaign by the Italian treasury to increase international investors' interest in the country's bond market  - the world's largest outside the US and Japan. The strategy has proved a success, with the proportion of Italy's debt held by outside investors increasing from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent between 1990 and 1992, and reaching a peak of 14.5 per cent last February. However, since May this year, international bond and equity investors have been frightened away from the Italian market by uncertainties about the future of the rightwing coalition led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Italian treasury officials believe the proportion of foreign investment may have dropped below 10 per cent. However, Mr Vincenzo La Via, a director of foreign borrowing at the Italian treasury, hailed the offering as a success. Bond traders said interest from European investors was disappointing, but Mr La Via said there had been strong demand from Japan. The issue comes amid continued political sparring between government, opposition and trade unions - and within the coalition itself - over the 1995 budget. Aimed at cutting Italy's large annual deficit, the budget was at first welcomed as tougher than expected. But analysts now fear it may have to be toned down to win parliamentary approval by the December 31 deadline. Mr Berlusconi has used confidence motions this week to force sensitive elements in the budget through the chamber of deputies. Italy has turned to the Japanese yen market for all three of its main foreign borrowing operations this year. In January it borrowed Y300bn, and in June it borrowed Y175bn as part of a Dollars 4bn multi-currency transaction. The bond offering was split into three separate issues, of three, 10 and 20-year bonds, designed to appeal to Japanese and European investors.</p>

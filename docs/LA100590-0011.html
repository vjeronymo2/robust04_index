			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROOKIE GIVES FLAMES VICTORY IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> Tim Sweeney, playing in his first regular-season National Hockey League game,  scored at 1:07 of overtime Thursday night to give the Calgary Flames a 3-2  victory over the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener at Calgary.  </P> <P> The Flames' Al MacInnis broke a 1-1 deadlock at 8:15 of the third period, only  to have the Canucks' Rob Murphy tie it again, forcing overtime.  </P> <P> Sergei Makarov scored the other goal for the Flames, and Jim Sandlak had one  for the Canucks -- both in the first period.  </P> <P> Calgary's Mike Vernon, who faced 26 shots, had an acrobatic night, making  several saves in the second period to prevent Vancouver from taking the lead.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Andy Moog's goaltending and first-period goals by  Dave Poulin and Cam Neely carried the Bruins past the Flyers at Boston.  </P> <P> The Bruins are 5-0-1 in their last six openers.  </P> <P> Moog lost his bid for his 10th shutout with 4:09 left when Rick Tocchet knocked  in a rebound from the slot.  </P> <P> Craig Janney made it 3-0 with 7:44 left and Boston's Ray Bourque closed out the  scoring into an empty-net with 57 seconds left.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, N.Y. Rangers 3 -- Dirk Graham scored two goals, and Ed Belfour  stopped 27 shots as the Blackhawks defeated the Rangers at Chicago to win their  first opener since 1986.  </P> <P> Chris Chelios, acquired from Montreal during the off-season, scored a  third-period goal on a 45-foot slapshot at the 41-second mark and assisted on  both of Graham's goals.  </P> <P> It was the Rangers' first loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago since Feb. 19,  1987.  </P> <P> Chicago had a 4-1 lead, but the Rangers made the game exciting when Bernie  Nicholls scored his second goal of the night at 19:14 of the final period and  Ray Sheppard scored with six seconds left.  </P> <P> Quebec 3, Hartford 3 -- Guy Lafleur, Joe Sakic and Mats Sundin scored in a  5-minute 36-second span of the second period, but the Nordiques had to settle  for a tie at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> After the Whalers took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals by Kevin Dineen  and Pat Verbeek, the Nordiques tied it in the first 2:11 of the second period  on power-play goals by the 39-year-old Lafleur and Sakic.  </P> <P> Sundin, No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, scored his first NHL goal to break the  tie at 5:36 of the second period, but Todd Krygier got the Whalers even later  in the period.  </P> <P> The Whalers had a man advantage for the final 1:37 of overtime, but Ron Francis  hit the right post at 2:02, and Quebec goalie John Tanner stopped a shot by  Kevin Dineen with 21 seconds left.  </P> <P> Detroit 3, New Jersey 3 -- Brendan Shanahan scored with 15 seconds left in  regulation to give the Devils a tie with the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> New Jersey trailed, 3-1, but rallied in Bryan Murray's debut as Red Wing coach  and general manager. Claude Lemieux started the Devils' comeback by scoring his  second goal with 8:20 left.  </P> <P> Brent Fedyk and Sergei Fedorov put the Red Wings ahead, 3-1, with goals in the  second period.  </P> <P> Marc Habscheid gave Detroit a 1-0 lead 3:55 into the game with a short-handed  goal, but Lemieux tied it about six minutes later.  </P> <P> Montreal 3, Buffalo 3 -- Stephane Richer scored with 3:43 left to give the  Canadiens a tie with the Sabres at Buffalo.  </P> <P> Buffalo took a 3-2 lead when Dale Hawerchuk fired a short shot past goalie  Patrick Roy at 6:32 of the third period.  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny and Dave Andreychuk scored for the Sabres, while Russ  Courtnall and Brian Skrudland scored for Montreal.  </P> <P> Winnipeg 7, Toronto 1 -- Dave Ellett had two goals and an assist as the Jets  routed the Maple Leafs at Winnipeg.  </P> <P> Jet rookie goalie Stephane Beauregard had 25 saves.  </P> <P> Dave Reid opened the scoring for Toronto, tipping a shot past Beauregard 1:48  into the first period, but Paul MacDermid evened the score 31 seconds later.  </P> <P> Dave McLlwain and Moe Mantha scored before the first period ended, Ellett  scored twice in the second period and the rout was on.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- Brett Hull, who led the NHL with 72 goals last  season, scored twice, and the Blues downed the North Stars at Minnesota to  spoil the debut of Coach Bob Gainey.  </P> <P> The score was tied, 1-1, but Hull scored with 3:37 left in the second period  and made it 3-1 with an unassisted goal in the third period.  </P> <P> Dave Gagner's power-play goal gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead in the first period.  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe setback News of Thursday's air crash in France involving the Airbus 330 aircraft weakened British Aerospace leaving the shares to buck the market trend as they closed 3 down at 454p. BAe is not only a 20 per cent stake holder in the Airbus consortium project, but also builds the wings of the Airbus series of aircraft. Sentiment was also hurt by food retailer Asda's intention to write down the value of its holding in property company Burwood House Group, jointly owned with BAe. Analysts suggested the company will soon have to revalue its 50 per cent holding in the joint venture to match the move made by Asda. Researchers also pointed out that BAe's announcement on Thursday that it was changing the way it funds its 30 per cent holding in mobile phones operator Hutchinson telecommunications would effectively add previously off-balance-debt on to the balance sheet. The latest upsurge in crude oil prices, which saw Brent crude for July delivery move comfortably above the Dollars 18 a barrel level, saw the oil majors make strong progress. 'If the dollar stages anything of a rally next week, then the leaders should do very well,' said one oil specialist at a leading UK intergrated house. Oil prices were said to be moving higher in wake of strike threats in the Nigerian oilfields could with worries that the civil unrest in the Yemen could halt the 200,000 barrels a day oil flow from that country. BP moved up 2 1/2 to 392p, while Shell edged up 4 to 684p. British Gas were held back by ongoing regulatory fears and eased 1 1/2 to 267p. But one of the market's top broking houses was said to be talking a strong buy story on the shares, emphasising the dividend dividend. Burmah Castrol was one of the FT-SE 100's worst individual performers, the shares sliding 15 to 851p after a sell note published by Nomura, the Japanese-owned broker. Mr Nick Clayton at Nomura said Burmah shares had outperformed by 20 per cent over the past six months and stood at their highest price earnings rating against the UK market for more than ten years. 'Investors can currently buy BP on a lower rating to Burmah thereby gaining exposure to the superior earnings growth resulting from its aggressive restructuring and cost cutting programme,' the Nomura analyst said. Talk of better than expected new subscriber numbers for June, rounding off what is expected to be an excellent quarterly performance for the cellular phones group, was said to have been behind the latest rise in Vodafone shares, which jumped 9 to 499p. ICI rose 15 more to 790p after a successful presentation at Goldman Sachs, the US brokerage. Chiltern Radio leapt 33 to 273p after the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust rejected the CLT bid for its existing 18.5 per cent and moved into the market to buy a near-10 per cent stake at 300p a share. A volatile session was seen in luxury products group Vendome. The shares closed 6 better at 444p, after it suggested in a results statement that recovery hopes may be premature. Activity in the banks sector subsided after the flurry of selling that affected the shares on Thursday in the wake of news that Abbey National had instigated a price cutting war in bank overnight interest rates. Abbey stock moved up 7 to 400p. Dealers said TSB, which dropped below the 200p level for the first time since September last year, was the only leading bank to suffer any follow through selling after the rate cutting news. TSB shares settled a net 2 1/2 off at 200 1/2 p on turnover of 5.1m shares. Barclays, on the other hand, rose 11 to 530p and NatWest 9 1/2 to 441p. The market's leading insurance brokers began to creep ahead amid talk that a broker buy recommendation is in the process of being prepared. Willis Corroon edged up 2 to 1480p, as did Sedgwick, 174p. The Hoare Govett buy recommendation helped life stocks move ahead with Prudential leading the sector higher and finally 4 better at 291p. Continued profit-taking in Allied Lyons, which is to hold an analysts presentations on Tuesday, saw the shares give up 10 to 543p. A squeeze in Kingfisher helped the shares appreciate 9 to 508p. A single large buyer of Marks &amp; Spenser sent the shares climbing 7 1/2 to 399p. Shares in Rolls-Royce closed 2 ahead at 175p, following trade of 3.8m, after a recommendation from investment bank Lehman Brothers in its review of the six best performing stocks of the year. Lehman said: 'We believe that over the next 12 months or so, Rolls-Royce may at last be able to achieve some positive earnings surprises.' Analysts at the bank also predicted an improvement in civil spares business.</p>

Novikov: "Strike Committees Are Politicized"] </F>   [Text]]While creating strike committees in  productions included in the Kirovskiy Zavod Association, the  consolidated Kirovskiy trade union committee suggests creating a  citywide strike committee as well. In the words of the  association's trade union leader, Vladimir Yudin, the task of  the strike committee today is not to organize but, on the  contrary, to warn about protest actions.    The most politically active Kirovskiy Zavod has it no worse  than other enterprises of the city. The average wages are close  to 200,000 rubles [R]. Only about 4,000 people have been laid  off from the tractor and former tank productions, but they  receive a stipend of 44,000. For steel smelters who have work  orders, the wages are generally twice the average. Nonetheless,  the workers, in Yudin's words, are prepared for protest actions,  and the steel smelters are guaranteeing their support for the  unemployed tractor builders. The reason, in the opinion of the  plant trade union committee, is that the labor collectives  consider the present economic reforms to be a blind alley.  Taxes and prices raised by monopolists will sooner or later  destroy the economy completely.    The consolidated city strike committee could also put  pressure on central and regional authorities in order to develop  a new economic policy. The strike committees of specific  productions must "apply pressure" on the administrations of the  enterprises, but not so as to gain any concessions but so that  the employer too will influence the government on his own  behalf. In other words--the strike committees are becoming  politicized.</p>

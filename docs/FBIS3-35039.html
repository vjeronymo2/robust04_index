			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, (IRNA) -- Secretary General of the  Lebanese Hizbollah Seyyed Hassan Nasrollah said that the last  year operations of the Islamic Jihad against the Zionist regime  has forced Tel Aviv to admit that 1993 was one of the toughest  years for its military forces.    Nasrollah made the remark in an exclusive interview  published  in Wednesday issue of the English daily `TEHRAN TIMES'.    Turning to political activities of Hizbollah, he said the  Islamic movement in Lebanon has been fully active in the  political scene for the past year and had sent 12 deputies to  the parliament.    "The importance of this approach is that it shows  Hizbollah's  popularity and proves that Western and regional propaganda  against us are totally baseless."    He described Hizbollah's social and cultural activities over  this period as spectacular but voiced its opposition with the  so-called peace process from the very beginning.    "We have particularly rejected Lebanon's entry into these  treacherous talks, because they are against our country's  political and national interests and we feel it is illogical for  Lebanon to participate in them."    Asked about Hizbollah's reaction in case Lebanon joins the  peace process and signs a peace treaty, Nasrollah said that such  a peace may create obgligatinos for governments but not for  people.    Stressing that people were after a real peace and not the  one  on the process, he said "when a peace treaty is finalized we  will then announce our stand according to the realities of the  time."    On the possibility of Hizbollah laying down its weapons, he  declined to give any comments in this connection or the  consequences of regional changes resulting from the peace  accord. However, he said, "we will address both issues when  positive changes occure in the area."    He called the existing relations between Hizbollah and the  Lebanese Government "severely tense, negative and confused".    Nasrollah described the present policies of Lebanon as  dangerous for the Lebanese people and for the future of the  country.    Referring to Hizbollah's relations with the Lebanese  Government as very disappointing, he said that not only the  government of Rafiq Harari was not able to solve the existing  problems but it created new difficulties.    "What deteriorated our relations with Rafiq Harari's  administration was the army's attack on our peaceful September  13 demonstration protesting the Gaza-Jericho partial authonomy  treaty," he said and called for Harari's resignation.    "Generally speaking, establishment of an Islamic government  seems to be ideally suited for all Islamic countries, yet, we  are against forced solutions."    Turning to the recent Geneva meeting of the Syrian and U.S.  presidents, he said that according to the media they disagreed  on the issues related to Hizbollah. Reportedly, U.S. President  Bill Clinton considered all liberation movements as terrorists  while syria regarded them, specially those in Lebanon and  Palestine, as legal and natural.    "People whose lands are occupied by foreigners have the  right  to fight for the return of their territorial sovereignty and no  one can deprive them of this right," he stressed.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CSUN SEEKS EXTRA YEAR FOR DEVAUGHN  </P> <P> For weeks Cal State Northridge football coaches have been under the impression  they were losing their top three tailbacks -- seniors Albert Fann, Victor  DeVaughn and Oscar Pittman.  </P> <P> According to DeVaughn, they were wrong.  </P> <P> He says he was a member of the Eastern Utah football team in 1986, but that he  didn't play. After sitting out a season, he spent the 1988 and '89 seasons at  Grossmont College before transferring to CSUN.  </P> <P> Northridge will need to document DeVaughn's claim before granting him another  season of eligibility. Larry Severied, a former assistant coach at Eastern  Utah, says he remembers DeVaughn playing some, but perhaps not enough for it to  count as anything but a redshirt year. Eastern Utah dropped football after the  1987 season.  </P> <P> As Fann's understudy, DeVaughn (6-foot, 210 pounds) carried 34 times for 246  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The West Valley Eagles bantam (9- and 10-year-old) girls' team won its division  at The Athletics Congress National Junior Olympics cross-country championships  at Tranquility Park in Omaha, Neb., on Saturday.  </P> <P> The Eagles totaled 40 points, 20 ahead of the runner-up team from Reno. West  Valley was led by Brandi Plasschaert, who finished second with a time of 12  minutes 33 seconds over the two-mile course.  </P> <P> The Burbank Bandits will play the West Los Angeles Falcons on Sunday for the  championship of the High Desert Football League.  </P> <P> The game is scheduled for 1 p.m. at Caltech in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The Bandits advanced to the championship game last Sunday with a 30-14 victory  over the Antelope Valley Crusaders.  </P> <P> The Falcons have won the league title three of the past four years.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters state that the smaller cargo compartments of the airplanes affected by this proposed AD are different from the larger compartments on the airplanes that are affected by AD 93&hyph;07&hyph;15, amendment 39&hyph;8547 (58 FR 21243, April 20, 1993), since those compartments contain pallets and/or containers. One commenter states that the smaller cargo compartments used in commuter service have not been established to be similar, from the standpoint of safety, to main deck Class B compartments of larger transports; therefore, any action to address fire safety should concentrate on large ``Combi'' cargo compartments, as in AD 93&hyph;07&hyph;15. Another commenter considers that the fire detection problems that may exist on jumbo-jet airplanes do not have any relevance for smaller airplanes. Another commenter states that the hazard of carrying large pallets/containers in increasingly large ``Combi'' compartments is the issue to be addressed, not the size of the compartment itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA disagrees that the smaller cargo compartments are not similar, with regard to fire safety, to the larger compartments containing pallets or containers. On the smaller transport airplanes, cargo and luggage are loaded in a manner such that smoke detection and access may be inhibited if the fire is deep-seated (buried in the cargo), much the same as in a container or pallet on a larger transport airplane. Further, the FAA has observed, and one commenter to the notice admitted, that in many instances, some operators of the smaller transport airplanes load the airplane's cargo compartments in such a manner that there is no place to displace the cargo within the compartment in order to get at a fire. This presents a two-fold hazard:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The fire cannot be accessed and continues to burn; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If cargo is removed from the cargo compartment, passengers could be exposed to fire, toxic smoke, and fumes; this situation is unsafe and contrary to the concept and rule requirements of the Class B cargo compartment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters provide information concerning the economic effects of the proposed AD. One of these commenters, an operator, states that it has had a long-term investment in its combi operations; however, if the rule is issued, any further ``Combi'' operations would be cost-prohibitive for this operator. This would force the operator to raise passenger ticket prices, and resort to less frequent all-passenger or all-cargo flights. Another commenter states that the proposed requirements of the rule would have a devastating effect on service to remote communities that have no alternative means of transport available. Another commenter states that it would cost up to $200,000 per airplane to accomplish the requirement to convert the cargo compartment to a Class C configuration; this would be a great economic burden for small operators. Another commenter estimated that the requirements of the proposed rule would cost 10% of its annual gross revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these comments and other information provided, the FAA must continue to consider the following aspects relevant to this rulemaking action:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A service history indicating that there has not been a fire in the Class B cargo compartments of the size of aircraft addressed by the proposed rule; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Cargo loading practices on the smaller transport category airplanes that may inhibit smoke detection and negate access requirements of the Class B cargo compartment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of fire in Class B cargo compartments and the impossibility of eliminating the potential for such fires, the FAA cannot conclude that the existing Class B compartments do not present an unsafe condition. However, this condition is a result of flaws in the underlying design standards for these compartments, and correcting those flaws may have significant economic and operational consequences. For these reasons, the FAA has concluded that issuance of an AD to address this condition is not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA now considers that a change to part 25 (``Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes'') of the FAR (14 CFR part 25) and to the relevant operating regulations of the FAR to address these issues is more appropriate and will allow further public participation in the rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, just prior to the time that the notice was published, a subgroup of the Department of Transportation Task Force on FAA Reform recommended that a Standing Advisory Committee for Rulemaking be established. The Secretary of Transportation approved this recommendation, and the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was chartered in 1991. The purpose of the committee is to provide advice and recommendations to the FAA concerning the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activity with respect to safety-related issues. The expected benefits of ARAC are to take advantage of the industry technical expertise and experience, to resolve controversies in an open forum, to resolve issues before formal rulemaking, and to broaden public participation in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has asked ARAC to consider 70 rulemaking issues, one of which is rulemaking relative to the Class B cargo compartment. A ``Class B Cargo Compartment Harmonization Working Group'' was established recently to formulate and harmonize an international position on amended requirements for the Class B cargo compartment as installed on transport category airplanes. In its deliberations, ARAC currently is considering the safety issues related to the Class B cargo compartment, appropriate rule requirements, necessary rule changes, estimated costs, and comments and advice from the aviation industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of this other on-going rulemaking activity, the FAA hereby withdraws the proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket 89&hyph;NM&hyph;205&hyph;AD, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 5, 1990 (55 FR 36284), is withdrawn. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Darrell M.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Enes Musovic report from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] This is the eighth day that the Chetniks have been  furiously attacking the free Gorazde territory. Their shells,  like the whirlwind -- which is the name of the latest Chetnik  offensive on the Gorazde territory -- have been claiming human  lives almost every hour. There are hundreds of wounded people.  Streams of blood and tears are literally pouring down the  streets of Gorazde and the surrounding villages. The Drina  River valley is resounding to the sound of explosions of  destructive shells of the largest calibers [words indistinct]  murdered, mutilated, and forlorn. Terror can again be seen on  the faces of the survivors.    Distress, tears, cries can be heard in the war hospital in  Gorazde. The rooms and corridors in medical institutions are  crowded. Additional facilities in the village and communal  areas are also packed as the wounded keep arriving. Some 30  seriously wounded are ready for evacuation, two of them are  urgent cases. Two surgeons, one anesthetist, and one  anesthesiologist from the Medicins sans Frontieres, with the few  but always present local doctors and medical staff have been  doing miracles. Many lives have been saved even with the  minimal conditions that exist in the Gorazde hospitals. There  is no adequate medical equipment, not enough medicine, no  sanitary material, no water, but there are many volunteers  giving blood who have done a lot so far. One should say that  the medical staff, although few in numbers, has been deployed in  all the field hospitals and are with the brave Gorazde defenders  on the most prominent positions facing the cutthroats of the  aggressor's army.</p>

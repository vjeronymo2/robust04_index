			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: David Copperfield - Magic He Walked Through the Great Wall of China; He has Made the Orient Express, a Jet Airplane, and the Statue of Liberty Disappear, reads the promotional blurb. So what is David Copperfield doing turning up aces and producing rings from his back pocket in the bleak open spaces of the Earls Court Arena? Padding out his act, I suppose. A man who returned magic to the days of Houdini by stage-managing elaborate public stunts, and brought it up to date by exploiting the sophistication of television, looks strangely deprived of his powers working at Earls Court. Without the big stunts you quickly realise that Copperfield's performance revolves around cutting up women and making them disappear - the magician's lot throughout the ages. During the two hour show he mislays more pretty girls than the average man loses socks. Loud music and awesome chutzpah married to saturnine good looks have made Copperfield the richest magician in history. His skill is in presentation: what he shows off is just the commonplace woof and warp of the conjurer's trade. This is not so much sleight of hand as sleight of personality. But Copperfield holds a crowd. The problem with most magicians is that the audience gets irritated with its own stupidity: it knows it is being tricked by something as facile as mirrors, or wires, or twins, but cannot quite see the joins. Copperfield disarms this criticism by constantly promising stupefaction and delivering surprise. I suppose I can guess how he managed to translate himself in a second from fondling a girl on stage to caressing the same girl (apparently) half way down the Arena, but the illusion shocks with its speed. And again it is probably no harder to saw your assistant in half vertically than horizontally, but Copperfield builds it up into an epic making event, if only by the size of his blade. Until familiarity takes hold, the scale of the tricks is impressive: you buy the sizzle. Unfortunately the great climax - Copperfield flying - is something of a let down. To the thousands at the rear of the Arena the sight of a small figure moving like a badly co-ordinated goldfish at the back of the stage against dark curtains cannot have been the most exciting of visions. It was not much more impressive near the stage. We wanted Copperfield to fly over us like Superman, not indulge in shenanigans which would have embarrassed a Victorian medium. Still there is something mysteriously eternal about magic - the elect have kept their secrets. It probably does the brotherhood no harm that Copperfield - assisted by fiancee, supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who sits centre front, gazes on in awe and is Copperfield's marketing gimmick - has such a smooth show biz approach that the punters are dazzled. But you can imagine old hands at the Magic Circle tut-tutting at this crass commercialisation of ancient rites.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Germany spells out Europe vision The European Union must take another big step in 1996 towards a federal future, under strict democratic control, and with clearly defined powers, a top-level German think-tank urged yesterday. It set out an agenda for the inter-governmental conference which is intended to complete the work of the Maastricht treaty, and lay the foundations for an expansion of the EU to include member states in central and eastern Europe. In a report which reflects widespread thinking at the highest levels of the German government, the group spelt out proposals for a bi-cameral system which would put the European parliament and the European council of ministers on an equal footing. Such an idea would almost certainly pit the German government against the UK and France, which have strenuously resisted any effort to give the European parliament equal powers to the council. At the same time the report called for precise definition of the competences which should be exercised at European level, and those which should be maintained by national governments, in an effort to curb the process towards centralisation in the Union. The experts involved in the report include Mr Joachim Bitterlich, who is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's personal adviser on foreign affairs and above all a specialist on European affairs, Prof Ernst Benda, former president of the federal constitutional court in Karlsruhe, and Prof Werner Maihofer, former federal interior minister. Their aim is to start a debate now, on the eve of the German presidency of the EU, and well before the 1996 deadline for the next inter-governmental conference on the EU, which is supposed to complete the work of the Maastricht treaty. In spite of their determination both to resolve the conflict between European integration and the preservation of national identity, and to resist the trend to European centralisation, their federal vision seems certain to arouse hostility from anti-federalists, above all in countries such as Britain, Denmark and France. The self-styled European structural commission, financed by the wealthy and influential Bertelsmann foundation, says the greatest challenge for the EU is to win public acceptance for a European system, which must be simplified, more transparent, more democratic, and more strictly controlled than hitherto. The experts admit that the Maastricht treaty underlined the widespread public fear over an excessively centralised and bureaucratic EU. It also represented the high water mark for the transfer of sovereignty to Brussels, they suggest. 'Europe cannot be built against the interests of its nations,' they said. 'But the opposite is also true: without problem-solving at a European level, national interests cannot be protected.' The authors stop short of any suggestion of a two-speed or multi-speed EU, saying that such a solution would only be necessary only if there were a big expansion of the current (enlarged) membership. It calls for a new single European treaty to combine the existing three-treaty basis of the European Community and the European Union. Poverty trap with an exit, Page 19</p>

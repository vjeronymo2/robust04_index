			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Kosovo protest is crushed SERBIAN police yesterday used tear gas and truncheons to disperse a demonstration by ethnic Albanians in Pristina, Kosovo, the mostly Albanian province in southern Serbia. Army jets swooped over the Kosovo capital as the protesters gathered for the second day, demanding the opening of Albanian language schools and university. Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanian leader, said in Pristina yesterday the violent break-up of the demonstration was a provocation by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic intended to show he still controlled the province. Scores were killed in 1989 when the Serbian president forcibly brought Kosovo under direct rule by Belgrade. Mr Milosevic may use Kosovo, seen by Serbs as the cradle of their civilisation, to rally popular support in Serbia, flagging after 15 months of war and United Nations sanctions. Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, said yesterday it would be easier to get sanctions lifted if Mr Milosevic resigned. Mr Milosevic is seen by the international community as the main instigator of the war in Bosnia. To re-integrate Kosovo's 1.9m ethnic Albanian population into Yugoslavia, Mr Panic has pledged to reform the educational system, boycotted by Albanians after Serbia imposed its own curriculum. The United States was last night consulting its allies on ways to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina and considering pushing for a tougher United Nations resolution, Reuter reports from Washington. The UN Security Council imposed the no-fly zone last Friday. State Department spokesman Joe Snyder said Bosnian Serbs flew numerous sorties, including bombing raids, on Saturday. There were no flights on Sunday and Monday but Bosnian Serb aircraft started operating again yesterday, he said. However, UN officials said there had been no violations since Saturday. Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has offered to remove all his aircraft from Bosnia and station them at airfields in the rump Yugoslav state under UN observers. The UN said Mr Karadzic made the offer at Geneva yesterday in a meeting with Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference, in an attempt to facilitate implementation of the resolution on the no-fly zone.</p>

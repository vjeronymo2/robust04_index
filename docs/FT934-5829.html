			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Wine snobs - don't you absolutely hate 'em? / Jancis Robinson defers to a man of taste 'The person I abhor most in this world is the professional wine snob. The person I abhor second is the amateur wine snob. And the most boring conversation you can overhear is the two talking together.' The man who used to begin his wine classes thus is one of the few whose assessment of an individual wine I would accept without question. Almost all of us concerned with selling or advising on wine pay lip service to the notion that the only thing that matters about wine is how it tastes and whether you like it, but no-one has put this maxim into practice as enthusiastically as James Rogers. As a wine merchant and, later, educator and consultant, he has made decisions about individual wines purely on the basis of lining them all up and tasting them without knowing what they were or how much they cost. 'It was my father who told me always to taste blind. 'You'll make a fool of yourself for the rest of your life,' he said, 'but you'll know more than the next person'. Wine has certainly taught me honesty and humility.' A typical Rogers exercise was a lunch last year at which dozens of Britain's more respected palates were invited to taste seven whites and seven reds and put them in order of price. My favourite white, for example, was Umani Ronchi's Casal di Serra Verdicchio (about Pounds 6 at bigger branches of Sainsbury's and Victoria Wine) which I guessed was far more expensive than a perfectly respectable premier cru Chablis. I never realised how good it was until I had tasted it unsaddled with preconceptions about Verdicchio. James Rogers could not have come from a more traditional background, and should by rights have become an affable but dozy pinstriped wine merchant. Raised in the leafy lanes of Surrey, he joined Cullens, his family's firm of licensed grocers, as a young, failed accountant in 1971. The next year he had 'an amazing experience'. He tasted La Rioja Alta's Vina Ardanza 1964 and realised that top-notch wine existed outside Bordeaux and Burgundy (a fact acknowledged by remarkably few of his peers 20 years ago). On holiday in California in 1973 he could hardly believe the quality of wine made there (compared with the produce of Europe in its pre-technological age). Cullens customers were soon introduced to names such as Robert Mondavi and Christian Brothers. He would always taste and then try to put a price on a given wine. 'If I could still make a margin on it, then I'd buy it', was his philosophy, regardless of the French-or- nothing mindset then prevailing. Thus two years later Rogers was the first major stockist of a cheap Argentine wine (branded Franchette by its importers, presumably in the vain hope that less open-minded customers would not notice its outlandish origins). Then in 1979 Rogers tasted the most extraordinary Cabernet Sauvignon bargain: a deep, fruity red that had all the punch lacking in so much cheap claret and was available by the tankerload from . . . Bulgaria, a place most customers would need an atlas to locate. 'It was fascinating how that became so successful,' remembers Rogers. 'I told all the shop managers to tell their claret-loving customers to serve it in a decanter and see what their friends thought of it. They loved it.' Bottles from Australia and New Zealand followed in 1981 and Rogers became the first non-scribe to win an important award for spreading the wine gospel to the consumer - appropriately enough, from Marques de Caceres, an innovative rioja producer. And then in 1985 Cullens was taken over. Since then Rogers has been a consultant for importers Enotria Wines and the Barnes Wine Shop, has written for Off-Licence News, devised wine courses, and has been very ill. At one stage he could not even drink but continued to make wine judgments with confidence using his nose. 'I'm surprised more people don't taste on the basis of smell alone; it gives the last wine as fair a chance as the first.' That reflects his philosophy towards both wine and illness fairly accurately. But his tastes in wine continue to evolve, as of course does the world's wine output. 'I have had a love affair with rioja, with New Zealand Sauvignon, with Australian Chardonnay (I remember a Brown Brothers 1978 that made me think that the Aussies were going to rule the world), but I have come back to finesse. You can't beat the French for sheer finesse, just as you can't beat the mystique attached to their labels. 'I'd love to observe two otherwise identical dinner parties where one lot of people is told they'll be served a first growth claret, and the other lot are just given it in a decanter without comment. I bet you'd get two completely different reactions.' This is typical of someone who cares about what is inside each bottle rather than its external baggage. In his wine merchant existence, Rogers may have argued that, compared with the nose, the eye is virtually redundant. But in the last year or so he has harnessed his own eyes to a camera to such good effect that an exhibition of his photographs is being held at Newton's restaurant, 33 Abbeville Road, London SW4 (081-673-0977). It opened last Monday and all proceeds go to a fund established by Rogers for those who nurse the terminally ill at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.</p>

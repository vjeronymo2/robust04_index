			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / People: Departures Carl Young has resigned as finance director of BM Group, the troubled construction equipment and engineering concern. He had held the post since July 1988 when BM reorganised following the acquisition of Tod and of Beazer Products and Services. Since then the group acquired Blackwood Hodge in autumn 1990 and Thomas Robinson early last year. His departure, to take place between now and June, is part of the shake-up at BM after the collapse in its performance and share price triggered by the departure of founding chairman Roger Shute last June. BM, which made a record Pounds 34.6m pre-tax profit in 1991-92, announced nearly Pounds 42m of restructuring costs and write-offs on Wednesday. It is in discussions with its bankers over breaches of covenant and a programme of debt reduction.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Chief scorns critics of his Pounds 6m pay MR PETER WOOD, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line Insurance subsidiary, yesterday pre-empted criticism of his Pounds 6m-plus pay this year. 'The only people who will complain are ill-informed moaning minnies,' he said. Confirming that he was paid more than Pounds 6m in the year to September, Mr Wood said he might earn a similar sum in each of the next two years. Mr Wood, whose remuneration of Pounds 285,000 basic salary and a Pounds 6m bonus payment is thought to make him the highest-paid British employee, said he deserved the reward because of the rapid growth of the company, which he had founded. He became a main board director of Royal Bank of Scotland this summer. The formula governing Mr Wood's bonus links his earnings to the rise in the insurance subsidiary's value. He said that its rapid growth might give him similar earnings for the next two years but they would fall after that. Mr Wood said he would try to maintain his earnings by forming a company called Direct Line Financial Services which would sell mortgages and personal loans by telephone in the same manner as Direct Line Insurance. 'I started something from scratch, and I have satisfied my customers, my staff and shareholders,' he said. The suggestion that it was wrong to earn this amount was equivalent to 'saying that we ought to become like the former Soviet Union'. He was talking openly about his earnings because he regarded them as being fair. If the net value of the company grows more than 12 per cent in a financial year, Mr Wood will receive a bonus of one percentage point of the additional increase in value. He earned Pounds 1.84m under the formula in the year to September 1991. Mr Wood founded Direct Line Insurance in 1985 and sold his 25 per cent stake to Royal Bank of Scotland for a reduced price in 1988 in return for the earnings formula. The subsidiary has 700,000 motor and 200,000 house insurance policies. He said the subsidiary was selling 50,000 motor and 8,000 house policies a month. He would be 'very disappointed' if the company's net value was less than Pounds 400m at year-end next September. The bank is to announce its full-year results to September 30 this week. It is thought to have disclosed Mr Wood's earnings earlier so that they did not distract attention from the figures. Observer, Page 15</p>

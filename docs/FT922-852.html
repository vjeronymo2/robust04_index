			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Output fall is less than feared THE FALL in UK output in the first three months of the year was marginally less than originally reported, according to figures released yester day. Revised figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that gross domestic product fell by 0.5 per cent in the first three months of this year, giving a year-on-year decline of 1.5 per cent. This was slightly better than the 0.6 per cent first-quarter fall reported last month. Excluding oil and gas extraction, GDP fell 0.3 per cent in the first quarter, compared with a provisional estimate of 0.4 per cent. The year-on-year rate of decline was 1.6 per cent. A slowdown in the rate of destocking meant that domestic demand rose 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year - the third consecutive quarterly rise. Within this: Consumer expenditure fell 0.7 per cent on the last quarter of last year and was 1.8 per cent lower than a year before. The biggest falls in this component of GDP were in cars (down 5.7 per cent on the previous quarter); furniture and carpets (down 7.4 per cent) and clothing (down 4.6 per cent). General government consumption fell 1.1 per cent on the previous quarter but was 0.6 per cent up on a year before. Fixed investment increased 1.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter, but was 2.2 per cent down on a year ago. Stock levels were broadly unchanged on a year ago, indicating an end to de-stocking. Inventories fell by just Pounds 23m (at 1985 prices) after a Pounds 709m fall in the last quarter of last year. A breakdown of GDP analysed by output showed that production by the service industries fell by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter and by 0.9 per cent on the same quarter a year earlier.</p>

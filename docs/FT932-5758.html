			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan to make Pounds 19.3m provision - Company pledged to pursue late payments SHANKS &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal company, is to set up a Pounds 19.3m provision to cover a reorganisation of its construction division encompassing late payments and sums relating to variations in contracts that it is not certain it will collect. The provisions will be taken in the year ended March 27 1993, results for which will be announced later this month. Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said Shanks's waste divisions traded 'satisfactorily' during the year. Pre-tax profits would be no less than Pounds 29m before the provision announced yesterday. The group intended to recommend a final dividend of 3.44p, unchanged from 1992. After a sharp early fall, Shanks's share price settled down 7p at 162p. Mr Hewitt said the group had traditionally been involved in long-term contracts, building roads, tunnels and bridges. Due to government pressure, payment on many of these contracts was often only being made after protracted negotiations with central government and local government clients. It was no longer clear when payment would be recovered, or indeed how much would be received. The group would now be focusing on shorter-term, and therefore more tightly specified, contracts. Mr Anthony Rush, former chief operating officer of Lilley, the failed construction and property company, is being brought in as managing director of Shanks &amp; McEwan Contractors. Mr Rush, who was on Lilley's construction side, will replace Mr John Mackenzie, who has retired. Mr Hewitt said the group would be vigorously pursuing payment. Should payments be received in future years they would appear above the line in future year's earnings. The provision relates to about 10 main contracts, five of them large road construction deals.

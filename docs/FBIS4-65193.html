			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>   [Text] Larnaca, Cyprus, May 13 (AFP)--Foreign evacuees air  lifted from Sanaa by the British Royal Air Force Thursday [12  May] said people were deserting the capital of war-torn Yemen  and shortages were worsening.    Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreigners,  most of them British, to Cyprus from Sanaa. The evacuees, many  looking exhausted, included babies and young children.    They spent about two hours at Larnaca airport before  boarding  a British Airways DC-10 plane bound for Gatwick airport, south  of London.    Some had witnessed the fighting which erupted a week ago  between northern and southern forces and were in Sanaa when a  Scud missile slammed into a densely-populated area of the city  Wednesday, causing at least 53 casualties.    Seventy-five evacuees arrived on one Hercules C-130 and 73  on  the other. The planes had flown into Sanaa from Djibouti  earlier Thursday.    The group included about 20 Americans, as well as some  Dutch,  New Zealanders, Swiss and Hungarians.    British construction worker Michael Wild said the blast from  the Scud missile which hit Sanaa Wednesday shattered windows in  the hotel where he was staying, 1,000 metres (yards) from the  impact.    He quoted local Yemenis as saying 43 people were killed and  10 injured in the attack, which flattened eight houses. Many of  the victims were children.    The official news agency SABA' said Wednesday 25 civilians  were killed by the Scud, fired by southern forces, and President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih put the overall casualty toll at 53.    Wild added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP)  building in the capital had been devastated in a northern attack  and the Italian embassy was also hit.    A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked to be not named said  "medical supplies are extremely low" at the main Al-Thawrah  public hospital in Sanaa, where he had been working.    He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were  barely functioning and virtually all the hospital's foreign  staff -- mostly Bulgarians and Indians -- had left.    About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few  days  ago.    The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the  crossfire were admitted with serious bullet wounds, and "at  least two of them died later."    The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was  virtually no maintenance, he said.    One of the Hercules pilots, Flight Lieutenant Nick Young,  said communications at Sanaa airport were "excellent" and  praised the help offered by the Yemeni authorities.    He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported  bombing raids by southern jets when the conflict erupted last  week.    The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20  kilogrammes (44 pounds) of luggage per person.    Yvonna Rienens, a Dutch teacher who was at an international  school just outside Sanaa, said 150 of the 200 teachers and  pupils at the school had already left.    She said she saw many Yemenis leaving Sanaa for villages  outside the capital, some with their goats, and carrying only a  few personal belongings, such as mattresses.    Oil engineers who were working for the U.S. company Yemen  Hunt Oil in the Ma'rib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil  workers had stayed behind to keep operations at the field  running. It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per day.    Some of them said Sanaa appeared to be a "ghost town," with  many shops closed and long queues at petrol stations.    Veronica Pickton, a British tourist from Basingstoke in  southern England, said there were frequent electricity and water  shortages at the hotel in Sanaa where she had been staying for a  week. However, there were "no signs of panic" among local  residents.    More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since  fighting erupted.    Britain earlier organised an evacuation of 225 non-Britons  from Sanaa.    Around 800 Britons, mostly oil workers, lived in Yemen  before  the civil war started. Some who were based around Aden, the  southern capital, have already been evacuated by sea.</p>

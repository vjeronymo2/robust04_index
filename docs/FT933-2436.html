			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / US expected to press EC for faster cuts in interest rates THE US is expected to urge France and other European Community countries to make faster cuts in interest rates when finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meet in Washington next Saturday. European monetary officials say the US has said in preparatory talks that it is disturbed at the slow easing of monetary conditions among Germany's partners in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) after the currency crisis in July and August. The US has argued that the ERM member states had been forced into too tight a policy position by linking their currencies closely to the D-Mark. Now that fluctuation margins have been expanded to 15 per cent either side of the ERM central rates, some US officials want interest rate cuts of perhaps one percentage point at a time in countries such as France, rather than the cautious cuts made so far. Underlying the US stance - which is likely to be supported by other nations attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington at the end of this month - is concern about the sluggish economic recovery in the industrialised world. The next issue of the IMF's World Economic Outlook, to be published in Washington on Wednesday, is expected to revise downwards the growth forecast for the industrialised world next year to about 2 1/4 per cent from nearly 3 per cent in April. In Helsinki yesterday, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said it now expects growth in its 24 industrialised member states will be only about 1 per cent this year compared with 1.2 per cent forecast in July. It is understood that the latest IMF growth forecasts for the US and Japan have been revised downwards since the first calculations were circulated in August. The IMF expects practically no growth for Japan this year, holding out the possibility of a full-blown recession. In Washington, Britain and other countries are expected to press for a speedy and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks as a way of strengthening global growth prospects.</p>

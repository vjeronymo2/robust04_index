			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers offered aid package THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled the first details of a four-year aid package for farmers hit by the agreement to reform the European Community's agriculture policy. The main points are a reduction in tax on farming land, worth FFr930m (Pounds 96m) next year, and debt relief worth FFr1.2bn from 1993 to 1995, said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Of this, the farmers will get FFr400m of debt relief next year. However, Mr Beregovoy, refused to give the total cost of the plan, beyond saying that it was 'high'. It also includes a range of tax breaks, including tax incentives for producers of alternative fuels. Mr Luc Guyau, president of the FNSEA, one of the two main farming unions, gave the package a guarded welcome. The government had listened to the farmers' basic problems 'even if we did not get everything we wanted', he said. The government bought forward the package by 10 days to defuse the anger of farmers, many of whom have disrupted road traffic and trains over the past six weeks in protest against the steep prices reductions agreed by EC member states in May. Mr Beregovoy called the plan 'an effort of national solidarity. . . designed to give confidence to the farmers'. However, it was unknown whether the deal would accepted by extreme splinter groups, like the Co-ordination Rurale, which mainly represents poorer smallholdings in south-west France. It organised the recent protests and wants to scrap the European reforms entirely and raise prices.</p>

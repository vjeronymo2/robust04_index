Eligible beneficiaries will select the level of coverage they require at the time of initial enrollment (either individual or family) and pay the appropriate premium payment. The rates are based on Federal Employee Health Benefit Program employee and agency contributions required for a comparable health benefits plan, plus an administrative fee. The administrative fee, not to exceed ten percent of the basic premium amount, shall be determined based on actual expected administrative costs for administration of the program. Premiums may be revised annually and shall be published annually for each fiscal year. Premiums will be paid by enrollees quarterly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effects of failure to make premium payments. Failure by enrollees to submit timely and proper premium payments will result in denial of continued enrollment and denial of payment of medical claims. Premium payments which are late 30 days or more past the start of the quarter for which payment is due will result in the ending of beneficiary enrollment. Beneficiaries denied continued enrollment due to lack of premium payments will not be allowed to reenroll. In such a case, benefit coverage will cease at the end of the ninety day (90) period for which a premium payment was received. Enrollees will be held liable for medical costs incurred after losing eligibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transitional provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) There will be a sixty-day period of enrollment for all eligible beneficiaries (outlined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) whose entitlement to regular military health services system coverage ended on or after August 2, 1994, but prior to the CHCBP implementation on October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Enrollment in the U.S. VIP program may continue up to October 1, 1994.

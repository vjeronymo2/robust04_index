			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CALFED CHAIRMAN TORRELL RESIGNS AFTER REQUEST FROM THE BOARD  </P> <P> In a surprise move, John R. Torrell III resigned today as chairman, chief  executive officer and president of CalFed Inc., parent of California Federal  Bank, one of the nation's largest thrifts.  </P> <P> Torrell, who joined CalFed in mid-1988, said he was acceding to the wishes of  CalFed's board. "In stepping aside during a time of momentum and progress at  CalFed, I am accommodating the desire of the board to make a change at the  helm," Torrell said.  </P> <P> CalFed, based in Los Angeles, said senior executive Jerry St. Dennis has been  appointed president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> The resignation comes about a month after reports surfaced that CalFed and  GlenFed Inc., the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, had held merger talks in May  but had broken them off. If the two companies had merged, it would have created  the nation's largest thrift, with assets of more than $50 billion.  </P> <P> On Thursday, CalFed Inc. reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings of  $19.1 million, or 73 cents a share, off from $38.3 million, or $1.40 a share,  for the 1988 quarter.  </P> <P> Analyst Michael Abrahams said he was "surprised but not shocked" about  Torrell's resignation. Abrahams said he was uncertain if the move stemmed from  the failed merger talks.  </P></p>

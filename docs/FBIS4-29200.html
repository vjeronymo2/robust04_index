			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- House of Councillors  lawmakers from the ruling coalition and the opposition camp  agreed Tuesday [14 June] on a wishy-washy plan for electoral  reform in the upper house, skirting all drastic reform proposals.    Following a series of meetings by party representatives, it  was agreed to increase the number of seats in four  constituencies and cut those in four others to achieve more  balanced representation. One seat will be added each to  constituencies in Kanagawa, Saitama, Miyagi and Gifu  Prefectures, while Hokkaido will lose two and Hyogo and Fukuoka  one each.    The ruling and opposition parties excluding the Japan  Communist Party plan to submit the reform bills in the current  Diet session. Proposals to reduce the total number of seats by  two from the current 252 and to introduce a vote-for-individual  formula into the 100-seat proportional representation system  were both scuttled.    Members of the 252-seat upper house are elected either in  multiseat constituencies or in a 100-seat proportional  representation system, in which votes are cast for parties, not  individuals.    Because the parties failed to agree on any striking  electoral  reform, the upper house poll scheduled for summer will see  little change from the current system. Diet passage of the  proposed changes, however, is far from secured, with the end of  the current session on June 29 approaching, political sources  said.</p>

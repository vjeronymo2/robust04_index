			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Contract for Canadians in Chinese telecoms NORTHERN Telecom of Toronto expects to become a leading supplier of telephone switches and other telecommunications equipment to China, under a deal signed with China's State Planning Commission. The memorandum of understanding covers various manufacturing, research and training projects, including joint ventures for the development and manufacture of large-scale circuits and switching systems. Northern expects the deal to result in sales worth 'billions of dollars' over the next few years. Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said that business flowing from the agreement could become the most extensive in the company's history. The company also regards the agreement as an effort by the Chinese to broaden their sources of telecommunications equipment and expertise. Alcatel of France and Sweden's Ericsson have so far been the main suppliers to China. AT&amp;T of the US recently signed a similar deal to the Northern agreement. A Northern official said yesterday that the agreement demonstrated 'the Chinese are not only opening their market, but also picking and choosing their suppliers'. Northern already has a significant presence in China. It has installed about 1.6m telephone lines, and supplied digital switches to several provinces and municipalities.</p>

Pak Kil-yon,  North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE that the speculation was based on groundless rumors and  Kim celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday in good spirit.    In a Seoul-datelined story Thursday, a foreign news agency  quoted South Korea's opposition Democratic Party Leader Li  Ki-taek as saying that he had heard from foreign diplomatic  sources that Kim Chong-il had sustained serious, but  unspecified, injuries. Li was told that if Kim did not appear  at celebrations marking his 52nd birthday Wednesday, the reports  could be considered "reliable." Pak said the reports were  political propaganda designed to slander Kim, the No. 2 man in  Pyongyang's ruling hierarchy.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / People: Sweetening the pill James Kerr-Muir is joining Kingfisher, the retail group which embraces Woolworth, Comet, B&amp;Q and Superdrug, as finance director. He takes the seat vacated by Archie Norman en route to Asda in December. Kerr-Muir, 51, spent 22 years at Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar group, where his last two jobs were finance director and managing director of the UK division. He left in November 'to pursue other interests' just after Neil Shaw, then chairman and chief executive of T&amp;L, decided to split the role and appoint someone else. The Kingfisher team knows Kerr-Muir of old. Geoff Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive, and Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director, used to run British Sugar, T&amp;L's fierce rival in the UK market. 'Funnily enough,' says Whittaker, 'we used to sell sugar to each other.' Kerr-Muir has no retail experience, Whittaker says, 'but sugar experience seems to work well'.</p>

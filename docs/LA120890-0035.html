			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING GROSS ABOUT DODGER DEAL  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson's leaving the Dodgers leaves me with two unforgettable memories.  </P> <P> The first is his 1988 World Series home run, which ranks as my No. 1 Dodger  highlight. The second is his turning his back on young autograph seekers after  a game in 1990. This ranks as an all-time low point. On the one hand, you have  the player, Kirk the Great. One the other you have the person, Kirk the Jerk.  Too bad for Kirk, because he has many more years ahead of him as a person and  only a few as a player.  </P> <P> TONY CANDIOTTI  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

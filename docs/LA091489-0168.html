			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NCAA TIP SENT ELLIS RUNNIN' TO SYRACUSE, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> Former Kentucky star LeRon Ellis decided to attend Syracuse University rather  than the University of Nevada Las Vegas because he was alerted to the NCAA's  investigation of the Runnin' Rebels basketball program, according to a report  published Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ellis, a former standout at Mater Dei High School, told the Syracuse  Herald-Journal that he spoke with "a couple" of National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. investigators during the governing body's probe into the Kentucky program  who told him about the NCAA's review of the UNLV program.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-11 Ellis announced July 17 that he was transferring to Syracuse from  Kentucky, which has received three years probation for recruiting violations.  Because of the NCAA penalty, Ellis is immediately available to play at  Syracuse.  </P> <P> Earlier in the summer, Ellis had said that UNLV was his first choice. The  school announced July 21 that it was under investigation by the NCAA concerning  the recruiting of former New York City player Lloyd Daniels.  </P> <P> Ellis said he questioned the NCAA investigators about UNLV's future and was  told the Rebels might be headed for the same punishment as Kentucky. That  conversation caused him to change his mind, he said.  </P> <P> "That's the only reason I changed my mind. The only reason," he said.  </P> <P> UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian told the newspaper that he had heard nothing of  Ellis' contact with the NCAA, but that he had wondered why Ellis changed his  mind.  </P> <P> "He committed to us verbally. We were really shocked when there was a  turnaround," Tarkanian said.  </P> <P> Spokesman Jim Marchiony said the NCAA allows investigators to speak to recruits  if the school in question has been notified of a pending investigation.  </P></p>

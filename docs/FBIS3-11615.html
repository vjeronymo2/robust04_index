As you may recall, Jean Paul Genie's death  occurred on 28 October 1990 at approximately 2045 on the highway  to Masaya, when the young man reportedly tried to pass General  Humberto Ortega's motorcade. A barrage of bullets riddled the  young man's body killing him instantly. Fifty-two cartridge  shells were found where he was killed.    Ortega, wearing military garb, arrived at the Army's Public  Relations Office where he had been summoned by Dr. Lester Gallo,  the military prosecutor in charge of the investigation. Shortly  before testifying, as requested by the accusers who were  represented by Dr. Daniel Olivas Zuniga, Ortega read a  12-paragraph public letter establishing his position on the  events that are currently under investigation. [passage omitted]    The Public Relations Office room where the Genie trial is  being held was too small for the number of local and  international journalists who covered the general's statements.  Once Ortega sat in the defendant's seat, he had to answer the  customary questions everyone involved in a trial is asked: where  he was and what he was doing at the time of the crime.    Ortega, like all of his personal bodyguards charged with the  crime, told the judge, defense, and prosecution lawyers he was  at home on the night of the crime. Ortega said he went to  Colonel Lenin Cerna's house that evening but Cerna was not home  because he was out of the country. He then went to the general  command where he stayed until he went home. He got home early in  the evening.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [text] The 13 June TRABAJADORES features an editorial on  the effects that increased prices and fees for some products and  services are having on salaries. Money lacks value when it does  not have the backing of goods and services because real income  does not depend on the amount of circulating currency but on its  purchasing power. TRABAJADORES adds that the black market is a  parasitic and unproductive economy since it does not help to  produce more goods, which is what is needed to increase supply.  Our country is developing an economic outline of its own, and  every measure must be seen as linked to others. The goal is to  boost work, but for the moment this is not possible because  production is limited due to lack of resources and raw  materials. Steps are being taken on performance incentives on  tourism, agriculture, mining, transportation, energy, and the  sugar industry, among other sectors. TRABAJADORES also points  out that formulas to stimulate production can be found in each  workplace, without forgetting that the goal is to revalue the  currency.</p>

He said he is satisfied with the  move to allow French firms to invest in Jordan.    Upon arrival in Amman today, Juppe said that France is  looking forward to the establishment of a comprehensive peace in  the region and that his visit to Jordan is based on France's  concern for supporting the peace process. He added: France has  a role to play in the peace process, particularly in the  framework of the multilateral talks and the committees in which  it is involved, such as economic development, water, and refugee  committees.    Juppe said France is seeking to help Jordan reschedule its  foreign debt; the amount of which is a burden to the Jordanian  economy.    He said France is working through NATO to put an end to the  suffering of people in Bosnia and is determined not to miss any  opportunity to achieve peace there. The recent NATO decision,  he said, has restored confidence and there are encouraging signs  now from the parties to the conflict that they will listen to  the voice of logic, including the handing over of some heavy  weapons to the United Nations.    Juppe was received at Amman civilian airport by Dr. Fawwaz  Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs; the  French ambassador in Amman; and senior Foreign Ministry and  French Embassy staff.</p>

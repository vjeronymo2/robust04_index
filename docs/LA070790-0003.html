			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE A-TEAM;  </P> <P> AVOCADOS: GROWERS AND PACKERS ARE TEAMING TO CATCH RUSTLERS, WHO WILL STEAL UP  TO 10% OF THE CROP.  </P> <P> Driven by a growing number of thefts, avocado growers have mobilized into  Ventura County's first agricultural crime-fighting force.  </P> <P> They could be called the A-Team, a special strike force of growers and packers  helping the county Sheriff's Department round up criminals and put them behind  bars.  </P> <P> Growers have become much more serious about avocado thefts, said Bob Tobias, an  avocado grower and an organizer of the task force that includes about 10  growers and advisers from the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's  office. "The main reason is because thefts are up."  </P> <P> The Orange County-based California Avocado Commission, which promotes avocado  sales, estimates that avocado rustlers probably will steal from 5% to 10% of  the state's $200-million harvest this year.  </P> <P> Avocados are big business in Ventura County -- its sixth-largest crop. The  county's 750 growers who till 16,000 acres of avocado groves countywide brought  in a $55-million harvest last year.  </P> <P> And authorities estimate the county's loss from rustlers at between $1 million  and $2.75 million annually.  </P> <P> However, the agricultural task force puts Ventura "way ahead of the game," said  Avi Crane, spokesman for the avocado commission. Because of its tough stance  against crime and its organized system of growers and packers, the county was  awarded $77,000 this year by the commission to fight the rustlers, the  second-largest grant to a county in the state, Crane said.  </P> <P> From now until the end of summer, task force members will don their  crime-fighting hats. Instead of guns, they will carry cameras and cellular  phones as they patrol groves day and night.  </P> <P> "In Ventura County, we are sending a message out there that, if you get caught,  you're going to jail," Tobias said.  </P> <P> Until the task force was kicked off, growers had relied on sheriff's deputies  to bring thieves to justice.  </P> <P> Now the task force advises sheriff's investigators on areas vulnerable to  avocado thieves. It also points out evidence that might have been missed by  investigators before, confirms the value of stolen fruit and compiles data on  avocado thefts.  </P> <P> Later this summer, growers say they will help the Sheriff's Department with  surveillance operations and the first sting operation to trap thieves who  peddle stolen fruit.  </P> <P> The sting operation will consist of a mock produce stand, staffed by deputies  who will lure thieves into unloading the fruit they steal.  </P> <P> This year, avocados are especially valuable because of smaller crops. Frost and  wind damage destroyed much of this year's harvest. Consequently, the price of a  single avocado is $1.50 at some stores.  </P> <P> Thieves have not failed to notice this, authorities say. An estimated 200,000  pounds of avocados will be stolen this year in the state, double the amount  pilfered last year, avocado commission officials predict.  </P> <P> In Ventura County, there have been 19 reported thefts of between 200 and 2,500  pounds of avocados so far this year, three of them last weekend.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Cmdr. Merwyn Dowd, who advises the avocado task force, said aid from  the task force has been vital.  </P> <P> Because of the task force's efforts in getting the word out to local farmers,  growers and their workers are more likely to notice missing fruit, parked cars  and unusual tire tracks and footprints. In one case, an observant foreman  reported a theft in progress, he said. Two people were later arrested.  </P> <P> Law-enforcement investigators have been aided by the task force's insight as  well, Dowd said. Because of the task force, sheriff's deputies now -- in  addition to analyzing footprints and tire tracks -- look for avocado leaves in  the cars of suspects and check under suspects' fingernails for avocado residue,  Dowd said.  </P> <P> The task force's evidence has helped prosecutors convict more avocado rustlers  and win stiffer sentences, authorities said. So far this year, about 30 avocado  rustlers have been convicted of grand theft, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J.  McGee. The stiffest sentence any rustler has received in Ventura County is  three years.  </P> <P> In most cases in other counties, theft of avocados is prosecuted as a  misdemeanor, authorities said.  </P></p>

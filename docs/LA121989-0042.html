			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL DRAFT MAY FACE CHALLENGE;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: TOP COLLEGE UNDERCLASSMEN ARE CONSIDERING SKIPPING SENIOR SEASONS  BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE ROOKIE SALARY CAP IN 1991.  </P> <P> Potential changes in the economic climate of the NFL could result in as many as  40 college football underclassman applying for next April's draft.  </P> <P> Leigh Steinberg, a sports attorney who has represented prominent athletes in  negotiations with NFL teams, made that estimate Monday.  </P> <P> Included in this group, according to Steinberg, are three highly regarded  quarterbacks -- Heisman Trophy-winner Andre Ware of Houston, Jeff George of  Illinois and Scott Mitchell of Utah. Linebackers Keith McCants of Alabama and  Junior Seau of USC also are said to be among those considering such a move.  </P> <P> Steinberg said the anticipated exodus of underclassmen -- players with  remaining collegiate eligibility -- is being prompted by NFL discussions of a  possible cap on rookie salaries by 1991.  </P> <P> "So, what underclassmen fear and unscrupulous agents tell them is that we're  sure salaries will be as strong in 1990 as they were in 1989, but 1991 could  theoretically be the year of the salary cap," Steinberg said.  </P> <P> Marvin Demoff, a Los Angeles sports attorney who represents pro quarterbacks  John Elway, Jim Everett and Dan Marino, said uneasiness over the new collective  bargaining agreement has prompted some agents to recommend that players forgo  their remaining collegiate eligibility.  </P> <P> "If that wasn't a risk these kids face, you wouldn't see so many thinking about  the draft," he said.  </P> <P> Demoff said other reasons for the trend are that football is one of the few  sports that has successfully stopped athletes from leaving college early, and  this season's success of Barry Sanders, the Heisman Trophy-winning tailback  from Oklahoma State who challenged the NFL system last year and left school  early.  </P> <P> Well aware of what lies ahead, the NFL could fight to protect its rule that  excludes underclassmen from the draft.  </P> <P> Exceptions were made last year for Sanders and Timm Rosenbach, the Washington  State quarterback. The NFL rationalized that Sanders' school was on probation  and that Washington State changed coaches on Rosenbach.  </P> <P> Otherwise, for a player to be part of the draft, he has to have either used up  his eligibility or be able to show that he will graduate before the next NFL  season.  </P> <P> Joe Browne, NFL spokesman, said the league has not abandoned its rules because  of last year's exceptions.  </P> <P> "We believe that our rules are in the best interest of the overwhelming  majority of college players," he said, adding that the figure of 40  underclassman opting for the draft is not a surprise.  </P> <P> Browne said the league is concerned about those marginal players who abort  their education for a chance at professional football. He cited the case of the  Sanders brothers -- Barry, who has been a success for the Detroit Lions, and  Byron, who left Northwestern for the NFL.  </P> <P> Byron Sanders was drafted but was cut and returned to school at his own  expense.  </P> <P> "For every Barry Sanders there are 10 Byron Sanders," Browne said.  </P> <P> Still, Steinberg said the NFL eligibility rule has some interesting wrinkles.  </P> <P> "One of the ways for a player to lose eligibility and become a participant in  the draft is to sign with an agent," he said. "It's almost as if the NFL says  underclassmen who are guilty of misconduct can have the privilege of coming out  early and have an extra year of income, but those players who follow the rules  need to stay in school.  </P> <P> "The exceptions made for Sanders and Rosenbach would lead many people to  believe that the NFL would like the rule to stay on the books but not to be  tested. Obviously, the NFL has a wonderful system, with the colleges, in  essence, acting as a farm system."  </P> <P> And when football players look at Magic Johnson leaving Michigan State for a  lucrative contract with the Lakers, or John McEnroe leaving Stanford for a rich  career in pro tennis, they wonder why they are not afforded the same  opportunities.  </P> <P> Browne insists the NFL is different from other sports and would defend its  rules in litigation.  </P> <P> Steinberg said: "Most legal observers believe that the NFL rule excluding  underclassmen wouldn't stand the test of judicial scrutiny; that if challenged,  the rule will fall.  </P> <P> "The point is, if they allowed underclassmen into the NFL, it would not destroy  college football. There are 100 players on those rosters. It hasn't destroyed  college basketball, which has 10 or 15 players on rosters."  </P> <P> NCAA officials are also concerned with any departure from the norm. But  administrators and educators are divided on what course to take. Some believe  in the free enterprise system, while others are more concerned with students  staying to graduation.  </P> <P> "I think a university should be for someone who wants to be there," said  William Reeves, the faculty athletic representative for Texas Arlington. "If  someone can make a better living outside the university, let them."  </P> <P> Reeves, a member of the NCAA's Professional Sports Liaison Committee, said his  feelings are bolstered by the fact Arlington does not have a football team.  </P> <P> Marie Ann Lawler, also a member of the NCAA committee and an associate athletic  director at Florida, where there is a big-time football team, partially agrees  with Reeves.  </P> <P> "I have no problem if they are ready to go and they can make it," Lawler said.  "I don't think you can ask a kid who is signing for a million dollars to stay.  But I feel sorry for the ones on the edge."  </P> <P> Lawler said she understands athletes' concerns over potential injury in their  senior seasons but believes emphasis should be placed on graduation. Although  past statistics show poor graduation records for many football schools, Lawler  said recent NCAA rules indicate there will be an improvement in this area.  </P> <P> So, she is concerned with the number of underclassman considering the NFL draft  as an alternative to higher education.  </P> <P> "This is a trend the NCAA doesn't like," she said.  </P> <P> It is a trend that has clouded the future for some players.  </P> <P> Mark Carrier, USC's All-American strong safety who redshirted as a freshman,  indicated that he will return for his senior season, then hedged by saying he  might re-evaluate his options after the Rose Bowl game against Michigan on New  Year's Day.  </P> <P> "I'm just learning about the NFL," Carrier said. "I haven't talked to any  agents or picked one. My decision (now) is that I'll be back in school."  </P> <P> USC's Seau, a junior who lost his freshman year of eligibility because of the  Proposition 48 academic rule, said he is still undecided, adding: "I'm a USC  Trojan come January 1, and we'll see from there on, but I'm leaning on coming  back (to school)."  </P> <P> Although Carrier has another year of eligibility, he will be only two classes  short of graduating in May and could conceivably take them in summer school,  thereby enabling him to graduate before the start of the '90 NFL season.  </P> <P> Seau, however, would be ineligible for the '90 draft, according to a strict  interpretation of the NFL rule.  </P> <P> Demoff, the Los Angeles attorney, said the warning from agents is not  unwarranted.  </P> <P> "I think some kids would pull back if the NFL gave them some guarantee that  there will not be a wage scale in 1991," he said.  </P> <P> If the owners cannot do that, they can expect to have a full house for the  draft in April.  </P></p>

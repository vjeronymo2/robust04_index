U.S. Vice President Albert Gore  and President Carlos Menem gave addresses.    Al Gore thanked Argentina for hosting this conference with  such a magnificent level of hospitality -- referring to Menem --  and asked everyone to help him create a global infrastructure of  information. He added that information is a treasure which must  be shared if it is to be of true value.    Let us now go to an excerpt of Menem's address:    [Begin Menem recording] As Argentines, Argentines who are  doubly proud. First for the distinction of having been chosen  to host this conference. Also for the opportunity of showing  the world our achievements in the arduous task we have  undertaken, to transform the state and especially the  privatization and deregulation of the communications sector.    It has been an essential step in our policy: To modernize  the  country's structure and thus be better armed to confront the  challenges of the 21st century.    We have done all this and will continue, thinking of future  generations. This why the transformation process being  implemented avoided every opportunity for speculation. [end  recording]    That was part of Menem's address. He also stated that during  the course of this conference, a contract will be signed to  expand the cellular telephone service throughout the country,  and that a international tender, one of the few examples in the  world, is about to be issued to resolve the structural problem  of how to control the radio-electric spectrum.</p>

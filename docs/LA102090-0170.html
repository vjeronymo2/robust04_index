			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRY STATIC KILLS CABLE BILL A 2ND TIME  </P> <P> Last-minute phone calls by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and  pressure by small cable companies have dashed hopes of reviving a legislative  proposal to re-regulate cable television, one of the bill's sponsors said  Friday.  </P> <P> "Once again, the public has been 'Sununu-ed,' " said Sen. Albert Gore Jr.  (D-Tenn.). "I used that word because I know for a fact that John Sununu made  personal calls to Republican senators urging that holds be put on this  legislation."  </P> <P> The White House refused to comment, but the Bush Administration already was on  record threatening to veto the bill if it were passed by both houses of  Congress. The Administration opposed the bill in large part because it involves  regulatory restrictions.  </P> <P> The basic problem the bill sought to address, according to supporters, is that  cable rates have risen dramatically while service has deteriorated ever since  the cable industry was deregulated in 1984.  </P> <P> The last-minute maneuvering involved a Senate bill that would have allowed the  Federal Communications Commission to set rates for over-the-air broadcast  stations that are carried on cable, a concern of rural Americans who cannot  easily get broadcast reception without cable. The bill also would have  empowered the FCC to review and roll back rates, if deemed excessive, for  premium cable channels such as HBO, ESPN or CNN.  </P> <P> A similar bill already has passed the House.  </P> <P> But the authors of the Senate measure said that several Republican senators  were refusing to let the bill come up for a vote after being pressured by the  White House and by some small cable operators.  </P> <P> The bill appeared to have died two weeks ago, when Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.)  blocked it from coming to a vote. But Gore and Wirth worked out a compromise  amendment last week that gave the bill another shot at floor consideration.  </P> <P> Both sides agree that the development of competing technology eventually will  be the best way to ensure quality service and low pricing. But supporters of  re-regulation contend that rival technologies are still years away and that  some regulatory protection is necessary in the interim.  </P></p>

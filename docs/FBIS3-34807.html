			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 February  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  Muslim, Christian Clerics Call For National Unity </H5>   A 1,500-word report on page two by Ibrahim Nasr and Mustaf  Yasin notes that mainstream Muslim and Christian clerics have  issued a call for national unity. According to the report, a  seminar on religious thinking and citizenship was held in the  Anglican Church in Heliopolis attended by Awqaf Minister Dr.  Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub, Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd, a former  information minister and an "Islamic thinker," and Reverend  Samu'il Habib, head of the Anglican community.    Minister Mahjub is cited saying: "Egypt has never known  fanaticism or differentiated among its people on religious  grounds."    Abu-al-Majd notes: "Egypt is at a crossroads, the same one  facing the Arab and Islamic worlds." He elaborates on the  vulnerability of the Egyptians, Arabs, Muslims, and Third World  people following the collapse of the old world order and the  rise of the "new international order" and recommends a return to  religious values to achieve stability and strengthen the nation.    Rev. Habib offers 10,000 seedlings to "be planted around the  al-Azhar mosque in affirmation of the unity of the people of  Egypt and the cohesion of the nation's strands." He makes other  charitable offers but is cited no further on any political or  religious affair.  <H5>  Writer Praises Muslim-Christian Seminar </H5>   A 600-word "Ramadan is Blessed" column by Majid Salim on  page  10 hails the seminar of Muslim and Christian clerics and their  call for national unity and denounces those who want Islam or  religion to play a marginal role in society. Salim opens his  columns with these words: "Divide religions and rule. This is  the slogan raised by the heirs of communism and the negators of  religion, those who want to drive religion into the sidelines  and then cut it off completely on the pretext that it is merely  a link between man and God and has nothing to do with relations  among members of society." Salim then argues that the  solidarity shown by Muslim and Christian clerics proves those  "negators of religion" mistaken.  <H5>  Seminar Emphasizes Religious Education </H5>   'AQIDATI carries extensive reportage on its own "convoys" or  religious seminars. A 5,000-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri,  Musa Hal, Nazih Fudah, and Mahmud Fudah across pages four and  five records the proceedings of a seminar held at the Special  Teachers College in Minyat al-Nasr. Most of the discussion is  religious, although Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf makes a  reference to a particular threat to the country's future. He  says: "I am confident that the hostile values [al-qiyam  al-mu'adiyah] that do not want Islam to prosper or Egypt to  stand on its feet know that Egypt's youths are the basis of its  future, so they attempt to deal a fatal blow to those youths  through drugs, sex, and extremism." He advises religious  education as a way to educate the youth and revive the country's  fortunes.  <H5>  Forces of "Modern Islamic Trend" Outlined </H5>   Islamic writer Muhammad 'Imarah dedicates his 900-word  "Islamic Views" column on page seven to a discussion of "The  Forces of the Modern Islamic Trend." He notes: "In the year  1368 of the hegira, 1948, the Muslim Brotherhood group in Egypt  entered its first, minor, crisis. In 1954, it entered its  second, major, crisis."    'Imarah does not elaborate on the difference between the two  crises, but he states that the crisis (not specified) "replaced  conventional modes of thinking -- particularly among the youths  -- with the mentality of tension. Among the ranks of those who  lived through it, the crisis (not specified) created claws to  protect the Islamic body. The feelings of anger, rejection, and  protest found voice in the publication of "Milestone on the  Road" by martyr Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966). This was followed by  the emergence of factions shunning society and seeking to change  it through violent means. These factions were united in judging  Islamic societies, regimes, and governments as being atheist and  pre-Islamic."    'Imarah adds that the trend for "rejection and anger and  protest" spawned three strands:    The first strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the claws," is  composed  of those who believe in violence and jihad.    Another strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the brain," comprises  those who call for reviving the Islamic tradition. This second  or "traditionalist" strand began with Jamal al-Din al-Afghani  (1838-1897) and focused on intellectual propagation.    A third strand, which is expressed in general popular anger,  is what 'Imarah calls "the body."    'Imarah provides no further insight into the positions and  tactics or future strategy and prospects of these strands and  gives no examples of the main representatives of the three  strands on today's Egyptian and Muslim scenes.  <H5>  India's Treatment of Muslims in Kashmir Denounced </H5>   Writer 'Adil Dayf dedicates a 300-word column on page 20 to  denouncing the Indian Government for its harsh treatment of the  Muslims in Kashmir.  <H5>  Muslims in Germany in Need of More Mosques, Schools </H5>    The only interview in this issue is with a German Muslim  freelance journalist, Muhammad Haytham 'Ayyash. In the  2,000-word interview on page 20, 'Ayyash notes that there are  4.5 million Muslims, mostly from the Turkish community, living  in Germany who can do with more mosques and schools.</p>

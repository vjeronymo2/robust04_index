			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: The unnatural mac is back, okay? GIVE A DOG a bad name and it becomes almost impossible to get it rehabilitated. Artificial fibres, transformed since the early days of raucous rayon and noxious nylon, have never quite received the recognition they deserve from the fashion press. Natural fibre snobs tend to bestow the word 'natural' as an almost automatic stamp of approval. However, there are some things that artificial fibres do distinctly better than natural ones. Making light, crease-resistant, naturally water-repellent raincoats is one of them. Ever since a couple of Japanese companies developed a range of soft, silky, peachy polyester fabrics known as microfibres, designers of the stature of Armani, the MaxMara team and others have been using them for anoraks parkas, raincoats and jackets. A close weave makes the fabrics water-repellent but their chief beauty lies in their extraordinary fluidity. They are also very light and almost uncrushable, so they make perfect travelling garments. Burberrys has brought out a snappy collection of short, swingy, almost A-line raincoats, all made from microfibre, in singing spring colours like orange, yellow, lipstick pink and apple green as well as neutrals such as stone and cream. Photographed right is one of the raincoats (Pounds 395) teamed with a pair of toning linen shorts (Pounds 130). The plain, cotton, white waistcoat (it also comes in a blue and white check) is Pounds 70. Chaps, for the moment, will have to stick to raincoats made from traditional fabrics which are, it appears, more suitable for longer-length macs that are the current fashion. Burberry has focussed on a collection that strikes more of an urban weekend mood. The brushed cotton safari jacket is Pounds 215 and is worn over a suede waistcoat (Pounds 160), a luxurious three-button long-sleeved polo shirt in silk (Pounds 175) and teamed with stone cotton chinos (Pounds 87.50). Burberrys, 18-22 The Haymarket, London SW1.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / People: An injection of commercial mettle Peripatetic businessman John Jackson, chairman of SD-Scicon and Graseby, and vice-chairman of Ladbroke, is to become chairman of Mishcon de Reya, the law firm which Lord Mishcon founded in Brixton before the war and which has more recently made a name defending clients against libel actions. Mishcon believes it is the first time a businessman rather than a lawyer has been appointed chairman of a large law firm instead of a senior partner, and follows moves in the 1980s to put the management of the firm on a more professional business footing. For his part, Jackson believes his appointment reflects an awareness that law and accountancy are important parts of the business community and could do with an injection of commercial mettle. Jackson - who was called to the bar but never practised - is not averse to unconventional career moves. After 28 years with British Philips, where he is still a director, he launched a career on his own, largely to indulge his interest in new ideas and the start-up of high technology businesses. Now 62, he spent five years during spare time at Philips making his family self-sufficient in milk, eggs, meat and vegetables, using borrowed land on which he paid rent of 'one fat lamb per acre per year'. Not content with just walking around Annapurna in Nepal on a sabbatical from Philips, he collected over 2,000 packets of seeds which he has distributed to European botanical gardens. Lord Mishcon, 75, who has a minimum of five more days as Her Majesty's opposition chief legal affairs spokesman, will also continue to advise clients as an active consultant.</p>

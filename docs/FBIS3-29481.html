Jayakumar said yesterday. Singapore would  have no objections if the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  was to reach a consensus on the matter, he said. [passage  omitted]    Mr Jayakumar described as "not finalised" Singapore Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong's plan to visit Rangoon. Mr Jayakumar's  comments came after a U.S. congressman said he believed it would  be "premature" for ASEAN to invite Burma if there were no talks  between now and July between Burma's opposition leader Aung San  Suu Kyi and the military junta's key member Lt Gen Khin Nyunt.  Bill Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) was replying to a  reporter's question during a press conference on Wednesday after  he became the first non-family member to be allowed to meet Suu  Kyi in Rangoon. By July, the charismatic Burmese leader also  will have been under house arrest for five years, normally the  limit allowed by Burmese law.    Foreign Minister Sqn Ldr Prasong Sunsiri earlier spoke of  the  possibility of Thailand, as this year's chairman of ASEAN,  inviting Burma to the meeting of the group's foreign ministers.  He raised the possibility after the last ASEAN foreign  ministers' meeting in Singapore. Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday  described the meeting between the U.S. congressman and Suu Kyi  as an indication of improvements in Burma. But he said it would  be "Burma's affair" whether or not the ruling State Law and  Order Restoration Council kept Suu Kyi under house arrest until  at least next year.    The Thai foreign ministry wanted to see better conditions in  Burma before moving to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN  meeting. The release of Suu Kyi was among a number of  improvements sought. But Thai foreign ministry officials  expressed confidence that there was still time for ASEAN to  decide on the matter. Senior officials of ASEAN would not rush  into the decision but closely monitor the situation in that  country, a foreign ministry source said.    One senior foreign ministry source described the U.S.  congressman's remark on the question as an attempt by a U.S.  politician to dictate to other countries in international  politics.    Meanwhile, the Singaporean foreign minister said he would  like to see Thailand and Singapore work closely for "ASEAN  interests" in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  group. Mr Jayakumar said there were no controversial issues  between Thailand and Singapore.</p>

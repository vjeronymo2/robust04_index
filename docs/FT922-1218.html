			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Nuclear Electric power hopes A NEW nuclear power station, twice the size of any built in Britain, could be the key to cheap nuclear power, according to Nuclear Electric. The state-owned company, which operates the nuclear stations of England and Wales, believes it could build twin reactors on the Suffolk site of Sizewell B, Britain's latest nuclear station under construction, for less than Pounds 3bn in today's money - possibly raising money from the private sector. That compares with around Pounds 3.5bn for the single Sizewell B reactor, due in 1994. 'We've already paid for Sizewell B,' Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, told a nuclear conference in London yesterday: 'Now we need to think how to capitalise on it. It's our duty to the consumer and the taxpayer.' Nuclear Electric cannot build any stations until it passes a government review in 1994. His proposal surprised some analysts, who said Mr Collier's hopes of private-sector financing, especially at the 8 per cent rate of return he quoted, was unrealistic. Mr Steve Thomas, nuclear specialist at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, said: 'They are saying this because they can't claim to be a nuclear company and not have investment plans.' The new station, which would start up around 2002, would have two 1300MW reactors. It would be second in size only to Britain's huge coal-fired power station, Drax, which generates power for six cities the size of Liverpool. Nuclear Electric believes it would produce electricity at less than 3p per unit, compared with between 6p and 8p for the oldest nuclear stations, and just over 4p for Sizewell B. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, criticised Nuclear Electric, saying it lived in 'never-never land.' It said: 'Never accept the economic realities of nuclear, and never deal with the formidable radioactive legacy of nuclear waste.' Thirty six organisations and individuals have sent the Department of Trade and Industry their views on the privatisation of British Coal. The 36 included companies interested in bidding for the state-owned coal company. The companies which contacted the DTI before its deadline on Monday included the electricity generators, mining unions and mining groups.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> NEW JERSEY RIDER TRIES TO ADD 7TH GOLD MEDAL  </P> <P> The U.S. Cycling Federation Junior Nationals draw to a close today with the  road race finals scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. along Lusk Boulevard on Sorrento  Mesa.  </P> <P> That's when the 13-14-year-old boys go off, but the big race will begin at  approximately 12:30 p.m., when the 16-17 girls hit the course. Among them will  be Jessica Grieco of Emerson, N.J., who will be attempting something never  accomplished -- sweeping all seven gold medals in the 10-day event.  </P> <P> Grieco already has won the criterium, the four track events (200-meter flying  time trial, 2,000-meter pursuit, sprint and points race) and the time trial.  </P> <P> Her biggest challenge will likely come from Denise Mueller of Encinitas.  </P> <P> At the Junior Worlds last month, Grieco won three silver medals, one in the  road race. Mueller took fourth in that race but today will be riding in front  of a hometown crowd.  </P> <P> There were three mishaps in Saturday's qualifying races, held only for the  15-16 and 17-18 boys. Two occurred some 50 yards in front of the finish line in  each of the 15-16 heats.  </P> <P> Some blamed the course for the accidents, saying it wasn't challenging enough  and that too many riders were still in a lead pack at the end.  </P> <P> But many riders and coaches blamed the accidents on inexperience.  </P> <P> "There are so many people here who aren't used to riding in packs," said Steven  Meilicke of Santa Rosa, winner of the first heat. "And it was so tight at the  end, people were getting kind of squirrelly."  </P> <P> Added Sam Guzman of Richmond, Va.: "People were just jamming together.  Everybody wants to do as well as they can so they can get to the final."  </P> <P> Concluded Rene Wenzel, national team coach, "This course in Europe would be no  problem at all -- they're so used to it (riding in packs) over there."  </P> <P> There were three heats for the 17-18 boys, and in only one did a single rider  go for a breakaway. That came in the second heat, when Bennie Ray of Columbus,  Ohio, finished some 30 seconds in front.  </P> <P> "I don't like pack sprints," Ray said. "I just wanted to give myself a  wide-enough gap."  </P> <P> Cycling Notes  </P> <P> There were three Junior National records set at the time trials in Borrego  Springs Friday. Jessica Grieco (29:41) bettered the old 20-kilometer mark of  31:48 for girls 16-17, Heath Sandall (27:59) beat the old mark of 28:47 for  boys 13-14 and Susan George (30:38) lowered the old record of 31:48 for girls  13-15.  </P></p>

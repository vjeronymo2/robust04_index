			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 KILLED, 3 WOUNDED IN FIGHTING AT 3 PARTIES;  </P> <P> GANGS: POLICE IN THREE CITIES SAID THE VIOLENCE OCCURRED AFTER SATURDAY NIGHT  GATHERINGS WERE CRASHED BY RIVAL GROUPS.  </P> <P> Three Saturday night parties in Los Alamitos, Santa Ana and Buena Park erupted  into bloody street fights among gang members, leaving two teen-agers dead and  three seriously wounded, police said.  </P> <P> The shootings and stabbings were unrelated, but all three melees involved large  parties that apparently were crashed by rival gang members. Police said it is  unusual for gangs to have such street brawls, noting that they typically attack  rivals in drive-by shootings.  </P> <P> "Gang members are like everyone else, and Saturday night is party night," said  Buena Park Police Lt. Patrick Black. "If rival gang members want to provoke  something, they usually know where to find them. But most of the time it leads  to drive-by shootings. I can't recall another one here like this in 10 years."  </P> <P> In Los Alamitos, police were called at 11:10 p.m. to 3952 San Mateo Ave., a  residential street in the city's northern tip, sandwiched between Cypress and  Long Beach. Apparently a fight had erupted in the street among the guests and  an uninvited group of people from a rival gang, police said.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy, apparently the host of the party, was stabbed to death. One  of his guests, a 19-year-old male, was in serious condition with stab wounds at  Long Beach Memorial Hospital, police said Sunday.  </P> <P> After a helicopter search, police arrested a 17-year-old youth and a  19-year-old man, both from Los Alamitos, and were holding them for questioning.  As many as three other suspects remained at large Sunday, police said. Police  declined to identify any of the suspects or victims.  </P> <P> Gang violence is rare in Los Alamitos, and police there declined to discuss  gang problems in the city. But Cypress police, who patrol streets within a  block of the double stabbing, said they have seen increased gang activity in  their city.  </P> <P> "There's been a noticeable increase over the last year or two. More and more of  our patrol people are coming in contact with various gangs," Cypress Sgt. Sandy  Stanton said.  </P> <P> "We're still pretty untouched, compared to L.A. County," she said. "It's pretty  unusual to have something this major occur. Mostly we just see more graffiti.  It's nothing real big right now, but three or four years down the road may be  something else entirely."  </P> <P> On Sunday, pools of blood still caked the sidewalk and driveway in front of the  San Mateo Avenue house, a gray wood and brick home with a child's inflatable  swimming pool on the front porch roof.  </P> <P> Neighbors identified the dead boy as Eddie Naverette, who had recently moved  there with his mother and a younger brother and sister.  </P> <P> Roger Rangel, who had been Naverette's stepfather until he and the boy's mother  divorced, said Sunday that he did not think the boy was in a gang. Rangel said  the boy had dropped out of school, was working with his uncle's construction  company and spent a lot of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter  Alexis.  </P> <P> Neighbors said they have never seen gangs in their middle-class neighborhood of  single family homes, which is about two blocks from Los Alamitos High School.  </P> <P> "I hope it's an isolated incident," said John Balestracci, 56, who lives across  the street from the house where the party was held. "The mother just recently  took over the house."  </P> <P> His wife, Jo Ann Balestracci, 31, said they watched part of the fight from a  window in their home.  </P> <P> "All you saw were people running in all directions. We heard lots of yelling  and heard a girl screaming. And we heard some kid yelling, 'You're going to  die, boy, you're going to die!' "  </P> <P> About the same time as the Los Alamitos stabbings, Santa Ana police found a  17-year-old shot dead and another 17-year-old with a gunshot wound to the head  at 1100 S. Rosewood Ave.  </P> <P> The two teens were not identified. The injured youth was in critical condition  Sunday at an unidentified hospital, police said. They had no suspects Sunday.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police said shootings grew out of a street fight involving two rival  gangs that had converged at a party.  </P> <P> One witness said he called police about 10 p.m. to break up the party, but  officers did not immediately respond.  </P> <P> "I called four times over there. They said they were too busy," said Frank  Balderrama, who lives on Rosewood Avenue.  </P> <P> "There was loud music and cars in the street so I called police. Then, about  five minutes later, there were 30 to 50 youths out there, pushing and shoving,"  Balderrama said. "I called (police) again. Then I heard bottles being broken.  Some guys went in their cars and got chains. I called again. Then I heard five  shots.  </P> <P> "It's a disgrace, the way (police) handled this. If they had cooperated with  the first call I made, (the victim) wouldn't be dead," Balderrama said. "This  town needs more police officers on weekends."  </P> <P> Police said Sunday that they could not comment on Balderrama's complaints  because the officers involved were not present.  </P> <P> Earlier Saturday night, about 8:30 p.m., Buena Park police received a call  about a large party that had ended in gunfire on Flamingo Drive, Lt. Black  said.  </P> <P> Gabriel Orozco, 18, of Cypress, was shot twice, with one bullet lodging in his  left elbow and another hitting his gallbladder. He was in serious but stable  condition Sunday after several hours of surgery at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> Police said at least two gangs were involved in the Buena Park shooting, but  they had no suspects.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lucy Chabot contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNRELATED GANG SHOOTINGS  </P> <P> Two teen-agers were killed and three seriously injured Saturday night when  three seperate parties in North Orange County eruppted int violence that police  say was gang-related.  </P> <P> An 18-year-old Cypress youth was shot twice at a large party at 6072 Flamingo  Drive in Buena Park. He is in serious but stable condition. Police have no  suspects.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy who apparently was the host of a party was stabbed to death  at 3952 San Mateo Ave. In Los Alamitos, A 19-year-old guest was seriously  wounded. Two youths were arrested for questioning, and police said they were  searching for as many as three others.  </P> <P> A 17-year-old boy was killed and another 17-year-old was shot in the head in  the 1200 block of Rosewood Avenue in Santa Ana. Police said shots were fired  between rival gangs at a large party in the street. There were no suspects.  </P></p>

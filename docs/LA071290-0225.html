			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONTEL REPORTS $6-BILLION GTE TAKEOVER OFFER  </P> <P> Contel Corp., a diversified regional telephone company, said today that it has  received a takeover offer from GTE Corp. in a stock swap worth $6 billion,  extending a recent spate of takeovers in the telecommunications industry while  mergers elsewhere have ground to a halt.  </P> <P> The deal, which would be one of the largest ever in the telecommunications  industry, proposes that Contel stockholders receive 1.27 GTE shares for each  Contel share.  </P> <P> Contel has about 158 million shares outstanding. At this morning's price, that  would be about $37.75 a share. GTE was trading at $29.75, down $1.25 from  Wednesday's close.  </P> <P> Contel, a company with more than $3 billion in annual revenues, provides a wide  range of telecommunications products and services. Recently, it bought  $1.3-billion worth of cellular telephone properties from McCaw Communications.  </P> <P> GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., is one of the world's largest telecommunications  companies, with more than $20 billion in annual sales.  </P> <P> Contel, shaped by entrepreneur Charles Wohlsetter, its chairman, was built from  a sleepy regional telephone company into a leading diversified communications  concern with local telephone units in 30 states. The purchase of the McCaw  units in three Southern states also made it a major player in the emerging  cellular telephone market.  </P> <P> For GTE, the acquisition of Contel will expand its domestic telephone company  base. The merger will also greatly expand its cellular business, which has been  a key focus of its growth strategy. It had been downplaying its role in the  domestic long-distance telephone market by selling much of its Sprint business.  </P> <P> A GTE/Contel hookup is likely to catch the attention of regulators, who will  examine its effect on the local telephone industry.  </P> <P> Contel, the 10th-largest telephone company, has 2.4 million telephone customers  in 30 states, while GTE operates in 31 states.  </P></p>

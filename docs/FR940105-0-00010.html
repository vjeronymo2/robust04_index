			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the comments noted above asserted that separate random testing rates for licensee employees and contractors/vendors would create additional administrative and financial burdens for licensees. Although this issue is somewhat moot since the Commission will permit licensees to reduce the random testing rate to 50 percent per year for all persons covered by Part 26, the Commission does not concur that conducting random testing using two random rates would have caused appreciably higher administrative or operating costs. Presumably, most licensees' data bases already distinguish between licensee employees and contractor/vendor employees subject to testing. Numerous commenters on the initial rule in 1989 indicated that the workforce population should be separated so that permanent employees would not be tested at a much higher rate to make up for contractors who might not be on site when selected for testing (see comment/response 7.4.3 of NUREG&hyph;1354). The NRC staff understands that several licensees have divided their testing population as permitted by the rule. The number and identity of licensee employees in the testing pool remains rather constant over time. The number and identity of contractor/vendor employees in the testing pool, on the other hand, varies quite considerably over time depending on outages and other operational considerations. A licensee may choose to create more than one test population so that it may test portions of its workforce at a greater rate or reduce the burden on its employees from being tested at a higher rate to compensate for the testing of contractors and vendors not normally on site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Comment. The Commission should modify certain portions of 10 CFR part 26 based on industry experience and lessons learned and incorporate numerous program enhancements as discussed at various industry forums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters recommended that the Commission make future modifications to certain portions of 10 CFR part 26 based on industry experience and lessons learned and incorporate numerous program enhancements as discussed at various industry forums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific recommendations for ways in which part 26 can be improved and numerous other program enhancements are currently being considered by the NRC in conjunction with a general package of rule revisions currently under development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, the NRC has not prepared an environmental impact statement, nor an environmental assessment for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) These requirements and amendments were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0146.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the rule will permit licensees to reduce the random testing rate for their employees, the resulting reduction in the reporting and recordkeeping burden is expected to be an average of 223 hours per site, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (MNBB&hyph;7714), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;3019 (3150&hyph;0146), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has prepared a regulatory analysis for this regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission.

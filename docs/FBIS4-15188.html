			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladas Burbulis report on interview with Lithuanian Prime </F> Minister Adolfas Slezevicius; date and place not given:  "Tallest Premier Wants To Be Self-Critical"]    [Text] March 31 marks a year since the day when the  Lithuanian Seimas approved the program submitted by the  country's sixth government. The 48-year-old Adolfas Slezevicius  was then charged with heading the cabinet. Introducing him to  their readers, the newspapers joked that the new premier and,  consequently, the new Lithuania is just two centimeters short of  complete happiness (Slezevicius is 198 cm tall).    The "boy" and his government have been in power for a year.  What has been accomplished and what has not been? This  ITAR-TASS correspondent put that question to the prime minister.    The premier preferred to be self-critical this time. We have  been forced, he said, to make unpopular decisions. For  instance, we could not keep buying gas from Russia at double the  price at which it is sold in Lithuania, since our debt was  snowballing. The same thing has been true of electricity, in  order to ensure that its prime cost does not exceed the retail  price.    [Burbulis] Has the current government made any mistakes  which it has later had to correct?    [Slezevicius] Yes, it has taken a number of wrong steps  which have damaged the economy and people. One of the most  important and worrying problems is that of settlements between  economic players, and mutual debts -- which currently stand at  around 900 million litai (approximately $200 million).    [Burbulis] For the first time Lithuania's prime minister is  also the chairman of the ruling party -- the Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party. How are these two jobs being combined?    [Slezevicius] I think that this is the democratic Western  model for running a country -- when the party which wins the  election forms the cabinet.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Frock coats and flush customers - The rich world of private banking DISILLUSIONMENT with high street banks and the derisory interest rates on current accounts might tempt wealthier clients into the arms of small private banks. It should be stressed that you usually need to be very wealthy for joining a private bank to make any sense - the charges, detailed below, are often far higher than any you will pay in the high street. Some newer banks, however, offer a different service. For example, Robert Fleming, a long-established merchant bank, now offers a high interest cheque account. The interest rates tend to outstrip the competition, but for the best rates you will need quite a high net income. Smith &amp; Williamson, which started offering banking in 1970, having grown out of a Glasgow accountancy practice, offers a different specialist service. The banking is free while in credit but there is no interest on current accounts. Their special service comes from the assistance on tax which they can integrate with the service. The small banks which most people associate with 'private banking' grew out of goldsmithery in the City of London and remain exclusive, sometimes insisting on references from existing customers before you may join. These include C Hoare, famed for its close links with the legal profession and still independent; Child &amp; Co, the oldest bank in England, now a trading name of the Royal Bank of Scotland; and Coutts, the largest and most expensive, now a subsidiary of NatWest. These banks differ surprisingly in character. For example, if it matters to you that your bank manager does not have a beard, then Coutts &amp; Co may have the answer. All its male staff, from the chief executive down to the office boys, are required to be clean-shaven. They must also wear frock coats and waistcoats while they are in the office. Coutts finds that its customers value this adherence to tradition, although none of its competitors goes to the same extreme of wearing its history on its frock coat sleeve. Hoare, like Coutts and Child, refers to its main banking hall as the 'Shop'. The porters who guide you around the hall still wear a uniform of swallow-tail coats with brass buttons. A typical perk is the narrative account, on offer from Coutts, Hoare, Smith &amp; Williamson and Adam and available for an extra charge from Child. These list all the people who paid money into your account and all the people to whom your cheques have been paid. Many find this useful. Adam goes a step further and offers personal profit and loss accounts, showing what you spent during the year, or during the month, on food, or education, or taxation. This may well prove to be a boon come the end of the tax year. Personal banking from a specially assigned banker who will usually only have around 200 accounts to supervise is the other big 'plus'. The manager with whom you deal can be expected to have a broad view of your finances and to be in a position to guide you to other financial services. If you dislike financial hassle, there are attractions in this kind of service, rather than talking to a number of different middlemen. There are some tangible fringe benefits, in the form of invitations to dinner and, in the case of Coutts, concerts in the central garden court. Coutts also offers genuine leather cheque book and credit card holders. Whether you really think they are worth paying for is another matter. These banks do not make it easy for you to forget their heritage. Hoare's previous clients include Samuel Pepys, Jane Austen, and Lord Byron. Its traditional strengths lie in serving the legal profession - the inns and the High Court are both near its main branch in Fleet Street. Coutts can counter, first and foremost, with the royal family, who have been faithful customers since the time of George III. Their line-up continues with the actors Keen and Kemble, Pitt the Younger and Pitt the Elder, the Duke of Wellington, Charles Dickens and Lord Tennyson. Child &amp; Co then wades in with clients from an earlier generation - Oliver Cromwell and Dean Swift. It also has traditionally close links with racing, and with Oxford University. All this information comes straight from the banks' promotional literature. For some reason, the main high street clearing banks completely omit the names of previous clients in their advertising. Coutts has by far the most glamorous office, at the head of the Strand. However, the spacious mix of the marble garden court, with goldfish ponds and plenteous plants, mixes oddly with the Victorian dress of the attendants. The overall impression is of a modern City office, not unlike the Snowdon aviary, peopled by the cast of a Dickens novel. Hoare's premises look more Victorian - a small office is reached through a corridor where guns for use against Napoleon are on display and four top hats stand ready in the main shop. Child's office is open-plan, and looks more like a modern high street bank, although show cases display documents from the bank's early history, and ten guns acquired at the time of the Gordon (a Coutts customer) riots against Catholics are also in the middle of the hall. However, not all the banks are ancient, or exclusively the preserve of 'old money'. Adam &amp; Co was established in Edinburgh six years ago and aims for more entrepreneurial spirits. While the older banks cater for the nobility, Adam's typical client is someone who has just sold his share in a company, or floated it on the Unlisted Securities Market. If tradition and status appeal to you, then some of the old established names may seem attractive. But if you want value for money, you will need to shop around. Adam &amp; Co.

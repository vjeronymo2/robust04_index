			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Curious forecasts spring from subtle imagination Sir, As an engineer rather than an accountant, I was sorry that your article, 'Managers lack finance skills, says survey' (February 24), did not supply the 'correct' answer to the philosophical question 'What is the basic purpose of a profit and loss account?' My own experience is that a good profit and loss account (and balance sheet) is a subtle work of the imagination (with a small admixture of fact) which has four basic purposes: to flatter the management, to reassure the bankers, to comfort the shareholders, and to minimise the tax liability. To balance these purposes without actually being seen to break the rules is the true art of accountancy. Would this have been marked correct? Your article said: 'Only 38 per cent (of managers) correctly identified (working capital) as just cash, stock and debtors.' I was brought up to believe that working capital was 'current assets less current liabilities'. If nearly two out of five managers (and KPMG Management Consulting which conducted the survey) think creditors and overdraft can be ignored, this could account for a lot of curious working capital forecasts and apparently perverse management decisions in British industry.

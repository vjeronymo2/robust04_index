			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Travel: Bedazzled, but not bored, by Buggala - Nicholas Woodsworth drops out of the 20th century on a supremely somnolent island in Lake Victoria AS A RULE, tax assessors are calm, collected men who keep their emotions, when they have any, well buttoned. So when I met three of them waving their arms and hopping up and down on the little stone jetty at Luku, wild to get away in the leaky fishing canoe I had just arrived on, I imagined the worst. They were dishevelled. They had twigs in their hair. There was a desperate look to their eyes. What in God's name, I wondered, could this island be, to turn hard-nosed tax men into these pathetic, anxious creatures? They were falling over each other to get into the fishy-smelling canoe. Were there hostile tax-payers hot on their heels? Swarms of African killer bees? Cannibals? No, it was none of these things. It was boredom. 'We have been stranded at this jetty for three days', said Innocent, the senior taxman. 'We have slept in mud huts, and sat in the grass, and waited and waited for a boat to get us out of here.' His black, heavy-framed glasses, usually a successful prop in the presentation of fiscal gravitas, sat skewed to one side of his nose. I wished my own tax assessor amused me as much. 'This is a horrible island. There is no electricity, no plumbing, no transport, no news, no civilisation. There is nothing here - just forest, and primitive villagers, and monkeys who steal crops. Nothing]' Innocent was venting 72 hours' worth of indignation. 'How can we do our job? This place has been cut off from the world for 20 years. It is hard to get on the island, hard to get off, and nobody has any money anyway. We are going home.' The small Yamaha motor on the canoe buzzed into life. 'If I were you I would return with us', Innocent shouted as the little boat turned from the jetty and pointed its bows to the distant mainland. I thought about it for a moment. Life on Buggala Island in Lake Victoria may be disagreeable to the modern, bureaucratic frame of mind, but to me it sounded just the ticket. There are not many places left these days, even in Africa, where you can escape it all. I decided to stay. Innocent was right. Luku is a tough place to get out of. On the other side of the island, across 24 miles of thick tropical forest, was Kalangala, the island's main village, and the Malaanga Ssese Lodge, my destination. But there appeared to be no way to get there. Like Innocent and his colleagues, I sat in the grass, watched the birds of late afternoon being replaced by the bats of early evening, and wondered what to do. Rescue came in the form of a red Honda motorcycle with an empty tank. 'I have transport but no petrol money', said Andrew, a young man who eventually ambled out of one of Luku's mud huts. 'You have petrol money but no transport. We shall help each other.' In no time a jerry-can was produced, and for an exorbitant sum I purchased two litres of petrol. There was change due but a shortage of coins. I was given a large bunch of bananas instead. With me, my rucksack and my bananas perched precariously on the back of the Honda, Andrew roared off into the forest. Such is the waywardness of travel off the beaten path in Africa. The Ssese Islands are as spectacular as they are whimsical and out of the way. The road, a track of rich red tropical dirt, meandered up into hills covered with virgin forest. Smooth-barked tropical hardwoods vaulted upwards into the dusk. Occasionally we would stop in a grassy clearing so I could adjust my bananas and look out over the hills. Below, beyond the reed-lined edges of Buggala, scores of other green islands seemed to float on the windless and glassy water of Lake Victoria. Nearby, the last of the day's butterflies flitted over feathery heads of grass. With the motor off, I could hear the sounds of the forest - birds hooting, the cheeching of monkeys high in the trees. There was a new coolness in the humid air. Beside the road, the bright reds and yellows of tropical flowers jumped out from the twilight. It may not have pleased Innocent, but it pleased me. By the time we arrived at the lodge, Kalangala, high in a hillside forest, was in pitch dark. The tax men had been right again: there was not a hint of electricity anywhere. From the open doors and windows of houses by the roadside came the flickering warm light of kerosene lamps; from the trees and vegetable plots and clearings around them came the colder, steadier, phosphorescent glow of a thousand fireflies. It was like motorbiking through a constellation of stars. After days of hard overland travel through central Africa, I was grimy, bug-bitten and weary. I had eaten too many boiled yams. I had stood too often under dribbling showers of cold rust-red water. I had slept in too many unchanged bedsheets. I had had African hotels. There was no reason why things should be any different here. But I had not reckoned with PT Andronico, hotel proprietor extraordinaire. 'Welcome, brother]' Andronico stood on the steps of his tin-roofed, flower-festooned house with open arms. A great laugh resonated from his slight frame. Within seconds I was installed in a small, simple and immaculately-kept room. Within minutes, a tub of clear rain water had been drawn and heated and in a little cubicle lit by wavering lamp flame and open to the night sky and stars, I was sloshing my travel fatigue away. Half-an-hour later I was sipping banana wine and feasting on roast pork and pineapple. Sated and sighing, I took the time to look around. PT Andronico is proud of himself, and proud of his lodge. It was all rather dotty, like finding oneself in the middle of a vigorous and colour-mad naif painting. Scattered about the porch, amid a dozen burning lamps, were plants and flowers in paint pots and tubs, each container labelled 'plant', or 'flower'. On window sills and walls and doors, in large letters, were other inscriptions: 'Truth and Justice', 'Love', 'Honesty'. There is no conscious colour scheme to Andronico's lodge; its blues, yellows, greens and pinks are as unruly and wildly put together as the profusion of tropical flowers that grows around it. What, I asked Andronico, was the meaning of the letters 'P T A' painted on every surface? The dark face under the silvering hair lit up, the smile widened. ''A' is for Andronico. We all have Christian names on the Ssese Islands. I was educated here by Catholic missionaries, the White Fathers. 'T', my good brother, is for teacher; for 33 years I was headmaster of the island primary school. And 'P' is the best of all. Oh, yes. It stands for pilgrim. In 1975 my brother Afridisio and I flew to Rome with the Ugandan Church. We drank red wine, we looked at the city from the top of St Peter's, we met the Pope. I kissed his hand. It was a wonderful time.' The smile became wider and prouder. The P T A inscriptions Andronico has placed all over his lodge are not marks of ownership, but robust, joyful statements of existence. Existence is a precious thing in Uganda these days, and Ssese islanders, 16,000 of them scattered over 84 islands, enjoy a more reassuring measure of it than most. Twenty years ago Idi Amin came to power and embarked on a rule of terror. Normal life came to a halt, and the Ssese Islands, far out in the waters of the world's second biggest lake, were simply forgotten. Other tyrants followed Amin, a succession of armies ravaged and destroyed the country, and year after year nobody moved on or off the islands. It was too dangerous. But if islanders had to make do without the conveniences of modern life, they were grateful to be spared its murderous inconveniences as well. Today peace has returned to Uganda, and with it the first trickles of tourism, but the country is bankrupt and there is no money to modernize the Sseses. There are just six cars on Buggala, all belonging to government agencies. There are telephones, too, but not many: the lodge's number is 26. Andronico has a television, but every time the car battery that powers it runs down it has to be lugged to the mainland. Cut adrift from the 20th century, the Sseses have slipped through civilisation's net. They now drift serenely on the warm, equatorial waters of Lake Victoria, oblivious of time, place or the changing world outside. The days went by. Innocent may have been bored on the Sseses, but I found plenty of things to do. I went fishing in dug-out canoes for the monstrous Nile perch that inhabit the lake. I walked, feeling much reduced in size, on trails across the forest floor 150 feet below a dark green canopy of branches. With Andronico energetically cycling ahead, showing few of his 66 years, I pedalled around the island on an ancient bicycle, visiting his aunt, his children, his countless friends. Everyone knows Andronico, he has taught them all. Most of all, though, I enjoyed simply sitting on the front porch, a glass of banana wine close at hand, watching peaceful Ssese life go by: bright yellow weaver birds hopping in and out of their globe-shaped, hanging nests; barefoot school-children skipping home to neat little thatched houses fronted by mango trees and coffee bushes; red tethered cows grazing by the roadside; old men walking from a shop with a sack of salt or a bag of vegetables balanced on their heads. I enjoyed it all the more because I know it will not last for ever. Sooner or later, civilisation will come to the Bali of Africa. There will be electricity, modern hotels, more people like me, less people like Andronico. One day, Innocent and his minions will be happy to return to Ssese. Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Uganda c/o British Airways, which flies to Kampala twice a week and offers an Apex return fare of Pounds 788 and full economy fare of Pounds 1,990. Fuel, spare parts and personnel permitting, there are three nine-hour long ferry sailings from Kampala to Buggala island each week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Wen: "Trade Promotion Body Set Up"] </F>   [Text] A nongovernment organization aiming to promote  economic cooperation between China and other Northeast Asian  countries was founded in Beijing yesterday. The Chinese  Association for the Promotion of International Technological and  Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia is the first of its kind.    "The focus of the world economy is moving from the West to  the Asia-Pacific region, in which Northeast Asia boasts great  potential for development," said Yang Shouzheng, president of  the association.    The detente after 40 years of "Cold War" provides the region  with a stable climate for technological and economic  cooperation. With their rich resources and a huge market,  Northeast Asian countries have placed market economy as the  priority in their economic development.    The founding of the association is to meet the needs of the  region by providing consultancy services and promoting exchange  and co-operation. "Trade between China and Northeast Asia has  been growing steadily over the past few years," said Pi  Shenghao, deputy director with China International Trust and  Investment Corporation Research International.    Bilateral trade has been active.    Trade between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) reached  $8.9 billion last year and that with Russia amounted to $7.2  billion, a 24 percent increase over the previous year.    Trade with Japan, China's biggest trade partner after Hong  Kong, reached $39 billion last year, a 30 percent increase over  1992.    Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia,  and between ROK and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  has also seen steady growth. Besides trade links, Pi said, the  neighbouring countries are working together under a United  Nations programme to develop the Tumen River Development Zone,  which borders China, Russia, and the DPRK.    The United Nations Development Programme will invest $30  billion in the massive project over the next 20 years. "The  project will boost relations among Northeast Asian countries,"  said Pi.    In the three northeastern provinces in China, Harbin has  established itself as the conduit for commerce with Russia.  Since 1990, an annual border trade fair has been organized in  Harbin, attracting businessmen from nearby regions and other  parts of the world.    Tianjin and Dalian have also held such fairs.    To expand international cooperation and investment, the new  association will hold an international academic symposium and a  trade fair with the theme, "Northeast Asia looking to the 21st  Century," in April next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The withdrawal of Russia's strategic missile forces  deployed in Belarus has already begun. This relates to the  Mazyr and Lida missile divisions composed of eight missile  regiments equipped with 72 launching facilities. The divisions  are armed with the portable ground-based missile systems RS-12M  and Topal.    In 1993, one missile regiment was withdrawn from Pastawy,  Vitsebsk Oblast, to Russia. In 1994, another four regiments  with 36 launching facilities will be withdrawn from Belarus.  The last regiments will be pulled out in 1995. In 1996, the  Mazyr and Lida divisions will cease to exist.</p>

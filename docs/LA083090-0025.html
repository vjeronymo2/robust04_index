			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FESTIVAL NEWS  </P> <P> Festival Club Moves: The Festival Club at Bruno's Ristorante will move to Cafe  Largo and Canter's Delicatessen because recent surgery has left Bruno's owner  unable to oversee operations. Cafe Largo and Canter's -- opposite each other at  432 N. Fairfax and 419 N. Fairfax, respectively -- have agreed to serve as  informal gathering places for Open Festival attendees and festival artists  during the event. The buses for the Open Festival's "99 Hours of Art" tours are  now tentatively slated to leave from Farmers Market. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

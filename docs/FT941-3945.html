			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: True grit under the flag - Theatre The UK has a new institution created by one of its oldest. The Moving Theatre Company has been founded by Vanessa and Corin Redgrave; their co-directors are Lenka Udovicki of former Yugoslavia and Helena Kaut-Howson of Theatr Clwyd. Its first production, The Flag, at the excellent Bridge Lane Theatre, sets the tone for the company's work: gritty and trenchant. This makes a fine debut. Brechtian drama follows in April. The Flag, written by Alex Ferguson from the novel by Robert Shaw follows the fortunes of a left-wing clergyman back from the horrors of trench warfare and dizzy with hopes of the 1926 General Strike. Shaw's novel, the first of an uncompleted trilogy, looks to George Orwell in content and George Ewart Evans in country style, for it is set in a sleepy parish in Suffolk. The central figure, John Calvin (excellently played by Corin Redgrave) is not a character but a magnet for nonconformity: sexual, political and religious. He is brought to Suffolk by a mischievous and libidinous dowager who loves him and his politics: 'Wonderful news,' she reports, 'I've found a socialist, a real socialist . . . in Manchester.' Calvin duly offers the recalcitrant parishioners new forms of faith. The Red Flag hangs in the church, a totem for the play's action. Ferguson's adaptation makes sporadically powerful theatre. The original novel's impact lay in its picture of the world rather than in the pattern of exchanges between individuals on stage. The play has to give up social description for dramatic action. Corin Redgrave's direction (with Gillian Hambleton) moves deftly between times, and switches sharply among the large cast of characters: Calvin's malcontent wife, his pubescent children, his erstwhile comrades in arms and the bevy of bucolics. What remains at the end is the sense that something telling has happened, and regret that the play leaves so much unsaid. Beneath runs the fear of capitalism and disappointment in the labour movement. Socialists in 1926 must have held their breath, face to face with something commensurate to their capacity for action. But only the miners stayed out on strike. Bridge Lane Theatre until April 2</p>

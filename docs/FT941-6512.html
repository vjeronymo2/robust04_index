			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession cuts profit at Esab to SKr82m Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, yesterday reported a near 50 per cent slide in 1993 profits after financial items to SKr82m (Dollars 10m), as income fell from recession-hit Europe and a cooler Brazilian market. But the Swedish group said 1992 profits had been inflated by a one-off profit of SKr99m. It said income in the fourth quarter of 1993 accounted for more than half the income for the full year, and predicted a strong improvement in 1994 as demand in some European countries and Brazil had stabilised and growth continued in North America. Sales in 1993 rose to SKr7bn from SKr6.4bn, and orders grew to SKr7.13bn from Skr6.4bn. But Esab said these were distorted by the sharp fall last year in the Swedish krona; taking this into account, sales fell by 4 per cent. The company is holding its dividend at SKr3.25 per share. Esab has faced a sharp decline in the main western European markets for welding equipment - Germany and Italy - since 1991. But it expanded in Russia and eastern Europe, acquiring 70 per cent of the Czech republic's leading welding company, Zelezarny-Vamberk. In January it also signed contracts to set up two joint ventures in China, the largest a plant in Shanghai which will have a production capacity in 1995 of 30,000 tonnes of welding electrodes.</p>

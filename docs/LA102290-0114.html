			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> WHALE BEACHED IN S.F. BAY  </P> <P> A humpback whale was found beached on mud flats south of Candlestick Park  today, snarling traffic as commuters on a bayside freeway slowed to watch the  stranded creature, authorities said.  </P> <P> Marine biologists were trying to learn why the whale was stuck in three feet of  water near the edge of San Francisco Bay, about half a mile south of the  stadium. The whale may have been the same one seen swimming in the bay south of  Candlestick on Sunday.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard said it was sending out two boats with biologists from the  Marine Mammal Center and National Marine Fisheries Service to see if they could  help the whale.  </P></p>

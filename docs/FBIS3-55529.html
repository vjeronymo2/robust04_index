			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Melnikova and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- On the eve of the first  parliament session presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov  warned communists against launching attacks on the president and  the Constitution and added that the president wants to  constructively work with the legislature.    Kostikov told a briefing on Monday [10 January] that there  are signs that communists are planning to launch attacks on the  president and the new Constitution in parliament thus resuming  what the former anti-Yeltsin legislature had failed to complete.    "Unfortunately, according to information which we possess,  there are big fears that some factions, in particular the  communists, are getting ready for attacks on the government, the  president. We have all grounds to expect that attacks on the  new Constitution will be launched", he said.    Kostikov called on communist leaders to remember "the bloody  trace left by communists and learn lessons from it" while  criticising the young Russian democracy and accusing the  president of dictatorship.    "On the eve of the first session of the State Duma I would  like to recall the tragic events connected with the bolshevik  history", he said referring, in particular, to the  anti-Bolshevik uprising in the fortress of Kronstadt in 1921  which was drowned in blood.    On Monday the Russian president decreed to rehabilitate the  soldiers and navymen who were executed during and after the  anti-Bolshevik uprising.    Kostikov said the president wants that cooperation with Duma  goes calmly and constructively. "Tomorrow a new page of the  Russian democracy begins and we are all interested that this  stage of cooperation of the president, the government with the  legislature is quiet and constructive", he stressed adding that  the executive authority would "keep a close eye on the  behaviour" of all parliamentary groups.</p>

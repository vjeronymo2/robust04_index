			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: A flying start in the Eurolira sector - International Borrowers dashed with almost indecent haste to launch their new year Eurobond issues, tapping a wide variety of currencies and maturities in the first few days of 1994. While several sectors of the international bond market saw substantial new supply, one of the most interesting was the Eurolira sector. This area offered borrowers attractive arbitrage opportunities, at a time when the regulations governing the market have been eased and when investor demand for high-yielding paper is expected to remain quite strong. Last week saw a sudden rise in Eurolira issuance with seven new issues - from Eurofima, Kingdom of Sweden, Dresdner Finance, GECC, Credit Local de France, Bayerische Hypobank, and Abbey National - raising a total of L1,750bn, or nearly 10 per cent of the total of L18,076bn raised in Eurolira issues in the whole of 1993. It not unusual for issuers to kick off the new year with a burst of activity. But the start of 1994 saw a change in some of the regulations concerning the Eurolira sector. Lead managers no longer need to obtain permission from the Bank of Italy for such issues. Instead, a Bank of Italy official said, they only have to notify the central bank of their intention to launch a Eurolira issue and can assume that the deal will automatically go ahead. Only in the case of borrowers with a low credit rating or no rating at all, or in cases where the issue has an unusual structure, does the central bank maintain its right to withhold permission. From the borrowers' point of view, it is the favourable swap opportunities which have provided the main driving force, allowing issuers to obtain attractive sub-Libor funding. Such opportunities come and go, and borrowers have to be quick to take advantage of them. For example, syndicate officials point out that for much of December, swap opportunities were unattractive, and so there was almost no issuance of Eurolira paper that month. From the investors' point of view, 1993 was a very good year for both Italian government bonds and Eurolira bonds, and these markets are expected to continue to perform well in 1994. Dealers cite several attractions of Eurolira paper. This sector of the international bond market is normally dominated by retail investors hunting for high coupons. Few other areas of the international bond market can provide such high coupons and such high overall yields. Coupons on Eurolira paper were in double digits last summer, and while they have steadily come down since then - last week's issues offered coupons ranging between 7.375 per cent and 7.875 per cent - they are still substantially higher than the coupons and overall yields on offer with, say, D-Mark denominated paper. Bond market specialists expect Italian government and Eurolira bonds to rally further in 1994 as inflation continues to decline and interest rates continue to fall. While hopes are high of a cut in official interest rates in the near future, some analysts predict that the Bank of Italy may hold off cutting rates until the Bundesbank lowers the key German interest rates. In the secondary market, Eurolira paper is quite expensive, with many issues trading at well over par, dealers said. Yet in spite of these factors, investors did not appear to be rushing to buy up all the new Eurolira issues. By Friday afternoon, some of the issues were only just trading at full fees, and dealers quoted prices for the Kingdom of Sweden and Credit Local which were outside full fees. The more generous in the market attributed this lack of investor interest to the holiday hangover, adding that it was proving difficult to track down investors as many are not expected to return to work full-time until today. Others claimed that the Kingdom of Sweden deal had been priced too aggressively and that matters had not been helped by the generally heavy supply. 'The market has had enough, it is getting saturated,' said one dealer. Given the conditions, it remains to be seen whether the European Investment Bank goes ahead this week with the launch of its much-rumoured L1,000bn Eurolira issue. Such a large deal could well swamp a market which appears to be suffering from a bout of indigestion.</p>

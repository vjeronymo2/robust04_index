			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Mar (DPA) -- Juan Maria  Rendon, president of the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise  [Ecopetrol], today disclosed that the announced daily sale of  between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil to Havana is in doubt  because of Havana's failure to offer payment guarantees.    The official said negotiations on the oil sales stalled  after  Cuba proposed to make its payments contingent on its sugar  sales, something that could represent problems for Colombia if  Cuba encounters problems in its sugar trade. Rendon said the  Colombian Government is demanding the oil sales be backed by  letters of credit from major international banks, something  Havana apparently has not considered.    The announcement on the sale of oil produced serious  protests  among Cubans exiles in Miami, whose most radical sectors have  proposed boycotting Colombian products exported to Florida.    Meanwhile, Colombian political sectors have asked the  Gaviria  administration to reconsider its diplomatic relations with Cuba  after the media disclosed the holding of a "summit" in Havana in  which several guerrilla leaders and a Catholic bishop allegedly  participated. According to media reports, it appears the  meeting took place between 23 and 28 January with the presumed  consent of Fidel Castro's government. This is why the Colombian  Government asked for an explanation of the matter in a  diplomatic note signed by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. The  Cuban Government denied that such a "summit" was ever held. In  turn, Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas said, "we  have to believe" Cuba, and he ruled out the possibility of  breaking relations.    Diplomatic relations between Santa Fe de Bogota and Havana  were reestablished in October after having been suspended for 12  years. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay (1978-82) broke off  relations after intelligence reports indicated Colombian  guerrillas had been trained in Cuba.</p>

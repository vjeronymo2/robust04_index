			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN PARENT SUES TO REVERSE THRIFT'S SEIZURE  </P> <P> American Continental Corp., making good on its promise to fight the federal  seizure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., has filed suit in U.S. District  Court in Phoenix to overturn the seizure last Friday of the Irvine-based  thrift.  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, meanwhile, intends to ask a bankruptcy court  today to transfer control of certain Lincoln assets to federal regulators,  contending that American Continental filed for protection from creditors last  Thursday to try to keep those assets out of the government's hands.  </P> <P> Lincoln, one the of state's biggest thrifts with $5.4 billion in assets, was  seized by the bank board as part of the S&amp;L rescue program instituted by  President Bush. While Lincoln still is owned by American Continental, it is  being run by federal regulators.  </P> <P> Besides trying to overturn the seizure, the suit filed by American Continental  seeks $150 million in damages from the bank board; its insurance arm, the  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., and its regional regulatory branch,  the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said Tuesday he was aware  of the suit but had not reviewed it and could not comment on its allegations.  The suit was filed Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compelling Reasons  </P> <P> Wall said, however, that the bank board had compelling and legally proper  reasons for taking control of Lincoln.  </P> <P> Government regulators maintain that Lincoln was being mismanaged and that its  assets were being used to benefit American Continental at the expense of the  S&amp;L.  </P> <P> "We said at the outset that we expect this to be a very litigious matter," said  Wall.  </P> <P> He said the seizure of Lincoln was hastened by American Continental's decision  to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code on behalf of itself and 11 Lincoln subsidiaries. The bankruptcy case does  not include the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> One result of the bankruptcy filing is the suspension of monthly interest  payments to some 23,000 investors who bought $200 million worth of American  Continental bonds.  </P> <P> Many of the bonds were sold through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branch  offices and were marketed as alternatives to certificates of deposit that paid  lower interest rates but were protected by federal deposit insurance.  </P> <P> Under the bankruptcy rules, bondholders are considered unsecured creditors and  cannot receive any payments of principal or interest until a plan of  reorganization is worked out. One bankruptcy law specialist said that could  take a year or more in a case as complex as American Continental's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond-Holder Action  </P> <P> One bond purchaser, Fountain Valley dentist Don Mikami, said Tuesday that  bondholders are trying to determine what recourse they have.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is organizing," said Mikami, who owns $25,000 in American  Continental subordinated debentures. "We're collecting as many names as  possible at this time and getting a data base of investors" for a possible  future legal action.  </P> <P> In its suit, American Continental maintains that regulators had no right to  assume control of Lincoln because the S&amp;L was solvent when it was seized.  </P> <P> The suit also claims that the bank board and its officials have waged a  three-year campaign to destroy Lincoln "in retaliation for Lincoln's opposition  to limitations on the types of investments in which savings and loans may  engage."  </P> <P> American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr., in a 20-minute speech  Monday, claimed that the seizure of Lincoln threatened the stability of  American Continental -- one of the Arizona's largest employers -- and thus was  a blow against that state's economy.  </P> <P> Keating also charged that the bank board has been attempting to destroy his  reputation and the ability of his companies to do business by systematically  leaking confidential information from government audits of Lincoln to the press  and by "toying with the files, by trumped up charges . . . distortions and  outright lies."  </P> <P> Keating is a fiery and politically well-connected Phoenix developer who has  been outspokenly critical of the bank board and its regulation of S&amp;L  investing policies.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Maria L.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  said Wednesday [2 March] it will revise its long-term domestic  energy demand-supply outlook because the nation's energy  consumption is growing at a faster pace than the panel  previously projected. The advisory committee for energy, a  panel of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said  the existing projection, worked out in June 1990, will be  replaced in May by new forecasts for 2000 and 2010.    The group said energy consumption has been expanding at a  faster pace than it projected while supply growth is expected to  remain slow. The panel said the prospect for energy supply is  dim because the development of alternate energy sources has  become stagnant and the construction of new nuclear power plants  has been hampered due to difficulty in finding construction  sites.    The current outlook puts an annual average increase of  Japan's energy consumption at 1.6 percent toward the year 2000.  The panel said domestic consumption, which bloated during the  "bubble economy," continued to rise at an average rate of over 3  percent despite the recession.    It also noted that Japan's dependence on crude oil has not  declined as expected because of low oil prices.    The committee said the new outlook will incorporate a plan  to  promote the use of alternate energy sources which discharge  lower levels of carbon dioxide than fossil fuels to meet the  government-set goal for per-capita CO2 emissions.</p>

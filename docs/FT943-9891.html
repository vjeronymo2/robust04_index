			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Korean bribes probe draws in chaebol chiefs An expanded investigation into bribery involving Korea's nuclear energy programme threatens to implicate the heads of the Daewoo and Dong-ah industrial groups. Prosecutors allege that the former president of Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the state-run electricity monopoly, received kickbacks totalling Won400m (Pounds 324,412) from the two conglomerates for construction contracts of several nuclear plants and thermal power stations. Mr Ahn Byong-wha, the Kepco president between 1989 and 1993, was arrested last week for allegedly accepting a Won200m bribe from the Korean agent for Atomic Energy of Canada involving a nuclear reactor contract. A total of five nuclear power plants were ordered by Kepco at a cost of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) during Mr Ahn's term. Mr Kim Woo-choong, the Daewoo chairman and one of Korea's best-known businessmen, is expected to be interrogated today on his return from a business trip to Vietnam following the questioning of Mr Choi Won-suk, the Dong-ah chairman, over the weekend. The business groups own two of the country's largest construction companies. Both men could be indicted on bribery charges if it is believed they gave kickbacks to Mr Ahn. Mr Ahn is alleged to have demanded the money in order to bribe other government officials in the former administration of President Roh Tae-woo in an unsuccessful attempt to extend his term as Kepco president. The Kepco investigation threatens to harm relations between the government of President Kim Young-sam and the country's big conglomerates, or chaebol. Mr Kim initially took a tough stance against the chaebol last year in an effort to reduce their immense economic and political influence. Several main groups, including Hyundai and Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), were the target of corruption inquiries. But the government adopted a conciliatory policy toward the chaebol earlier this year as part of an attempt to revive economic growth. Political analysts believe that Mr Kim might once again be willing to challenge the chaebol in an effort to reverse his declining popularity after his ruling Democratic Liberal party lost two of three parliamentary by-elections last week. The Korean public has generally mistrusted the power of the chaebol and the president's anti-corruption campaign last year contributed to his high approval ratings then. It is thought Mr Kim may also try to use the Kepco investigation as a means to assert his authority in the DLP against the conservative faction affiliated with former President Roh. Mr Ahn was a former trade and industry minister in the Roh administration after serving as president of state-controlled Posco. Critics of Mr Kim have accused him of conducting a political vendetta by focusing corruption investigations on companies whose leaders were known to oppose his presidential candidacy in 1992. Mr Kim of Daewoo and Mr Park Tae-joon, the former Posco chairman, supported a aborted effort to run a conservative candidate against the present president. Mr Park later fled to Japan after he was investigated for allegedly using Posco funds to finance the failed presidential challenge. Mr Chung Ju-yung, the former Hyundai chairman who stood against Mr Kim in the 1992 election, recently received a suspended jail sentence for illegal campaign finances, and his group has been subject to government-imposed financial restrictions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic told reporters today that the visit by  Russian Patriarch Aleksiy II is a "moral, brave, and peacemaking  gesture and a sign of support for the Serb people." Official  talks between the Russian and Serbian patriarchs and President  Milosevic lasted for about an hour, after which a luncheon was  given in honor of the respected guest from Russia.    After that the Serbian president told reporters: "Let me  express my great satisfaction on behalf of citizens of our  country and on my own behalf that we have had the opportunity to  welcome Aleksiy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and  patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. "We interpret this visit as  a symbol of his efforts to have peace prevail in this area, a  sign of great solidarity with our people who are experiencing  great difficulties, and a sign of goodwill and resolve to find  the best possible solution for the big crisis in the area,"  Milosevic said.    Recalling that the friendship between the Serb and Russian  peoples has historic traditions, President Milosevic stressed:  "We do not live in history, we live in the present time and for  the sake of the present time we highly respect this moral,  brave, and peacemaking gesture by the Russian patriarch -- his  visit to our country."    Patriarch Aleksiy expressed satisfaction with the warm  welcome in the "fraternal Serbian state." He said: "We are  deeply grateful to the Serb people who are warmly receiving us,  as representatives of Russia, wherever we go. This is a  fraternal visit, but at this time we cannot remain indifferent  to the bloodshed and suffering of the innocent people in the  area," the patriarch said. "We will be happy if we succeed in  making a contribution toward achieving peace in the area," he  said, and expressed his gratitude to President Milosevic for the  cordial reception and "for enabling us to hold joint talks about  all key isses which are troubling this area."    Patriarch Aleksiy stressed that the visit is to continue and  the bishop of Backa, Irinej, has specified that a trip to  Sokolac and Sarajevo is planned for tomorrow, when the Serbian  and Russian patriarchs are expected to meet Cardinal Franjo  Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema Mustafa Ceric.    To a journalist's remark that Sarajevo Radio has reported  that Mustafa Ceric refused to meet [Serbian] Patriarch Pavle,  Bishop Irinej said the meeting has been officially confirmed,  and the Serbian church is not taking media reports as an  official refusal.    After a meeting in the afternoon with Yugoslav President  Zoran Lilic, the guest from Russia will visit Sremski Karlovci  and Novi Sad.    Patriarch Aleksiy is expected to visit Sokolac and Sarajevo  tomorrow.</p>

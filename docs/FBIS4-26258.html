			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Baiyangdian, a  renowned lake and tourism attraction in north China's Hebei  Province, has become dry again at this time this year, resulting  in losses to a dozen counties and cities around it.    More than 180,000 people live by the lake.    The few tourists are found walking on the dried-up lake bed  and tourism boats are laid up. Hotels, restaurants and holiday  villages are closed.    The present time would normally be the high season for local  tourism. But the 390-sq-km lake, which used to be famous for  its aquatic products, is now nearly bare of visitors.    Zhu Weijue, a deputy chief engineer with the Hebei  Provincial  Water Conservancy Bureau, said that the present drought,  starting in 1991, has been the worst in 50 years. Water from  rivers feeding the lake has been diverted for agricultural and  industrial use.    The Hebei provincial government is making efforts to help  local people fight the drought and try to reduce the damage to  the minimum.    The lake was dry for five years from 1983 to 1987, its  longest dry period. In 1988, the lake was again filled with  water.    Zhu said weather forecast shows that it will be a dry year  for the central and southern parts of northern China, including  Baiyangdian lake. Rainfall will be far from enough to refill  the lake in the near future, he noted.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, THE OSCAR SHOW WAS ONE BIG CARR CRASH  </P> <P> In 1939, my late father, Leo Shuken, won the Academy Award for scoring  "Stagecoach." Since then, I have been proud that the motion picture academy was  part of my family's history.  </P> <P> I was not proud when I watched the awards ceremony, which was shown all over  the world and for the first time in the U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> I recognize that the friendly public chiding of our leaders and political  satire in general are parts of our legacy of free speech. But to mock and  denigrate the vice president of the United States in front of other (even  hostile) nations and cultures is not an acceptable part of that legacy.  </P> <P> RONALD SHUKEN  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

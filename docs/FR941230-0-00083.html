			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that the recreational harvests calculated for 1993 are inflated. Specifically, the Texas charter vessel estimate appears to be excessive, compared to that of prior years. This estimate was based on only five interviews and has a very large standard error associated with it. Consequently, 1993 harvest estimates may have been overestimated and should be reduced to provide a higher allowable catch level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although it can be argued that the Texas charter vessel information has a fairly low level of precision, the existing data still represent the best scientific information available to the Council and NMFS in making management decisions. Moreover, sufficient justification does not exist for the compensatory reduction in Texas landings requested by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment referenced estimates of red snapper year-class strength that indicate that the 1990 year-class was weaker than the 1989 year-class. However, the estimates of numbers of red snapper alive by age, in June of each year, show a greater number of age-0 red snapper alive in 1989 than in 1990. This casts doubt on the reliability of the year-class strength estimates and, in turn, on the spawning potential ration (SPR) estimates that are derived using the year-class strength estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS believes that a very poor relationship exists between age-0 abundance and documented catches of older fish in the red snapper catch. Actual catch records for recent fishing years indicate that the 1990 year-class was weaker than the 1989 year-class. The discrepancy alleged by the commenter is a result of the VPA calculation, not an inaccuracy of the year-class data base. For these reasons, NMFS disagrees with the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment also indicated that the Council was presented with the results of a recent scientific study that suggests a lower recreational release mortality. However, the population projection model could not be modified to use: (1) Release mortality other than the 33-percent level assumed in the assessment, and (2) zero or differential release mortalities for recreational and commercial fishing. Use of these modifications may have produced results indicating that less restrictive measures were needed. For example, several Council members believe that a release mortality of 5 to 10 percent is appropriate. Assuming the lower release mortality, the reduced bag limits would result in an unnecessarily high reduction of harvest by approximately 52 percent from 1993 harvest levels. As a result, the five-fish bag limit is too restrictive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council minority report also claimed that since the recreational allocation refers only to red snapper caught and retained, incorporating release mortality into the analysis in effect double counts the impact of release mortality. An analysis of zero release mortality therefore should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NMFS stock assessment reviewed a number of studies of red snapper and other reef fish that estimate release mortality between zero and 67 percent. However, the studies indicating a red snapper release mortality less than 33 percent have not been extensively peer-reviewed or accepted by NMFS. As a result, the assessment assumed 33-percent release mortality. This assumption was extensively peer-reviewed and remains the best available scientific information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the assessment was completed, new recreational fishing mortality estimates will be reviewed by NMFS, SAP, and SSC to determine if a change to the release mortality is warranted. However, depending on its magnitude, such a change would not allow necessarily an increase in the recreational bag limit for red snapper in future years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Center stated that its staff does not agree that the assessment double counts the impact of release mortality. Elimination of release mortality from the assessment would allow this source of fishing mortality to be unaccounted for in determining the status of the resource. Moreover, elimination of the release mortality is contrary to the best available scientific information and should not be used in the VPA. NMFS therefore disagrees with this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment noted that a state agency study disputed the fecundity data in the red snapper stock assessment. The minority report stated that the state agency is in the process of reevaluating these data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS concludes that the points raised do not change the results of the stock assessment. Once the referenced state study is complete, the results will be considered for inclusion into the data base. In the interim, the fecundity data in the stock assessment must be relied upon as the best available scientific information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

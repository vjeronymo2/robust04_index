			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: MONETARY POLICY IS NOT A PANACEA  </P> <P> By now, it should be fairly evident that the new decade has begun on a weak  economic note. Growth of the gross national product in last year's final  quarter was almost non-existent, while output in January slid by the steepest  monthly rate in seven years and gained only slightly in February, according to  the nation's purchasing managers.  </P> <P> The financial markets aren't in much better shape. Bond prices have tumbled  since the middle of December, sending the yield on the bellwether 30-year  Treasury bond soaring by over 0.75 percentage point to nearly 8.67% at one  point recently -- its highest level since last spring.  </P> <P> This year hasn't been kind to stocks either. The popular averages experienced  one of their worst Januarys in 30 years and have regained only a small part of  the drop since.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, the Federal Reserve Board would respond to these ominous signs by  loosening up on money, pushing interest rates down. Although the Fed has eased,  it hasn't eased very much.  </P> <P> Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed are aware of the  softness in business activity. However, they also worry about other things,  such as the rate of inflation. This leads me to conclude that the Fed has a  great deal of confidence in its ability to manage the economy -- more so than  may actually be justified.  </P> <P> It may be true that monetary policy can be used effectively to restrain the  economy. But it does not necessarily follow that monetary policy alone can  stimulate activity when such a move is called for.  </P> <P> This was the situation in the 1930s. At that time, the economy was spiraling  downward. Recognizing that it had tightened money when it should have loosened  it, the Fed proceeded to flood the banking system with reserves in the hopes of  driving interest rates low enough to stimulate borrowing and increase spending.  </P> <P> Rates came down, all right, but the banks refused to lend and people were  reluctant to borrow. This gave rise to the expression, "You can't push on a  string."  </P> <P> It seems to me that the Fed's freedom to maneuver is being increasingly  constrained by a unique set of developments that I call conundrums:  </P> <P> * If the Fed decides to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, it may  find that foreign investors will pull their funds out of U.S. fixed-income  instruments because of the relative attractiveness of rates back home. This  would cause interest rates in the United States to rise, as has occurred since  mid-December.  </P> <P> * Cutting Washington's budget deficit to reduce our dependence on foreign  funds, thus our vulnerability, might constitute enough fiscal restraint to tip  the economy over into the very recession that we're hoping to avoid.  </P> <P> * Fears in some quarters that the Fed will have to ease to keep us out of a  recession have contributed to the run-up in bond yields noted above, making it  even more necessary for the Fed to ease.  </P> <P> * Even if the Fed were to ease, it might not do much good, since lenders are  becoming increasingly reluctant to lend, while many borrowers are so burdened  with debt that they may not wish to borrow any more.  </P> <P> * Anyway, monetary policy is mostly in the hands of the regulators and  analysts, who are exhorting the banks to curtail lending to shore up their  capital ratios. This is producing the kind of credit crunch that we used to see  in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were limits on how much banks could pay for  deposits and charge for loans.  </P> <P> * Many people would have little reason to borrow, in any event, since the  big-ticket items they would likely purchase with these borrowed funds now cost  more than they can afford. Prices of new cars and new homes have gone up much  faster than have most families' incomes during the past two decades.  </P> <P> * Discretionary buying power in general is being chewed up by rapidly rising  Social Security taxes and the high cost of medical care, food and energy. These  items are obviously outside the purview of monetary policy, yet if the Fed  accommodates these increases, they'll become ingrained in our economy.  </P> <P> * We need a lower dollar to revive exports and curtail imports -- both  essential to keeping us out of recession. Yet pushing the buck down would very  likely increase the inflation pressures that the Fed is concerned about.  </P> <P> Recognizing that whatever they do may be wrong, Fed officials lately have begun  to talk about how they believe that the threat of recession is receding. In  this way, they hope to keep a lid on inflation and interest rates and hold the  economy on an even keel.  </P> <P> But if the Fed is no longer worried about recession, maybe the rest of us  should be. This is because interest rates are still restraining economic  activity.  </P> <P> And if the Fed is waiting for inflation to slow before easing money, it should  be aware of one other fact: Most of the reduction in a given rate of inflation  tends to occur after the economy has gone through a recession.  </P> <P> In other words: No pain, no gain in the fight against inflation.  </P></p>

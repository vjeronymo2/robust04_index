			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Berlin after Karajan - Andrew Clark finds Claudio Abbado revitalising the orchestra WHEN Claudio Abbado hosted a dinner for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra during last month's Italian tour, he told the musicians he did not want to be called maestro. 'I'm Claudio - for everyone', he said. Returning to Berlin, orchestra and conductor plunged into rehearsals for a concert cycle inspired by the late 18th century German poet Friedrich Holderlin - featuring composers as diverse as Ligeti, Rihm and Reger. No two events better symbolise the changes in Europe's leading concert orchestra since the death of Herbert von Karajan in 1989. No-one would have dreamed of addressing Karajan by his first name, nor would he have championed the 20th century programmes that dominate the orchestra's 1992-3 season, the first to bear Abbado's stamp as artistic director. There was bound to be a reaction to Karajan's 35-year reign, but few can have imagined it would be so fast and sweeping. In the vacuum after Karajan's death, the musicians seized the chance to move out of his shadow and modernise their image. Abbado was the conductor best equipped to share responsibility for the changes. Where Karajan was authoritarian, Abbado is mild and approachable. Conflicts which marred relations between chief conductor and orchestra in the 1980s are unlikely to be repeated. The musicians now have more control over their working conditions, personnel and recordings than any other contract orchestra. Tours are no longer dependent on Karajan's behind-the-scenes deal-making: the orchestra goes where and with whom it wants - in May to London with Bernard Haitink, followed by Israel and the US with Abbado. The emphasis now is more on the music than the man in charge. But Abbado is no door-mat: he has set out his artistic agenda and won the orchestra's loyalty by virtue of his musicianship and imagination. Despite warnings from the prophets of doom, expensive projects like last year's concert performances of Il viaggio a Reims and this month's Holderlin cycle have been an artistic and box-office success. Abbado's repertoire and skills have nonetheless proved double-edged. Widely respected for his Mahler and Brahms performances, he has yet to prove himself in other core areas of the orchestra's Austro-German tradition. His Mozart, Beethoven, Bruckner and Strauss lack the authenticity he brings to Berg, Musorgsky and Verdi. Nor is he a sound-merchant in the Karajan mould. The orchestra's distinctive Klang has lightened up, becoming more slender and digestible, less luxuriant. The increase in 20th century repertoire may be partly responsible. The orchestra has also started engaging conductors with a distinctly un-Karajanesque concept of sound, like Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Pierre Boulez. Another contributory factor is the turnover of personnel since the late 1980s - the orchestra is noticeably younger, more international. But the brighter, more energetic sound also reflects Abbado's technique and personality. He is less of a perfectionist than Karajan, less disciplinarian. Where Karajan kneaded the sound in circular motions, gathering it and controlling it in a tactile manner, Abbado is more spontaneous in performance - the arms flung open, the overall effect more explosive. The orchestra sounds less like a machine, the music less awesome and remote. Unlike its chief rival, the Vienna Philharmonic, which guards its tradition without recourse to a chief conductor, the Berlin Philharmonic has invested heavily in change. Under Abbado, it is becoming a less exclusive, more versatile and forward-looking instrument. In the competitive musical world of the 1990s, the two are counting on each other to make it work. The Berlin Philharmonic's Holderlin cycle opened with three sold-out Abbado concerts contrasting Holderlin settings by contemporary and Romantic composers. Abbado also took part as conductor and pianist in a chamber music programme of Nono, Maderna, Kurtag and Holliger. The choice of theme reflects Abbado's knowledge of and identification with German culture, as well as his familiarity with postwar Italian composers who have been attracted to Holderlin's world. Holderlin (1770-1843) is a poet whose verse expresses a longing for the spirit of the classical era and a belief in nature and beauty as healing forces. Mentally ill for the last 37 years of his life, he continued writing in fragments. Holderlin's musical appeal lies in the melody and rhythm of his verse, as well as the purity of his German. The challenge facing the composer is to preserve and, if possible, enhance this appeal. Giacomo Manzoni's Holderlin frammento for chorus and orchestra came over unmistakeably as a post-1960s product - a complex web of aleatory effects and choral echoes, requiring the musicians to scrape and stamp their feet, and ending appropriately with the poet's words 'Pardon if I do not make myself well enough understood'. By contrast, Wolfgang Rihm's waif-like Holderlin-Fragmente for baritone and orchestra captures the mood of innocent isolation in the text, using simple brush strokes for each word (cleanly enunciated by Johannes Kosters). Ligeti's Drei Phantasien for unaccompanied chorus shows a similarly keen and detailed response, avoiding the self-conscious vocal effects of Heinz Holliger's Die Jahreszeiten or the anaemic quality of the Holderlin extract from Nono's Prometeo. Only Richard Strauss, in his Drei Hymnen (sung by Karita Mattila with Elysian beauty of tone), rode roughshod over his material, clothing it in the same majestic-heroic flourishes he applied to everything else. Thanks to its vivid contrasts and Abbado's inspired direction, the main programme had a powerful cumulative impact, ending with the nostalgic glow of Reger's An die Hoffnung and the heavenly harmony of Brahms' Schicksalslied. The chamber music concert, less convincing in overall effect, included a soporific 45-minute recitation from Hyperion, which I would have gladly sacrificed for a chance to hear Britten's Holderlin settings. The Leipzig Radio Chorus, directed by Gert Frischmuth, made an outstanding contribution to both events. Claudio Abbado conducts the Royal Opera's new production of 'Pelleas et Melisande' at Covent Garden, first night March 24. The Berlin Philharmonic gives its annual Europa concert on May 1 at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Bernard Haitink</p>

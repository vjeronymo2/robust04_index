			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] has  officially informed the UN Secretariat General that it will  accept the second map on Maras [Varosha] and an agreement can be  signed if the agreements reached in Vienna are added to the 21  March document which was submitted to the sides in connection  with the confidence-building measures [CBM] package. Following  a meeting over dinner, which was held among the representatives  of the TRNC, Turkey, and the United Nations at the President's  Office last night, and which lasted approximately three hours,  President Rauf Denktas read out to reporters the reply given to  the UN Secretariat General.    The reply text stressed that the TRNC has the will to  conclude an agreement with the Greek Cypriot side on the CBM  issue in the hope and expectation of facilitating a  comprehensive solution, which considers the realities on the  island as the starting point, which is based on political and  legal equality, and which consequently assures the equal  distribution of authority.    The text noted: Acting out of this will, the TRNC will  accept the ideas concerning the access to and security of Maras  proposed by Mr. Robert Lamb during the meeting held in Vienna on  11 and 12 May with Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy in Cyprus, as well as the Maras map  submitted by the United Nations, on condition that the  agreements with regard to the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International  Airport and the travel, foreign aid, and landing and take-off  benefits to be granted to the Turkish Cypriot side reached  during the said meeting on the basis of Mr. Lamb's ideas are  included in the text of the agreement to be submitted to the  signature of the sides.    The text sent to the UN Secretariat General also declared  that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to correspond with the UN  officials on the above-mentioned subjects.    After reading out the reply, Denktas answered reporters'  questions. He said that Feissel informed him that he has  certain problems, and he will contact New York. The UN  officials do not want to change the 21 March document, Denktas  noted. He stressed the need to seek the consent of the Turkish  Cypriot side with regard to the new elements to be incorporated  into the 21 March document. Responding to a remark that Greek  Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis is not willing  to accept any changes to the document, Denktas said: That is  Kliridhis' concern.    In reply to another question whether the Turkish Cypriot  side  is saying a conditional yes, Denktas stated: We did not say  conditional. Work was done in Vienna and results were obtained.  We want these results to be incorporated into this agreement.  These elements must be included into the 21 March document so  that they can turn into an agreement and we can sign it.    On the subject of Maras, Denktas announced that the Turkish  Cypriot side is ready to accept the second map. Answering a  reporter who reminded him of Feissel's statement before the  meeting on the promises made in Vienna, Denktas said that the  promises made to the Turkish Cypriots were the focus of the  hours-long discussions during the meeting.    In a statement after the meeting last night, Feissel said  that comprehensive talks were held on all the aspects of the  CBM's and that Denktas expressed his views on all the issues.  Feissel declared: It was a constructive effort.    Refraining from giving concrete answers to questions on the  outcome of the meeting, Feissel reported that he will convey the  content of the talks to the UN secretary general. He said that  the CBM's are still alive. Feissel also declined to answer a  question on the content of the message he will send to the UN  secretary general after the meeting.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: Local councils TODAY'S INTRODUCTION of the new council tax for funding local authority expenditure is notable for the absence of controversy. The advent of its predecessor, the poll tax, was marked by non-payment campaigns, civil disobedience and even riots. It created chaos in many town halls, choked some courts with enforcement proceedings and contributed to the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Against the gloomier prognostications of critics, the council tax seems to have enjoyed a relatively painless birth, ushering in a period of truce between central and local government which is sorely needed. Both sides can claim credit for this. Local government has been determined to make the new system work, despite misgivings about the complexities of discounts for single-adult households. Council leaders have recognised that they were drinking in the last chance saloon: the continuing independence of local government could not survive another poll tax fiasco. They have also strained to keep spending increases down - with only three councils said to be in danger of capping for over-spending. The government's contribution was in designing a system which is more convincing about its fairness than the poll tax ever could be. It also defies attempts to produce headline figures for the new tax, leaving most people blissfully unaware about whether they would be better-off or poorer as a result. A relatively inexpensive transitional relief scheme has limited the increases paid by households this year to between Pounds 1.75 and Pounds 3.50 a week. And stringent spending limits have been imposed on councils to ensure that the change in local taxation has not meant a leap in bills. The lessons of the poll tax were well learnt in Whitehall. This apparently painless transition to the new tax coincides with other signs of an improving relationship between central and local government. Ministers have spent much of the last year signalling an end to the hostilities of the 1980s. Councils have become more entrepreneurial in using the discipline of contracting-out to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their services. Power continues to move towards the centre with the recently announced police reforms and the increase in schools opting-out of local authority control. Today also sees more than 550 further education, tertiary and sixth-form colleges pass out of local authority control, becoming independent bodies funded directly by the government. However, the movement of power is not all one-way: responsibility for care in the community is passing down to councils, also from today. This offers local government an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their ability to deliver vital services locally. It should not be fumbled, whatever councils' misgivings over the funding. Further challenges lie ahead, including the reorganisation of local government to provide a single local council for every part of the country. The tax base of local authorities needs to be extended, since the council tax will raise less than a quarter of the money they spend. This gearing means that small increases in spending require the sort of huge increases in local taxation which so discredited the poll tax. However, further change should be gradual and incremental. A period of stability is needed in local government, not least to clear up the mess left by the poll tax. A decade of warfare between town halls and Whitehall has profoundly damaged local government. Repairing local democracy will need care and skill if its political legitimacy is to be restored.</p>

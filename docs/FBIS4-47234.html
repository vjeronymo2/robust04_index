			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Kirchev, member of the Uzbekistan Journalists </F> Union, under rubric "Nature and the Economy": "More Precious  Than Gold: or, How To Build Interrelationships Between the  Branch That Extracts Precious Metals and the Environment"]    [Text]  <H5>  World Money Is Being Extracted From the Depths of the Earth </H5>   Gold. The first of the metals that were discovered by man.  There is a film of mystery over this word. Possibly because, in  the category of raw materials created by nature, it has occupied  a special place. Nowhere else in the world has anyone found  another product (with the same chemical and physical properties)  that could be as suitable for the role of universal equivalent,  as a single gauge of values. Incidentally, all this is well  known.    Our Republic during the Soviet era was in the second or  third  place in the Union with respect to the amount of the currency  metal that was being extracted. That, to a rather large degree,  determined our Republic's weight and role.    Then independence came. And it brought with it new problems.  It is well known that foreign investments can help to build an  economically strong country.. We have political stability and  civil peace. For a foreign investor these are very important  factors. But he would prefer to invest his capital and provide  credit if he is also given the guarantee that his capital is  backed up by currency gold.    Nature has bestowed on us abundant gold-bearing ore.  "Uzbekistan occupies eighth place in the world with regard to  the overall volume of gold production and fifth place with  regard to production per capita of population," Republic  President I. A. Karimov said in his statement at the 4th Session  of the Forum-Fund International Economic Organization in  Switzerland in June 1993. "Thirty deposits have been discovered  in the country, and their total reserves exceed 4000 tons... The  quality of Uzbek gold corresponds to the highest world standards  and, over a 20-year period, no claims were made against it.  During the past two years it has been awarded three  international quality prizes."    The extraction of gold and other precious and nonferrous  metals is primarily a mining process. The ore specialists have  been aided by science and by the technology with which  Uzbekistan's mining industry has been abundantly equipped. The  basis of the gold-mining branch is made up of the mines with  shafts, quarries, and concentration plants. Their output is  industrial concentrate with a large content of precious metals,  from which high-grade gold and silver are produced at mining and  metallurgical combines (Navoi and Almalyk).  <H5>  Happy Birthday, Association! </H5>   After the well-known 21 January 1994 edict of the Republic  president, the State Committee for Precious Metals became the  Association for Mining Gold and Processing Diamonds. Its short  name is Uzalmazzoloto. At a meeting of the founders in April,  the chairman of the association's board was elected. That  chairman is 46-year-old Shavkat Nazhimov, who previously headed  the state committee. He began his career in the gold-mining  industry as a foreman at a concentration plant.    Our leading, strategic branches are managed by a firm state  hand. Acting as the chief state instrument for management in the  gold-mining industry are the fixed prices that are established  for precious metals. The world price of one gram of gold today  is U.S. $12.    Sh. Nazhimov says, "The state pays us only part of this. We  take an attentive attitude toward this temporarily enforced  measure: times are difficult for the Republic and it is  necessary to provide for the social program..."    The higher administrative levels are considering the  question  of increasing the payment for the gold miners' output, but, as  they themselves feel, the size of that payment must outstrip the  inflation level. Otherwise it will be impossible to pay back the  production expenses, or to replenish the mining capacities that  are being depleted. Because the mining of precious metals must  increase.    Mining is the "eating up" of the mineral resources. It is  active contact with the environment.    It is no secret that in previous years we took the attitude  toward the protection of the environment as being of secondary  importance. Today the situation is changing. We have come to the  realization that technology that is ecological tested or that is  free of waste products (in almost every branch) means that that  technology is also the most economical one in the final  analysis. In the mining industry, destruction and waste products  are unavoidable. If a ton of ore contains 3-5 grams of gold (and  this is considered to be rather good content), then it is easy  to imagine what mountains of ore have to be processed in order  to extract from that ore hundreds of tons of the precious metal.    Today science, technology, and the environmental protection  services are struggling to resolve the problem of these tailings  -- artificial mountains. A large amount of money is being  expended. We shall discuss a little while later how this should  be done from the start in the best way -- both for the  environment and for the economy.    Have you noticed that the association's name includes the  word "diamond"? Didn't it surprise you to learn that we have  this valuable stone here, although its homeland is the Urals and  Yakutia?    This "raw material" for the manufacture of diamonds is  delivered to the Almaz Plant in Burchmulla by the Russian  Committee for Precious Metals. The hands of the local expert  craftspeople who at one time studied at related enterprises  manufacture two types of precious stones -- 17-faceted and  57-faceted diamonds. The finished articles -- and the largest  weigh as much as one carat, 0.2 grams -- are sent back to where  the raw material came from.    Plant director Rustoy Ziyavidinov discusses his people very  warmly: "These expert craftspeople with astonishing hands love  their work very much." First the diamonds go to the markers and  cutters. It is necessary to discern in the small shining stone a  future diamond, and to "design" it correctly. Subsequently they  go to the grinders and polishers. It is delicate work. The work  ends with the facet-cutter.    There is also a shop for processing fianity  --semiprecious stones from the Urals. In addition, the plant  manufactures gold-plated teaspoons, engagement rings, sewn  garments, sets of kitchen knives...    The shops at the Almaz Plant have been set up in the  repaired  facilities of the former mining and concentration combine which,  during the war years and subsequently, used to mine arsenic.  Tailings that have accumulated are also situated on the  territory of the form bismuth Ustasaray Mine. There are a lot of  tailings. For a long time ecologists have been demanding that  they be carefully buried and rendered harmless, inasmuch as the  poisonous substances are located on slopes above the Charvak  Reservoir. Both the plant and association administrators  understand the seriousness of this problem and intend to resolve  it by the end of the current year.    The past frequently looks at us with loathsome ecological  sores. They were created by us. And we are also the ones who  should heal them.  <H5>  The Ecology and the Economy Should Go Hand in Hand </H5>   People's present needs must be satisfied without any  detriment to future generations. That idea arose under the  influence primarily of ecology. Ecologists attempt to correct  the errors of the past and to look into the future. Economists,  as a rule, are interested in increasing the immediate profits.  Bringing them closer together contains the key to resolving many  problems.    Does there exist in the gold mining branch any experience  when ecological priorities guarantee the achievement of high  economic results? I was told at the association that for a long  time we have known about the existence of this kind of  experience, but we were not able to acquaint ourselves with it  first-hand until we flew last year to... the United States.    Sh. Nazhimov headed the delegation, which also included N.  Namazayev, the leader of the association's science group; T.  Igrashev, chairman of the oblast environmental protection  committee; and A. Yemelyanov, chief geologist at the Angren  Mine. They visited a private gold mining company. It is a small  one that mines 13 kilograms of gold a year.    Our specialists saw progressive technology for extracting  the  precious metal from the ore. They saw a strong and very  authoritative ecological service, the precise organization of  labor, and high working efficiency. In a couple of days all this  was perceived as something completely obvious. But there were  things that made a staggering impression.    Just imagine being shown pleasant-looking slopes, hills  overgrown with grass and little trees, and being told that just  a few months ago there had been a quarry here, where operations  with explosives used to be carried out, and where a road used to  wind over the slopes... But where are even the slightest traces  of this? There is nothing. All one can see is the primordial  natural beauty, recreated by man with surprising diligence and  with love. Even the little trees had returned to the places  where they were born. It was fantastic!    What is this, then? The greatest patriotism? The strict and  respectful observance of environmental protection laws? Or is it  simply something that is economically beneficial for them?  Apparently it is all of these things, taken together. They have  fused together and given rise to standards of everyday existence.    Of course we shall not idealize everything that our people  saw in America. That country also has a large number of  ecological problems. But, objectively speaking, the people there  were earlier in recognizing the seriousness of those problems  and began to engage seriously in resolving them.    The second thing that could not fail to surprise our  delegation was the poverty of the gold-bearing ores from which  their colleagues extract the precious metal. Half a gram in a  ton of ore? In our country that is the same amount of the  precious metal that exists in the tailings.    One gram of gold costs the company $8. It sells the gold to  the state at $12 (the world price). The remaining $4 are  completely sufficient for reproduction, for new technology, and,  of course, for providing the people with a good life. And  necessarily one dollar out of the $4 will go into the protection  of the environment. That's a lavish amount! We spend only a  tiny fraction of that amount for those purposes.    The association -- this new structure -- will have to  assimilate qualitatively new steps in environmental protection  work. It must do so. Proceeding along this road is difficult,  because the past has left us a "rich inheritance." Almost 15  million tons of tailings. In addition, more than 50 million  cubic meters of rock overburden have accumulated. Almost 1700  hectares of land has been destroyed in the mountainous and  foothill rayons. It will be necessary to recultivate several  quarries.    But, no, everything is not really that gloomy. Interesting  experience also exists at the Angren Gold Mine, where the best  ecological results have been achieved and where the output  produced is cheaper than anywhere else.    Last year the concentration plant that is situated here held  a housewarming party on the occasion of the introduction of  ecologically effective and highly productive equipment. The  people at the enterprise have attempted to do the maximum to  assure that no more ecological problems will develop in the  future. And the intention is that that principle, which is  based on the improvement of the technology and of the  environmental protection service, will be introduced everywhere  at the association's enterprises. It is for these purposes that  a program for the ecological rejuvenation and technical  improvement of the enterprises by the year 1997 has been  prepared. It is planned to improve the process of secondary  extraction of gold and silver from substandard ores and  overburden, and that means additional kilograms and tons of  precious metals. It is also planned to obtain building materials  (crushed rock, sand, silicate and clay bricks) from waste  products, and also to carry out secondary extraction of  side-produced nonferrous metals -- lead, copper, zinc. Certain  quarries and depleted deposits will be sealed up.  <H5>  Prospectors Continue To Be Esteemed </H5>   Whatever forces and capabilities of scientific-technical  progress we put our hopes on or count on, a good result in any  job invariably depends upon people's skill, knowledge,  industriousness, and devotion.    In gold mining there continue to be a rather large number of  people who have remained true to the traditions of cooperative  handicraft labor. They are the prospectors. One should not think  that these are only manual laborers with a pick and shovel.  Their strong point is their maneuverability, and sometimes also  their ability to extract a considerable quantity of metal at  deposits with small volumes of gold reserves. Life is difficult  for them. But the gold that they mine is cheaper for the state.    For many years a certain S. Bondarenko headed the famous  Kyzylkum Cooperative. He died two years ago. The cooperative  elected as its leader S. Aksenov, a smart miner.    The labor performed by the cooperative members is today in  demand with new force under conditions when the problems of the  material-technical support of major subdivisions have been  complicated. And those cooperative members are successfully  engaging in the mining not only of gold, but also of salt,  marble, and coal.    Prospectors... It's a good word. It is applicable to people  of any occupation who put their heart and soul into their work.  Currently we are talking about gold miners. This branch has  grown many expert workers and highly qualified specialists who  deserve to have their names known. They include N. Karabayev and  B. Dekin -- crew leaders at the Kochbulak Mine; S.  Khudaybergenov, chief of the Kyzylolma Mine; A. Mirzayev, chief  of the Angren Gold-Extracting Factory; N. Sannibayev, crew  leader at the Zarmitan Mine; and many others.    When we have more people like this, society will be richer,  and it will have more of all kinds of valuables, including, of  course, gold.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CYPRUS;  </P> <P> SPRING BIRD HUNT WON'T BE BANNED  </P> <P> The Cypriot government approved continuation of its spring hunting season, the  last in Europe, despite strong opposition from environmental groups.  </P> <P> In announcing the season, which began Sunday, Interior Ministry game department  chief Costas Papamichael rejected charges that the season amounts to a  slaughter. He insisted that hunters "are very lucky if they get two birds and  are normally quite satisfied with that." Environmental groups oppose the spring  hunting because it falls during the breeding season of migratory birds.  </P></p>

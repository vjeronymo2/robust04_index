According to a well-informed source, Russia's Choice,  Communists, Agrarians and Liberal Democrats are ready to agree  on a speaker to represent one of the smaller groups --  Yavlinskiy's bloc or the Women of Russia -- on condition that  his or her four deputies represent their four biggest groups.    Communists favor a strong, not decorative speaker as well as  the formation of a leading body such as a council of the Duma.    According to the source, the four biggest groups are also  discussing the formation of parliamentary committees. Russia's  Choice is claiming leading posts in two or three (economic)  committees, Liberal Democrats in the international affairs  committee, Communists in defense and security committees,  agrarians in committees on agriculture, constitutional  legislation and legal reform.    A former member of the Supreme Soviet and a representative  of  the Agrarian Party Vladimir Isakov intends to head the latter  committee.</p>

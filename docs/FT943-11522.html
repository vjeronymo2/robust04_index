			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Larger stake in Spanish sugar firm sought Mr Jose Mara Amusategui, chairman of Banco Central Hispano, has received 'clear offers' from the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle and from Generale Sucriere, the sugar group controlled by Saint-Louis of France, to buy into General Azucacera, Spain's second-biggest sugar company, writes Tom Burns. The French and UK producers indirectly share a 21.3 per cent stake in Azucacera, and are seeking to acquire 10 per cent each of BCH's stake. BCH has a 47 per cent stake. Mr Amusategui is interested in such a disposal. However, he warned that the government was concerned at the prospect of the company, which has a 22.5 per cent share of the domestic sugar market, falling into foreign hands. 'It is a very political issue because of the EU's sugar quota regulations,' said the BCH chairman, 'and it is all the more sensitive because of the large numbers of sugar beet farmers involved who supply Azucacera.' 'I think (the disposal) will go through after the summer,' he said. The bank's stake in the sugar producer is capitalised at about Pta20.5bn (Dollars 157.5m).</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Market breather Foreign exchange markets ended the year on a quiet note yesterday as traders took to the sidelines after a surprisingly busy week, writes Philip Gawith. There was little price volatility compared to the previous days which had seen sharp movements in the dollar, Mexican peso, lira, peseta and franc. Trading desks were very lightly staffed. European trading effectively finished at lunchtime, and New York desks were not planning to open in the afternoon. Despite the thin trading conditions, the dollar was completely unmoved by the release of November home sales figures, and the Chicago purchasing managers index. It closed barely changed in London at DM1.55 and Y99.77. In the UK sterling had a solid day, with the trade weighted index finishing at 79.7, from 79.6. The pound broke through DM2.42 again to close at DM2.425, from DM2.4183. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.25bn money market shortage at established rates. In early Mexican trading the peso was unchanged at 4.85/5.00 pesos to the dollar. Traders said the announcement on Thursday by President Ernesto Zedillo of an economic emergency plan had not affected the market as he had not offered full details. The three European currencies that have been weak recently all made up some ground yesterday against the D-Mark. The lira finished at L1,047 from L1,049, the franc at FFr3.433, from FFr3.455, and the peseta at Pta 84.91, from Pta 85.15. Holders of these currencies received something to cheer about from the 1995 global economic and financial market survey conducted by IDEA, the financial analysis service. This found that the median forecasts, at the end of 1995, were L1,010, FFr3.42 and Pta 84 - in each case a strengthening from current levels. The corollary of weaker currencies has been a deterioration of interest rate sentiment, with markets anticipating the need for higher rates to bolster weakening currencies. The past week saw the March PIBOR and Eurolira contracts respectively lose around 23 and 13 basis points. These moves have been accentuated by the increasing conviction that the next move in German rates will be up, reflected in the recent fall in Euromark futures prices. This conviction was bolstered by the hawkish tone of comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, in the Handelsblatt newspaper. He said a strong D-Mark was necessary to remedy the economy's structural problems, and that structural change would not be assisted by a loose monetary policy. But Mr Brian Durrant, economist at brokers GNI, cautioned: 'One should watch what the Bundesbank do as opposed to what they say ..the Bundesbank like to keep some speculation alive in the markets that interest rates have the scope to go either way at this stage in the economic cycle.' Mr Steven Bell, economist at Morgan Grenfell, has produced some interesting research on sterling. He finds that the two years 1993-4 exhibited the lowest degree of sterling volatility in any two year period in the floating exchange rate era. Also, short term interest rates were also unusually stable, with their volatility the lowest in over 20 years. Mr Bell has no ready explanation, save to say that there is no simple relationship between financial variables and exchange rate stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Studying Persistently and </F> Profoundly and Applying What Has Been Studied To Practice--On  Further Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping"]    [Text] The fourth theoretical study course on Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping sponsored by the  party Central Committee for principal leading cadres at the  provincial and ministerial levels has ended. So far, all  incumbent principal leading cadres at the provincial and  ministerial levels throughout the country have attended the  study course once. Study classes and training courses on Volume  III of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping are being  held in various parts of the country as scheduled. Taken as a  whole, the situation in previous studies was good and the  achievements gratifying. Leading cadres at all levels,  particularly those at the county sectional level or above,  should continue to exert themselves and seize the opportunity to  persistently and profoundly study Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping and apply what has been studied to  practice in order to raise this study to a new level along with  the improvement of the entire party's ideology and theory.    "Persistently" means that we must persist in studying  Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's works for a long period. Leading cadres should  not think that they can relax because they have attended the  study course, have read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works once,  twice, or three times, and have understood the main contents.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works are simple and easy to read and  most leading cadres can understand them, but it is not easy to  master their basic principles or apply them. This requires  persistent efforts. Of course, unlike the "study course," they  cannot spend too much time on their studies because they are  busy with daily affairs, therefore, they should be good at  fitting in time for their studies. It is necessary to work out a  feasible plan to combine concentrated study with daily study,  and collective study with individual study. All leading cadres,  particularly high-level cadres, should put the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping on their desks and regard his works  as "mottoes." Whenever they come across problems, they should  read his works. If they persist in doing this and form such  habits, they will benefit a lot from it.    "Profoundly" means that we should not stop after getting a  little knowledge but should continue to make arduous and  profound efforts to master the essence and scientific system of  Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. It is necessary, through a period of study, to  understand the main contents of the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, the questions expounded by Comrade  Xiaoping in different periods, his views on certain questions,  his remarks in different periods, and so on. But this is only  the "way" to the "hall and room," and we should move forward  along this "way" and try to thoroughly understand the two major  issues of contemporary China and contemporary China's Marxism by  taking all problems in reform and development into account. The  process of profoundly studying Comrade Xiaoping's theory is a  process of his theory permeating our minds and a process of  using the essence and scientific system of his theory to arm our  minds. Thus, while repeatedly studying the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping, we are required to use his works as  standards to measure ourselves and as guidance to sum up our  work. In this way, we will improve our understanding, have a  good idea of the overall situation, uphold what is correct,  overcome what is wrong, rectify what is one sided, and really  arrive at profoundness.    Applying what has been studied is the fundamental aim of  persistent and profound study and is also a basic method of  studying theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "It is  necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it; the sole  purpose of mastering it is to apply it." Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is  contemporary China's Marxism. The sole purpose of mastering  this theory is to use it to analyze and resolve major problems  in China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. In  applying what has been learned, we must make earnest efforts.  In the course of establishing the socialist market economic  structure this year, a number of major reform measures have been  introduced. The current reform is like "storming heavily  fortified positions," during which many new problems and new  situations must be properly understood and resolved. We may say  that practice is urgently calling theory for help; thus, there  is a vast field for theory to be applied to. Now, the most  important thing is to make contributions to serving the major  aspects of the situation. The major aspect of the party's and  country's work for this year is to seize the opportunity to  deepen reform, expand the scope of opening up, promote  development, and maintain stability. The key issue is to  properly handle the relationship between reform, development,  and stability. This basic principle of the party Central  Committee is the result of using Comrade Xiaoping's theory to  comprehensively analyze and correctly judge the present  international and domestic situation and is the outcome of  combining theory with practice. Leading cadres at all levels  should use Comrade Xiaoping's theory as guidance in deepening  their understanding of the overall situation and enhancing their  consciousness and determination to implement the "20-character  principle." In localities, departments, and units under their  leadership, they should creatively proceed with their work and  make practical contributions to promoting reform, development,  and stability.    Persistently paying attention to leading cadres' theoretical  studies is a "key project" of "arming cadres with a scientific  theory" and is also the key to making a success of the entire  party's studies. Party committees at all levels should  conscientiously sum up their previous experience and do a better  job of this major issue of fundamental and long-term  significance.</p>

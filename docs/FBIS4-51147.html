			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States has  proposed that an additional five areas of trade be upgraded to  "priority" sectors for the bilateral trade framework talks which  are to be resumed between it and Japan.    The KYODO NEWS SERVICE today quoted Japanese Government  sources as saying that the U.S. Government has suggested that  financial services, glass, intellectual property, lumber, and  antitrust policy and deregulation be added to the list of  priority areas for negotiations.    Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging  framework  are government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment, insurance, and auto parts.    The sources were quoted as saying that the Japanese  Government will basically accept the U.S. proposals apart from  the lumber sector.    KYODO said the proposal was made during vice  ministerial-level discussions in Washington which led to the  breakthrough in the framework talks following a three-month  stalemate.    The trade framework negotiations were agreed upon last July  as a means of cutting Japan's swelling trade surplus with the  United States, but hit a snag in February this year due to a  discord over a U.S. demand for "objective criteria" to measure  the opening of Japan's market to foreign imports.    Meanwhile, Japan's Ambassador to the United States Takakazu  Kuriyama said his country needed to take steps to significantly  reduce its politically sensitive current account surplus and  implement a market-opening package to successfully conclude the  bilateral trade talks.    Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the  upcoming visit to the United States by Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko, made the statement at a press conference at the  Foreign Ministry.    He said Tokyo and Washington agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks because both sides shared the view that it is  undesirable to keep tense economic and trade relations  "drifting" since that would hurt overall bilateral relations.    He added that the two countries also reached the accord  because it deepened understanding about each other's positions  on the trade talks.</p>

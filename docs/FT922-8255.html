			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / People: Bystram - food for thought at Adas Adas, the government's Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, has appointed as chairman Charles Bystram, a director of Stakis. The 62-year-old Bystram brings substantial food industry experience to Adas; he was chairman of Geest and before that a director of United Biscuits. He will help guide the transition of the former government department into a commercial business - Adas became an independent executive agency last month. Chief executive Julia Walsh says: 'It's vital that primary producers, processors and retailers co-operate much more closely if the industry is to survive against competition from tram, Adas is nailing its colours to the mast and showing the whole industry that we mean business.' Adas was launched as an agency with a brief of providing strategic, business and technical consultancy to all involved in land-based industries - food producers, processors and retailers, farmers and growers, government ministries, planners, land-owners and leisure enterprises. Adas has 1,700 consultants and the biggest specialist R&amp;D base in the country. The chairmanship is one of three key posts which are to be filled from outside. Christopher Herring is to become finance director after six years of consultancy with Touche Ross, including work with other government agencies. The appointment of a marketing director has yet to be announced.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES TIMES;  </P> <P> 1990 ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR DOUBT WITH PERFECT SEASON  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> Suspect is the league and playoff schedule of the Santa Clara High boys'  basketball team.  </P> <P> Respect is nonetheless what the Saints earned this season after posting their  first unbeaten season in Lou Cvijanovich's 32 years as coach.  </P> <P> The reasons are many.  </P> <P> * An overwhelming 41-point nonleague win over Simi Valley, a team that went on  to win the Marmonte League co-championship and enter the Southern Section 5-AA  Division playoffs with a 17-8 record.  </P> <P> * A 16-point victory over Santa Barbara, a team that went on to win the Channel  League co-championship and enter the 5-A playoffs with a 20-6 record.  </P> <P> * A 23-point average margin of victory -- a spread that climbed to 24 in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> * A 52-game Frontier League winning streak that began in 1984 and a 45-game  overall streak that includes a 28-0 record this season.  </P> <P> * Shon Tarver, Santa Clara's All-American guard, was rivaled only by Artesia's  Ed O'Bannon as the best player in Southern California.  </P> <P> * Finally, Cvijanovich has been acknowledged as the county's premier coach for  more than three decades. This season Cvijanovich, 63, won his 11th Southern  Section basketball championship (he also has won two in football and one in  baseball) and second consecutive state title.  </P> <P> That the latest titles came in the Southern Section 2-AA and state Division IV  does not diminish the accomplishments in the opinion of Santa Clara's boosters.  </P> <P> Indicative of the program's success, they point out, is that four starters  graduated from last year's team yet this year's group posted a better record.  </P> <P> "People said they didn't think we'd even win the league," said Tarver, who  joins Bruce Howarth as Santa Clara's representatives on The Times' All-Ventura  County team. "They said all we had was me. I totally disagree. When we hear  those kind of things, I'm glad they said it just so we could prove them wrong."  </P> <P> Don't expect too much of a decline next season, despite the loss of Tarver and  fellow starters Howarth and Anthony Zuiraitis. Starting forwards Anthony  Maestes, a junior, and Chris Cole, a sophomore, return along with sixth man  Steve Amar, a sophomore.  </P> <P> Although Cvijanovich said a year ago that "I'll coach until I drop dead," he  has been cautioned by his physician that arthritic knees might force him to  retire. The coach intends to continue as long as his health will allow,  however. "I'm already planning for summer league," he said.  </P> <P> Among girls' teams, Ventura again could be a team to watch next season. The  Lady Cougars, third in the Channel League, were the surprise of the county in  the playoffs, advancing to the 4-AA final before falling to Muir. Ventura won  its first Southern California regional playoff game before again falling to  Muir.  </P> <P> Coach Glenn Gray is excited about next year's team. Guards Cori Herman, a  member of this year's 10-player all-county first team, and Denise Rea, a  second-team selection, will be back along with forward Andrea Williams.  </P> <P> As always, Buena will be a Channel League favorite under Coach Joe Vaughan. The  Bulldogs were 26-0 this season before falling to Hart in the 5-A championship  game.  </P> <P> First-team players, their coaches and parents are invited to The Times'  basketball awards brunch, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton.  Winners of awards for coach of the year and player of the year will be  announced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLAYER PROFILES  </P> <P> Steve Carnes: A three-year varsity player at Simi Valley who was the last link  to the Don MacLean era, Carnes played a key role as the Pioneers tied for the  Marmonte League championship, the fifth year in a row they have either won or  shared the title. Carnes, a guard, led Simi Valley in scoring (16.9) and  assists (5.8) and he also averaged 4.0 rebounds.  </P> <P> David Harbour: A two-time All-Ventura County choice, the left-handed Harbour  was a scoring machine, leading Camarillo with an average of 26.8 points and  setting a single-game school record with 50. Harbour, an intense and  intelligent guard who excels at every phase of the game, also led the Scorpions  in rebounds (7.2) and assists (4.4).  </P> <P> Bruce Howarth: A bench-warmer a year ago, Howarth emerged as another in a long  line of hard-nosed Santa Clara point guards. Howarth, who led the Saints with  7.3 assists, controlled the offensive tempo, rarely committed turnovers and was  a fierce defender. He also complemented Shon Tarver, the Saints' All-American  off-guard.  </P> <P> Chris Loll: A left-handed shooter with a feathery touch, Loll did more than  score, leading Thousand Oaks in rebounds (7.1), assists (3.0), steals (1.4) and  blocked shots (1.8). Loll, a forward who also led the Lancers in scoring  (15.6), made a game-winning field goal in an upset of Westlake and the decisive  free throws in an upset of Royal.  </P> <P> Russell Myers: A physical forward whose quick first step enables him to  penetrate defenses, Myers led Royal to a share of its first Marmonte League  title since 1971. Myers, who overcame an early-season bout with mononucleosis  to average 24.3 points and 5.9 rebounds, scored a school-record 45 points in  one game.  </P> <P> Jeff Oliver: A two-time All-Ventura County selection, Oliver tied MacLean's  single-game county scoring record with a 52-point effort against Loyola.  Oliver, a guard who will attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, was second in the  county in scoring with 28.4 points a game. He also led Buena in assists (6.7  avg.).  </P> <P> Mike Spears: A dominant force at center, Spears was the leading rebounder in  the county (12.2 avg.). Spears, who set Hueneme records for rebounds in a  career and in a season, also averaged a school-record 3.7 blocked shots.  Opponents routinely double-teamed Spears, yet he still managed to average 18.1  points.  </P> <P> Shon Tarver: An All-American and two-time state Division IV Player of the Year,  Tarver is said by many to be the finest player to come out of Ventura County.  Tarver, a guard, led Santa Clara to an unbeaten season and a second consecutive  Division IV championship by averaging 9.2 rebounds and a county-high 31.6  points and 4.0 blocked shots.  </P> <P> Eric Thomas: A three-time All-Ventura County player, Thomas led Rio Mesa to the  third round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs this season. Thomas, a forward  who will attend New Mexico, averaged a team-high 20.4 points, 9.3 rebounds and  2.5 blocked shots a game. Thomas is the only four-time All-Channel League  selection.  </P> <P> Mike Wawryk: A strong leader as well as an intimidating force at center, Wawryk  led Simi Valley in rebounding (8.3) and was second on the team in scoring. Simi  Valley won a share of the Marmonte League title largely because Wawryk emerged  as the league's most dominant inside player.  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> Susanne Carey: One of only two 6-footers on the All-Ventura County team, Carey  made a successful transition from center to shooting guard. Carey, who will  attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, averaged 13.6 rebounds and 15.6 points in  helping St. Bonaventure win the Tri-Valley League championship.  </P> <P> Nicole Ellis: The Buena center showed tremendous dedication in coming back from  a severe knee injury that sidelined her most of last season. Ellis led the  Bulldogs, who reached the Southern Section 5-A final, in rebounding (8.2) and  blocked shots (1.8).  </P> <P> Melissa Gische: An intelligent and versatile player, Gische averaged 16.7  points and 8.4 rebounds a game in helping Westlake take a share of the Marmonte  League championship. Gische, a forward, is a deadly perimeter shooter.  </P> <P> Cori Herman: Ventura enjoyed a Cinderella season, advancing to the Southern  Section 4-AA final and winning a state regional game, largely because of the  play of Herman. The savvy guard led the team in scoring (16.8) and rebounding  (6.8).  </P> <P> Dani O'Byrne: An excellent ball-handler and defensive player, O'Byrne also led  Westlake in scoring (17.1) and assists (4.3). Alternating between guard and  forward, O'Byrne was assigned to cover each opponent's top offensive threat.  </P> <P> Mia Palkie: An unselfish player who fits nicely into Buena's team concept,  Palkie has just scratched her potential. Palkie, a forward, averaged 11.4  points and 5.5 rebounds in helping the Bulldogs begin the season with 26 wins  in a row.  </P> <P> Michelle Palmisano: A player with tremendous scoring range, Palmisano was the  leading scorer in the county with a 29.6 average. The Thousand Oaks guard, who  also had 262 rebounds and 122 assists, will be watched closely by Division I  schools over the next two seasons.  </P> <P> Sal Tauau: The county's most dominant force in the key, Tauau led Channel  Islands to a share of the Marmonte League championship. Tauau, a physically  imposing 6-foot center, averaged 12.5 rebounds, 11.2 points and 2.8 assists.  </P> <P> Nichole Victoria: At 5-6 the shortest player on the All-Ventura County team,  Victoria is also the most prolific scorer in county history with a career total  of 1,927 points. Victoria averaged 22.8 points, 6.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists  for Camarillo this season.  </P> <P> Edith Young: In Coach Callie Gibson's last season, Hueneme posted a 14-11  record largely because of the expert ballhandling and defense of Young. The  point guard averaged 13.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.2 assists a game.  </P> <P> 1990 ALL-STARS  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY  </P> <P> PREP BOYS TEAM  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Steve Carnes  </P> <P>

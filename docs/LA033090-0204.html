			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN QUENTIN WARDEN VIEWS GRIM DUTY WITH EQUANIMITY  </P> <P> Like many lifers who pass through one of California's most notorious prisons,  Dan Vasquez grew up tough in a poor Southern California neighborhood, joined a  gang and dropped out of high school.  </P> <P> But the stocky, rough-talking Vasquez is not behind the bars of San Quentin. He  is in charge. And as the prison's warden, he is preparing to direct the  scheduled execution Tuesday of Robert Alton Harris, which would be the first in  California since 1967.  </P> <P> "I'm not a ghoulish person. I'm not relishing that upcoming, potentially  upcoming, execution," Vasquez said. "But I know what my job is. I know I have  to carry out the responsibilities of my job."  </P> <P> Vasquez's views on crime and justice were honed in the Redlands barrio where he  grew up, as well as in the state correctional system, where he started his  career a quarter-century ago as a guard at the prison in Chino.  </P> <P> A likeness of San Quentin is forged on his belt buckle. On the back of his hand  are his initials, tattooed in the ragged style of the streets. He keeps it as  "a reminder of the old days."  </P> <P> "Some people make decisions in life that they can never, never change again,"  said Vasquez, 46. "Fortunately, I hadn't made that type."  </P> <P> When he discusses the death penalty, his words are not the slick slogans of a  politician, or the fine and silvery arguments of an attorney. He is at the  "business end" of the ultimate sanction a state can impose.  </P> <P> Under the procedure he revised when he arrived as warden in 1984, Vasquez must  order that his officers place the prisoner in the gas chamber. Then he will  signal one of them to lower the lever immersing cyanide pellets in acid, thus  forming deadly gas.  </P> <P> "I don't have any personal or moral conflict over it. I don't. I'm fortunate,"  he said. Then, as if anticipating that some death penalty abolitionist might  call his attitude shallow or callous, he said, "I think I'm just as much a deep  thinker as the next person."  </P> <P> Each day, Vasquez drives past protesters who have been keeping a vigil outside  San Quentin since Harris' execution date was set two months ago. The warden  wonders about their priorities.  </P> <P> Referring to the murders for which Harris was sentenced to death, Vasquez said,  "How quickly they forgot the crime that was committed against two young people,  two 16-year-old kids."  </P> <P> Vasquez knows that if he didn't have a bit of luck, concerned parents and  occasional help from a teacher or probation officer, he might have ended up a  San Quentin inmate. As a teen-age gang member, he "was getting into a lot of  trouble," he said.  </P> <P> The Army was his way out. In the service, he received a high school diploma.  The Army trained him to become a police officer. Upon his discharge in the  mid-1960s, he tried to join police departments in Southern California. But at  just under 5-foot-8, he failed to meet the restrictive minimum height  requirements then in place for the departments. He was, however, accepted as a  correctional officer at Chino.  </P> <P> As he worked his way up, he went to college, became a parole officer, and  returned to the prisons as an agent investigating prison gangs. In the late  1970s, he became an administrator, rising to deputy superintendent at Soledad  state prison.  </P> <P> Then the call came to run San Quentin. In corrections, the job of warden at San  Quentin "is prestigious," said James Park, San Quentin associate warden from  1964 to 1972 and now a consultant to the joint legislative committee on prison  construction. "It is still the prison in California."  </P> <P> The prison Vasquez took over was in sad shape. Stabbings were common. With  1,750 prisoners in maximum custody, San Quentin had more high-security inmates  than any prison in the country. State and federal judges had deemed conditions  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, under court oversight that continues, the state spent $35 million  to renovate the prison and moved high-security prisoners to newer institutions.  Still, violence flares. Even as Vasquez spoke to The Times recently, officers  were investigating a homicide.  </P> <P> Vasquez has not gotten to know the man most likely to die next in the gas  chamber. He has no desire to do so. He did, however, take it upon himself to  tell Harris when the inmate's execution date was set in February. He tried to  get Harris to think about final details, such as how his belongings should be  disposed of, and what should be done with his body.  </P> <P> "He was understandably shaken," Vasquez said. "The warden was there with a  death warrant."  </P> <P> Vasquez has thought hard about the mechanics of a state killing. He has tested  the gas chamber and has visited Southern states to see how they carry out  executions.  </P> <P> But he does not see himself as an executioner. "If you want to talk about an  executioner," he said, "you better make arrangements to talk to Robert Alton  Harris because he is a self-appointed executioner. I am not and none of my  staff is."  </P></p>

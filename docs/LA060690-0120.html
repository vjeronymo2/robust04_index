			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> MAN FINDS BOX OF EXPLOSIVES IN GARAGE  </P> <P> A 73-year-old man found a box full of homemade "firecracker-size" explosives in  his garage and drove them to the police station, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Police on Monday afternoon roped off Katella Avenue in front of the station  while investigators from the Orange County Hazardous Devices Squad disarmed the  small explosives, Police Sgt. Ron Lesovsky said.  </P> <P> "There really wasn't much danger, but we wanted to be sure," Lesovsky said. He  added, however, that the devices "had the potential" to cause harm if  detonated.  </P> <P> The explosives were made with black powder poured into little glass jars with  paper wicks sticking out of them, Lesovsky said.  </P> <P> The man, whom police declined to identify, said he found the box in his garage  and believed that the explosives were made by his 17-year-old grandson who now  lives in Texas.  </P> <P> "We're not about to go to Texas and get him for this," Lesovsky said.  </P> <P> The man had originally reported the theft of black powder, which he used for  reloading ammunition, in May, 1989, Lesovsky said.

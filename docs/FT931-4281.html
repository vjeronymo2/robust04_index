			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (5): A finger on the pulse - Instant analysis, How custom-built software links project information, including materials and complex labour schedules, into an accounting system / Case study of The Welding Institute IT IS rare to find an organisation like the Welding Institute which can justify creating its own custom-built project management system. TWI is itself one big project, a private limited company and non-profit-making organisation which specialises in research on welding and joining materials. It was formed by international collaboration between such manufacturers as Shell, BA, Jaguar, and the Royal Ordnance. TWI organises between 600 and 700 separate consulting projects annually, including work for international research projects (Eureka, Esprit) and the Department of Trade and Industry. Its turnover of Pounds 18m comes largely from project sponsorship, through its member companies, and partly through fixed-price contracts. Of a staff of 420, there are over 200 professional scientists, engineers, material scientists, and mathematicians who are likely to be involved in a number of projects at any one time, and need to do a great deal of reporting-back. People who might be world experts in their field are managing four or five projects at once. The fixed-price nature of the projects makes time-accounting important, and Ian Smith, commercial manager, makes a useful between project management and project control. 'It's a matter of size. If one person can keep the whole picture of the project in his head, and simply need a picture of costs that are mounting up, that's part of project control. That includes telling the client what you're doing, proposals, instructions, contracts, costing and estimating,' says Ian Smith. 'There's a need for weekly feedback on costs, but only one person might know about technical progress. Project management is what is needed for things like NASA's space shuttle, which is simply too big for one person to keep control, or keep tabs on contractors. 'The present batch of products on the marketplace is really designed for projects such as building the Channel Tunnel, where the problem is scheduling certain resources at a certain point, at a particular time.' In 1990, TWI was unable to find anything ready-made to manage project cash as well as project scheduling. For smaller project work, individual TWI researchers use Superproject Expert from Computer Associates. But TWI wanted something which would link all project-costing information, including materials, labour and so on, into an accounting system. There was a need to provide information for use outside TWI as well as inside - 'one of our functions is to act as a centre for all our members. We're geared up to showing people exactly what we're doing,' says Ian Smith. CMG (Computer Management Group) won a competitive tender to provide the CMG: Fact2000 accounting suite, plus a custom-built project-costing system, written using the Oracle database. The Project Control and Costing system feeds information such as purchase orders for materials for a specific project automatically through to Fact2000. This enables TWI to account by project. The system runs on a Prime EXL under SCO Unix, supporting two dozen or so users, and is also being put onto an IBM PS/2. The entire installation, including hardware, package, consultancy and the custom-built project management module, carried a Pounds 100,000 price tag. It was the analysis of instant information that was lacking from the Fortran-built database which Mr Smith had previously built for his own in-house use. This provided a useful prototype in commissioning the CMG system. Since its implementation, Mr Smith has written his own little 'management summary system' using summary reports to analyse various aspects of the project work. He also makes great use of ad hoc reports, and uses files of data to analyse further using Lotus 1-2-3. Choosing a partner was a matter of 'feeling comfortable' with the developer, says Mr Smith. The system has now become a joint venture between CMG and TWI, so that TWI receives royalty benefits. The system has also had wider benefits, he says - 'if you think of everything as a project, including administrative events like sickness and holidays, everything becomes easy, because you always have your finger on the pulse.' ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS Project Control and Costing System This product was a bespoke development for TWI in 1991. Project costs are monitored against budget for a wide variety of research and development projects. The project costs are automatically updated from the input of purchase order details, time sheets and expenses. The system integrates with CMG's Fact2000 financial and accounting package and with third party software products, such as Lotus 1-2-3. Suppliers: CMG Computer Management Group, a UK company owned 96 per cent by employees: the remainder of investment is by Midland Montagu Ventures. The company has 1,700 employees of whom 80 per cent own shares; there are 600 employees in UK. Turnover: Pounds 103m with Pounds 9.1 profit in 1991, Pounds 96m with Pounds 8.6m profit in 1990. Number of users: one in the UK. Price: around Pounds 25,000, dependent on user bespoke requirments. Hardware and operating systems: Open Systems, Unix sales and support/maintenance: exclusively through CMG. Other services include implementation consultancy, bespoke development and facilities management.

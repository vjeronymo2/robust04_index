			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'INTERNAL AFFAIRS': GLOWERS, GLARES AND A PERFECTLY CAST GERE  </P> <P> Even at 40, Richard Gere has such a sensual smoothie's face -- like an evil  grown-up boy with glittering eyes and an omnipresent cheek-tweaking smile --  that he's perfect casting for the sexy bad cop in the nervous, shallow cop  thriller "Internal Affairs" (citywide).  </P> <P> Gere's role, corrupt Dennis Peck, is an LAPD street cop, high-roller and  all-around hedonist. Gere hasn't done a pure heavy like this since 1977's  "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" -- and he plays Peck with relish: a happy, sly,  sure-footed stud killing and conniving his way to the juiciest plums. Peck  wears an omnipresent cocky, intimate grin, and he's so perpetually pleased with  himself, he's such a master at pushing psychological buttons, he can talk  almost anybody into almost anything. When that fails, he turns ruthless, whips  out a gun or a choke-hold. Gere makes him a carnally hip seducer rotten with  buoyant malice and sleek, rough-trade dandyism.  </P> <P> The movie itself is another doppleganger melodrama, about cops and crooks  having interchangeable personalities. Here, the man chasing Peck -- Andy Garcia  as Internal Affairs investigator Raymond Avila -- gets so obsessed, he begins  taking on Peck's personality, turning ruthless and seductive. When Peck goes  after Avila's wife (Nancy Travis), leering and tossing around sadistic-erotic  hints like Robert Mitchum's reptilian rapist in "Cape Fear," the circle is  joined. Peck is the man who seduces everybody. When he can't, as with Avila's  Lesbian partner Amy (Laurie Metcalf), he may as well try to kill them.  </P> <P> There are all kinds of possibilities here for a classy, glossy thriller with  dark undercurrents, but the movie fumbles them. It's fitfully exciting,  erratically absorbing. But, scudded along on its smooth surfaces, you're always  aware of chances muffed and cliches embraced.  </P> <P> Strangely, director Mike Figgis, who cooked up a lurid, smoky film noir stew of  a style in "Stormy Monday," doesn't do much with Los Angeles here, even though  his cinematographer, John Alonzo, once shot "Chinatown." The streets look flat  and bright, empty and monotonous, like a stage set where everyone is waiting  for the dry ice and steam to arrive. The first half of "Affairs" seems  unusually set-bound. Then, suddenly we're deluged with car chases, murders and  double-murders.  </P> <P> The plot construction is erratic, almost as if scenarist Henry Bean had written  all the scenes, and then shuffled them -- and the ending looks like another  absurd last-minute tack-on. There's a thread here, but it develops High  Concept-style, hopping along like an amphetamine-driven kangaroo. Only a few  things hold it all together: Gere's bent villainy, an interesting jazz-rock  score by Figgis , Anthony Marinelli and Brian Banks and the movie's leitmotif  of glowering and glaring. Garcia has a drilling, killing stare that looks like  a cartoon buzzard. Metcalf tops him; she has the sullen, eye-shadow stare of a  robot grouch, programmed to humiliate. Meanwhile, Gere twinkles, smirks and  flirts, as if he wanted to get an orgy going.  </P> <P> Gere, Garcia and Metcalf are all magnetic actors and a battle of wits among  them should be fascinating. But the battle here is half-witted. By the end of  the film, Peck seems completely crazy, trying to pull off murderous stunts and  scams no one could manage, juggling so many villainous balls -- including a  murder-for-hire and complicated financial swindles -- that they're bound to  tumble.  </P> <P> What keeps things interesting are the two leads and a supporting actor or two,  like Metcalf and yeoman Richard Bradford, wasted again as a growly superior.  The story itself floats away half-way through -- leaving them all to glower and  glare, dodge cars and bullets and wait for the inevitable last-stand crisis.  Lost too is a potentially compelling theme: "Quis Custodiet" or "Who will keep  the keepers themselves?"  </P> <P> "Internal Affairs" (rated R for sex, violence, language) seems to be reaching  for something new -- and near the end, there's a moment of black lunacy during  Peck's rampage that suggests it's twisting toward nightmare comedy. But it  never cuts loose. No matter how much come-hither villainy Gere generates, or  how much envy and menace Garcia throws back at him, they're still trapped there  in that bare, empty story, waiting for the dry ice and the steam to arrive.  </P></p>

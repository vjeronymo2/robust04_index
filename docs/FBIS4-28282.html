			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- The government has begun  preparing a set of economic stabilization measures to guard  against economic confusion that may result from United Nations  sanctions against North Korea.    The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Wednesday that the  government is preparing countermeasures in the judgement that  the situation is likely to worsen rapidly after U.N. sanctions  go into effect.    An EPB source said the government had started reviewing  economic measures taken during such emergencies as the Pueblo  and Oct. 26 incidents. In January 1968, the U.S. intelligence  vessel Pueblo was seized by North Korean naval ships off Wonsan  in the East Sea, and former president Park Chung-hee was  assassinated on Oct. 26, 1979.    The source added the government measures will be determined  through consultations among concerned cabinet ministers as soon  as sanctions against Pyongyang are adopted by the United Nations.    If sanctions were imposed, economic, political and military  unease could prevail in South Korea, leading to an imbalance in  the supply and demand of daily necessities, the source  explained. This highlights the need for government measures to  ensure stable supply and demand of major items used by the  general public.    In addition, the government will take steps to clear up  uneasiness among foreign businessmen so that they do not avoid  transactions with their Korean counterparts.    The EPB official explained, "Although we have not yet  prepared detailed measures, we are studying programs minimizing  the possible economic impact following a resolution on U.N.  sanctions. We are preparing scenarios from diverse angles for  the economic situation in accordance with the degree of North  Korea's reaction to the sanctions."</p>

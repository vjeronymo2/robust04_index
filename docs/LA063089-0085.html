			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK SLOW-GROWTH LAW  </P> <P> A high-powered coalition of Pasadena community leaders and organizations,  including the Urban League and the Chamber of Commerce, has filed suit to block  a slow-growth initiative passed by voters in March.  </P> <P> The suit, filed Thursday in Pasadena Superior Court, charges that the ordinance  would restrict the housing supply, preventing low-income buyers from finding  homes. The initiative violates federal fair-housing laws, impedes interstate  commerce and conflicts with state legislation, charged attorney Carolyn  Carlburg.  </P> <P> Buoyed by a rising tide of slow-growth sentiment, Proposition 2 won approval  from 57.2% of the voters in an election that had a 10.9% turnout. Coalition  members said Tuesday that the new law excludes minorities and the poor from the  Pasadena housing market.  </P></p>

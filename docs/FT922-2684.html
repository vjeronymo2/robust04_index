			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM chairman denies obligation to MGN pensioners INVESCO MIM, the investment company which managed Pounds 50m of Mirror Group Newspapers pension funds, has no moral obligation to help pensioners harmed by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, who controlled MGN, and will not be contributing to a government-sponsored trust intended to provide compensation, chairman Lord Stevens of Ludgate said yesterday. Answering questions after the company's annual general meeting, Lord Stevens said 'My moral obligation is to shareholders.' He said that while his company followed instructions from Bishopsgate Investment Management, another Maxwell company, to loan pension fund securities, all funds were returned to MIM. 'The moral obligations belong elsewhere, not with us,' he said. Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, has said that companies which had financial dealings with Mr Maxwell and had 'profited handsomely' might feel a moral obligation to help pensioners. A writ filed in early June by the present trustees of MGN's pension scheme alleges that MIM and other fund managers should have been suspicious for more than a year before Mr Maxwell's death about the stock lending they were carrying out on BIM's behalf, and that MIM received indications that loaned stocks were being used as loan collateral. The writ also alleges that in order to return all loaned securities to MIM, BIM had to dip into other pension funds. Lord Stevens said that MIM intends to 'vigorously contest' the writ which seeks Pounds 11.3m from his firm. He said that MIM's suspicions about stock lending were not alerted by the fact that loaned securities were returned in the names of others because the Maxwell organisation was badly disorganised. Meanwhile, the company's annual report, released yesterday, shows that Lord Stevens' salary was cut by nearly 20 per cent in 1991, down to Pounds 354,000 from Pounds 441,000 in 1990.</p>

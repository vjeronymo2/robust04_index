			<p>BFN     [Text] Thirteen clergymen including bishops Vincent  Nsengiyunva [of Kigali diocese] and Joseph Ruzindana have been  killed by four soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] who  rebeled. The sad information was reported to us by our  correspondent in the Butare-Gitarama region, Wilson Ndayambaje  who was present yesterday when the political director of the  RPA, Colonel Frank Mugambage, was announcing the sad news to  journalists.    Before giving you a complete list of all the bishops and  priests who were killed, let us see first how things happened.  After the fall of Kabgayi at the hands of the RPA, 13 clergymen  who were at Kabgayi were placed under the protection of eight  soldiers of the RPA. But four of the soldiers who originate  from Gitarama, left their comrades with whom they were supposed  to ensure the security of the clergymen. They went to execute  these clergymen. When the other four soldiers learned about  this, they intervened and killed one of the rebellious soldiers  while the other three ran away. Currently, a search is being  conducted to find them and bring them to trial by a military  tribunal. According to preliminary investigations, before  evading the vigilance of their colleagues and going to  accomplish their dirty job, the four boys, all from Gitarama,  said that some of the bishops and priests had participated in  the massacres perpetrated against the soldiers' families. The  search for the three rebels continues so that they can be  arrested and transferred for trial by the RPA.    The complete list of those killed is as follows: Bishop  Vincent Nsengiyunva, Bishop Thaddee Nsengiyunva, Bishop Joseph  Ruzindana, Monseigneur (Innocent Gasabwoya), Father Rwabalinda,  Father Ndaberetse, Father Francois Murego, Father Ntamugabumwe,  Father [name indistinct] Mutabazi, Father Kayibanda, Father  Richard [name indistinct], Father Aime Uwimana and (?priest)  (Fidele Gahunzire). God be with them.</p>

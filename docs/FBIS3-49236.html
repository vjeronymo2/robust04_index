The Serb civilians reached the territory of the Bosnian serb  republic (RS) sometime in the afternoon. The RS authorities in  cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  will take charge of them.    RS government representative Branko Djokic who took part in  the talks with the Moslems arranging for the Serbs' departure  from Zenica said after the talks that the Moslems had expressed  readiness to allow some 1,300 Serbs leaving Vitez, Novi Travnik  and other central Bosnian cities under Bosnian Croat control to  pass over their territory. The possibility of a meeting of  representatives of all three warring sides in connection with  this was also mentioned.    A civil, ethnic and religious war has been raging in the  former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April 1992  between the local Moslems, Serbs (Orthodox) and Croats  (Catholic) in response to the Moslem leadership's efforts to  turn Bosnia into a Moslem-dominated unitary state.</p>

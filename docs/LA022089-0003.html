			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Colombia's leftist Patriotic Union party, in what was seen as a significant  policy change, called on rebel groups to end guerrilla activities and make  concrete peace proposals. The government insists that it will only open talks  with the rebels once they prove they are serious about seeking peace, but the  Patriotic Union and other opposition parties want talks without prior  conditions. Party President Bernardo Jaramillo said: "The guerrillas must  realize that it is not possible to achieve a military triumph in this country.  The only solution to Colombia's violence is to negotiate away from arrogant  positions and offer concessions."  </P></p>

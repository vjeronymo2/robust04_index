			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] is  sticking for the time being to its stance that the size of the  Bundeswehr should not be reduced from 370,000 men. Klaus  Kinkel, FDP chairman and FRG foreign minister, said following a  meeting of the FDP presidium in Bonn today that the government  coalition meeting tomorrow must consider whether there are no  other areas where savings could be made. At the same time, he  stressed that despite the policy document submitted on the  weekend by Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, a "whole host  of issues" remains open.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Reports about terror and horror perpetrated by  uncontrolled armed gangs are still arriving from Rwanda.  [passage omitted] Belgian soldiers will leave Rwanda tomorrow,  19 April, and it is feared that the massacres will continue.    [Begin recording] [Special correspondent Angeles Bandres] At  Kigali Airport, an airport turned into a camp, Belgian,  Pakistani, and Bangladeshi Blue Helmets mount guard. The last  will remain in Rwanda as long as the United Nations wants them  to remain. All Belgians are due to have left by 19 April.    The Spanish military are due to fly them out in two flights  a  day today and tomorrow. The two Spanish Air Force Hercules  planes have landed again in Kigali. This time the aim is to  pick up military equipment and Belgian Blue Helmets. The  evacuation of this battalion is to be completed in just a few  days.    The Spanish Hercules landed in Kigali at 2000; the landing  strip was well marked, but the orders were that the planes had  to fly without lights for security reasons.    [Captain Javier Frias] We started our descent, but the air  controller in Kigali told us to stop going down because shots  were being fired.    [Bandres] In principle, the Spanish mission is due to finish  on Thursday, 21 April, returning to Spain through Brussels in  order to drop the Belgian soldiers off in their country.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cesar Ubeda Bravo] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said Central America,  especially Nicaragua, requires a transition period that would  allow the region to maintain its competitiveness while  negotiating joining NAFTA, which was signed by the United  States, Canada, and Mexico. Minister Leal, who met with the  American Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said this transition  period is required by NAFTA and is necessary because of the  special conditions of the region, which is leaving behind a  period of wars and conflicts.    He said that in a prudent amount of time -- three years --  the Central American economies should adjust themselves to the  transformations that are taking place, allowing the countries to  maintain current preferences and to have access to the same  preferences so they can join NAFTA after the transition period.    The chief of Nicaraguan diplomacy said that with the signing  of the treaty, Central America is at a serious disadvantage with  Mexico. "With the implementation of NAFTA this year, Central  America runs the risk of losing its preferential conditions for  access to the U.S. market. This is because the reduction of  tariffs in this treaty is automatic for 84 percent of Mexican  products," he indicated. For the Central American isthmus, 20.1  percent of exports to the United States have a tariff treatment  with preferences assigned by the Caribbean Basin Initiative  [CBI], the Generalized System of Preferences (SGP), and the  Assembly Plant [Maquila] Regimen.    During a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and  dignitaries of the Central American region and the Belizean  prime minister, a high-level commission was created that will be  in charge of the follow-up work on the CBI and Central America's  adherence to this extremely important treaty. "It must be noted  that the leading products exported to the United States are  agriculture and textile products. It is precisely in these  sectors that our relative competitiveness with regard to the  same products of Mexican origin are adversely affected," Leal  said.    He added that the seriousness of this situation not only  consists of the fact that Mexico is joining the U.S. market, but  that it also enjoys a preference that is far beyond the usual  tariff treatment. "NAFTA encompasses, in addition to tariff  aspects, the so-called nontariff barriers. It also includes  specific provisions regarding investments," he pointed out. He  added that the CBI lacks these additional benefits, "which  constitutes a severe disadvantage for Central American products.  It will allow Mexico to compete under better conditions."    He said NAFTA will grant Mexico preferential treatment on  sugar, which will make the country a net exporter of the  product. As for the textile sector, he indicated that the  treaty allows 45 percent of Mexican exports to the United States  to enjoy a zero tariff, which means Mexico will have an  advantage over Central American products in the U.S. market.  Finally, he called upon the businessmen to support the treaty  signed by the northern countries.</p>

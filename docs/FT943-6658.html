			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / The English coast and its holidays from hell: Britain's tourism industry is in trouble. Michael Thompson-Noel packs his bucket and spade and sets out to discover why I felt trapped and concussed. There was seediness and desperation almost everywhere I looked. I believed I was in a time warp, or in a novel by JG Ballard in which the past and the future had coalesced gruesomely into a macabre and changeless present. I was in Great Yarmouth. Among the horrors that market themselves as English seaside resorts, Great Yarmouth, which sits like a boil on England's eastern cheek, is perhaps without peer for hideousness and hopelessness. In some ways it is a typically clapped-out English working-class coastal resort-town whose fate, in an era of cheap mass foreign travel, is to play host to the poorest and least sophisticated of Britain's stay-at-home holidaymakers. It gives them beer and crummy boarding houses, dodgem cars and shooting galleries, food to feed a pig on and a wind from the Urals. The day I was there - a day in mid-August, the high point of summer - the wind was so strong that the sea was unsafe and the beach out of bounds. But there is something grippingly awful about Great Yarmouth. It looks as though it has not changed in any respect in half a century, as though its grotesqueness and datedness are protected, for some reason, by a force-field. It could be England's worst seaside resort. That would make it, by definition, one of the worst in the world. Not that I stayed long. I was out of there fast. Why did I go? I went because I was looking for a chimera: the Great English Holiday. Why should I do that? Because I had read that Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority and of the English Tourist Board, was growing alarmed at the bleakness of the position confronting British tourism, particularly its English variant. Reading of her concern, I realised that I had never, as an adult, spent a holiday of more than three days in England. I have holidayed in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, California, Canada, Scotland, Wales and elsewhere. But England, hardly ever. The reasons are quite conventional: climate, cost, familiarity and English naffness (naff: adj, slang, unfashionable, socially awkward; worthless, rubbishy). Here are some figures. Tourism in all its guises is worth about Pounds 30bn a year to Britain's economy. Britain's income from foreign tourists is booming: 1994 forecasts are for 20m visitors, especially from the US, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. In the international league table of tourism, Britain still ranks sixth, after the US, France, Spain, Italy and Austria, though it used to be fifth. Tourism accounts for about 1.5m jobs in Britain and more than 200,000 businesses. It employs nearly 7 per cent of the workforce. But all is not well. In 1985, says the tourist authority, Britain had a balance of payments surplus on its tourism account of Pounds 571m - ie, more was spent by foreign visitors to Britain than by the British travelling abroad (this does not take into account the money spent by Britons in Britain). This account toppled into loss in 1986. Last year the deficit was Pounds 3.6bn - a faster and deeper decline than that experienced by other countries in Europe. The main reason for this turn-around is said to be the growing number of Britons holidaying abroad as their wealth grows. In real terms, between 1980 and 1992 expenditure by UK residents on holiday in Britain fell by 12 per cent, while spending on foreign holidays soared by two-thirds. A well-organised outbound tourism industry (travel agents, tour operators and foreign tourist boards) spends well over Pounds 100m in marketing overseas destinations to the British. By contrast, the domestic industry is less well organised, highly fragmented and does not have the same marketing muscle. As more and more Britons have taken foreign holidays, Britain has lost share of international tourism. During the 1980s, Britain took about 6 per cent of world tourism spending. By 1992: 4.8 per cent. In England, says Adele Bliss, the picture is at its sorriest: 'In the last decade the share attracted by England of all holiday spending by Britons has fallen by some 10 percentage points, all of which has gone on holidays taken abroad. That share loss cost our tourism industry some Pounds 2.5bn in 1993 alone.' So off I went in search of an English holiday. I spent 5 1/2 days and drove 972 miles. I travelled willy-nilly, stopping at random, looking for places that would persuade me to spend my next holiday in England rather than in Italy or in Fiji or in Sarawak (terribly nice, Sarawak, one of my all-time faves). I decided to travel up England's eastern coast because it was the one I was least familiar with. But it makes no difference: east, south or west, Britain's seaside resorts are almost uniformly wretched: grasping, ghastly, catering to the lowest common denominator. If there was a map of England's naffness that utilised coloured lights, you would find that the cities glowed orange, that the towns shone purple and that the English coastline throbbed in apocalyptic scarlet. It has lost its soul to naffness. Only scraps survive. Worse, the bits in between are often occupied by drab caravan parks or camping sites - people holidaying in tents, a concept so twisted that the holiday-time murder rate in England's coastal parts must be worryingly high. For 2 1/2 days I meandered northwards, repulsed by ugly resort town after ugly resort town. My main compensation was the quality of hotels I stayed in. I did not shy from luxury. They were excellent, including the guesthouse I stayed in on the second night, and proved that one of the best aspects of English tourism is the quality and range of its hotels. They are as good as any country's, but cheap they are not. My first night was spent at Congham Hall, a luxury country house hotel set in 40 acres of parkland near King's Lynn in Norfolk. It is near the Sandringham royal estate, just inland, and is run with great flair by Christine and Trevor Forecast. The peace of the Norfolk countryside is all around. Its food is more than good and it has a heated outdoor swimming pool. Its herb gardens are famous. Would a holiday at Congham Hall prove memorable? Undoubtedly it would. But prices, including full breakfast, range from Pounds 99 per night for two people in a smallish double room to Pounds 118 (single) or Pounds 180 (double) for a luxury ground-floor suite. After breakfast I chatted to Trevor Forecast, who will become chairman of Pride of Britain, a marketing group of 33 stylish British hotels and restaurants, in November. He and his wife employ 35 workers, including part-timers. 'What are the virtues of foreign holidays?' asked Forecast helpfully as we sat in the sitting room, watching the rain. 'I have jotted them down for you. There is the weather, obviously, though people are becoming wary of too much sun. There is their cheapness, of course, though not at our level of hotel. There is the attraction of foreign culture. And, for some, the adventure of flying, though that must be waning. 'As for holidays in England, I think there are three main advantages. The food is better: I would throw in a plug for English cooking. Travel times are shorter: you can use your own car. And it's safer. There is the odd rail strike, to be sure, but no likelihood of a coup in Norfolk.' He could have added a fourth: the immense range of things to see and do in England. In recent times the English heritage business has been reviled for turning England into a Disneyesque theme park. But the criticism has been disproportionate to the damage inflicted by the heritage-mongers, at least to date. On price, the proprietor of Congham Hall said that British tourism was not treated fairly by the government. One of its grosser burdens is the high rate of VAT. Biss says that Britain's tourism infrastructure is woefully under-utilised, especially compared with that in Mediterranean countries. As a consequence, profits are not high enough and charges are uncompetitive. Part of the problem is the cost structure. In Britain, serviced accommodation and restaurants have to pass 17.5 per cent in VAT on to their customers, compared, for example, to 6 per cent - or sometimes outright exemption - elsewhere in Europe. Forecast finds this galling. The morning of our chat, The Times reported that Spain's government had decided to reduce the 15 per cent VAT levied on five-star hotels to 6 per cent from January 1. However, many five-star Spanish hotels had contrived to reduce their VAT bills anyway, simply by down-grading themselves to four-star, where the charge is already 6 per cent. Unfortunately for English hoteliers, there is no sign of a slackening in the appetite for foreign travel. Visa, for example, recently produced a survey of the more exotic destinations favoured this year by holidaying Britons. They included Ecuador, Gabon, Vietnam, Estonia, Guyana, Jordan, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe. For the British, a two-week package holiday in Vietnam, including flights and accommodation, costs about Pounds 1,500. A seven-night Crusaders and Citadels sightseeing tour of Jordan with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, an upmarket travel operator, starts from about Pounds 900, including flights and some meals. In any case, British tourism is a millpond compared to the giant-size business of global tourism, in which market trends of enormous proportions take shape at oceanic depths before swelling to the surface. The Mediterranean, for instance, is the world's premier tourist area, yet even the Med has lost market share steadily (partly because of price), from 31 per cent of world tourist arrivals in 1987 to 27 per cent three years ago. However, a report last year by the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the Med would reverse recent trends and capture more than a third of international tourist arrivals by 2000. Can Britain cope with souped-up competition from established and emerging rivals, or is its tourism doomed to slide further into the morass, in company with British industry, science and sausage-making? Probably, it will cope. The realisation that I could enjoy a holiday in England impressed itself upon me the moment I left the coast. I did this at Whitby. I had already bypassed Scarborough, of which people talk highly. It is the Yorkshire resort. But I was daunted by its size, and carried on to Whitby, a dramatically-sited north Yorkshire fishing port with a ruined abbey peering down on it. But by the time I reached Whitby - I could not park the car there, I could not even stop: it was crawling with humanity - I was so sick of resorts that I swept straight out, and wrenched the car westwards. By doing this I was propelled, almost at once, into the serenity of the North York Moors, 555 sq miles of outstandingly beautiful countryside, from gentle farmland to sweeping heather moors domed by massive skies - world-class scenery. The area is one of Britain's 10 national parks - so immediately uplifting that I felt embarrassed at having spent my life gallivanting to far-flung places without once having visited it. But my embarrassment was salutary. It reminded me that the naff-map of England does not glow at all if you study its interior: that the naffness of England fades away entirely if you avoid its cities, towns and coast and strike into its countryside. Some of England's national parks are pretty heavily visited, particularly the Lake District and the Peak District, each of which scores 20m visitor-days per year. But at the other end of the scale are the national park of Northumberland, the Norfolk Broads (a national park in all but name), Exmoor and the Yorkshire Dales. The other four British national parks are the Brecon Beacons, Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire coast and Snowdonia - in total, more than 5,400 sq miles of protected and outstanding countryside, as fine as any in Europe. If I were Adele Biss of the English Tourist Board, I think I would pipe down. I would stop worrying about the deficit on England's tourism account and conclude that the present figure was not particularly bad, all things considered. I would accept that nothing can be done about English weather and acknowledge that the government does not care a damn about hotel VAT rates. I would mourn that England possessed no coastal resort remotely in the class of Deauville, Rimini or Surfers' Paradise, and then shut up about it - confident that England's seaside resorts, led by hell-holes such as Great Yarmouth, will cling stubbornly to their grottiness until the end of time. Finally, I would stop parroting at conferences about under-used capacity, the public policy agenda and our rich tapestry of heritage. Instead, I would spread the word about England's national parks and the rest of its splendid countryside, a task that could be accomplished for a fraction of the budget presently at my disposal. Ring Miss Biss today. Ask her for a naff-map to guide you on your travels. If she says she does not have one, tell her she should be fired.</p>

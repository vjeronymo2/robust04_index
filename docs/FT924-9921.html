			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Personal View: The moment of truth The prime minister has made the situation clear. Wednesday is the time for Britain to decide, clearly and unequivocally, whether it intends to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He is right to put the question, on a substantive motion, squarely before the House of Commons. At some point this moment of truth had to be faced. There is now no point in delay  - unless the objective is to scupper Maastricht. If the intention is to ratify the treaty, rather than find a pretext to bury it, the time to act is now. The longer the decision of principle was left, the more the government's opponents would scent blood. They would view deferral as victory in disguise. Both the Labour opposition and the Tory dissidents have claimed until now that it 'makes sense' to wait for Denmark to make its decision on the treaty. Their argument has been that (as indeed the government came perilously close to conceding over the summer) Copenhagen's intentions should be settled before the Commons resumes work on a bill which might be unnecessary. Why have a Tory punch-up today over a treaty which could sink under its own weight into the Baltic Sea tomorrow? These arguments have always been specious. What the 'after you' school of Euro-diplomacy is really saying is that it would be very happy to see Maastricht die. For anyone to claim that there is no link between early UK ratification and Maastricht's chances of coming into effect is in fact to engage either in self-delusion or deception, or both. What incentive have the Danes to do a deal unless they see that all other member states will ratify? UK inertia distorts their choice. In Labour's case, cloudy logic is motivated by the pursuit of unprincipled party advantage. In the case of the Tory Euro-phobes, the refusal to admit the link is much more calculated. It is a cynical deception designed to disable the government and impose a minority view. Thank goodness the government has seen the dangers of that route. The same disingenuousness now reappears; so the claim that a deal on subsidiarity must be settled before the Maastricht bill can proceed. How could the British presidency of the European Community act as honest broker in Edinburgh on this or any other issue if the Commons declined to discuss the treaty, let alone if it voted against it? Letting things slide might help the government in the short term, but it would leave Britain as the one clearly seen to have pulled the plug on further progress. That would deliver another big blow, after the ERM retreat, to British credibility and influence in Europe. The government clearly understands the risk and is not prepared to run it. The case for an early Yes vote by the Commons thus comes back to the treaty's substance. Why do we want Maastricht at all? The answer is we want it for positive and negative reasons which the public debate so far has scarcely addressed, distracted by the media obsession with party and parliamentary tactics. Positively, Britain knows that its standing in the world is greatly enhanced by effective membership of a strong European Community. It wants a common foreign and security policy, on the right kind of terms set out in the Maastricht treaty. It believes in closer co-operation in justice and home affairs. It favours more democratic legitimacy and better control of EC administrative structures. Britain also likes the flexibility offered by more moves towards intergovernmental decision-making, but accepts the rationale for binding law decided by majority vote in respect of the single market. As any continental politician will testify, the final treaty design owes much to the UK. We have nothing about which to be ashamed or defensive. More negatively, we have much to fear from Maastricht's demise. The treaty keeps firmly alive the notion of the EC developing 'as 12'. It makes less, not more, likely a fast-track, inner-core move by Germany and France to form their own monetary and political union, with Benelux in tow. For Denmark, too, it should be seen as a last chance to save the power of the smaller countries in a system which, almost by chance, gives them disproportionate influence. Few people in Britain seem to have caught up with the speed with which the anti-Maastricht forces have retreated in France since September 20. While the French government may be boxed in by its farmers on the Gatt talks, Paris is now proceeding on all other mainstream European issues as if nothing had happened. France stared into the abyss and realised the absolute necessity of re-cementing the Franco-German axis as the working motor of Europe. That process is already back on track. In Bonn, similar conclusions were drawn. Britain's Euro-phobes need to understand the reality that follows from this. Failure to ratify might mean the 'death' of Maastricht in a technical sense. But it would certainly not kill the concept of closer - much closer  - partnership between 10 (or five) of the other member states. Whatever the technical difficulties, they would find a way of going ahead without us. And that would be the real defeat. The economic consequences for Britain would be disastrous. Last year, Japan's then prime minister, Mr Toshi Kaifu, told me that he regarded the country's link with Britain as 'the keystone of the arch of their relationship with Europe'. However, last week a Japanese businessman bluntly put to me a very different point of view: 'We are beginning to wonder whether we were right to regard Britain as the gateway to Europe after all.' It is not only Japan. In my native Wales, for example, 50 German companies have chosen to invest. By 1995, Bosch alone will be employing 1,200 people. How long would this kind of investment continue if Britain were to repudiate a treaty that had been so precisely tailored to our needs? Those Conservative MPs (and others) who dub Maastricht as a distraction from the economic debate really must cast aside such inward-looking myopia. Economic recovery and European policy are two sides of the same coin. Failure to ratify Maastricht would be a truly massive economic as well as political calamity  - for Britain, for Europe, and indeed the rest of the world. The Thatcherite dream of Britain miraculously evolving as a kind of north European Switzerland convinces nobody beyond our shores. They would see us wrapping ourselves in the Union Jack, in preparation for burial at sea. John Major is right to regard the ratification of the treaty as an issue of historic proportions. He knows that the case for sticking to his gun is overwhelming. Any government which, having been ejected from the ERM, then presided over Britain's wilful destruction of Maastricht (and that is how it would be seen), could have no place at the heart of Europe. Mr Major knows that Maastricht simply must be ratified  - for his sake, for the government's sake, for our country's sake, for all our sakes. The time to settle the question is now.

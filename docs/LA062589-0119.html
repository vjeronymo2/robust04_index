			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIGARETTES AND KIDS  </P> <P> In your story on the "most memorable" ads ("Lingering Scent," May 24), I  noticed where Camel cigarettes was mentioned for its cartoon character.  </P> <P> The R. J. Reynolds spokeswoman, Maura Payne, claims that "we took extra pains  to make sure that he appealed to adults, not children."  </P> <P> If what Payne says is true, why have I observed so many young children wearing  small T-shirts with the cartoon camel in front? Who do they think they are  kidding?  </P> <P> DOUG WEISKOPF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (DPA) -- The administration of  President Rafael Caldera will implement controls on prices and  on the dollar exchange to cope with the severe financial and  monetary crisis in Venezuela, congressmen from three political  parties announced after meeting with the chief of state.    Spokespersons for the ruling National Convergence, the  Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), and the opposition workers  Radical Cause Party expressed their support today at Miraflores  Palace for the government's "emergency" measures and requested  tighter controls on the banking system. One-third of the  country's banks ended up in state hands due to the liquidity  crisis at nine institutions.    The opposition Social Christian Party, Copei, and the social  democratic Democratic Action Party did not express their  position on the new official measures of Caldera, who began his  second government term on 2 February. The 78-year-old president  will address the country on a television network tonight to  announce the new measures.    As a reflection of the severe situation, the dollar has  jumped from 117 bolivares (national currency) in late April to  200 last Thursday. The government has availed itself of a  prolonged banking holiday that began on Friday to draft the new  measures.    According to commentators, the Venezuelan state provided  assistance "without sufficient guarantees" to new banks in  crisis on the order of $4 billion. This "financial crack" began  last January with the intervention at Banco Latino, until that  time considered the country's second most important bank. The  state intervened at eight other banks two weeks ago.</p>

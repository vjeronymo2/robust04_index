The  meeting will discuss the troubled Kismaayo region.    The port of Kismaayo is contested by two warlords, General  Mohamed Hersi and Colonel Omar Jays, the main ally of south  Mogadishu's strongman, General Mohamed Farah Aidid. Morgan is  the son-in-law of deposed Mohamed Siad Barre.    The meeting comes amid fears that the departure at the end  of  this month of United States and other peacekeeping troops from  Somalia will lead to renewed civil war, with Kismaayo as one of  the main danger zones.    In a related development, efforts by KTN to find out the  fate  of a Kenyan attached to the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM],  John Wanjohi, who was kidnapped in Mogadishu, were fruitless.  Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they had  unsuccessfully tried to get information from the UNOSOM office.  Wanjohi and a New Zealander, Wayne Hargreaves, were reportedly  seized from their vehicles in Mogadishu yesterday.</p>

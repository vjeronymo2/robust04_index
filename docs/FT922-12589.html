			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / US in new bid to end Bosnian conflict THE US yesterday launched a fresh diplomatic effort to end the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where fighting broke out again despite a ceasefire. Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, telephoned the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Portugal, the current president of the European Community, to discuss how to end the fighting. A State Department spokeswoman described the conduct of the Serbian leadership in Belgrade and Serbian armed forces in Bosnia as 'completely outside the bounds of civilised behaviour.' In London Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said: 'It's not acceptable that Yugoslav army or Serb irregulars or indeed Croatian irregulars should intervene and provoke a civil war.' Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, yesterday said the UN would not extend its peacekeeping operations to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Vance, who arrived in Belgrade for another round of peace talks, appealed to Bosnian leaders to respect the ceasefire. 'The situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is very, very serious and is causing us great concern. It is therefore essential that all the parties live up to the ceasefire agreement. War is not the answer. It will be ruinous to all sides and nobody should think that he or she can gain a one-sided advantage.' Mr Vance said the UN did not have enough troops to undertake peace-keeping operations in Bosnia as well as Croatia. Nor is there any UN mandate to operate in Bosnia. Clashes yesterday were reported in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, in Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia, and in Mostar, in the south. The federal army said it had secured Visegrad, a predominantly Moslem town in south-east Bosnia. The fighting which has left dozens dead and forced 100,000 people to flee.</p>

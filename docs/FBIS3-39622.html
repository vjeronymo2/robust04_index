			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Helena Garrido: "Pragmatism Is the Golden Rule"] </F>   [Excerpts] Last week, the prime minister and the minister  of finance made speeches on economic policy that, even if  different in language, clearly revealed that they were based  more on pragmatic principles than any other ideological tendency.    Prime Minister Cavaco Silva enunciated three basic rules  allowing the government to choose a combination of budgetary and  monetary policies. "The first is that there are no general  revenues; each case is different and must be dealt with  according to its own specificity; the second is that the  stabilization policy must be be seen in the context of the  medium- and long-term development of the country; the third is  pragmatism: Woe to the individual who does not respect  theoretical principles, but also woe to whomever is led only by  them," said Cavaco Silva, affirming that these are the norms he  has always taken into account.    Of the three rules, only the second is purely economic.  Despite the fact that the others also reveal the relative  fragility of economic theory, they are much closer to the  objectives of the purely political world, that is, maintaining  power and reconciling interests within the context of minimizing  for electoral purposes the social costs of the implementation of  these policies.    The speech by Minister of Finance Eduardo Catroga is the  application of these rules.    The present situation "demands a combination of  macroeconomic  policies that foster economic recovery through the adequate use  of available instruments in the areas of budgetary, monetary,  and incomes policies," said Catroga in the speech outlining for  the benefit of entrepreneurs the 1994-95 economic policy.    Catroga denied there was a change in economic policy and  emphasized that "each concrete moment" needs a certain  combination of different policies [passage omitted].    The problems mentioned by Catroga and his promises--both  within the confines of the entrepreneurs' concerns--as well as  the constant use of the word "company"--are the most explicit  elements of pragmatism advocated by Cavaco Silva. Interest rates  must drop; the government will reduce the stamp tax in 1995,  reduce reserves and the weight of state debt, stimulate savings,  energize the capitals market, and practice wage moderation. In  short, a group of marvelous proposals for an entrepreneur.    The constant praise of companies that Catroga says are "the  agents of change," as well as the implicit minimization of  macroeconomics--quite opportune in recessionary times--complete  the favorable aspect of the message.    However, since no one believes in miracles, realism emerges  with regard to difficulties. For instance, Catroga repeated what  others have already said: "Recovery may be slow and difficult."    More important than the message is the messenger. Catroga is  a finance minister who has been an entrepreneur all his life,  and he is likable and affable. Entrepreneurs heard the right  message at the right time, enunciated by the right person; thus  all ingredients are present to make the speech credible and  optimistic enough to foster investment. Catroga's appointment,  therefore, seems to be a genuine example of Cavaco Silva's three  rules. [passage omitted]</p>

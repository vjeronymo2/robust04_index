			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIROHITO'S DEATH STIRS MEMORIES OF OLD JAPAN  </P> <P> As a child growing up in Japan, Kaoruko Yamanouchi remembers dressing in her  best clothes every summer to welcome young Emperor Hirohito as he stopped in  her hometown of Utsunomiya, about an hour north of Tokyo, while traveling to  his summer residence.  </P> <P> Yamanouchi has lived in the United States for 30 years, but on Saturday she was  wearing a black armband as she went about her errands in Los Angeles' Little  Tokyo.  </P> <P> To her, the late Emperor Hirohito, who died Friday at the age of 87, was a  "scholar (who) loved our country," and only a recent knee operation will keep  her from returning to her homeland for his funeral.  </P> <P> "I asked my doctor yesterday if I could go," said Yamanouchi, a retired social  worker. "He said, 'No.' "  </P> <P> For Japanese immigrants living in Little Tokyo, particularly the elderly, the  emperor's death is a somber occasion, but it has far less meaning for  Japanese-Americans born in the United States, no matter what their age.  </P> <P> "I'm American-born, so for me it's like something happening to the King or  Queen of England," said Ruth Miyauchi, a resident of Little Tokyo Towers, an  apartment building for senior citizens.  </P> <P> "I'm sure my parents are grieving about it, or my grandparents," said Judy  Miyakawa, a Cal Poly freshman, as she arrived for work at the Japan-America  Theater box office. "He's more of a symbol of old Japan. But Japan is so  capitalistic now. I don't know why everybody's making such a big fuss about  it."  </P> <P> Kimiko Roberts, a seventh-grader and fourth-generation Japanese-American, has  never been to Japan. But she learned about the emperor recently when she wrote  a report about him for school.  </P> <P> "To me, I guess I'm more of a true American, so I don't really feel that much,"  said Kimiko, who was wearing a black-and-white sweat shirt with matching hoop  earrings. "But I know it is really hard on the people who live in Japan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Signs of Mourning  </P> <P> Despite the emperor's death and the unusually chilly weather, the shopping  plazas in Little Tokyo were bustling Saturday. Japanese-language newspaper  clippings reporting Hirohito's death were displayed in the windows of the  Kouraku restaurant and the Modern Food Market; otherwise, there were few  visible signs of mourning.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, officials at the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles were planning to  accept condolences next week from business and political leaders and members of  the 190,000-member Japanese-American community in the county.  </P> <P> A spokesman said condolence calls can be made Monday and Tuesday between 10  a.m. and 5 p.m. at the consulate, Suite 1200 in the Sumitomo Bank Building, 250  E. 1st St.  </P> <P> Officials of other large organizations had no immediate plans to mark the  emperor's death.  </P> <P> The Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center planned to go ahead with a  New Year's event scheduled for today at 11:30 a.m., according to Katsumi  Kunitsugu, executive secretary. She said a statement about the emperor will be  read as part of the program.  </P> <P> At the Kyosan Buddhist Temple where a memorial service is tentatively planned  for Jan. 15, Seicho Asahi, one of the ministers who came to this country seven  years ago, said that for him, the loss is personal. "He was part of the  family," Asahi said.  </P> <P> And at Yagura Ichiban restaurant, the Japanese-born manager, Takee Sato, said  he would light incense at Nishi Hongwanshi Temple to commemorate the emperor's  death. "He was like a god," said Sato in halting English.  </P> <P> Highlighting the differences in reaction to the emperor's passing between  immigrant and the American-born were two personal recollections with  contrasting overtones.  </P> <P> A white-haired American-born woman in charge of the visitors' register at the  Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center had a personal memory of  Emperor Hirohito that was more amusing than sad.  </P> <P> When she was 11, the woman spent a year at a Japanese grammar school. One day,  the emperor paid a visit.  </P> <P> To show their respect, the schoolchildren were told to kneel and keep their  heads bowed. As an American unused to such gestures, she remained on her feet  to the  </P> <P> mortification of her mother, who also happened to be visiting.  </P> <P> "(Hirohito) didn't smile. He looked straight ahead," said the woman, who was  too embarrassed to see her name published. "He had a beautiful face, like a  movie star."  </P> <P> But for Hiroshi Nanadzue, 86, a native of Japan, Hirohito's death has unlocked  deep-seated memories from his childhood. As a boy, Nanadzue lived near the  Imperial Palace in Tokyo and every morning he used to tip his cap to the young  prince as the future emperor and his two brothers rode to school in a  horse-drawn buggy. Every morning, Hirohito would nod back.  </P> <P> "People say, 'The emperor. The emperor.' To me, he was just another kid,"  Nanadzue said, brushing tears from his eyes.  </P></p>

Despite the fact that  the three-day all-Russian conference of the heads of customs  organs that ended yesterday was originally supposed to  generalize the results of 1993 operations, the main issues  discussed here were problems related to the introduction into  customs operations of concepts new to the service. This involves  not only a whole series of documents dedicated to customs  procedures, but also the transfer to the State Customs Committee  of functions as main currency control agent.    [Begin box]  <H3>  From the Report of Russian State Customs Committee Chairman  Anatoliy Kruglov </H3>   Following completion of its structural reorganization, the  Russian customs service comprises 12 regional directorates, 127  customs offices, and 413 customs check points. According to 1993  freight customs declarations, 1.9 million export and import  dispatches were registered, as were 3.2 billion tonnes of  freight, 14.7 transportation facilities, and baggage and  property of more than 275 million physical persons.    According to preliminary data, customs officials put R3.8  trillion [rubles] (including over $970 million) into the Russian  federal budget. This constitutes 15 percent of the revenue  portion of the federal budget. The export of about 4,000 objects  of art and antiquities was prevented. More than 50,000 firearms  and ammunition, and over 2.4 tonnes of narcotics were seized.    [End box]    No matter how impressive the figures sound that are cited in  the report of State Customs Committee head Anatoliy Kruglov, the  customs service has accumulated more than its share of problems.  The main portion of these are related to the introduction of new  customs operating procedures. For the majority of customs  workers in the regions, their exact role remains a puzzlement.  They are confused as to how and for what the required customs  fees should be exacted. Assembling employees at the conference  not just from the central region but from the outlying areas as  well, committee leaders attempted to explain the essence of the  operating modes being introduced and procedure for their  practical application. Customs employees are troubled most of  all, it turns out, by the freight-in-transit mode. The fact of  the matter is that in the absence of a precise regulatory  statute in this regard, freight often does not reach its  intended destination. As we know, it is precisely for this  reason that the system of bond duties for excise commodities was  introduced. Nonetheless, this measure has not corrected the  situation, in the view of customs officials. The customs service  has therefore gone one step further and announced the creation  of a special customs escort structure.    The next sphere of problems examined at the conference  concerned the introduction of rigid requirements in the  importing of certain commodities and increased customs fees in  their regard. In particular, a reduction in volume of imported  automobiles was noted. The state budget simply loses as a result.    No less serious have been the problems associated with  nonreceipt of appropriate hard currency proceeds from exports.  Currency control was therefore discussed especially thoroughly  at the conference. In spite of customs service efforts, the  Russian budget loses something on the order of $10 billion  annually, according to data cited at the conference. Although it  was in 1993 that the function of main currency controller was  transferred to the Russian State Customs Committee, observers  believe there is still a long way to go before practical results  of this measure are seen. The reasons for this are the absence  of technical capabilities for setting up precise customs control  over foreign trade operations and the lack of personnel training  for this activity. It was reported at the conference that plans  call for the establishment in 1994 of a single technological  system for registering and controlling the movement of freight  and effecting financial deductions. This system is supposed to  unite all customs structures--from the customs check point to  the State Customs Committee. If successfully instituted, this  system will result in significant reductions in the time  required to register freight and will enable timely and accurate  compilations of customs statistics to be made. But in order for  hard currency control to really begin to function--first and  foremost with respect to the export of strategic raw materials  and later for other commodities, specialized subdivisions are  being instituted at all authorized banks which will have direct  contact with the Russian State Customs Committee and Federal  Currency Control Service.    [Begin box]  <H5>  COMMENTARY </H5>   The conference was essentially a training session for  personnel from the localities. According to the Law on Customs  Duties and the Customs Code, the authority of the State Customs  Committee has been significantly expanded. First of all, in  collecting duties, value-added tax, and excise tax from imported  production, the State Customs Committee is carrying out fiscal  functions. Secondly, in increasing the number of customs  operating procedures, the State Customs Committee is controlling  a new segment of entrepreneurial activity. Thirdly, the customs  service is the pivotal element in the system of hard currency  control (for both the Central Bank of Russia and Ministry for  Foreign Economic Relations scenarios). It is the customs  authorities that start up the mechanism for circulation of  information: exporter--State Customs Committee--authorized  banks. They can actually dispute the contract prices of  exporters and importers. The multi-profile nature of the customs  service is turning the State Customs Committee into the  department possessing the most powerful arsenal of weapons for  effecting real regulation of foreign economic activity.

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Clinton would speed growth programme GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the frontrunner in the US presidential election, is considering ways of speeding up implementation of his plans to stimulate growth after mounting evidence that the economic slowdown is set to continue. Mr Clinton said he had been worried by a speech delivered in Tokyo last week by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which warned that the US faced an economic downturn of a kind not seen since 1945, and which might prove more protracted than previous recessions this century. 'I think it's something we need to look at - getting people to work again, getting incomes up . . . there's some other things we might be able to do to bump this economy some,' Mr Clinton said. The Democratic candidate's economic advisers, however, were at pains over the weekend to underline their commitment to keeping to a target of cutting the federal budget deficit in half over four years. A report in the Los Angeles Times that Mr Clinton was considering a new stimulus package provoked anxiety in the financial markets, which are already worried about the prospects for bringing the budget deficit under control. Long bond prices fell sharply on Friday. Mr Gene Sperling, the campaign's economic policy director, dismissed the report and said Mr Clinton had not asked for an accelerated recovery programme. He added that there was 'no consensus on any specific plan' among the Arkansas governor's advisers. Other advisers, however, said they were considering ways to 'front-load' the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.6bn) a year of infrastructure investment that Mr Clinton has already proposed, without actually increasing spending over a longer period. Democratic campaign managers are concerned that talk of a new growth package might open Mr Clinton to renewed attacks from President George Bush, who has already tried to paint his opponent as a 'tax-and-spend liberal'. They want to avoid anything in the last two weeks of the campaign that could shake Mr Clinton's commanding lead in both national and state-by-state opinion polls. Any new stimulus package that seems likely to increase the already yawning deficit would also draw unfavourable comparisons with Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate who has built a following by proposing harsh medicine to deal with the national debt. In half-hour television advertisements this weekend, Mr Perot added flesh to his economic proposals, sketching a five-year plan to eliminate the deficit. The plan includes Dollars 315bn of discretionary government spending cuts over the five years, and savings of Dollars 268bn on entitlement programmes from measures such as higher premiums for Medicare, the US health insurance for people 65 and over. Mr Perot also wants Dollars 342bn of tax increases, mostly derived from the proposal he has already outlined for increasing the petrol tax by 10 cents a year over five years.

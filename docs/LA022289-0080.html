			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> David Duke's opponent filed a court motion seeking to block the former Ku Klux  Klan grand wizard from taking the Louisiana Legislature seat he won Saturday.  The motion filed by home builder John Treen asks that Duke's candidacy be  declared illegal because he lives outside the suburban New Orleans district  that elected him. State law requires a one-year district residency by  candidates. District Judge Clarence McManus said he was studying the request.  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Angola ready to award two oil contracts in spite of civil war: Minister expects Dollars 1bn investment in exploration THE ANGOLAN government is ready to award two new contracts for oil exploration shortly in spite of the country's civil war and disrupted production. Ms Albina Africano, the country's energy minister, said western oil companies were preparing to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in oil exploration. The country was plunged back into civil war after election results which returned President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his MPLA government to power were rejected by the rebel movement Unita. In May Unita captured the oil town of Soyo where they destroyed oil storage facilities and halted onshore oil production. 'They've completely destroyed Soyo, everything has been blown up,' Ms Africano said. Onshore oil output of 30,000 barrels a day (b/d) has been stopped since January and some offshore production has been suspended because of the destruction of Soyo's storage terminal. Ms Africano in London for meetings with the British government in an effort to persuade ministers to put pressure on Unita to return to the negotiating table, said 60,000 b/d of offshore output had been halted, but she was confident that this could be resumed within months, if storage facilities offshore could be expanded. Angola is producing 453,000 b/d compared with capacity production of 550,000 b/d. The rebels have shot at the oil platforms 70km offshore, but Ms Africano said the western oil companies have been given military guarantees they will be protected as effectively as possible. 'The situation is more stable than it appears, the future investment plans of the oil companies show they still have confidence in the country,' she said. Chevron, Angola's largest operator is investing Dollars 500m in development of oilfields in Cabinda, and Elf, the French energy company, plans to put Dollars 1bn into expanding its own production. Ms Africano said the government hoped to sign a contract by September, giving Exxon, the US oil major, and British Petroleum deep-water exploration acreage. Exxon will be the operator on the 4,500-square km block with BP holding 40 per cent of the interest and Agip, Italy's resources company, having a minority interest. Royal Dutch/Shell has recently been awarded another deep water block and Ms Africano said a group of companies led by Chevron and including Total and Agip would be awarded another deep-water block in August. The Angolan government is looking for the country's oil production to increase to 690,000 b/d by 1997, excluding the new deep-water blocks.</p>

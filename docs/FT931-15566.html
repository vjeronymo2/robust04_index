			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banesto sells corporate loans BANCO Espanol de Credito (Banesto) yesterday became the first bank in continental Europe to remove corporate loans from its balance sheet through securitisation. Securitisation allows banks or companies to repackage assets and sell them to investors, thus removing these assets from their balance sheets for accounting purposes, and, in the case of banks, reducing the amount of capital they need to hold. This is the latest innovative financing used by Spanish banks to raise new capital, following a series of preferred share offerings and subordinated debt placements. Banesto has set up a Dollars 1bn Euro-commercial paper programme, backed by loans to Spanish companies. The first Dollars 30m tranche of one-month commercial paper, backed by a three-year loan, was issued under the programme yesterday. As the commercial paper matures, more paper is issued throughout the life of the underlying loan. In case no investor can be found for the new paper, a liquidity facility is provided by JP Morgan, the arranger of the programme. According to JP Morgan, the structure allows Banesto to fund the loans at a cost below the London interbank offered rate, which is cheaper than their normal cost of funds. Loans to companies are considered the most difficult assets to securitise. Because of their large size, risk is much more concentrated than in the securitisation of, for example, mortgages. Unlike consumer loans, they are individually negotiated transactions. A number of UK banks, which have been experiencing difficulties in the corporate loan market during the recession, have been eyeing the structure.</p>

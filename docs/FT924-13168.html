			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: Two Gentlemen of Verona and Lermontov's Last Dream - Theatre Throughout David Thacker's RSC production of Two Gentlemen of Verona at the Barbican - before, during scene-changes, and at the end - there occur classic popular songs from the jazz/swing era. Great songs: 'Nice Work if you Can Get it', 'And Then My Heart Stood Still,' 'Blue Moon,' 'In the Still of the Night' and more. But will not some people in the audience go home thinking that Shakespeare wrote them? Worse, will not some people miss them if ever they see Two Gents again? Nobody would claim that this is Shakespeare's best play, and there are passages when his words seem a lot more remote than those of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter et al. But those passages are not frequent. This production (first seen in Stratford 18 months ago) is not one that apologises for the play; it trusts it. Two Gents is always light and urbane; at its best, it is also surprisingly touching. So it proves here. It is often strange how, even as the play reminds you of situations that Shakespeare handled so much more marvellously in other plays, you find yourself oddly affected. At the heart of the action is the amorous perfidy of Proteus, courting first Julia, then Silvia, both with sincere ardour, even though Silvia is his best friend's girl. He is the male equivalent of the women in Cosi fan tutte, but he is also an embryo Don Giovanni - especially in the balcony scene, where, with Julia overhearing all, he courts Silvia. In this staging, Barry Lynch is a beguiling Proteus - charming, intense, soft and urgent at the same time, almost innocent in his treachery. Set against his inconstancy are the steadfast affections of Julia and Silvia. As Julia, Claire Holman is rather like a young Judi Dench; the voice half-hoarse, half-creamy, the manner so vital and spontaneous. Josette Bushell-Mingo (who has moved up from the role of Lucetta since Stratford) is a perfect contrast. She has a kind of gravity, elegance and nobility that naturally startle Proteus and make him forget Julia. The play's more broadly comic scenes, which are really just Shakespearian rotework, work here triumphantly. The dog Crab (played by Woolly), with his lean and dolorous air, comes close to stealing the show. And, best of all, that urbane beanpole Guy Henry makes Thurio as vivid as any character onstage. His face is deadpan, his eyelids beat in hilarious bemusement, his voice is a wonderfully humourless and solemn, and he catches exactly the essence of a hangover. The character he plays is just a hollow drone, but here he becomes a joy. ***** The French Symbolist poets were not alone in fighting duels with friends. Mikhail Lermontov, the Russian Romantic, was killed by his friend Martynov on a cool July morning in 1841. Lermontov goaded his opponent; and light mirth ended in grievous wounds. Harry Meacher's complex, inventive biographic drama, Lermontov's Last Dream for Pilgrim Productions at the Pentameters Theatre, starts on that duelling field, Lermontov wounded, dreaming of his past life. The whiff of Czarist sulphur hangs around Lermontov's death, but without conspiracy. It amounted to suicide at arm's length, boredom of life ended with a little help from his friends. Lermontov's 27 years in Moscow and the Caucasus were, like the lives of English counterparts Byron and Keats, a Romantic way of death. He wrote poetry, but achieved fame for creating Russia's Byronic man Perchorin, A Hero of Our Time in his only novel, written in 1840. The message: 'We survive on novelty, so much less demanding than commitment.' This play has Lermontov haunted by his own creations, controlling and controlled by them. Like the novel, Lermontov's Dream presents a Byronic journey of easy oaths and easier women; it knows that happiness looks boring and virtue unappealing. Lermontov becomes the ego and the id of Perchorin, sharing his creation's lines by entering the pattern of lies and shocks modeled on Perchorin's misdeeds. In Lermontov's world, all is blank hypocrisy, passion a shallow concern, and social rules only for those who care. The characters put the hard questions: 'Lermontov, why have I never been a slave to the women I have loved?' Learning about the world he has created, Lermontov faces himself. In keeping with Lermontov's writing, the play avoids intimacy with the characters. One of Perchorin's lovers, Vera, declares, 'I go from guilt to ecstasy in a single moment; it's madness' but she never shows it happening. The wrecking of wreckable lives and the universal duplicity of feeling throughout are told rather than shown. The play needs more space, more brooding, and less freneticism. However, this makes bold, inventive theatre, with a narrative that drives the action forward. A simple black and red set, black cossack costumes for the men and wispy chiffon for the women create a visual unity. The acting of Harry Meacher (who co-directs with Kit Gerould) and David Middleton as Lermontov and Perchorin is a swift, sure interchange; elsewhere, Paul Arlington, Gail Macfarlane and Judi Bowker are convincing as doctor, society woman and lover. Lermontov's Dream succeeds in conveying the bleak vision that made him a pattern for Chekhov's Solyony (The Three Sisters). He had written in 1838: 'Knowing too much, lost in equivocation, our generation is growing old in idleness.' How could he bear to live longer?

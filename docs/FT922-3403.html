			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Warning by race equality chief THE emergence of neo-fascists in continental Europe, the racist posturing of presidential aspirants in the US and the horrific events in Yugoslavia will only add to the insecurity felt by Britain's ethnic minority community, Mr Michael Day, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said yesterday. Mr Day said in the commission's annual report that ethnic minorities could never feel totally secure when they witnessed oppression on racial grounds elsewhere. Racial minorities in Britain saw how the stance of more liberal politicians was adjusted to 'take account of the pressures from a Le Pen'. It had caused alarm, Mr Day said, when 'the language of 'swamping' began to seep back into the debate on refugees and asylum seekers in the apparent need to placate those holding more racist views'. Progress towards equality of opportunity for all in Britain was 'too slow and too grudging', but the way in which institutions such as the police, the churches, the law, health, education and housing were prepared to review practices was encouraging. There was general support for outlawing the most blatant and offensive expressions of racism, but objections were raised 'the nearer we get to challenging the vested interests of those in privileged positions'. The commission was, Mr Day said, disappointed that an opportunity had been missed to use the Citizen's Charter to give an explicit lead on ethnic monitoring. Policies of privatisation and devolved responsibility had reduced opportunities for influence. 'As hospitals assume trust status, schools become locally managed, vocational and enterprise training becomes the responsibility of Tecs (training and enterprise councils) and Lecs (Scotland's local enterprise companies), local-authority and central government services are contracted out, what external authority is there to ensure they continue to be equal opportunity employers?'</p>

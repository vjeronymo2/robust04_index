			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At 1500 the testimony of  Ramiz Alia was heard in the Tirana Court's hall. In a long  apology of about two hours, the defendant rejected the  accusation by often attacking it and frequently claiming that it  did not present any concrete facts and that it is completely  political and extremely (?hectic).    Continuing with his explanations, the former first secretary  of the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] explained several  sections in the indictment, with which he is charged. I have  not accepted and will never accept the idea that I have  misappropriated and abused, Alia insisted, who is charged with  the criminal act of misappropriating state property in  conspiracy and that of abuse of position in conspiracy, defined  in Articles 62/13 and 106 of the Penal Code.    Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci spoke in defense of his  client.  Koci denounced the grave violations that, as he said, were  inflicted on his client. Counsel Koci, former chairman of the  High Court of Appeals at Alia's time, stated that these  violations are based on not knowing the constitution and having  a low professional level.    No, rejoined Neshat Fana, the prosecutor. It is Alia himself  who tried to give political coloring to his speech. The charges  against the defendant are not based on when he was president,  but for the time when he was party chairman. The prosecutor  continued to say that the denouncements of hundreds of families  of those convicted have been entered in the investigation file.  They request that the defendant be convicted as a criminal, as  the one who initiated ideas on the isolation and  depersonalization of the people, massive evictions, murders on  the border, as a continuer of [Enver] Hoxha's deeds, etc. The  indictment does not charge the defendant with such claims, but  accuses him of personal errors while he was at the head of a  political party. The people conducted a political trial, as  Alia is trying to represent today's hearing, against him in  February 1991 and March 1992.    After the prosecutor's speech, Defendant Alia replied again,  considering the speech of the prosecutor as a subterfuge against  him. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles designer Gregory Poe, who makes and peddles his pricey clothes in  Japan, is setting the stage for his entry into the U.S. market -- literally.  Poe, 32, designed the flashy costumes for "The Geography of Luck," a play  opening today at the downtown Los Angeles Theatre Center. Set in Las Vegas,  Poe's most spectacular female get-up is a Kelly green showgirl number, complete  with satin, feathers, sequins and beaded headdress. Poe, who says he plans  later this year to start selling his other designs in the United States,  describes the "Geography" costume gamut as "anywhere from very glitzy showgirls  to white trash."  </P> <P> The Unusual Is His Usual  </P> <P> Stylist to the stars Angelo di Biase has left his post at Umberto to become the  style director at Char Salon. Di Biase is known for creating the unusual hair  styles sported by Rosanna Arquette, Beverly D'Angelo and Ellen Barkin. His work  will be seen in the movie "Johnny Handsome," featuring Barkin and Mickey  Rourke. Di Biase will also be responsible for coiffures showcased in "Robocop  II." Guess even robots need the right "do."  </P> <P> Step Right Up, Folks  </P> <P> Here's a new approach to hair salon protocol. At the Accent salon, clients are  taken on a walk-in basis only. No appointments accepted. And those who wait  more than 45 minutes for services are granted a 50% discount. There are seven  of these shops in U.S. cities now, and there will be one in Los Angeles this  year, says Mary Tingle, a spokeswoman for the company. They cater especially to  the hair-care needs of black men and women, and use both Gentille and Nucleic A  products, she tells Listen.  </P> <P> Try to Patch That Up  </P> <P> Looks like Tom Petty is into the hippie scene, judging from the decorative  patches on his blue jeans. Listen caught sight of him the other night, with  rocker Billy Idol close by. Idol isn't joining the Woodstock Revisited look,  despite all the hoopla lately about this being the 20th year after. He's still  wearing his ubiquitous black leather with fringe. This time he added a  horsehide vest, complete with Pinto markings. What would the hippie vegetarians  say about that?  </P></p>

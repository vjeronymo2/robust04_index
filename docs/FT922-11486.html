			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Bosnian capital enjoys a lull in ethnic fighting SARAJEVO, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday saw a lull in the fighting that broke out immediately after the leaders of Moslem Slavs, Serbs, and Croats had agreed to observe a ceasefire brokered by the European Community on April 12. Sarjevo residents described it as the worst night of clashes since battles erupted in Bosnia about seven weeks ago over its bid for independence from Yugoslavia. The EC team, led by Lord Carrington, the chairman of the EC peace conference, said talks would resume in Lisbon on Monday if a ceasefire was in place. Meanwhile, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, said yesterday no party was blameless for the situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but it was not feasible to dispatch a UN peace-keeping force to the strife-torn republic. In western Bosnia, Croatian radio reported 94 federal soldiers killed in fighting between Serb and Croat forces. But Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said four soldiers had been killed and 50 wounded, and it claimed Croat forces had suffered far greater losses.</p>

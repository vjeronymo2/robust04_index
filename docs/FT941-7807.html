			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Uncle Sam's absence: The US attitude to Bosnia could undermine Nato's strategy General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, 'believes we can build on the Sarajevo model and use it in other parts of Bosnia', according to a senior officer on his staff, quoted by Reuters on Monday. But the same day, US President Bill Clinton proclaimed his wariness about issuing further Nato ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia, warning that Nato should 'not undertake a mission it is not able to perform'. This is worrying, because Nato's ability to perform almost any mission depends more on Mr Clinton's willingness to give the necessary orders than on anything else. The threat to bomb heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area was taken more seriously than earlier threats because the US, which would provide the largest number of bombers, and France, which has the largest number of troops on the ground, were both clearly determined to carry it out. If Mr Clinton says he does not believe Nato can intervene elsewhere in Bosnia, the chances are that others, such as the Serbs shelling Tuzla airport and the Croats besieging Mostar, will not believe it either. No doubt it would take time for Nato to agree on any further ultimatums, even if the US pushes for them strongly. But that need not matter. What is needed at this stage is for the Russians to warn the Serbs, and the Germans to warn the Croats, that they are in real danger of being targeted by Nato if they continue shelling and do not allow relief supplies to reach the beleaguered population in areas still under Bosnian government control. Of course, both protecting powers can say, no doubt in good faith, that they strongly oppose air strikes against their proteges and will do their best to block them - just as Lady Thatcher used to tell the South Africans, with evident sincerity, that she was doing her best to resist further sanctions against them. Such a distribution of roles is an essential part of the diplomatic game. But it only works if the protector can say credibly that his best efforts will be unsuccessful unless the protege takes significant steps in the desired direction. Mr Clinton's remark is therefore unfortunate. It tends to undermine the Nato strategy for bringing peace to Bosnia which - however imperfect, however tragically overdue - is just beginning to look as though it might actually exist. Worse than that, it is symptomatic of a general US half-heartedness about international commitments, particularly those with a military ingredient, which is generating a lot of insecurity, especially in central Europe. The behaviour of Hungary is instructive. In 1992 Hungary welcomed Nato surveillance aircraft (Awacs) to its airspace, for the purpose of monitoring the UN-imposed no-fly zone over Bosnia. It also sought Nato guarantees against Serbian retaliation, but its overriding concern was to play its part in a Nato operation aimed at halting Serb aggression. This year, when Nato issued its ultimatum to the Serbs around Sarajevo, Hungary served notice that it would ban the Awacs overflights if any air strikes were carried out. 'Hungary will not take part,' said Prime Minister Peter Boross. 'We have to live with Serbia and the Serbian people for hundreds more years.' Hungary has suffered from economic sanctions against Serbia; it was irritated at not being consulted by Nato before the ultimatum was issued, which hardly chimed with the 'partnership for peace' it had just been offered; and it is worried about repercussions for the 400,000 ethnic Hungarians in northern Serbia (Vojvodina) if relations deteriorate further. Still, the change in its attitude is eloquent. Eighteen months ago Hungary was eager to back a Nato operation, and believed Nato could protect it from any adverse consequences. Now it assumes a neutral posture as soon as things get rough. What has happened in between? Russia has become much more assertive. The European Union has accepted the continued primacy of Nato in defence matters. Nato has rebuffed applications for membership from Hungary and other central European countries. The US has announced its withdrawal from Somalia, after one incident in which 12 US soldiers were killed. And the US has repeatedly refused requests from its European allies to put troops on the ground in Bosnia. It did so again this week when Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, suggested it should match Russia's action by deploying troops in Sarajevo. Mr Clinton did, in his televised statement on Monday, reiterate his willingness to provide up to half the ground troops needed to help enforce an eventual peace agreement in Bosnia, if he judged such an agreement 'enforceable'. But that pledge remains subject to congressional consent, which will not be easy to obtain unless Mr Clinton throws the full weight of his authority behind the request. That means that the hypothetical agreement must be presented as a major achievement of US diplomacy, not a piece of shabby realpolitik which the US has grudgingly accepted. That in turn requires that the US play a much more prominent role in negotiating a peace agreement than it has done up to now. There have been some signs of this in the last fortnight, with Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, trying hard to resolve the conflict between the Bosnian government and the Croats. But to be effective, US involvement needs to be at a higher level than that, and part of a much clearer overall strategy. Not only Bosnia's fate, but the credibility of the Atlantic alliance and the prospect for any effective security system in Europe, are now at stake.</p>

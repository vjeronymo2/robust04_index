			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS -- German chancellor Helmut Kohl  said Germany and the rest of the West are interested in a  democratic, politically stable and economically strong Russia.    "We, Germans, and, I think, the majority of people in Europe  and the West are interested in a democratic, politically stable  and economically strong Russia," he said.    Speaking at a joint news conference after his talks with  visiting President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday, Kohl pledged to  support by words and action Russian partners. He confirmed that  Germany pins hopes on Yeltsin's economic reform and fully  supports his policy.    He stressed the need to let Russia in in international  organisations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. Kohl stressed that Germany will soon become president of  the European Union [EU] and will call for the soonest possible  signing of a cooperation accord between Russia and the EU.    One of the key topics discussed at the talks which will  continue on Thursday was European security, the German  chancellor continued. "I explained to President Yeltsin the  meaning and goals of the decision adopted at the NATO summit  meeting in Brussels in January 1994. We are interested in  Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace," he said.    Speaking about the Bosnian conflict, Kohl noted that Germany  and Russia are working in the contact group with representatives  of the United Nations, the EU, the United States, France and  Britain in order to reach as soon as possible a comprehensive  cease-fire in Bosnia and involve the warring sides in  cooperation to establish a durable peace.    Kohl and Yeltsin also discussed bilateral relations,  including the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany.</p>

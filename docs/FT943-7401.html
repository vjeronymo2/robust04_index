			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers up The beginning of the end of the newspaper price war hove in sight as the Sun raised its cover price and the rest of the sector breathed a sigh of relief and saw their share prices respond accordingly. Some of the more hardened publishing analysts suggested that the decision by Mr Murdoch's flagship tabloid to lift its price by by 10 per cent to 22p was cynically timed to soften the effect of News Corp's full year figures tomorrow. The company is expected to announce profits of ADollars 282m (Pounds 134.2m) against ADollars 360.5m last time and much of the hit will have come from the Sun and Times price cuts. Daily Mail Group bounced 10 to 1025p, Mirror Group 2 to 145p and Daily Express parent United Newspapers 4 to 547p. However, The Telegraph fell 10 to 368p. SG Warburg consider 359p as a fair price for the stock following the group's hit from its price cut in June. Water stocks performed well as one securities house was said to be recommending them as an income fund play in preference to some regional electricity companies. Smith New Court was mentioned as the motor behind the price moves although the house specialists said their influence was exaggerated. Nevertheless the leading water stocks stood out and some analysts pointed out that Anglian, which rose 10 to 567p was now well in line for a return to the FT-SE 100. Meanwhile Thames improved 8 1/2 to 545p, Severn Trent 5 to 598p and North West 8 to 577p. The recs were mixed with Eastern Electricity dipping 7 1/2 to 802p and London 3 to 702p. There was also some switching into British Gas which held firm at 302p and was the most heavily traded stock in London with 10m shares traded. The shortage of stock and some early bidding saw a very brief spate of 'backwardation', the situation where bid and offer prices are reversed. A weak oil price and reports of a breakdown at its strike-hit plant in Nigeria affected Shell Transport in early trading. The shares were down 10 at worst and recovered to close 7 weaker at 714p. Industrial group Charter advanced 15 to 770p, after it raised its offer for Esab, the Swedish welding equipment group, and also declared the offer unconditional. Defence electricals group GEC gave up 8 to 294p as talk that the company was lining up a big acquisition did the rounds in the market. Dealers also attributed the decline to general profit taking following last week's strong advance, prompted by talk of a bid from industrial giant BTR which has now faded. BTR ended the session 2 ahead at 378p. The prospect of new orders from the Middle East cheered engineering group GKN. The shares added 2 to 628p. A stock overhang depressed Granada and the shares eased 13 to 502p. Thorn EMI was firm ahead of today's first quarter figures. The shares hardened a penny to 1063p. Stores group Body Shop trailed 7 to 229p following negative press comment on payment. Lloyds Chemist closed unchanged at 304p, after Goldman Sachs crossed 1.6m shares at 303 1/2 p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel tumbled 14 to 290p, after a weekend press report said it might cut prices on travelling through the tunnel. The prospect of stiffer cross-Channel competition weakened ferry operator P&amp;O 10 to 692p. Negative press comment on director's pay at Tiphook left the shares 3 lighter at 32p. Building and construction stocks were mixed in thin trade ahead of results. AMEC, which reports in early September, closed 3 up at 115p following a recommendation from Goldman Sachs but Tilbury Douglas fell 8 to 591p. Shares in Brandon Hire gained 3 to 84p making a rise of 35 per cent in under four weeks. Marley, the materials and automotive components group, is forecast to provide the first important pointer to the sector's performance with tomorrow's interim profits. The shares were steady at 155p. A return to profit and an announcement by chemicals group MTM of the first dividend for three years saw the share price recover 6 to 85p.</p>

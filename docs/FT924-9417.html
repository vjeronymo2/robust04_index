			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Bad times for global equity flows - The continuing decline in trading activity IN the far-off heady days of the mid-1980s, there seemed little doubt that equity markets were on the verge of going global. The slumbering giant of the international investment world, the US, had stirred as its investors began to look abroad for better returns than those available at home. Nothing would ever be the same again. Today, that vision looks increasingly simplistic, even if there are still plenty of pundits predicting the coming of the global equity market. The crash of the Tokyo stock market - after many foreign investors had jumped in, guessing that share prices had touched bottom - and the volatility in currency markets this year give ample warning of the risks that lie in wait for international equity investors. That global equity flows dipped in 1991, and have continued to decline further this year, is reported by Baring Securities, the UK investment house, in the latest of a series of annual studies of the international share markets. The report, produced by global equity strategists Michael Howell and Angela Cozzini, follows the pattern of similar studies produced previously while the pair worked for Salomon Brothers. According to the Baring study*, the value of foreign shares traded dropped by 9 per cent in 1991, to Dollars 2,100bn. In terms of share volume, there was a more marked 20 per cent fall. Net equity investment abroad still rose to Dollars 100bn, though, higher than its previous peak of Dollars 92bn in 1989. The message: overseas investment is still creeping up, even though trading activity has slumped. Much of the foreign investment that did go ahead in 1991 was badly timed. Of the Dollars 100bn of net buying, nearly half was accounted for by purchases of Japanese shares, ahead of the renewed slide in prices earlier this year. Much of this money was pulled out again as asset allocaters panicked, says Mr Howell - missing out on the subsequent bounce in Japanese share prices. Baring's research also indicates that foreign buying of US shares has been particularly badly timed. When foreigners sell, prices go up: when they buy, they fall, says Mr Howell. Last year, foreign buying of US shares was minimal, with the only significant purchases coming from investors outside Europe and Japan (see table). Meanwhile, international investment emanating from some regions was very subdued last year. Japanese investors, who had spent a net Dollars 18bn buying foreign shares in 1989, paid out only Dollars 3.6bn in 1991. UK and continental European investors, while remaining substantial figures on the world stage with net purchases of nearly Dollars 40bn, nevertheless slipped from their 1989 record of Dollars 46bn. It was left to the US to plug the gap: it exported a net Dollars 43bn of equity capital, more than double its 1989 level. Despite these difficulties, however, the overall trend in the nature of overseas investment seems likely to continue. In the late 1970s, just 5 per cent of international capital flows was accounted for by equity investment. By last year, that proportion had leapt to 36 per cent, reflecting the new dominance of institutional investors as providers of international capital. Also, the fall-off in foreign share trading has been less pronounced than the decline in domestic trading on most of the world's exchanges. That means that, as a proportion of all share trades, foreign transactions continued to creep up last year, to 19 per cent. The emerging markets of Latin America and the Far East continue to attract a large proportion of net overseas investment. In addition, Baring reports, investors have begun for the first time to switch funds actively between these two regions in pursuit of higher returns. While Latin America attracted substantial equity investment in the first quarter of this year, for instance, much of the money has since been moved across to the Far East, says Mr Howell. In all, the emerging markets attracted a net Dollars 14bn last year, almost identical to the investment in each of the previous two years. In that period, just over a fifth of net overseas share buying has been directed at the emerging markets. If primary share issues were included, that proportion would rise to more than a quarter. *International Equity Flows, Baring Securities, Pounds 250.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FLOWS (Dollars bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Market to:                      US     Japan      UK     Cont.

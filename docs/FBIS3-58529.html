			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The talks between the head of state [Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro] and [Giorgio] Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber  of Deputies, lasted over an hour. A communique issued by the  Quirinale [president's office] explained that Napolitano was  received by Scalfaro in accordance with Article 88 of the  Constitution. Essentially, Scalfaro heard him, as the  constitutional document stipulates, before dissolving parliament.    Napolitano has not made any statement. He limited himself to  saying that he did not know the date of the election, and that  it would be chosen by the government. He was asked if elections  would be held on 20 March, since Jews have reportedly been  assured that elections will not clash with Passover.</p>

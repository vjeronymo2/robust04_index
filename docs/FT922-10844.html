			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Eridania improves earnings 28.4% ERIDANIA, the agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group, raised net group profits by 28.4 per cent to L172bn (Dollars 137.3m) last year, while sales increased by 10.2 per cent to L10,096bn. The improved earnings have spurred a L10 increase in the dividend to L250 a share for ordinary shares and L280 for savings stock. The company said its planned merger with Beghin-Say, the French sugar and foods group that it controls, was advancing steadily. Approval is expected at Beghin-Say's annual meeting on May 27 and the merger should go ahead at the beginning of next year. Eridania forecast that sales and earnings looked set to improve further this year, partly on account of the planned merger and also due to recent acquisitions. Moreover, the group's debt-equity ratio was set to fall, in spite of the acquisitions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- By 241 votes for and 38 votes  against, the Ukrainian Supreme Council approved the resolution  "On the implementation of the resolution by the Supreme Council  of Ukraine of 24 February 1994 on the status of the autonomous  republic of Crimea according to the current Constitution and  legislation of Ukraine, and the resolution by the Supreme  Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 on suspension of the law of  the Crimean Republic on the restoration of the Constitutional  foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood."    "The Supreme Council of Ukraine," the resolution says,  "hereby notes that the Supreme Council of Crimea failed to  comply with the requirements of Clauses 1-3 of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council resolution of 24 February 1994 on the status of  the autonomous republic of Crimea according to the current  Constitution and legislation of Ukraine, and Clause 2 of the  resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994, and  did not bring the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in  accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine within 10 days.  Proceeding from this, and with the aim of safeguarding the  functioning of all bodies of state power and self-government in  Ukraine, in full accordance with the Constitution and laws of  Ukraine and the process of consistent formation of a  law-governed state, the Supreme Council of Ukraine hereby  resolves:    1.

To instruct the Commission for Legal Policy, Judicial and  Legal Reform, and the Law of Procedure to submit proposals to  the Supreme Council of Ukraine within two weeks on amendments  and additions to the current legislation which would foresee  annulment of legal acts passed by the Supreme Council of Crimea  on their suspension by the Supreme Council of Ukraine and  bringing these legal acts in line with the Constitution and laws  of Ukraine within the established period; to submit within one  month conclusions as to correspondence between the Constitution  of the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine's legislation.    4. To propose, in accordance with Clause 35 of Article 97 of  the Constitution of Ukraine, that the president of Ukraine as a  guarantor of the Constitution of Ukraine submit before 6 June  1994 to the Supreme Council of Ukraine a list of measures based  on the Constitution and the current legislation of Ukraine which  can be taken by Ukraine's state authorities, in the event of  failure to comply with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine."</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis buys 899,000 shares for cancellation Chrysalis, the record, communications and media company which its founder, Mr Chris Wright, recently failed to take private, has in the last week bought in 899,000 of its own shares for cancellation. The company, which said last month it could not persuade one sizeable shareholder to accept its offer of 95p per share, paid 72p for most of the shares, and 71p for the rest. Chrysalis' shares yesterday closed unchanged at 74p. The cancellation of these shares increases Mr Wright's stake in the company to 49.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on statements by Armenian Vice Premier Vigen </F> Chitechyan by Mariam Ogandzhanyan: "The AES Is Beginning  Operation, But Don't Expect It to Get Brighter"]    [Text] As already reported, journalists were given the  opportunity to visit the Armenian AES [atomic power station] on  22 April. Gagik Markosyan, the AES' chief engineer, personally  accompanied them on a trip around the station. Journalists were  shown a mockup of the station in the technical office and  provided with detailed explanations of the basic principles in  its operation. It is known that the first of the AAES' [Armenian  Atomic Power Station's] two units were put into operation in  1976, and the second one was commissioned 4 years later. Both  reactors are first-generation water-cooled power reactors,  although unlike the standard units, they were designed by taking  into account the region's seismicity. After the station is  started, it is expected that 400 megawatts will be generated  daily. But for the present, the station represents an additional  load on the energy system by consuming 2.5 megawatts per day.  Inasmuch as the second unit is in better condition and its  restoration requires less efforts, it will be renovated first.    After an inspection of the station, a press conference was  held, at which Armenian Vice Premier Vigen Chitechyan drew the  journalists' attention to a report on the current status of the  AES, as well as problems associated with the renovation process.  The necessary explanations were provided by Mr. Avagyan, chief  of the Armatomenergo Administration; A. Margirosyan, chief  engineer of the AAES; and F. Arakelyan, director of the  Armatomenergoprom Planning Institute. As Mr. Chitechyan pointed  out, the status of the AAES changed after the collapse of the  USSR. In this connection, independent Armenia had to conclude a  number of agreements with international organizations and sign  international conventions on the use of atomic energy. The  question of Armenia's membership in the IAEA [International  Atomic Energy Agency] was resolved successfully, and an  intergovernmental agreement was signed with Russia on supplies,  including nuclear fuel. The next step was establishment of the  necessary infrastructure . An operating organ was formed--the  Armatomenergo Administration, as well as a monitoring organ, the  Armatomkontrol Administration. The regulations of the AES were  revised and reapproved in conformity with international  standards, and it was given the status of a special-purpose  state enterprise. The concept was worked out and approved by the  government, and a coordination plan was drafted on this basis.  The working plans for each system and each unit subject to  renovation were worked out in conformity with this plan. As Mr.  Chitechyan noted, we can speak about completion of the  preparatory stage today. The station's most important assemblies  have already begun to be repaired in most sections. It is  expected that the planned level of safety will be provided for  by the end of this year. As far as additional steps to increase  the station's safety are concerned, they require that additional  sources of financing be found. On the whole, roughly $70 million  are needed for the AES to resume operations. In this connection,  there is a decision to establish a public fund under the  Ministry of Energy to mobilize all the reserves and coordinate  all the funds to put the AES in operation as soon as possible.  For the present, the available funds are enough for a month of  work.    Mr. Chitechyan noted in particular that the most favorable  conditions possible had been created for the station's  personnel. The wages of employees engaged in the process of  resuming operations add up to roughly 20 established minimum  wages (25 percent more than the president receives). Three  houses which are being built will be provided initially for the  specialists that have been invited, and after their departure  they will be used to improve housing conditions for the AES  employees.    Responding to journalists' questions, Mr. Chitechyan stated  that the fuel needed for the station's operation is being  obtained exclusively in Russia at present, although he added  that there is a continuous search for alternate sources.    It was explained that the seismic stability of the station  after its renovation will correspond roughly to 8 or 9 points on  the scale. The operational service life of both units existing  at the station is 19 years.    Mr. Chitechyan did not mention the periods for starting [one  or two words illegible] and renovation of the first unit. They  will become known only when the preliminary repair operations  are concluded. However, even after the station is started, the  people evidently will not observe any particular brightening in  their everyday life. As the Armenian vice premier pointed out,  the electric power being generated will be directed where its  cost will be recovered the quickest. Only when a certain amount  of profit is obtained will we able to think about lighting the  streets and houses. Well, we are not accustomed to it anyway.    In conclusion, Mr. Chitechyan noted the special role of the  press in shaping public opinion and he called upon the mass  media for cooperation.</p>

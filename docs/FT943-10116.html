			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Sport: Princess Anne negotiates a tricky course - Equestrianism / Keith Wheatley learns about the economics of eventing Gold medal success for the British eventing team last weekend at the World Equestrian Games should give attendances a welcome boost at the Calor Gas British Open championship beginning next Friday. It will be a relief to one of the event's co-founders, the Princess Royal. She and former husband, Captain Mark Phillips, both former Olympic competitors, have created something at their home that has grown far beyond their original vision. Equestrian entrepreneurs with a creative urge and some spare land should read their story before building the first fence. 'We simply wanted to build a demanding advanced course as a contribution to the sport in Britain, because that was our joint interest,' said the Princess, strolling on the sunny south-facing terrace at Gatcombe Park. The steep Cotswold valleys in front of the mellow, but ungrand, house provide a natural amphitheatre for the cross-country course. 'It was very debatable whether it could be commercially successful in terms of the outlay. It can be if you have a good sponsor, but you're not going to run the property on it.' The 1,400-acre estate is still farmed by Phillips, in spite of the couple's divorce. Althorp Park, family home of Princess Diana, has recently gone into the horse trials business with its own three-day event. Earl Spencer, by his own admission no horseman, went on record as saying it was a purely commercial venture. 'If the event doesn't make it worth its while, I'd have to take a fairly mercenary view and pull the plug.' His kinswoman by marriage could have counselled him to take the long view. 'When you have a lot of permanent grassland, which we have here, it gives you a chance to do something other than graze sheep. They'll improve the going no end but it doesn't pay very much.' Through her own experience as a member of the International Olympic Committee, the Princess has an insight into the relationships between sport and business. On the recent commercial crisis at the top end of British eventing - riders of the calibre of Ginny Elliot and Mary Thomson have talked about selling their top horses just to keep going - she observed: 'The good news and the bad news about sponsors and riders is that they enable people to compete when they otherwise might not be able to, but also that they tend to keep a relatively limited number of people at the top. 'The ones trying to get on the ladder will have more difficulty climbing upwards because the major sponsors will keep the top riders in good horses. This factor is more obvious in showjumping than eventing.' The Princess's own discipline of eventing (she was in the British team in 1976 at the Montreal Olympics) is the fastest-growing equestrian sport, particularly at the base of the pyramid. She has contributed by establishing two Novice trials (in spring and autumn) at Gatcombe, as well as the British Open in midsummer. Like many landowners who are also keen on horses, the Princess is eager to make productive use of land no longer wanted for agriculture. And, like many landowners, she is driven to distraction complying with Byzantine regulations from Brussels. In the eyes of Eurocrats, horses are not 'an alternative land use' and their presence compromises land put into 'set-aside'. 'We suffer, I suspect, because in some parts of Europe horses are still farm animals. We've had to measure corridors for 'the track' across particular fields that are in set-aside but if the authorities really want to get difficult I suspect they could say that spectators shouldn't watch from those fields because they've paid at the gate. It infuriates me,' the Princess complained. 'Although the numbers of people taking part in horse trials are increasing, maintenance of the sites is becoming more difficult. Some have had to close because they just couldn't fit in around set-aside regulations. But you're not running a commercial project, it's a sports competition on which you hopefully won't lose money.' Such issues have often managed to divide landowner and tenant. How much more difficult, potentially, when the two individuals concerned were once husband and wife? 'Capt Phillips is the farmer and I'm the landowner,' she explained. 'Regulations for set-aside land say usage should not be lucrative to the farmer. Well nobody will explain to me why it is that the landowner has to suffer the same restrictions. 'In this instance I don't see any money from the set-aside payments but I'm equally not allowed to use the land for horse trials in case there's any financial benefit. It's a difficult debate and I think it's one that's soured by the fact that Brussels is paying out vast amounts of money for people to do nothing.' Hand-outs are not part of the natural style of the Princess Royal. Next weekend she edges modestly into the retail business with the launch of Gatcombe Park polo shirts and sweat shirts. 'People have often asked for them in the past, so it's by way of an experiment,' she said. 'What's the point of letting outsiders do it, when it can benefit people on the estate if we handle it ourselves? But we won't be selling them outside Gatcombe itself. I don't see myself taking a trade stand at Burghley and Badminton.'</p>

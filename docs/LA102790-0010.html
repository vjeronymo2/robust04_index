			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVAK ON AMERICANS MOVING UP  </P> <P> Novak instructs us to quit "bashing the rich" since "most people got richer"  last decade.  </P> <P> I couldn't agree more that we should "cut the hypocrisy."  </P> <P> Since The Times reported July 24 that the richest 1% of Americans got 87%  richer last decade while the poorest 20% got 5% poorer (making the widest  rich-poor gap in 40 years), I suggest we do a lot more than bash the rich and  the political system that supports them. Let's cut the hypocrisy and find a way  to disenfranchise the selfish rats so that our country can care for its  desperate needs. Then they can "put up or shut up."  </P> <P> CAROL BENSON HOLST  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

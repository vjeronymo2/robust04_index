			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General </F> Uri Savir by Me'ir Einstein; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Einstein] I understand that  the issue of Jerusalem and the location of the Palestinian  economic authority were also discussed at the meeting of the  donor countries in Paris. I believe the issue first came up in  the document submitted by the PLO which stated that the economic  authority would be established in Jerusalem; however, you  managed to foil this intention and the economic authority will  be set up in Jericho.    [Savir] We told the Palestinians that we were very  interested in promoting the agreement between us. We said that  a great deal of time had been wasted over words and that we were  facing a test, a new reality, which would require patience since  things do not change for the better within a day. We said that  the time had come to improve conditions on the ground, and, at  the present stage, the autonomous areas were in the Gaza Strip  and Jericho. Second, we promised to cooperate in these efforts  on condition that they complied with the framework of the  Declaration of Principles [DOP]. According to the DOP, all the  autonomy institutions must be in the Gaza Strip or Jericho.  This was stated by the Norwegian chairman at the meeting and  also by Nabil Sha'th at the concluding news conference.    [Einstein] It was decided at the conference to transfer $42  million to the autonomy in order to meet expenses for the next  three months. What will happen after that?    [Savir] Look, there are commitments to provide $720 million  this year. The donor countries contributed $42 million for  current expenses above the $130 million previously agreed upon.  I think that at the beginning of the process, a greater  emphasis was placed on investments because the various countries  and their industries seek to profit from investing in joint  projects by Israel and the Palestinian autonomy in the  territories. I think that not enough thought was devoted to the  need to give the autonomy a chance to get itself established and  pay the first salaries before they can collect taxes and customs  duties. Afterwards, the autonomy will have to start financing  itself through taxes and its agreement with Israel. Also,  investments in infrastructure will improve financial conditions.  I believe that what is important is that the international  community gave this agreement a very great chance for success.  There are many areas of tension in the world but in this case  there was a meeting of representatives from over 40 countries,  led by the United States, the EC, Japan, the Scandinavian  countries and others, who said that they wanted the autonomy and  its relations with Israel to succeed, and the Palestinians will  now have to prove that these funds will indeed be used for the  development of the economy. It is important that everyone learn  to equate peace with economic improvement. That is the really  big test.    [Einstein] When will there be another conference of the  donor countries?    [Savir] Approximately one month from now in Paris. This  mechanism is very important not only to recruit contributions  and future investments but also to monitor the auditing  processes of the Palestinian economic institutions which are  currently being established. At the conference, the  Palestinians reported the establishment of their new economic  body PECDAR [Palestinian Economic Committee on Development and  Reconstruction]. The donor states insist on knowing where the  money is going and what the autonomy's budget is. They are  working closely with the World Bank and these issues will be  examined periodically and the Palestinians realize that they had  better cooperate in these processes. We should also help,  because ultimately the real test lies in bringing about an  economic improvement that leads to greater stability and  security.    Following the Israeli withdrawal and the PLO's assumption of  control in the area, the Palestinian residents will want to see  their lives improve. The international community will want to  examine these processes on a regular basis, at least at the  beginning. The atmosphere at the talks was very good. The  Palestinian delegation told us that a great deal of time had  recently been wasted on various statements and that we must  continue implementing and promoting the DOP in the field and get  back on track with regard to establishing an entirely new  relationship between the Palestinians and Israel.

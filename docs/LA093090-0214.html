			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> REMOVE THE BURDEN OF INEQUITY;  </P> <P> THE 1990 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IS CRUCIAL TO WOMEN TRYING TO BREAK INTO  HIGHER-PAYING JOBS.  </P> <P> The Civil Rights Act of 1990, passed with bipartisan support in the House and  Senate, would provide significant protection from workplace discrimination for,  among other beneficiaries, thousands of working women. The Bush Administration  persists in its threats to veto the act, repeating unfounded arguments that its  enactment will result in hiring quotas and will create a "lawyers' bonanza."  Those fears are groundless. If the President capitulates to scare tactics, he  will deny a necessary shield against employment discrimination and deepen  severe economic disadvantages women already suffer.  </P> <P> Women, like men, work because they and their families need paychecks to  survive. Today, almost half of all workers are women, and 72% of all mothers of  school-age children work outside their homes. Discrimination in employment  causes grievous suffering for these women; the children suffer, too, because  depriving mothers of the employment they need to support their families  handicaps the children as well.  </P> <P> The Civil Rights Act of 1990 would protect women against illegal discrimination  by reversing a 1989 Supreme Court decision, Ward's Cove vs. Antonio, which made  it more difficult for women to challenge employment policies that are  supposedly neutral, but, in fact, have an adverse impact predominantly on women  and minority employees.  </P> <P> An example of such a policy is a police department regulation imposing height  and weight minimums on all officers. Although policies of this kind may not  seem discriminatory on their face, they often operate to exclude a majority of  women (and men in some ethnic groups as well). Before Ward's Cove, a woman  could successfully challenge that policy as discriminatory if she proved that  the height and weight requirements barred most women from employment, and if  the police department could not prove that the requirements were necessary for  its operation. Ward's Cove greatly increased the burden of proof on the  employee who challenges as discriminatory such employer policies and practices.  </P> <P> For women struggling to break into the ranks of traditionally male occupations,  which usually pay considerably more than traditionally female jobs, the Ward's  Cove decision struck a harsh blow. These women need the Civil Rights Act of  1990 to restore their ability to challenge unfair practices that keep so many  high-paying jobs off-limits to them.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the Bush Administration contend that overturning Ward's Cove  would result in employers imposing quotas by sex and race. No evidence supports  that argument. Employers did not resort to quotas before Ward's Cove changed  the law, and there is no factual basis to suspect that employers will do so if  Bush signs the 1990 act, restoring the situation that existed before Ward's  Cove.  </P> <P> The 1990 act would give women further protection by allowing victims of  intentional sex discrimination to sue their employers for damages. The Civil  Rights Act of 1964 provides no possibility of recovering damages to compensate  victims of proven sex discrimination who have thereby suffered loss or injury.  A separate statute provides victims of racial discrimination with an  opportunity to recover damages if they prove their cases.  </P> <P> In opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1990, the Administration contends that  women will get "multimillion-dollar" damage awards and make lawyers very rich.  The history of damage awards in race discrimination cases is directly to the  contrary. The Administration offers no explanation for its contention that  women, whatever their race or ethnicity, will be awarded huge damages when  neither men nor women who have suffered racial discrimination have received  such awards. What is it about working women that makes the Administration so  nervous?  </P> <P> The President should focus his attention on the cost to working women, to their  families, and to the national economy of allowing invidious discrimination to  go unremedied and undeterred. The nation relies on the labor of millions of  women and minority workers today, and the demographics tell us that we will  rely even more heavily on them well into the next century.  </P> <P> If the President is not moved to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1990 because it  is conscientiously right or because it is supported by both Democrats and  Republicans in Congress, he should sign it, because it is vital to the economic  health and productivity of our country.  </P></p>

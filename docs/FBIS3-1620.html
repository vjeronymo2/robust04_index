Ma Yongwei, president of the bank, said his bank will become  two banks later this year in accordance with the government's  call to separate the functions of government mandated  agricultural loans and commercial lending.    Ma said the split of his bank's business will not hurt  future  development.    The two banks will be the Agricultural Development Bank and  a  new Agricultural Bank of China, the president said.    Ma said it plans to vigorously develop its commercial  business in foreign countries this year.    The Agricultural Bank of China will soon establish two  offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong to strengthen its presence in  areas where the bank's major partners are located.    It also plans to found three branches in New York, Hong Kong  and Singapore and issue corporate bonds in Western financial  markets this year. The move will further involve the  Agricultural Bank of China in foreign financial markets.    The Agricultural Bank of China's split follows the  government's decision to forbid State policy banks from  providing commercial loans.    Beginning this summer, the Agricultural Development Bank  will  fulfill the government's policy of supplying subsidized loans to  farmers.    The granting of long-term, low-interest loans to farmers  will  remain a fundamental function of the government, according to  bank officials. They noted that the 15-year-old economic reform  has raised farmers living standards substantially.    Bank analysts said the creation of the Agricultural  Development Bank is part of the government's efforts to back  agriculture while encouraging banks to do their business  according to commercial practices.    They noted many villages still remain undeveloped.</p>

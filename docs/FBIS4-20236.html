			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr.  Gheorghe Tinca, Romania's minister of national defense, handed  over Romania's presentation document regarding our country's  concrete participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] scheme  to Mr. Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO delegate secretary general.  The document basically lists the measures being adopted by  Romania to achieve the political goals of the Partnership as  well as the means and activities envisaged to implement the PFP  program.    On the occasion of the submission of the presentation  document, Mr. Tinca and Mr. Balanzino had an almost 40-minute  meeting devoted to relations between our country and NATO and to  the prospects of bilateral cooperation, including within the  framework of the positive implementation of the PFP.    During the talks, the sides assessed the contents of the  document, which will now be examined by the North Atlantic  alliance. Negotiations will be held with the Romanian delegation  in the next few weeks, after which NATO will submit its own  contribution to this cooperation. A program for a bilateral  partnership will be worked out between Romania and NATO. The  NATO delegate secretary general praised our country's presence  in the front-ranking group, since Romania was the first country  to sign the Partnership document and submitted the presentation  document two days after Poland. This is proof of our country's  seriousness on this matter.    After the document was handed over, the NATO delegate  secretary general and the Romanian minister of national defense  had a brief meeting with the press. On this occasion, they  emphasized the significance of this political act, which  reiterates Romania's active commitment to ensuring the success  of the PFP program as well as our country's firm desire to  deepen its integration into the political and military  structures of the North Atlantic alliance. This report has been  sent to us by press correspondent Andrei Barsan.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BES amendment withdrawn MR Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, said yesterday that he withdrew a controversial proposed amendment to the finance bill to 'thwart' Labour. His proposal was that investors in a business expansion scheme where shares were issued after December 31 1992 should lose relief on a loan taken up after June 30 this year. It would have denied relief to 55,000 investors. Mr Stern said he was concerned that Labour might win a vote on retrospective legislation to ban loan-back BES schemes at committee stage since some Tory MPs would be ineligible to vote because of their own investment in loan back BES schemes. He said he withdrew the proposal on Monday, at which stage it would have been too late for Labour to table a similar proposal. Labour said retrospective legislation would never have been acceptable, citing its own proposals to backdate the legislation which were ruled out of order.</p>

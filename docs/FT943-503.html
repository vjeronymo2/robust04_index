			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Luxury stores are hard hit Japanese consumers' growing appetite for discount shopping contributed to a decline in turnover at high-priced department stores and supermarkets last month. Sales at large retailers fell 1.7 per cent in the year to August, more than wiping out a 1.2 per cent rise in July that had appeared to break a 25-month run of declines. Department stores were hardest hit, with a 3.6 per cent sales fall, the International Trade and Industry ministry said. Supermarket sales stagnated. Discount stores have been the main beneficiary of a rise in consumer spending. Yet they are not included in government statistics on retailing, nor in official inflation measures. Consumer goods prices are falling by 0.4 per cent annually, twice as fast as shown by the latest government data, for July, a survey by Sanwa Research Institute shows. Sanwa estimates discounting is depressing GDP by 0.3 per cent a year. The rise in cheap imports is depriving Japanese manufacturers of 0.8 per cent of production, worth Y1,800bn (Pounds 11.6bn) a year, Sanwa believes.</p>

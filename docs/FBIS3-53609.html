According to a spokesman for the Afghan prime minister's  Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the president  should step down, a transitional government set up, a national  army formed, and elections held after six months.    Meanwhile the spokesman for Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic  Society  of Afghanistan] led by President Borhanoddin Rabbani, says Mr.  Rabbani will remain as president, and stressed that the  government will accept the ceasefire if the opponents remove  their heavy weapons from around Kabul.    This is at a time when it does not seem the two sides can  come to the negotiation table under the bases of conditions they  have proposed.    What complicates the situation is the two sides'  unwillingness to compromise under demands because of the  sensitivity and significance they attach to their political  positions.    It seems impossible to reach an agreement on the basis of  good will as long as a climate of forgiveness is not allowed to  prevail over the inter-Afghan parties' relations.    According to observers of Afghan affairs, a change in the  political situation in Kabul cannot help create peace and push  forward peace objectives either, because it is hard to conceive  an end to the war as long as political objectives are being  achieved through the use of arms and military force.    Experience, however, shows that under such difficult  conditions faced by Afghanistan, friendly and neighboring  countries -- not withstanding their divergent views of the sides  involved in the fighting -- have been able to persuade them to  hold negotiations. The ongoing war in Kabul will lead to the  same conclusion.    According to the special envoy of the Iranian foreign  minister to Kabul, all sides have welcomed the mediation efforts  of friendly and neighboring countries.    Mr. [Mohammad Ibrahim] Taherian [Iran's special envoy for  Afghan affairs] returned to Islamabad on 12 January after  meeting the leaders of the warring sides in Kabul. In an  interview, he said it is not ready to persuade the two sides to  hold negotiations.    He reiterated that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is trying to  create the ground for carrying out mediation between the Afghan  groups through consultations with the officials of the Pakistani  Foreign Ministry and other Islamic countries.</p>

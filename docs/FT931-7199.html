			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dell shares fall 17% as equity offer is dropped SHARES in Dell Computer, the fast-growing US personal computer manufacturer, plunged by almost 17 per cent yesterday after the company announced that it had withdrawn a planned share offering because of 'unfavourable market conditions'. The offering of 4m shares had originally been timed for last December but was put off until early March following controversy over the company's reporting of its foreign exchange dealings. Dell's share price had fallen from Dollars 49 1/8 at the start of this month to Dollars 36 1/4 on Tuesday amid growing concern that the personal computer industry's price war is set to intensify. Explaining the pulled issue, Mr Tom Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer, said 'with interest rates where they are and with currently low price/earnings multiples for technology stocks, we can do better for our shareholders by accessing other sources of capital'. He added: 'We have a strong financial position that allows us to take our time and pick the method for funding our growth that best fits our needs.' Dell, a pioneer in the direct selling of computers over the telephone, tried to reassure investors that its earnings momentum was continuing. It predicted that its revenue growth in the fiscal year to next January would exceed 70 per cent and would make Dell a Dollars 3.4bn to Dollars 3.7bn turnover business. It also forecast earnings per share of Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 3.75 for 1993-94, compared to analysts' expectation of around Dollars 2.57 in the year to last month. Despite this, investors remained nervous at the outlook for the personal computer market and Dell's shares closed yesterday on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market at Dollars 30 1/8 , down Dollars 6 1/8 . The market was particularly unsettled by reports that Mr Daniel Benton, a computer analyst at Goldman,Sachs, yesterday removed his 'buy' recommendation on both Dell and its rival Compaq. Goldman had been acting as lead underwriter for the Dell offering and had been prevented from commenting on the company until the issue was cancelled. The currency controversy which led to the initial delay in the offering arose last November when a Wall Street analyst suggested Dell might have inflated earnings through its method of accounting for foreign exchange trading. Dell denied this, and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did not find any reason for the company to restate its earnings. However, the SEC did require Dell to make additional disclosures about its currency trading practices. Dell also announced yesterday that it would release its fourth quarter results on March 9 but it added that it did not expect any appreciable change from the projections announced on February 1, when it forecast revenues of Dollars 615m, slightly below analysts' expectations, but more than double the previous year.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Coventry advances 27% to Pounds 16.5m Coventry Building Society yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.5m for the first half of 1994. Against a background of intense competition for personal savings, the society took in only Pounds 43m in net retail receipts - including interest added to savings accounts - against Pounds 187m last time. Mr Martin Ritchley, chief executive, said that the sector as a whole had suffered an outflow in the first half of the year. The society is expected to pursue retail deposits more aggressively in the second half of the year. He emphasised, however, the importance Coventry attaches to raising money on the wholesale markets, which is cheaper at present, to fund its mortgage lending. Mortgage lending was slightly higher in the first half of the year, at Pounds 216m (Pounds 208m). Provisions against bad and doubtful mortgage debts fell to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.2m). Total assets rose to Pounds 3.05bn (Pounds 2.82bn). There has been speculation that Coventry, the UK's 15th largest society, would be a potential target for a bank or other financial institution. But Mr Ritchley said its results showed it was able successfully to maintain its independence.</p>

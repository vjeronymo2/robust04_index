			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eldad Beck] </F>   [Text] Bassam Abu-Sharif, one of Yasir 'Arafat's advisers,  has placed the blame for the Hebron massacre on the Israeli  Government. He says that this morning's incidents reinforce the  PLO's demand for international supervision to guarantee the  safety and well-being of the Palestinian residents of the  territories. Abu-Sharif was asked to comment on the Israeli  argument that the massacre was committed by a mentally ill  person. The following is his reaction.    [Begin Abu-Sharif recording, in English] Well, we have seen  such statements before. When the intifadah began, an Israeli  soldier stopped a bus with 60 Palestinian workers on it and  machine-gunned them. That is an old story. Actually, the  Israeli Government is responsible, whether this man is  unbalanced or balanced. I think he is balanced. He is an  extremist, and the more the Israelis maneuver around and linger  in implementing the agreement that was signed in Washington, the  more ground they give to their extremists.

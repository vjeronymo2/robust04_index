			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> A suspect's fingerprints were found on a piece of tape gagging a murder victim,  a sheriff's deputy told a judge Monday.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Robert Stahl Jr. listened to three witnesses at a  brief preliminary hearing before ordering Alan Buzzard Stevens, 46, of San  Marcos to stand trial for the murder of Cynthia McVey, 26, of Livermore.  </P> <P> McVey was vacationing in San Diego County when she was strangled. Her body was  found Nov. 29 off California 76 on the Pala Indian Reservation.  </P> <P> Stevens is a potential suspect in the killings of several prostitutes in North  County, but so far has only been charged with the slaying of McVey.  </P> <P> Sheriff's detective Sam Bove testified that Stevens' fingerprints match those  found on the tape that covered the victim's mouth.  </P> <P> Dr. Ronald Rivers, who performed the autopsy, said McVey had been strangled by  hand. Rivers said that, because of the position of the body, he suspected that  McVey was killed elsewhere and then dumped at the site where the body was  found.  </P> <P> Stevens trial date will be set at an April 3 arraignment. He remains in County  Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 9 TASS -- The Russian opposition called  for early presidential elections in Russia as it rallied in  Moscow on Monday to celebrate V-Day.    The rally was led by former Vice-President Aleksandr  Rutskoy,  Communist die-hard Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov and other  members of the opposition. The demonstrators marched from the  Byelorussky Railway Station in the northwest of the Russian  capital to Manezh Square outside the Kremlin and then to  Lubyanka Square near the former KGB headquarters.    Rutskoy called on the demonstrators to "meet the 50th  anniversary of the victory over the Nazi by a victory over the  present regime." He stressed that there is still enough time to  understand "whether we want to go on living like this,"  referring to the disintegration of the Soviet empire.    Other speakers called on all opposition forces to unite in  order to win the upcoming presidential elections.    Umalatova announced her decision to run for presidency, but  at the same time recommended former Soviet Prime Minister  Nikolay Ryzhkov for the post of president.    Labour Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the opposition  has got its own leaders, namely Umalatova and infamous Nina  Andreyeva.    He urged his supporters to begin preparations for the  presidential elections due to take place in 1996 and suggested  compiling lists of candidates for preliminary voting. "Let the  people themselves choose their candidate to the supreme state  post," Anpilov said.    Konstantinov, leader of the National Salvation Front,  stressed that "it is time to set up a single, well-organised  opposition movement and set forth a clear-cut programme of  action." He said "there is no confidence that the next  presidential elections will take place in 1996 as planned."    Konstantinov said the opposition's immediate goal is to  unite  its forces and collect one million signatures required for  holding a referendum on early presidential elections.    According to various reports, the rally gathered about 7,000  people. Among its organisers are the party Vozrozhdeniye  (Revival), the standing presidium of the Congress of Soviet  People's Deputies, the Labour Russia movement, the All-Russia  People's Union and the Agrarian Party of Russia.    The Union of Army Officers led by Stanislav Terekhov also  took part in the rally. The union's members and war veterans  were expected to march to Manezh Square together with the  opposition and then part with them to lay wreaths at the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall.</p>

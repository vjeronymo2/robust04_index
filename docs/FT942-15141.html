			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: For this relief - some thanks - Serious Money Two cheers] The government's belated and partial climb-down on capital gains tax indexation losses is a blow for fairness and common sense. The proposal in the November Budget means you can still adjust the base cost of gains to allow for inflation, but you cannot similarly adjust losses or turn a nominal gain into an inflation-adjusted loss. This new discrimination undermines one of the basic objectives of stock market investment: managing a portfolio in which the winners outstrip the inevitable losers. This week's proposed concession, allowing individual investors to index up to Pounds 10,000 of losses over 1993-94 and 1994-95 will be a boon to people sufferring an embarrassment of unrelieved gains. (See page IX for the precise mechanics). Just one gripe. Would it not have been even fairer to cancel the proposal altogether as far as individual investors are concerned? After all, it was abuse by companies, not individuals, which prompted the Budget move in the first place. Now let us look another gift horse in the mouth. Why is it that the competitive price-cutting in the personal equity plan market has focused on initial, not annual, charges? Several unit trust managers have cut or eliminated the initial charges on Peps, the fastest-growing part of the market. Annual charges have not been cut; indeed, they have in some cases been increased. But it is annual charges which make the bigger dent in the long-term return on your investments. This is particularly true for income funds, especially in a low-inflation, low interest-rate climate. Take, for example, an annual charge of just 1.5 per cent - quite common for Peps. It can knock more than a quarter off the value of your investment in just 20 years. And it is surprising how fast a fund which combines an initial charge with a relatively modest annual charge will catch up with a 'no load' fund with a higher annual levy. Our chart* shows what might happen to a couple of funds with different charging structures over a 20-year period. The first is M&amp;G Managed Income, a Pep which trumpets the fact that it has no initial charge. But it does have penalties for early surrender and a 1.5 per cent annual levy. The second is M&amp;G Dividend, which has a conventional 5 per cent initial charge coupled with an annual charge of only 0.75 per cent. We did not fuss about minor charges and have assumed growth of 6 per cent a year. After six years, the fund with an initial charge has caught up with its 'no-load' rival; after 20, it has outstripped it comfortably. What makes this particular comparison interesting is that M&amp;G Dividend is one of the funds in which M&amp;G Managed Income invests. Unless Income excels, you would be better off in the Dividend fund. Not that M&amp;G's annual charges are unusually high. And, to set our example into context, we have made similar projections for one of the highest-charging funds in the business. Knight Williams, which sells mainly to elderly people, levies an initial 6.375 per cent on its funds and has an annual charge of 2.5 per cent. Together, these charges eat up more than 40 per cent of your investment over the 20 years. But, again, it is the above-average annual charge that does most damage in the long term. What is obnoxious is not high charges as such but high charges not justified by good performance. A system of charging more common abroad than in Britain is performance-linking. This has a low basic annual fee, which moves up to a higher level if - and only if - the fund's investment performance tops some yardstick. It is a sensible formula for funds aiming to achieve capital growth. Why is it that so many annual fees have been creeping up? One common answer is that they are needed to keep the financial advisers sweet. Most fund management groups pay advisers initial commissions on Pep sales of 3 per cent plus renewal commissions of 0.5 per cent. Why? Because most fund management groups rely heavily on the advisers for sales. One sizeable group, Newton, has stood out against the demand for renewal commissions and got away with it. But, then, it does have a rather good performance record. Its annual charges are only 1.25 per cent, with one exception: it charges 1.5 per cent on the one fund for which it does pay a renewal commission. Here is one final sum on which to reflect. If we had drawn a line for 'Total commission to financial adviser' on our chart, it would have mopped up 12.5 per cent of your investment over the 20-year period. We do hope he is worth it. *Courtesy of GT Management.</p>

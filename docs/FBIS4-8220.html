			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zeljko Avramovic] </F>   [Text] Politics is primarily an ability to accomplish what  is possible to accomplish, and every political activity relying  on imaginary strongholds inevitably leads away from reality,  toward nothing. Returning to reality usually means (?returning  to the essence of the matter), which, like every other nucleus,  is covered in darkness.    This should have been borne in mind by those who, entering  political waters, assumed the responsibility of leading the  Albanian people in Kosovo toward the aim that, as everyone  knows, is outside the domain of serious political thinking. The  intoxicating seductiveness of the idea of Kosovo as an  independent state, which would be represented by these very  people in the capital cities of Europe and the world with the  accompanying sounds of an anthem and a guard of honor, is  returning to Rugova's supporters as a bitter pill that they do  not want to swallow but cannot spit out either.    The painful sobering up has divided the Kosmet [Kosovo-  Metohija] political elite. The rift in Rugova's Democratic  League of Kosovo and clashes between the party and the  government of the so-called republic of Kosovo that has been  concealed for a long time have escalated in the past few weeks.    The party was left by Jusuf Budzovi, Ismet Salihu, Ibrahim  Berisa, and Dr. Rexhep Islami. Rugova, Agani, and Hiseni have  stayed in the Presidency of the so-called republic of Kosova.  The clash between the government and the party leadership must  have reached the upper limit considering that Bujar Bukoshi,  prime minister of the self-declared Kosovo state, is being asked  to resign.    Shkelzen Malici is publicly saying that the government is  playing more the role of an improvised ministry for relations  with other countries than is making vital decisions. The  problem also arose as the consequences of the undefined  hierarchy and control within the secessionist leadership.    Ibrahim Rugova has so far been the untouchable boss. The  illegally elected parliament now formally no longer exists. The  so- called government has been reduced to the prime minister and  one minister, even though 17 ministries had been planned. So,  everyone is accountable to Rugova, and he is accountable to no  one.    Perhaps the motives for these clashes, whose cause is a lot  more deeper and is encroaching the most sensitive sphere, the  sphere of finances, should be sought in this backdrop. This is  supported by a statement by Fehmi Agani, who is still loyal to  Rugova. He said that the distribution of financial resources  and the collection of the compulsory 3-percent tax from the  workers of Albanian nationality in the country and outside it  are beyond control.    Rexhep Cosia, who split with Rugova earlier, holds the same  view. The proximity of money is directly proportionate to the  proximity of authority and every separation from it leads to  resistance and proofs that something is wrong with the present  authorities.    The former self-proclaimed prime minister Jusuf Zeinulahu  also spoke up recently. He admitted what he had been aware of  right from the beginning. According to him, the Assembly and  the Government of the so-called republic of Kosovo were formed  ad hoc with directives from the political parties of Albanians,  and are not legitimate. Zeinulahu's public statement about  something that many people were aware of has stirred the spirits  in the leadership of the so-called Albania alternative and  opened the road to the struggle to preserve the present  positions, while creating covers in retreat. In this light one  should view the participation in the debate in KOHA by the  former high official of the Central Committee of the League of  Communists and the spectacular return of Veton Suroi, who left a  long time ago.    That something strange is happening is also confirmed by  separate visits to the United States, first by Bukoshi, and then  Rugova, and the statement by the former, which was not approved  of by the Democratic League of Kosovo. In an interview for the  Voice of America, Bukoshi said that the status of an autonomous  region for Kosovo can be accepted as the first step toward the  ultimate solution of the Kosovo issue. This statement  represents a major turnabout in relation to the sacred stand  hitherto on Kosovo as an independent state. This raises the  question as to why a section of the Albanian political  leadership has redefined its position and accepted the existence  of Yugoslavia and a dialogue with its legal organs.    It is difficult to believe that this a result of regret or  bad conscience before one's own nation whom they pushed into an  abyss. One could say that this is more a result of the unwilling  acceptance of the fact that, on the one hand, no country in the  world recognized Kosovo as an independent state, and on the  other, that the state of Yugoslavia is sufficiently strongly  standing on its legs, and that it is capable of thwarting the  political exhibitionism of forced secession without difficulties.    In these circumstances an increasing number of Kosmet  Albanian politicians and intellectuals are trying to extend  their political activities with conciliatory stands.  Belligerent statements and the policy of extreme demands have  not yielded any results, and the advocates of the idea that the  page should be turned over, or even begin writing a new book of  political activities by Albanians in Kosovo, are becoming  increasingly vociferous.</p>

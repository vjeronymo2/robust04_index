			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A break for coffee - A man causing a stir in street catering If David Humphries has his way, the dingy street carts which dispense greasy hamburgers, hot dogs and onions on the streets of London will be replaced by sleek machines dispensing coffee and croissants. Humphries, a former journalist, believes London is under-espressoed. For such a gastronomic transformation, the British public would thank the people of Seattle, Humphries' home town, which is now the coffee capital of the US. Humphries, a former employee of the Associated Press news agency and senior editor at Penthouse magazine in New York, came to the UK in 1989 when his wife was posted to London by her company. Having left Seattle in 1984 he noticed on return visits that the city was becoming gripped by coffee-mania. This began in 1982 when Nordstrum, the city's biggest department store, opened an espresso cart outside its main store. Others were quick to follow and soon there were more than 1,000 carts. Today, the downtown area is said to have a cart every 300ft and there is even one on a boat to service the yachts in the city's port. Two factors accounted for this growth, explosive even in a country where coffee is the national beverage. The first was the popularity in Seattle of latte, a drink of hot, steamed milk added to espresso topped with milk froth. Second was the arrival of Italian syrups - such as almond, cinnamon or hazelnut - with which to flavour cappuccinos. Drinking Italian-style coffee became fashionable and Seattle even has drive-in espresso carts. Set-up costs are relatively low. In Seattle, about Dollars 10,000 buys (from one of the city's 40 manufacturers) a cart that includes a sink with running water, a drainage tank, refrigerator, water storage tank and electric power panel. Then you need a power supply, a permit, and somewhere to park the cart at night. And, most importantly, the right site - as Humphries was to discover. When, on a subsequent trip to Seattle, he heard of an espresso cart which had paid for itself after a month because of its location, he placed an order for one to be shipped to London early in 1992. But, on returning to look for a site, he ran into a big problem. His preferred sites - outside the Tate Gallery, on Oxford Street or Piccadilly - were vetoed by local councillors. No new permits for street carts were being issued, and existing ones were guarded jealously by those who held them. The imminent arrival of his cart forced Humphries into taking a site inside the London Pavilion at Piccadilly Circus. Then he discovered the King's Road shopping mall in Chelsea and tried to convince its manager of the profit they could share from an espresso cart - but instead he walked out a restaurateur. Regulations forbade any carts dispensing food and drink, but the basement restaurant was being vacated, so Humphries moved in to convert Londoners to flavoured cappuccinos and lattes. A friend from Seattle helped him develop a blend after a month during which they sat through 14 different tastings at a coffee specialist in Soho. Today, with four outlets - the others are in the Plaza shopping arcade, Oxford Street, in the heart of the West End, plus two carts in the City at the Broadgate development, next to Liverpool Street station  - he has a monthly coffee bill of more than Pounds 2,000. In its first year, the company's turnover was Pounds 340,000; in its second, it is on track to top Pounds 1.5m. Margins on an espresso are big: a 3p cost turns into a 60p sale, and returns from one operator can be big. If the site is right, the daily gross profit can be Pounds 200-300. But the number of customers must be high and consistent. Humphries had one setback: a fifth outlet in Camden Town proved unsuccessful because the area is busy only on Saturdays and Sundays. As a result, he closed it after Christmas. But in the basement of the Plaza arcade, where he pays 18 per cent of gross turnover as rent, the site is very busy throughout the week - particularly as it is located right opposite the down escalators. Humphries' original espresso cart finally found a home in March 1993 at Broadgate (for which he needed permission from the developer, not the council). At 7am, queues of office workers wait for the kiosk to open and it stays busy until 8pm, seven days a week - especially now the development's ice rink is open. Spurred by such slogans as 'Cappuccino makes you smarter than you really are]' customers buy more than 1,000 cups of coffee on a busy day. Having found that office workers are a perfect market, Humphries would like to operate espresso carts in a ring around Liverpool Street. Having now designed his own cart, he is negotiating to place them in such outlets as department stores and cinemas - even with a transport company. And, in March 1995, he plans to install a cart in a shopping mall in Calais, France. Humphries has no desire to control a large organisation and has his eye on granting franchises. He cites Grinding it Out - written by Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's - as one of the seminal books of the 20th century, and believes that espresso carts selling up-market, high-quality food and drink could well be the franchise vehicles of the 1990s. There is another compelling reason for that. Humphries says an espresso cart, fully equipped and ready to roll, should cost less than Pounds 20,000  -rather less expensive than the sum you need to open a McDonald's franchise.

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / French GDP down in first quarter France's gross domestic product fell in real terms by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, up from the provisional estimate of 0.5 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics institute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. News of the weaker figures took a toll on the Paris stock market where the CAC 40 Index fell by 0.51 per cent to 2,128.20. The impact of the Insee figures was aggravated by investors taking profits after the market's rise in the past fortnight.</p>

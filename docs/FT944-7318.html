			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Pay deal averts Yarrow strike A strike by shipyard workers at Yarrow on the Clyde has been averted after a pay deal was agreed yesterday. The self-financing two-year agreement for hourly paid workers will give them 3 per cent this year and the same next year. A profit-related pay scheme will operate for this year only. In return, unions have agreed to a series of productivity improvements.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Maastricht targets upset EC THE DIFFICULTIES of European Community countries in meeting the economic convergence targets specificed by the Maastricht treaty could hold up moves towards economic and monetary union, the IMF suggests. Of the 12 nations, only Luxembourg meets all four targets on the basis of its economic performance last year. Five countries - France, Germany, the UK, Denmark and Ireland - meet three of the criteria. Belgium and the Netherlands satisfy only two, Spain meets one, and Italy, Greece and Portugal fail on all four. The relevant criteria, given as guidelines in the treaty, are that consumer price inflation must not exceed by more than half a percentage point the average for the three member states with the lowest inflation rates; interest rates on long-term government securities must not be more than two percentage points higher than those in the same three member states; general government deficit is limited to 3 per cent or less of GDP; and the public debt/GDP ratio should be less than 60 per cent. In 1992, Britain failed the targets because of its large government deficit, as did France. Germany fell down on its inflation record; Denmark and Ireland failed to meet the target on government debt.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Brussels kills off slaughterhouse profits - Closures are multiplying as Britain's abattoir industry is forced to raise standards A COUPLE of months ago, the local commission agent for a quality meat scheme came to our farm to see if we were interested in a premium price for the last of our 1991 lambs. He had heard that the 100 or so animals we had left from the previous season had been fed entirely on turnips and sugar beet tops through the winter, and that they had been given no concentrate feed. This meant, he told us, that, provided they were of sufficient quality, they would qualify for a 6 per cent premium over average market price. You don't get many offers like that in farming these days, so we were bound to take him seriously. Even so, we took the precaution of checking on the credit-worthiness of the eventual buyers and talking to a few farmers who had previously supplied them to ensure there had been no payment problems. All seemed well, and we agreed to sell the lambs at the said premium. Two days later, the lorry arrived to collect the lambs, and off they went to the abattoir. Two days after that, it was announced on the BBC's early morning farming radio programme that the company which had taken them had called in the receiver. Now, two months after that, we are still waiting to hear if we are likely to be paid anything for the lambs, and, if so, what proportion of their total value of close to Pounds 4,000. I am not optimistic. Because of the relatively modest amount of money involved, we are unlikely to be dragged down in the classic domino effect that characterises such business failures. But we were relatively lucky. Another Norfolk farmer stands to lose Pounds 72,000 from the same collapse, and yet another Pounds 260,000 from the bankruptcy of an even bigger meat company that went under a few weeks later. I am not sure how they will cope. It is estimated, in fact, that about 90 UK abattoirs have closed in the last 12 months, and, according to a new report by the Meat and Livestock Commission, a further 350 are likely to go out of business within the next two years. That implies that about half of the 700 or so abattoirs in operation at the moment will go. Only 12 years ago, this country had almost 1,200 abattoirs. The slaughter industry is, in fact, squeezed between the costs of complying with European Community regulations and the reluctance, or more accurately, refusal, of the big wholesale buyers to pay more for meat. Moreover, 1992 is a crunch year, because, by January 1, 1993, all UK abattoirs must comply with the European Commission's Fresh Meat Directive, which requires that the standard of all slaughtering facilities throughout the community be harmonised. That is not to say, as the MLC report makes clear, that standards currently imposed in the UK are any danger to public health. Indeed, all abattoirs have had to be licensed, inspected and approved regularly by local authorities for many years. The EC now requires, however, that so-called 'export standards' be met, even when the meat is for domestic consumption. It is the expense involved in bringing plants up to this level that is causing many of the closures. In the past only a small proportion of the abattoirs in the UK were export-approved. This was because, historically, the UK had been an importer, rather than an exporter, of meat, and few abattoir-owners felt it worthwhile to spend the significant sums required to be otherwise. Now they have to do so or go out of business. Indeed, some abattoir-owners have recently taken the necessary measures. They have brought their plants up to the required standard and, in many cases, have increased their capacity in order to justify the expenditure. This means they are now forced to buy additional prime stock to keep their slaughter lines running. But in the meantime a shortage of supplies has occurred. Poor profitability last year led to a reduction in the pig-breeding herd. Then the dreaded blue-ear disease cut the numbers reaching maturity this year, both here in Britain and in other EC countries that normally export to the UK. The disease is still decimating herds in some regions, and now another, equally serious, flu-like virus, which can also be fatal to small pigs, is adding to farmers' and abattoir-owners' problems. Inevitably, given the keen demand from expanded abattoirs, combined with the shortage of stock, the price of those pigs that are available has risen, much to the satisfaction, I might add, of farmers who have managed to stay free of disease. But the supermarkets, who are the main customers of many of the upgraded abattoirs, have declined to pay extra for their supplies on the grounds that this would force them to raise retail prices and risk provoking consumer resistance. Similarly, although the ex-farm price of fresh English lamb is still insufficient to provide a reasonable profit for sheep farmers, now that the EC variable premium has been abolished, supermarkets find that they can buy frozen New Zealand lamb much cheaper and are turning to these imports in increasing quantities in order, they say, to help the housewife economise. The number of home-produced lambs has also fallen slightly this year in response to EC measures to restrict the size of flocks by limiting ewe headage payments to 500 head per farmer. All of which is bad news for the abattoir industry. In the short term, at least, it is also bad news for farmers like me. For, although I accept that the rationalisation of the UK slaughtering sector may be long overdue, I am now faced with the unpalatable possibility of not being paid for animals I have taken months or years to rear. Indeed, I may well be forced to accept lower prices for those animals from abattoirs I know to be solvent, instead of trying to strike the best possible bargain. And, in case you were wondering, the cost of credit insurance against abattoir failure has become prohibitive, always assuming you can actually find someone willing to write it.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] North Korea, claiming that it has not agreed that  the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South  should be a precondition for the third round of North Korea-U.S.  high-level talks, is delaying allowing the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] to extract test material from major nuclear  facilities, thus laying a stumbling block.    Hearing the report from relevant authorities on the  afternoon  of 8 March that a stumbling block is laid on IAEA's nuclear  inspection now ongoing in North Korea, the government discussed  measures for this, and decided to reconfirm that North-South  special envoy exchange is the precondition for North Korea-U.S.  talks.    On 8 March, a high-ranking government official said that  "North Korea, contrary to its previous promise, is claiming that  the inspection of the core facilities, including 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor and a radiochemical laboratory, should be  conducted at the end of the schedule, thus making the  inspection, including extraction of test material, delayed."    This official pointed out that "North Korea, claiming that  the North-South special envoy exchange is not a precondition for  the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, threatened  that if the United States continually insists on special envoy  exchange as the precondition for the talks, North Korea will not  allow the inspection of core facilities."    The official noted that "the inspection team, changing its  original plan, is continuing inspection activities, including  replacement of batteries of surveillance cameras installed in  the other five nuclear facilities. Whether North Korea will  reject the inspection of core facilities to the end or not is a  matter that we should continually watch."    This government official stressed that "during the recent  New  York working-level contact with the United States, North Korea  agreed that the North-South special envoy exchange must be  realized before the third round of talks." Thus, he reconfirmed  it is the firm position of the ROK and the United States that  the third round of high-level talks will be held only after the  special envoy exchange is realized.    In particular, the government is going to reconfirm this  existing position during forthcoming talks with Robert Galluci,  U.S. assistant secretary of state, for readjustment of the  positions of the ROK and the United States toward the third  round of talks.    The official also noted that "as the special envoy exchange  is clearly a precondition for the third round of talks, it is  not necessary for us to raise a specific demand that the special  envoy exchange must be realized before the third round of talks  during the working contact with North Korea slated for 9 March."  He added that "whether or not North Korea sincerely accepts  nuclear inspection as previously promised and respond to special  envoy exchange is a matter which North Korea should decide  according to necessity for a third round of high-level talks."    However, North Korea, in a statement issued in the name of  Kang Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister, on 4 March,  threatened that if the United States continually maintains that  the envoy exchange must be realized before third round of talks,  North Korea cannot satisfactorily ensure the inspection by IAEA.</p>

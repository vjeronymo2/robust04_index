			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Fujitsu staff go it alone In Japan, where lifetime employment is the norm and people tend to be paid on seniority rather than merit, leaving the corporate fold to set up a risky new business is almost unheard of. But Fujitsu, the computer company, wants to encourage some of its 54,000 Japanese employees to do just that and maybe help them become rich in the process. As part of its campaign to make staff more flexible, it will put up money for them to strike out on their own to develop new technology products and services. The idea of corporate venturing is well established in the US and, to a lesser extent, in the UK. Despite the absence in Japan of a widespread venture capital mentality, Toru Katsurada, Fujitsu's planning and personnel director, hopes technology experts can be spurred to develop an aggressive entrepreneurial streak. The programme, called new venture system, is still at an embryonic stage, with only two projects (still confidential) under consideration. It was announced last month and, believes Katsurada, is virtually unique in Japan. For every venture it approves - up to five are expected to be launched each year - it will match funds from the ex-Fujitsu owner, who will own 51 per cent. 'It's a high-risk, high-return programme,' he adds. 'We might lose an excellent engineer and incur a large loss if the venture fails - but we might be able to introduce new products as a result of this system.' Fujitsu will expect each venture to start making profits after three years. Because Japanese stock market listing requirements are so strict, start-up companies cannot easily use flotation as a way to take profits. So if the owner wants to sell, Fujitsu will buy the shares at a 'very high' negotiated price, if justified. The ventures could be in any area of information technology, says Katsurada.</p>

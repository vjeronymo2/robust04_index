			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / New plan for Olympic Airways Greece is due to present a revised plan for restructuring Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier, to the European Commission today. The government wants permission from the Commission to write off more than Dr400bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in accumulated debt and provide a capital injection for the company. The restructuring calls for cutting over 1,200 jobs, eliminating almost all long-haul routes and reducing the size of Olympic's fleet. In addition, wages would be frozen for up to four years. Olympic's unions have accepted the need for restructuring, including some job losses, but oppose the wage freeze.</p>

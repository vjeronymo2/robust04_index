			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 14: Big potential despite difficulties - Poland / Western companies and individuals are seeking to establish a presence THE recent Polish elections led to an even more divided parliament and a new government - further underlining the country's already considerable political uncertainties. The programme of privatisation of state corporations seems to have stalled, at least temporarily. And there is confusion over the progress of the draft legislation relating to the restitution of land to its former owners. In addition, there is no similar concept to that of freehold although foreigners are able to acquire the right to the long-term use of land. Yet despite all this, Poland, with its population of some 36m, is undoubtedly a potentially large market. And it is a Polish development that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has chosen as its first real estate financing project. EBRD - with a loan of Dollars 65.6m together with a 12 per cent equity investment of Dollars 3m, part of which will be syndicated to other banks - will help finance a 40-storey, 75,000 sq m office building in the centre of Warsaw. The National Bank of Poland will occupy one third of the space. The developer is Emilii Plater Partners, a joint venture between the National Bank and the Golub Epstein Partnership - which is a US joint venture between two Chicago-based companies. The remaining space, says the EBRD, will be let to both foreign and Polish organisations. However it seems likely that the overwhelming majority of demand will come from foreign companies. Warsaw, unlike Prague and Budapest, is not a beautiful city. It was almost completely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt under communism. Built on a grid system, with no identifiable central area, much of it is still dismal and depressing. There is an acute shortage of good quality office space and considerable demand resulting in 'artificially high' rents, according to Mr Angus McIntosh of Healey &amp; Baker. For example, a rent of DM85 a sq m a month has just been achieved in the LIM Centre, one of Warsaw's few modern developments. Taking its name from its three joint venture development partners - LOT, the Polish airline, Ilbau the Austrian contractor and Marriott the hotel chain - it consists of a 520-room hotel, 13,400 sq m of offices (of which LOT occupies about 7,000 sq m) and 4, 200 sq m of retail space. The offices are full and the hotel occupancy high. Rents and hotel bills are paid from western accounts in hard currency. Funding came from the Austrian Girozentrale Vienna and, encouraged by LIM's success, the bank is involved with two further real estate projects in Poland. The first is a speculative office building of 16,700 sq m in Warsaw, not far from the LIM Centre, which is just about to get underway. Again, Ilbau is a partner. The second, in Szczecin, is far more ambitious. In this town close to the German border and an 1 1/2 hours drive from Berlin, work is proceeding on a 402-room five-star hotel to be operated by the US Radisson group, 25,000 sq m of offices, 3,000 sq m of shops and a casino. The main office tenant and development partner will be the Polish Steamship Company. The remainder will be let to western companies at rents anticipated to be in the region of DM40 a sq m a month. Girozentrale is putting up a syndicated loan of DM170m, part of which is guaranteed by the Austrian State Export Promotion Bank. And in addition it is providing equity of DM85m. Dr Alexander Auboech of Girozentrale admits that it is a 'huge' complex for a town with a population of just 400,000. But it will, he considers, create a new town centre, just as LIM did in Warsaw. Much of Poland's infrastructure is not up to western standards, but its public transport system is generally good, says Mr McIntosh. Healey &amp; Baker is marketing the US Business Centre, a 25,000 sq m office development on behalf of a US consortium. A five-minute taxi ride south of the LIM Centre, the development adjoins the new Polytechnika metro station. The agent reports 'serious interest' with heads of terms agreed with some 10 companies ahead of a construction start. Western trading, manufacturing, and technology companies and a whole range of consultants and professionals have either set up or are seeking to establish a presence in Poland. Although the UK organisations are there with the rest, their involvement in property development is fairly limited. Even contractor Higgs &amp; Hill, which is undertaking refurbishment at the British Embassy and should be well-placed to take advantage of local opportunities, has apparently yet to do so. It also seems that UK banks and institutions have politely turned down invitations to subscribe to funds seeking to invest in Poland. However, interest from the UK with its large number of expatriates is evident. Mr Jan Chudzynski, who heads the newly-launched property consultancy Dauntons Gerald Eve, considers that increasing numbers of UK business and property people are taking a look. He cites the regular meetings of the 'Pink Club' at the British Embassy in Warsaw. In 1989, he says, only six to 10 people used to turn up. Nowadays it is 50 to 60. And Mr Phil Hudson, senior partner of specialist eastern European property consultancy East 8, which has compiled a series of detailed reports on real estate development in former eastern European countries, notes that more copies of the Polish report have been sold than any of the others.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 10 per cent of first of a building               year's rent + 25 per cent VAT  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Fees variable: each deal is arranged of a building               individually  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Fees variable: each deal is arranged or owner/occupier           individually  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Land registry: 3 per cent (payable by or owner/occupier           corporations acquiring property)                             Property tax: 2.5 per cent on annual basis                             (payable by corporations acquiring property)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lansana Kouyate, the deputy UN secretary </F> general's special representative in Mogadishu, by correspondent  Assane Diop; place and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] The deputy UN secretary general's special  representative in Mogadishu, Lansana Kouyate, is the guest of  RFI this evening [passage omitted]. How is the latest UN  resolution being greeted in Mogadishu?    [Kouyate] The resolution adopted by the UN Security Council  is the one needed by Somalia today because it is absolutely  necessary to put things in perspective. The international  community is unable to impose peace on a population that will  reject it. This is the sine qua non condition for this peace to  be workable. The Somalis must take their fate in their own  hands. I believe that this concept has been understood by the  Security Council.    [Diop] So the issue of the disarming will recede into the  background; you are saying that the international community  cannot impose peace if the Somalis do not want it while, in  fact, those who are blocking peace, or rather the one who is  blocking peace now is mainly General Aidid.    [Kouyate] Yes, certainly. Now all Somalis must be invited to  sit down together, and this is where the diplomatic and  political roles will be underlined. They must patiently be made  to understand that they have to sit around the same table. I  believe that the incident with the Somali National Alliance was  unfortunate, firstly, because it did not happen in the framework  of a national disarmament plan, and also because it was focussed  too much on Mogadishu, this gave the impression of a war against  one man only, against one faction only. I believe that this  needs correcting first.    [Diop] The United Nations is still considering this  roundtable between all Somalis, including General Aidid. For  his part, General Aidid, who keeps playing the spoilsport, is  considering turning against the United Nations once the Western  contingents have left. Aren't we moving toward a dead end with  this man?    [Kouyate] There are rumors that the situation will get  worse.  I believe that, politically, we must cool things down, that the  Somalis must know that their fate will not be decided before 30  March, but also after it, and that it is in their hands.  Therefore, all the threats emanating from the Somali National  Alliance may be groundless. One should not add fuel to the  flames now, one should tread carefully. That being said, it is  true that General Aidid refuses to get in touch with the United  Nations today; however in Somalia, as elsewhere, changes occur  all the time.    I believe that the Security Council's reassessment of  options  for Somalia and the reinsertion of these in the framework of  diplomatic and political action is also an asset. General  Aidid, who was being hunted, is now free to move; the Somali  National Alliance prisoners held by UNOSOM [UN Operation in  Somalia] have been freed, and this new resolution is stressing  the diplomatic and political approach. These are real assets.  The United Nations is also making a huge effort to set up  police forces. We have already received all the necessary  equipment, uniforms, weapons, vehicles. I believe that we are  doing tremendous work there. I believe that those who are  opposing this will be [words indistinct] Somali forces but not  the United Nations.</p>

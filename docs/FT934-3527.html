			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: London Industrial raises Pounds 14m in placing London Industrial, a property company specialising in small working units, yesterday raised Pounds 14m through a share placing with institutions. Mr Harry Platt, managing director, described the company as 'a provider of starter homes for small businesses.' The placing through Smith New Court of 5.05m ordinary shares at 320p each, values the company at Pounds 29.3m. Of this 4.58m are new shares, with the remainder from existing shareholders. Pro forma net tangible assets after the placing are Pounds 28.8m, equivalent to net asset value per share of 315p. The money raised will be used to finance the purchase of four estates, including one in Stevenage, the first outside the M25, for a total of Pounds 8.5m. The remainder will be used on capital expenditure and further expansion. While gearing will fall from 167 per cent at the end of September to 80 per cent after the placing, the company plans long term gearing of about 100 per cent. The company was established in 1986 when 12 institutions subscribed Pounds 16.7m to acquire 18 estates from the Greater London Council's industrial property portfolio. It has since expanded through acquisitions, joint ventures and extensions. Before the latest acquisitions, which will be concluded shortly, the portfolio comprised 27 estates with 900 units and 700 tenants. The average unit is 1,000 sq ft, with an average rent of Pounds 6.71 per sq ft. Mr Platt said the occupancy rate of the original 18 estates had been 72 per cent when the company started, and had risen to 95 per cent before the recession. He believed the bottom of the market had been reached in the summer of 1991, when the rate fell to 75 per cent. The company total for its 27 estates is now 77 per cent. He was confident that the company, which has overhead staffing of 17 people, could almost double the amount of property managed without increasing overheads. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 355,000 on rental income of Pounds 2.53m in the six months ot September 30. In the last full year pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.03m on rental income of Pounds 4.76m. The board intends to recommend a final dividend of 5p for the year to end March, giving a total of 7p. Dealings in the shares are expected to begin next Wednesday.</p>

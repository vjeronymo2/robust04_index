			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: FICTION FOR YOUNG READERS;  </P> <P> ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS BY SCOTT O'DELL ILLUSTRATED BY TED LEWIN (HOUGHTON  MIFFLIN: $18.95; 181 PP.; ALL AGES)  </P> <P> The reissue of "Island of the Blue Dolphins," Scott O'Dell's first and  best-known work for children, may seem at odds with an adult's memory of the  book as it first was published 30 years ago. The dull, musty library volume  that was passed ceremoniously among children has been replaced with a  rejuvenated, deluxe edition carrying luminous new illustrations by an artist  hand-picked by O'Dell.  </P> <P> Although O'Dell's recent death is mentioned in the amusing, generous  introduction, the copyright page still lists only an open-ended annotation:  Scott O'Dell, 1903- . Perhaps it's a sign; a really good yarn-spinner is never  gone, as long as the stories go on being spun.  </P> <P> O'Dell's view of a paradise lost takes its seed from a historical incident he  learned of during his early years on the California coast. Karana, a  12-year-old member of an island clan, finds herself in a solitary struggle for  survival in a primeval setting. The fragile ecosystem of the girl's island home  is disrupted by greedy hunters who plunder the sea lions and then kill most of  the men of her tribe.  </P> <P> When she and her younger brother are left behind by the ship that bears away  her people, Karana must battle what seems to be all of nature. Wild dogs kill  her brother; there are earthquakes, tidal waves, new seasons of hunters and  endless solitude. She finds a measure of contentment during her survival and  takes pleasure in small comforts -- the company of creatures she has tamed (and  whose flesh she vows never again to eat), a pair of handmade earrings. She also  acquires knowledge of weapon making, a skill taught only to boys.  </P> <P> Man as hunter or shepherd, the island as planet, the encounter with nature --  these are but some of the large human themes dramatized in this story. Perhaps  a male protagonist would have tried to sail beyond the horizon, or attempted to  conquer the less-than-tame aspects of his surroundings. But O'Dell seems to  insist that the feminine inclination to tend rather than confront is not only  preferable but ultimately indispensable for humankind's survival. In the  subsuming need to nurture, Karana is ultimately incapable of vengeful action.  The pack of mad dogs is a reminder that nature may be cruel -- but that there  is no place for premeditated and worthless killing.  </P> <P> In the world of blue dolphins (so different from that of the white whale),  O'Dell expresses an Edenic belief that human nature is essentially good and is  corrupted only by social intercourse and the prejudices of urban life. But the  author's equally strong conviction that there is a basic human need for  companionship leads the older Karana to the evolutionary step from living in  nature to "civilized" life. At age 30, the heroine finds solace in the shadows  of her rescuers, smiling her welcome and wearing face paint to indicate her  virginity, ready to be inducted into the society of others.

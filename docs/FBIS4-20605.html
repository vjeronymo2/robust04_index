			<p>Mechanism   of Vestibular Adaptation of Fish Under Microgravity   <F P=102> 43070038E Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Summer 1993 p 19 --  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070038E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NASDA REPORT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Principal Investigator Akira Takabayashi, </F> assistant professor, School of Hygiene, Fujita-Gakuen Health  University]    [Text] Animals on Earth always controlled their attitude  and movement with reference to gravity. They adjust their  attitude by integrating the sense of sight and soimatosthesia  with the function of the vestibular otolith organ. They will  adapt to the change of vestibular sense as time elapses when  they are put in an utterly new environment such as microgravity.  Man sometimes exhibits symptoms of space motion sickness during  the adaptation process. In ``Fuwatto '92,'' the role of the  otolith organ in attitude control in microgravity was examined  using two carps. Goldfishes are used in IML-2 to investigate the  temporal change of the attitude control mechanism using their  attitude and behavior as indices (i.e., to clarify the  adaptation process in microgravity and the process to re-adapt  to ordinary gravity on Earth).    Though goldfishes exhibit various attitudes and behavior,  their innate reaction to turn their back to the light source is  useful for observing the interaction between the sense of sight  and gravitational sense. Figure 1 shows the reaction. In the  natural environment on Earth, gravity works toward the bottom  and light comes from the top. In such an environment, the  goldfish takes an attitude with its belly down and its back up.  When the light is applied from the side, it tries to turn its  back toward the light but is not completely successful due to  the downward gravitational sense. The most important organs for  sensing gravity are the left and right vestibular organs. If  both of them are removed, the goldfish turns its back to the  light source independent of the direction from which the light  comes (see Figure 2). However, the inclination decreases as time  elapses and becomes constant in 6 months. In contrast, the  goldfish which has undergone surgery to remove only the left or  light vestibular organ inclines significantly to the operated  side and the inclination toward the intact side increases a  little (Figure 3). The inclination toward the operated side  decreases with time, but the inclination toward the intact side  rarely changes. The goldfish eventually adapts a balanced  position between both sides. During short (20 second) exposures  to microgravity obtained during parabolic flight of an airplane,  the inclination angles of these goldfishes approach 90 degrees,  and the attitude seemed to be controlled by the sense of sight.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-60B>      Figure 3. Change of Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>       In the space experiment, a total of six goldfishes,  including  two which had had the vestibular organ on one side removed 2  weeks earlier, one with both organs intact were flown in space.  Changes in the reaction to the light source during and after the  flight were photographed with a video recorder to analyze  adaptation to the gravitational environment change. Clarifying  the adaptation mechanism of the sensing system, with emphasis on  the vestibular system, should provide useful information to  clarify and provide countermeasures against space motion  sickness, an important problem in space medicine. The experiment  is expected to reveal the interaction between vestibular organs  on both sides and with other senses.</p>

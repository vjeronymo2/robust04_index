			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Rising provisions at NatWest limit recovery AN UNEXPECTED rise in National Westminster Bank's provisions for possible bad debts last year limited the bank's rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 405m from Pounds 110m the previous year, it was announced yesterday. The bank's 1 per cent increase in the charge for possible bad debts to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.88bn) was mainly caused by a rise in provisions in UK branch business to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Nearly half the UK provisions were on loans of less than Pounds 50,000. Operating surplus before provisions rose 20 per cent to Pounds 2.43bn (Pounds 2.03bn). Underlying growth was 16 per cent to Pounds 2.36bn, after excluding a 'fifth quarter' from the change in year-end of its Lombard credit finance operation. Lord Alexander, chairman, said provisions on small loans showed the impact of the recession on medium and small-sized businesses. The bank would be 'best served in the future by the avoidance of extreme economic cycles'. Strong contributors to profits included commission on foreign exchange trading, which earned Pounds 228m (Pounds 136m). NatWest Bancorp, the US retail bank subsidiary, made a profit of Pounds 109m (Pounds 182m loss) after provisions for bad debts fell to Pounds 100m (Pounds 327m). The bank also achieved a 15 per cent rise in non-interest income to Pounds 2.93bn. Commission income rose 11 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.06bn), partly because of higher charges in UK banking. Losses in the UK branch business increased to Pounds 140m (Pounds 66m), in spite of a rise in profits before provisions to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 1.15bn). Profits at NatWest Markets, the investment banking subsidiary, fell to Pounds 252m (Pounds 315m). The bank made a retained loss of Pounds 103m after an unchanged final dividend of 11.375p. Its ratio of capital to risk-adjusted assets rose to 9.8 per cent (9.6 per cent). Its tier one ratio weakened to 5.2 per cent (5.5 per cent). It took a Pounds 29m loss, and made a Pounds 93m adjustment to its capital ratios as a result of a property revaluation. It did not apply a further Pounds 175m fall in its property values to capital because it does not consider this permanent. Lord Alexander said the bank could accommodate a Pounds 17bn rise in risk-weighted assets. A rights issue was unnecessary on anticipated asset growth. Earnings per share rose to 12p (3p). Shares closed 16p down at 443p. Details, Page 23 Lex, Page 20</p>

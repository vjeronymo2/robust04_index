			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Meggitt rise to Pounds 23m MEGGITT, the Dorset based engineering company, yesterday reported a 4 per cent increase in operating profits, helped by acquisitions, but a fall in earnings per share. Operating profits rose from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 25.3m, including losses of Pounds 493,000 from discontinued operations. Sales improved by 8.5 per cent, from Pounds 302m to Pounds 328m. At the pre-tax level, profits rose from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 23m, helped by a Pounds 3.5m swing from an interest charge to a receipt of Pounds 929,000 from the proceeds of the 1991 rights issue. This was struck after taking a higher loss on disposal of discontinued operations. Earnings per share fell from 6.9p to 6.6p, based on the new FRS 3 accounting standards. Stripping out the loss on discontinued businesses, earnings fell from 8.4p to 8.1p. The board is proposing a 2.53p final dividend, giving a total of 3.78p, a 5 per cent increase for the year. Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said he was very confident about the future and that the company had had a good first quarter. 'We have had, and still have, a difficult environment but we have performed better than our peers,' he said. In aerospace, margins remained about the same and profits would have been almost unchanged before acquisitions. The electronics and controls divisions reported profits broadly maintained. Profits from the energy division halved to Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 45m. The group finished the year with gearing of 14 per cent. COMMENT Meggitt has been viewed warily by the market because of its failed 1990 bid for USH, its sometimes opaque acquisition policy and the 1991 rights issue. With Tweedie focusing on the provisioning habits of acquisitive companies, the market might be expected to remain cautious. But Meggitt now looks set for a period of consolidating what it has acquired and is already showing quite considerable cash generating powers. The oil business, hit by a lower oil price, and aerospace, which will be affected in the second half by cuts at Boeing, might restrict any advances from here. But there seems little downside at current levels. The company is forecast to make profits of at least Pounds 30m this year on a normalised basis, helped by currency and the inclusion of a full year's contribution from Endevco. This gives earnings of 8.8p and a prospective multiple of an undemanding 12.</p>

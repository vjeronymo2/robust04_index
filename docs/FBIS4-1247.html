			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special news bulletin"] </F>   [Excerpts] With barely two days left before South Africa's  historical election, a powerful car bomb has exploded this  morning at approximately 0945 in the Johannesburg city center.  At least four people have been confirmed killed, but according  to reports the death toll already stands at seven. Several  people were injured by glass fragments, and a spokesman for the  Hillbrow Hospital says 79 people have been admitted, 11 of them  in a serious condition. The explosion took place in Bree  Street, between Von Wielligh and Kruis Streets, close to the ANC  headquarters. There is no confirmation that there are possibly  more bombs in the vicinity.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified  eyewitness,  in English] We all saw....[pauses] The only thing we saw is we  saw the police search the car here. After the police searched  the car they went off; they drove. They parked down there and  that's when the explosion came.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Now you said the  police were here, and they searched the car?    [Eyewitness] They searched the car here, here, here. Right  here.    [Correspondent] And the car came through.    [Eyewitness] The car....[pauses] They left the car in the  car  park there. It was about plus five minutes, I say three to five  minutes; then the explosions came. [end recording]    The police estimate that between 70 and 90 kg of explosives  were used. The front of a shop was completely destroyed and  there was a fire inside the building. The police, fire brigade,  and paramedics were on the scene within minutes and four street  blocks around the scene of the accident were cordoned off. The  explosion was heard by inhabitants in Hillbrow and Kensington.  A spokesman for the ANC, Mr. Carl Niehaus, says extensive  damage was done to the organization's headquarters and telephone  lines were damaged. He said the explosion took place shortly  before an ANC election bus was due to depart from the building  to embark on voter education. He described the explosion as an  attempt at blatant intimidation.    [Begin recording] [Niehaus] We believe that this is an  attack  on the entire democratization process in South Africa, and  specifically on the ANC, and we call on all our people not to  allow themselves to be provoked by this attack. We must remain  as calm as possible and ensure that we win this election in the  best possible way, that everyone turns up to vote. The best way  to fight this type of terrorism is at the polls.    [Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in English] I hope very much that  we will not panic and as long as the security forces show that  they are going to be effective in following up all of this kind  of thing, we should be saying....[pauses] Quite obviously there  are those who want to subvert and sabotage the efforts, and we  mustn't allow them. First of all we mustn't panic, and we must  go along because there isn't as much violence as they had hoped  there was going to be, and I just beg our people to remain calm  and to let the security establishment deal with it. We are  going to vote and these elections are going to be free and fair,  and so there to all those ghastly creatures who are trying to  subvert us. We are not going to allow them to do that. [end  recording]    The PAC's regional office is also in the vicinity. A  spokesman for this organization says he is convinced that the  explosion was aimed at the PAC.</p>

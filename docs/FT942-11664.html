			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Britain will help create monetary authority The Bank of England will help Palestinians create a Palestinian Monetary Authority which will have all the functions of a central bank except the ability to issue a currency, a senior Palestinian economic negotiator said yesterday, Julian Ozanne writes. Mr Samir Houleila said in an interview that the greatest challenge facing the Palestinians in implementing the economic protocol signed with Israel last week was the creation of credible, transparent and efficient financial and economic institutions which would have authority outside the political and bureaucratic structures of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The Palestinians will ask for considerable technical assistance from the UK and Switzerland. Implementing the agreement would be hard because it only applied to the Gaza-Jericho part of the occupied territories, Mr Houleila said. He urged Israel to endorse policy decisions taken by the Palestinian authority and apply them to the rest of the West Bank. He defended the protocol, saying Palestinians would gain an immediate reduction in the cost of living from lower oil prices, VAT, customs duties and direct taxation, which would fuel exports and investment. The economic protocol met Palestinian aspirations much better than the political and security agreement negotiated in Cairo. 'Actually we have paid a high price in the political and security realm, but we get the benefits in the economic sphere.' The agreement terminates the Israeli-Jordanian agreement on banking in the occupied territories and allows Palestinians to make the US dollar legal tender, he said. A negative point for Palestinians was Israel's refusal to state specifically the number of Palestinians who would be able to work in Israel, Mr Houleila added. He and Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, agreed Israel was going to pay a short-term financial price for peace with the Palestinians, but would gain from long-term normalisation of relations with Arab and Islamic states. Mr Shochat said Israel would lose several million shekels' revenue from customs duties and income tax on Palestinian migrant labourers (75 per cent of which will be transferred to the Palestinians) but would reap the rewards of peace. 'For us the most important thing is not the existing situation but the opening of the door to the east and to Arab markets.' Mr Houleila warned the PLO would not call for an end to the Arab economic boycott of Israel before further talks on Jewish settlements, international borders and refugees.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, this question is essentially one of policy choices. An earlier administration chose to play an active Federal role in restricting the options of MPOs and grantees in their consideration of private enterprise participation (e.g., requiring the use of a particular accounting method and mandating route reviews every three years). The program it developed, based on 20-year-old statutory provisions previously unelaborated by the agency and adopted without the benefit of prior notice and comment, can be argued to have been a fair exercise of the discretion vested in an administrative agency wrestling with policy choices. But as discussed at greater length below, the claims of a few commenters that the previous policy had, in effect, taken on some kind of quasi-statutory status cannot withstand scrutiny. As the Supreme Court has noted,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may, within the limits of that delegation, properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise policy to inform its judgments. While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron U.S.A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> , 497 U.S. 837, 865&hyph;866 (1984).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the transportation arena, new State and Federal mandates_the Americans with Disabilities Act and mandated drug and alcohol testing, for example_require new programs and services, but the availability of Federal operating assistance to help pay the costs of these programs remains limited. Given the increasingly limited funds available, it is local decisionmakers responsible for meeting the transit needs of the community who most keenly feel the need to obtain the most transit service possible with the funds available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. &hyph;Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some 415 comments were received in response to the Notice from commenters representing a variety of views and interests, including transit systems, private operators, unions, and members of Congress:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;&hyph;Transit systems and government entities  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 73 Private operators&hyph;&hyph;&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 263 &hyph;&hyph;Unions&hyph;&hyph;&hyph;&hyph;&hyph;&hyph; <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 55 &hyph;&hyph;Members of Congress&hyph;&hyph;&hyph;&hyph; <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, private operators opposed the proposed recision, arguing that the existing private enterprise policy was effective and consistent with the FT Act, brought needed competition to the provision of transit services, and helped lower the cost of those services. Unions, a number of transit systems, and others, in contrast, took the view that the current policy needlessly creates paperwork burdens and reviews that are time consuming and not relevant to privatization efforts, which should be left to the local decisionmaking process. Many commenters simply expressed general support for or opposition to the policies under review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. &hyph;Summary of Comments by Issue  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Objections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While many commenters addressed the substance of the proposal, a few asserted that the manner in which the agency announced its proposal, i.e., the Notice of Proposed Recision, was itself flawed. These commenters noted that the FT Act specifically requires the agency to follow notice and comment procedures. The fact that an agency uses the term ``guidance'' or ``guideline'' is not controlling; the status of such materials as ``rules'' is determined by their binding character. By rescinding the existing guidance, the commenters contend, the FTA will effectively create a new ``binding norm'' by establishing the standards and procedures by which the agency maintains it will fulfill its statutory obligation to encourage participation of private transportation companies in transit service. Further, these commenters argued, the existing guidance clearly is mandatory in nature. Because such guidance effectively is a rule, they assert, the agency is obligated to comply with rulemaking procedures before amending or repealing the guidance. One commenter cited a Supreme Court case to the effect that an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency acts in the first instance. In this regard, commenters also alleged that, contrary to what FTA stated in its Notice, there is no significant record to show that grantees have found the existing guidance burdensome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter noted that although certain specific protections and activities are explicitly and implicitly contained in the FT Act, no process or procedure is prescribed in the statute for the enforcement of these requirements, which is therefore left to the rulemaking process. Nor is the agency free to act independent of the administrative record. The problem with the FTA analysis, asserted this commenter, is that it has failed to adhere to the requirement that a nexus exist between the need for changes and the underlying, supportive facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter argued that the agency had predetermined its final action on the Notice, notwithstanding its notice and comment review period. This commenter maintained that the agency's Notice misstates the private enterprise requirements, the statutory provisions, and the legislative history. This commenter also argued that the Notice misrepresents the material in the agency's files, the agency's interpretations of the current requirements, and the enforcement history of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, many commenters supported the agency's proposal and the procedure by which it was announced. One argued that much of the administrative burden imposed by the existing requirements could have been avoided or alleviated had the policies been subjected to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice and comment process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Fully Allocated Cost Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current private enterprise policies require that grantees use a fully allocated cost methodology when calculating their costs of providing service for comparison with those of potential private operators. The Notice indicated, however, that the method was not always an appropriate gauge of the true cost of providing a particular service and that FTA believes that in comparing public and private costs of operating a particular service, a recipient should be free to use any reasonable accounting method it finds appropriate in a given setting. A number of commenters particularly supported this aspect of the Notice. They noted that they long have argued that the criteria and policies for choosing among public and private providers should be left to local transit agencies and community planners and that the proper role for the Federal government should be one of neutrality. The constraints imposed on local decisionmakers by the fully allocated cost method resulted in service choices that not only failed to produce expected cost savings, but resulted in serious service, safety, and maintenance problems as well, they contended.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

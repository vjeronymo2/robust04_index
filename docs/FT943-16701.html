			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Wine for the great outdoors Wines served out of doors, where a breeze can waft away their flavour, need to be extra assertive - doubly so if they have to do battle with charred food and barbecue sauces. Many a brash New World wine comes into its own in the (hickory) smoke, such as Safeway's Australian Hunter Valley 1993 Chardonnay, at Pounds 4.99, and Waitrose's South African Backsberg 1992 Chardonnay, at Pounds 5.95. When Oddbins takes delivery of its Chilean Errazuriz 1993 Chardonnay at Pounds 4.99 this month, that, too, will do nicely. For a Friday or Saturday night (but not on a night before an early morning start), Baileys Shiraz 1992 (Pounds 4.99 Oddbins) is the archetypal barbecue wine: 14.5 per cent alcohol, great concentration and a deep, deep flavour from north east Victoria in Australia. This wine should be even better in a year. In rather the same mould, but slightly less of a sledgehammer, is Asda's clever exclusivity, Kanonkop Bouwland 1992 made from a well-judged blend of grape varieties by South Africa's celebrated winemaker Beyers Truter. For those who prefer less of a cerebral challenge from their barbecue red, Waitrose have the soft, aromatic bordeaux blend of Avontuur Cabernet/Merlot 1993 at Pounds 3.99, a South African designed for immediate drinking.</p>

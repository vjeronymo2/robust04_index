			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Nigeria delays on devaluation NIGERIA'S military government yesterday delayed implementation of a 30 per cent devaluation scheduled to come into effect on Wednesday afternoon, deepening the uncertainty about Nigeria's exchange rate policy. The wide gap between official and parallel exchange rate is disturbing Nigerians and external creditors alike, and undermining the country's structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund. Although the Nigerian central bank paved the way for a devaluation of around 30 per cent on Wednesday, the announcement has been held up as President Ibrahim Babangida continues to discuss the implications of the move with senior advisers in Abuja, the new federal capital in central Nigeria. The president is due to meet a visiting delegation from the IMF next week. It is expected to tell him that a renewal of the country's lapsed standby agreement with the Fund is partly dependent on the government's efforts to close the gap between the official rate for the naira, trading at 10.50 to the US dollar, and the parallel market which offers 18. A new agreement is a precondition to the rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 34bn external debt. But the president is also under considerable domestic pressure to resist a devaluation. Such a move, coupled with widespread public discontent about corruption and economic mismanagement, could present Gen Babangida with one of his toughest tests since taking office in a 1985 coup. Yesterday, the central bank continued to withhold the outcome of Wednesday's weekly foreign exchange auction which determines the value of the naira. The result is normally declared on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

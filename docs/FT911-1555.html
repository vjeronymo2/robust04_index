			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Institutions launch bid to oust Tace board NORWICH UNION and Framlington Group have launched a bid to remove the entire board of Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and to reinstate as chairman Mr Michael Beckett, who resigned from Tace a week ago, writes Richard Gourlay. In a letter to fellow shareholders, Norwich Union said it had called for an extraordinary general meeting because it had lost confidence in the current board under the chairmanship of Sir David Nicolson. Norwich Union controls 5 per cent and Framlington 16 per cent of Tace, but institutions accounting for about 40 per cent are understood to back the shareholder revolt. However, shareholders who control about 29 per cent of the Tace stock have given 'indications' that they will vote against Norwich Union's proposals, according to Mr David Floyd, of Belmont Bank which is acting as adviser to Tace. These shareholders are Mr Jock Mackenzie, the founder who resigned as chairman last year under strong institutional pressure but still controls 23 per cent of the stock, and Mr Bob Morton, the City financier, who controls 4.4 per cent, through Southwind. Sir David, who is 69 and a former chairman of British Airways and BTR, became Tace chairman in March against the wishes of the institutional shareholders who preferred Mr Beckett. Norwich Union said it had discussed the need for an independent audit ahead of a financial restructuring and rights issue. Sir David has said he thought an audit was unnecessary and last week hastily announced the restructuring plan which involved Tace buying the 49 per cent of Goring Kerr, another environmental monitoring group, that it did not already control. The institutions have been angered by the head office expenses which Tace has incurred since 1988 and the level of directors' remuneration. They remained sceptical that the board under Sir David would be able to control these costs and that he had a strong business development plan for the company. Mr Mackenzie received remuneration of Pounds 250,000 and other fees for services provided by a privately-controlled company that organised social events. Mr Dick Richardson, the managing director, received more than Pounds 200,000 even though the company only made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m last year. Tace board members were yesterday unavailable for comment. Mr Floyd said Tace preferred peace rather than war with Norwich Union. Tace would use the time before it has to call the EGM to meet the proposed new directors and would possibly consider inviting them onto the board. Norwich Union is also proposing as directors, Mr Christopher Glynn, who like Mr Beckett was formerly of Consolidated Goldfields, Mr David Tucker, of M&amp;G, and Mr Michael Rendle, a former managing director of BP.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac Minerals names new chief Lac Minerals, the Canadian gold and base-metals producer which is the target of two unwelcome takeover bids, has named a new chief executive as part of efforts to retain its independence. Mr Peter Steen, formerly president of San Francisco-based Homestake Mining, one of North America's biggest gold producers, replaces Mr Peter Allen, who was unseated last month by a revolt among Lac shareholders. Mr James Pitblado, retired head of Canada's biggest securities firm, remains chairman of Lac. Lac has received takeover offers from American Barrick of Toronto and Royal Oak Mines, a smaller company based in Vancouver. Both bids are valued at just over CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.44bn). Royal Oak's bid brought into the open long-standing dissatisfaction among Lac's shareholders. Criticism centred on Lac's inability to realise the full value of its properties in the US, Canada and Chile. Mr Steen, aged 63, has wide mining experience in southern Africa and North America. He said shortly after his appointment last Friday that he hoped to prepare a strategic plan, including cost-cutting measures, within two months. Analysts and shareholders are divided in their predictions on Lac's fate. While American Barrick is widely favoured among the bidders which have appeared so far, some think the recent shake-up could greatly increase Lac's attractiveness as an independent company. Also, other bidders could emerge in coming weeks with more attractive offers.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Test for Canada's constitution industry: Pressure is growing on politicians to decide the country's future CANADIANS joke that the only industry prospering in their recession-battered economy is that manned by a sizeable band of politicians, civil servants, lawyers and academics busy trying to write a new constitution. Over the past two years the constitution industry has produced a procession of commissions, panels, public forums and high-level negotiations, all aimed at holding the world's second biggest country in one piece. To its credit the process has kept English- and French-speaking Canadians on speaking terms, and has cooled the tempers, especially in Quebec, which flared after two English-speaking provinces failed to ratify the Meech Lake constitutional accord in mid-1990. But patience with the constitutional merry-go-round is wearing thin. Pressure is growing on all sides for the politicians to move from consultation and negotiation to hard decisions on the country's future. There is a good chance that some of these decisions will emerge from a full-scale constitutional conference which opens in Ottawa today. Chaired by Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, the conference will bring together leaders of all 10 provinces, two Arctic territories and Canada's aboriginal people. Mr Mulroney has indicated that if Quebec and the rest of the country cannot strike a deal this time, the federal government may step in with its own compromise proposals. These would probably be crafted to ensure approval by Quebec and would then require the support of only six of the other nine provinces, including Ontario, Canada's most powerful province. Mr Mulroney is also considering a national referendum. He would gamble that the country's eagerness to put the constitutional industry out of business and avoid an acrimonious break-up would be strong enough to ensure ratification. The participation of Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, at today's meeting is another sign that at least a partial - and perhaps only temporary  -solution to the long-running constitutional saga is in sight. Mr Bourassa said over the weekend that the next 10 days would be 'a crucial time' in the long constitutional wrangle. He has boycotted national-unity talks for the past two years, initially in protest against the rejection of the Meech Lake accord, and more recently for fear that another failure at the negotiating table might ignite a new burst of separatist fervour in the francophone province. Anger generated by the collapse of the Meech Lake agreement boosted the separatist cause in Quebec in late 1990 and early 1991. But a deep recession, conciliatory gestures from the rest of the country and a skilful balancing act by Mr Bourassa have combined over the past year to dampen enthusiasm for independence. Pressure to strike a deal at today's meeting is compounded by the national-unity referendum which Quebec is due to hold by the end of October. Unless he decides to delay the vote, Mr Bourassa has, by law, less than a month to formulate the question which will be put to voters. The separatist Parti Quebecois is pushing for a blunt question on sovereignty. But Mr Bourassa would prefer to campaign on a specific package of constitutional reforms already agreed with the rest of the country. If he returns from Ottawa without a package which he can sell to Quebec's notoriously sceptical political establishment, the risk increases that the separatist forces will again have the upper hand. A senior Quebec minister hinted last week that the referendum might be delayed under such circumstances. Mr Claude Gauthier, executive vice-president of Crop, a Montreal opinion polling group, says that in the last referendum campaign in 1980 - which the separatists narrowly lost - those in favour of some form of independence 'had to prove it was the good thing to do'. Now, says Mr Gauthier, the onus is on federalists to make their case. 'There is much more work to do this time for the people who want Canada to stay together,' he says. Mr Mulroney and his officials, helped by such provinces as Ontario, New Brunswick and British Columbia, have worked hard behind the scenes in recent weeks to bridge the gaps between Quebec on the one hand and the hard-line English-speaking provinces, notably Alberta, on the other. The most divisive issue now on the table is reform of the Senate, the upper chamber of parliament. The nine English-speaking provinces complicated Mr Mulroney's job last month by cobbling together a pact - known as the Pearson agreement - which would transform the all-appointed Senate into an elected body with equal representation from each province. Western provinces, especially Alberta, have for almost a decade pinned their hopes on an 'equal' Senate as a way to gain more influence in Ottawa. But the Pearson agreement sparked an uproar in Quebec. The reforms would leave the province with only eight French-speaking senators in an 84-member chamber, and Quebecois saw a real danger of bilingualism disappearing in one of the houses of parliament. Other elements in the Pearson agreement have also drawn criticism, and not only from Quebec. Having just negotiated a North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico, Mr Mulroney is pushing for a stronger commitment from all the provinces to tear down the myriad of inter-provincial non-tariff barriers which they have erected over the years. Hints were being dropped in Ottawa late last week that any deal which emerges from today's conference may end up papering over the most intractable areas of disagreement, such as Senate reform, by putting them off into the far-distant future. That would leave Canada's quest for a secure identity unfulfilled - and it would probably not be long before the constitutional bandwagon started rolling again.</p>

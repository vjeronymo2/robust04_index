			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Alcan Australia ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent-owned subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of Canada, yesterday announced its third consecutive annual loss and forecast further difficulties in the current year. The board said it would pass the dividend for the second consecutive year. Alcan said it made a net loss of ADollars 15.5m (USDollars 10.6m) for 1982 against a loss of ADollars 28.9m in 1991. Revenue was down from ADollars 590m to ADollars 576m despite a 3.7 per cent rise in sales volume. The group made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 1.2m, against a loss of ADollars 29.2m previous yearly. The gain reflected efficiency improvements and cost cuts.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Better margins lift earnings at The Gap New store openings and better profit margins at existing stores helped The Gap, the US casual wear retailer, produce a 19 per cent increase in net profits to a record Dollars 93.6m in its third quarter to October. The company said its Banana Republic stores had turned in an impressive performance, but revenues at The Gap stores fell below target because the merchandise did not sell as well as had been expected. Earnings per share rose from 54 cents to 64 cents. At the quarter's end, The Gap operated 877 Gap stores, 354 GapKids stores, 184 Banana Republic stores and 62 Old Navy or Gap Warehouse stores. The total of 1,477 represented an increase of 92 over the year-earlier figure. The group's sales revenues rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 988.3m, but only because of the new store openings. Sales at stores that had been open for more than a year fell by 2 per cent. The sales decline at existing stores, however, was offset by an increase in margins stemming from control over costs and a better merchandise mix, which reduced the need for price mark-downs to clear goods. Last year The Gap suffered a fall in profits prompted by a combination of expansion costs, weak consumer demand and competition from other store groups imitating The Gap basic clothing formula. Since then The Gap has shifted its product mix away from basic, unisex clothing such as T-shirts and jeans to more fashionable and gender-specific merchandise, particularly for women.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lagos, 11 Apr (PANA) -- The chief executive of  Nigeria's influential Lagos-based weekly news magazine,  NEWSWATCH, Ray Ekpu, has been arrested along with his deputy,  Yakubu Mohamed, the magazine said. An official of the  publication said that Ekpu and Mohamed were arrested in Lagos  and northern city of Lokoja at the weekend.    No official reason was given for their arrest by state  security officials, which followed the arrest Thursday [7 April]  of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Dan Agbese. The arrests are  believed to be in connection with last week's NEWSWATCH  interview with an official of the old administration of Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida which ruled from 1985 to 1992. [passage  omitted]    Some media and human rights organisations, in separate  statements after Agbese's arrest, condemned the action as a new  wave of media clampdown in the West African country, which is  acclaimed to have one of the freest press in Africa. The  organisations include the Nigerian Union of Journalists and the  Nigerian Magazine Publishers Association.    "Events in the recent past have shown that unlawful  harassments of media practitioners have never achieved any  positive results for the government," the association said.    Agbese, Mohamed and Ekpu, left the NATIONAL CONCORD  publication of millionaire Moshood Abiola in 1983 to set up  NEWSWATCH, whose founding editor-in-chief, Dele Giwa was killed  in a parcel bomb delivered to his Lagos home in 1986. There has  been no arrest or prosecution of Dele's killers, some eight  years after his slaying.</p>

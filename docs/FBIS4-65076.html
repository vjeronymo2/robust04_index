			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has welcomed  the unexpected decision by the Bundesbank on Wednesday [11 May]  to cut the prime rate by 0.5 percentage points. This step --  the discount rate was cut from 5.0 to 4.5 percent and the  Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6.0 percent -- will provide an  additional boost to "the ever clearer economic upswing," Finance  Minister Theo Waigel said. With its policy of cutting  interests, the Bundesbank is reacting to the Federal  Government's successful policy of consolidation."    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, however, added that not  only industry and labor but the government, too, ought to pursue  a policy that is guided by the objective of stability. Public  budgets must be further consolidated "so that the economy can  continue its upward trend." As far as wage and salary demands  are concerned, it is still necessary to pursue a restrained  course. The Bundesbank is now using "the room it is being  conceded by the financial and wage policy, thus supporting the  recovery of the economy, which is beginning to show."</p>

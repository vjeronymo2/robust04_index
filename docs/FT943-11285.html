			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: 'Drowned Out' at the Proms The City of Birmingham Symphony made their second Prom appearance on Thursday, bringing with them Mark-Anthony Turnage's almost-new Drowned Out. He has been their resident composer for four years (courtesy of the Radcliffe Trust), and Drowned Out was the final fruit of that happy association. The slightly jokey title belies the character of the music, for the inspiration came from William Golding's Pincher Martin - in which the whole novel consists of a life-in-flashbacks going through the mind of a drowning man. Turnage's piece begins with sombre, 'submerged' chords and a slow lament (saxophones are prominent, as usual with this composer). As the music develops speed and fury, the suggestion of a rite is never lost; much of it is underpinned by a fierce, repetitive beat, and it rises to several brassy climaxes. At last it declines into a chastened elegy, with morose clarinet. In all this, there is a strict economy of material, carefully rotated and varied. Perhaps the musical tension falters in two or three places, but the whole is cogent enough. Certainly it marks a new stage in Turnage's command. Drowned Out was not exactly flattered by its place in the programme, following upon the 1926 Tapiola of Sibelius - a work of similar proportions and severity, but by an old master. Rattle has been conducting that since 1979, and his hand with it is utterly assured. Some Sibelians draw it out more grimly, but Rattle's unhesitating way with it sacrificed nothing. Towards the end, the violins brilliantly suggested a driving Arctic blizzard, through which the oracular brass stood firm. One surprise: a quick passage in it suddenly and infallibly recalled Debussy's La Mer (1905). That has not struck me before; was Rattle deliberately pointing it up? (And was it a bit of composer's larceny?) Later we were to hear La Mer itself, in a beautifully prepared performance that wanted only a greater weight of strings than the CBSO can supply. From where I sat, at least, they were sometimes submerged altogether. As nearly always, Rattle seemed to have designed his programme to make interesting points. The odd piece out - but not out of place - was Messiaen's 1936 cycle of songs for his first wife, Poemes pour Mi, in his much later orchestration (which Rattle rendered as delicately as possible). There is a hothouse air about them, but in Maria Ewing's performance they were hard to resist. Miss Ewing was in lovely, velvet-voiced form, and obviously determined to make the songs tell without the slightest forcing. If she lacked the full power for a couple of places, she wisely refused to risk going through her tone; we missed nothing, and the spell remained unbroken. She sang the cycle by heart (no mean challenge), and illuminated it with a few simple gestures. There have been past occasions when one felt that she was trying too hard for theatrical effect - too much platform-drama, too many vocal tricks. Not here: she had judged what the songs require to a nicety, and rendered them with an air of dewy freshness. If that was a trick, it succeeded completely.</p>

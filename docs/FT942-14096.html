			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Unsettled outlook for Kidder Peabody - The bank's position after the discovery of false trading profits There will be no basic change in the strategy,' insists Mr Michael Carpenter, the British-born chairman of Kidder Peabody. But for the US investment bank, wracked by the discovery that its top US government bond trader falsified trading profits of Dollars 350m, the future looks anything but settled. One of the main sources of the bank's reported income of the past two years turns out to have been faked. And an investigation under way into how the alleged fraud arose could yet force big changes to the company's management and operations. Coming just as Kidder appeared to be on the rebound from a lacklustre performance in the early 1990s, the news could hardly have been timed more badly. On the surface, the Dollars 350m of falsified bond trading profits over which Kidder sacked the trader, Mr Joseph Jett, appear to account for a large part of the firm's reported income in recent periods. Last year, it made pre-tax profits of Dollars 439m, up from Dollars 300m the year before and Dollars 119m in 1991. In the four years before this, the bank made a profit once, in 1988. According to Mr Carpenter, though, Kidder's earnings power is stronger than this picture suggests. Excluding the falsified profits reported last year, he says, and before paying bonuses and building its reserves, the firm made Dollars 750m. Much of that came from the bank's powerful fixed-income securities operations, the one area where it has established a clear lead over other securities houses. Underwriting and trading mortgage-backed securities has been the strongest element of this, with Kidder handling as much as a quarter of all new mortgage-backed securities issues last year. 'It has been the clear leader,' says a mortgage-backed trader in another bank. Mr Mike Vranos, head of this business, is reputed to have earned a bonus considerably in excess of the Dollars 9m paid to Mr Jett for 1993. Kidder has also established a strong position in the junk bond market, where it underwrote over 10 per cent of new issues last year as the market for sub-investment grade debt in the US sprang back to life. These activities have pushed Kidder up the underwriting league tables, even though it has made less headway in the mainstream equity and investment grade bond markets. In Europe, the story is much the same. Although Kidder was an early arrival in London in 1957, it reached 20th position in the International Financing Review's Eurobond league table last year, due largely to its strong presence in the floating rate note sector, where its underwriting clout was exceeded only by that of Merrill Lynch. Its reliance on bond markets, and the mortgage-backed market in particular, has not served Kidder well so far this year. After allowing for the faked profits in the first quarter, Mr Carpenter puts Kidder's earnings at 'certainly above Dollars 100m, probably above Dollars 125m'  - at an annualised rate, well below the Dollars 750m of last year. Part of the problem has been the fall-off in issuance of mortgage-backed securities. Also, Kidder has taken a loss of around Dollars 25m on margin trades entered into with Askin Capital Management, a hedge fund group which has been forced by trading losses to seek protection from its creditors. 'The Askin situation got out of control much more quickly than any of us thought it could,' says Mr Carpenter. He denies, though, that this demonstrated a failure of control similar to the failure which allowed Mr Jett to report fictitious profits. Kidder chose to take a bigger credit risk than normal with Askin, given the profitability of the trading relationship and 'our assessment of the values of the collateral and the kind of margin we needed to liquidate our position in the event of difficulty,' Mr Carpenter says. In the event, Kidder was caught out by the upheaval in the mortgage-backed markets as much as Askin was. Despite these factors, Mr Carpenter says: 'The earning power of the franchise is still very strong, obviously depending on market conditions.' Kidder has been building up its investment banking operations virtually from the day in 1989 that Mr Carpenter was parachuted into Kidder by its parent, General Electric. At that time, the firm was reeling from an insider trading scandal and many of its top investment bankers were leaving. It has also been trying to grow its equity operations, those these remain far weaker than its fixed income business. Two questions remain. Will the fallout from the Jett scandal throw Kidder off-course? And will it lead parent GE to reconsider selling the firm? Both Mr Jack Welch and Mr Carpenter say that the episode has not undermined the relationship between parent and subsidiary. GE, though, has never felt comfortable with Kidder, of which it bought 80 per cent in 1986 for Dollars 600m. Persistent rumours of its intention to sell the bank swirled virtually from the beginning, and have subsided in the past two years only as Kidder has appeared to rebuild its profits. That a large part of the success was phoney has already restarted tongues wagging on Wall Street.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Examinations Department incurs certain costs in the course of conducting these examinations, including travel and staff costs. Of course, such costs rise when the offices of the organization being reviewed are located outside of the Philadelphia area. Staff time required to conduct an examination is substantially longer when the businesses of the firm are atypical of those firms for which the Phlx has historically served as DEA. Because of the familiarity that inherently results from repeatedly conducting similar examinations, Phlx Examinations staff has accumulated substantial experience regarding where to focus and locate information revealing potential areas of concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Exchange is currently the DEA for approximately one dozen firms that engage in Phlx-atypical businesses from remote locations. The Phlx is the DEA for firms located in other geographic regions, which do not transact business on the Exchange, and trade products not available on the Phlx. For instance, a Chicago-based firm conducting proprietary trades in government securities and a Connecticut-based firm engaged in convertible debt securities arbitrage are examples of atypical Phlx firms. The heightened costs, which include both money as well as valuable staff time, may be due to an atypically lengthy examination, travel and specific training regarding non-Phlx trading instruments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to actual costs incurred in conducting required examinations, the Exchange notes that, as the DEA for a firm, the Phlx, similar to other SROs, also frequently performs an advisory role respecting the regulatory obligations of its member/participant firms. This ``service'' function may take the form of answering telephone calls and other questions of such firms regarding Exchange and Commission rules, as well as the types of procedures such firm should have in place. Initially, becoming a member/participant firm of the Phlx, the Exchange assists in the firm's set-up of its financials and communicates with the firm, providing sample forms and general guidance. Thereafter, a firm may require periodic follow-up advice. These advisory costs to the Exchange of serving as the DEA are greater for the Phlx-atypical firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these heightened costs may be offset by transaction charges and related revenues received by the Exchange if such firms trade in Phlx markets. In reviewing these costs, the Exchange notes that Phlx member/participant organizations may be required to pay various fees and transaction charges, which usually constitute a large part of the revenue collected by the Exchange. Organization not trading on the Phlx escape these fees, while the Exchange remains obligated to administer various regulatory functions, including costlier examinations. In the area of examinations, the factor of staff time is particularly pronounced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, these firms do not engage in business on the Phlx, and, consequently, the heightened costs are not offset by revenues derived from these firms. Without this income source, the Exchange has determined to adopt an examinations fee in order to alleviate certain costs of conducting examinations. Currently, the Phlx does not charge an examinations or DEA fee, noting, in contrast, that most other SROs in the U.S. impose direct examinations fees. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  For the above reasons, therefore, the Phlx is proposing such a fee for those organizations for which it serves as DEA_with certain exceptions. The proposed examinations fee would apply primarily to those member and participant organizations which do not execute trades on the Phlx. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Chicago Board Options Exchange imposes a fee equal to $.40 per $1,000 in gross revenues. Other exchanges similarly impose revenue-based examinations fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to fairly allocate the proposed examinations fee, the Exchange has determined to exempt those member and participant organizations that actively trade on the Exchange, thereby counterbalancing examination costs with transaction fees. Organizations that for any month incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by the Exchange or by its registered clearing subsidiary would be exempt from the fee, provided that the fees exceed the examinations fee for that month. Inactive organizations would be exempt because examinations are not customarily conducted for such organizations. Compliance with the inactive status will be determined by gross securities-related transaction revenues reported on the organization's most recent semi-annual FOCUS report. In addition, the organization must continue to lack such revenues, as determined monthly, in order to be exempt from the examinations fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, a member or participant organization that is wholly owned by, controlled by, or under common control with an organization operating from the Phlx trading floor or generating counterbalancing Phlx transaction or clearing fees would be exempt from this fee, because the affiliated organization is generating transaction or clearing fees to help offset examinations costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(4), in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and issuers and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes that the proposed examinations fee of $1,000 per month is reasonable in view of the Exchange's costs in conducting examinations of non-Phlx-trading organizations, especially in terms of staff time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange also believes that structuring the fee to exempt organizations that transact business on the Exchange represents an equitable allocation of the Exchange's examination costs among members by focusing on those member organizations that generally do not otherwise continually contribute to compensating for, and usually, in fact, increase Exchange examination costs. The Exchange notes that the fee becomes effective January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

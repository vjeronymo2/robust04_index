			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Markets show first flicker of positive response - Economy The first flicker of a positive response by the markets to the IRA ceasefire came yesterday as several Northern Ireland companies made gains on the London Stock Exchange. The share prices of companies such as Northern Ireland Electricity and Ewart, the property developer, advanced by about 5 per cent to 6 per cent, against an overall FT-SE index gain of 1.7 per cent. It is obviously early days to assert that a trend is emerging from these gains, but they are indicative that business confidence in the province will grow if the ceasefire holds and that economic benefits for the province, and even for the republic, will flow from an end to the violence. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday: 'I have always believed there would be a huge peace dividend for the island of Ireland.' The first payments on that are expected to come from the US. Mr Reynolds talked by phone to US President Bill Clinton yesterday, following the IRA announcement, and said he believed US economic support for the peace process 'is going to be very important'. He added: 'President Clinton assured me today that he going straight away to work at an economic package to underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, is to visit Washington shortly to follow this up. The US money will boost confidence, but of far greater importance will be decisions by the business community - both local and from overseas - on whether to boost investment in the province. An FT survey of business opinion in Northern Ireland in December last year revealed that more than half of the 56 leading companies surveyed believed that a political settlement, arising from an end to violence, would have a very positive effect on business and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland. A further 38 per cent believed that the effect would be 'fairly positive'. An additional benefit from an ending of the IRA bombing campaign will be a sharp reduction in compensation costs. The Northern Ireland Office currently pays between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m a year to individual and corporate victims of the violence. The stationing of some 19,000 British troops in the province, and the maintenance of the RUC police force at a strength of around 12,000, imposes an even heavier burden on the Exchequer - thought to be in excess of Pounds 1bn per year. In addition, there is an Exchequer subsidy to Northern Ireland of a further Pounds 3bn. Economic development will reduce unemployment, raise the taxation base and allow a reduction in this subsidy, which if required could be recycled into investment projects. A joint statement by Mr Doug Riley, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and Mr Paddy Murphy, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said 'real economic benefits' would flow from 'peace and creation of a stable political framework based on agreed democratic principles'. Potential benefits included improved confidence leading to more investment and cross-border trade, the development of new products and 'a more expansive approach which could mean significant new employment opportunities'. Yesterday most small businesses along the Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road were sceptical about the effect of the IRA's statement on their businesses. Mrs Jan Cheevers, owner of Stevensons florists in the Shankill Road, said: 'If peace comes then it may help me, but I can't see that happening.' Her shop is next door to the fish shop bombed by the IRA last October. Nine people and the bomber died. 'There is no trust any more,' she said. Nearly all of her customers are Protestants. A newsagent in the Falls Road who did not wish to be named said: 'I suppose we may get some more tourists up here now, but really things are likely to go on much the same.' The manager of a taxi company based on the Falls Road said that the only benefit he would get was from increased aid from the US. 'If this leads to Clinton giving us more money then that obviously is good. But other than that business will probably go on as normal.'</p>

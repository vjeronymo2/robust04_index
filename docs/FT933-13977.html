			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Chinese puzzles / Review of 'Silent Energy' at Oxford Since the mid-19th century, a vital strand in China's development has been its changing self-definition in relation to the west. Now that many Chinese artists are living in cities such as Paris or New York, some in exile since the Tiananmen Square events of 1989, this process continues, but with a new dimension. The work produced by those trained in China's art colleges since their reopening in the late 1970s has developed for the first time within a sustained climate of western influence. There has been time for a whole generation to assimilate western forms of expression much more thoroughly than in the past. Or, in the words of Huang Yongping, one of the eight artists showing specially commissioned works in Silent Energy, a two-part show at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, 'I took five years to study art and I will need 10 years to forget what I learned.' Huang was born in Xiamen in 1954, graduated from the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts in 1982 and has lived in Paris since 1989. While at art college, he was made to copy French 19th-century paintings. In protest, he collaged the faces of peasants on to his copies. After graduation, he founded the Xiamen Dada group in 1986, its anti-academic stance just as necessary to the artists of 1980s China as it had been to those of Europe 60 years before. At Oxford, Huang is showing a work which at first sight seems an average example of the 1990s school of large-scale installation. A tent-like structure fills the lower gallery, its form minimal, its frame of reference apparently simple - nomadism and museum culture, perhaps, or transient versus monumental. Stepping within, however, things begin to get complicated. The plain cream canvas is lined with yellow silk, a colour which in ancient China could only be worn by the emperor, signifying his power and status. At first, the yellow hued space seems empty, lit only by a naked bulb. Then a faint scratching sound draws the eye upwards. There, imprisoned behind a glass ceiling, creep literally hundreds of locusts. Amongst their scuttling shapes lurk even more sinister shadows - scorpions, trapped with their prey. The piece, Huang explains, is called 'Yellow Peril' and was inspired by a German cartoon of that name of the 1890s, which personified western fears of the people of the east. Such fears, of course, mirrored those of the Han Chinese themselves, who dreaded encroachment from the Mongol hordes, and built the Great Wall to keep them at bay. The Chinese characters for yellow and for locusts have the same pronunciation, which also sounds like the artist's name, Huang. Chinese characters can have several different meanings, distinguished only by their pronunciation, a constant source of jokes which delight the Chinese and mystify outsiders. Thus this familiar seeming piece in the western installation genre, complete with nod to Damien Hirst, requires a knowledge of Chinese history, language and culture to grasp the full range of its meaning. The same is true of the work of Cai Guoqiang who makes drawings using gunpowder and Chen Zhen, who have constructed a piece called 'Terraced Field' from burned books. To a Chinese eye, the charred volumes convey not just the musings on cultural decay and political oppression which might occur to western minds but also the concept of transformation through process, immolation as fertility rite. Gu Wenda, now resident in New York, sprinkles placenta powder, an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, over five empty cots in his piece 'Oedipus Refound II'. He also shows four scrolls, whose cut up calligraphy scrolled over with fake characters in red paint, upset the Chinese authorities so much that they closed down the 1986 exhibition in which the piece was shown originally. His neighbour in the upper gallery, Yang Jie Chang, soaks rice paper in calligraphic ink, using the sodden paper to construct rectangular shapes on plain white supports whose size is determined by the site where they will be shown. The dense black shapes recall Rothko, but were produced after months of study with Taoist and Buddhist masters. It is worth remembering that, at the time when western artists were becoming influenced by such eastern modes of thought, the communist regime in China began its campaign to expunge all traces of their existence from the country. Wang Luyan is the only exhibiting artist who still lives in Beijing, where he works as a graphic designer for a national newspaper. His piece, untitled and drawn directly on the gallery wall with red and black marker pens, shows a strange construction of pulleys and saws on to whose jagged teeth sag bulbous shapes suggestive of human body parts. There seems little ambiguity here, little need for clever references, in this pictorial metaphor for the lived experience of an arbitrary and terrifying structure capable in the end only of destroying its children.

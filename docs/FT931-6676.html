			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: The paradox of Churchill - Zara Steiner admires revisionary history at its best CHURCHILL: A MAJOR NEW ASSESSMENT OF HIS LIFE IN PEACE AND WAR edited by Robert Blake and W M Louis Oxford Pounds 19.95, 581 pages CHURCHILL, THE END OF GLORY by John Charmley Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 30, 742 pages CHURCHILL quipped: 'History will bear me out,particularly as I shall write that history myself'. While the old lion may have wanted the first word, he must have known it would not be the last. Churchill: A Major New Assessment is a glittering collection of essays by a distinguished cast of historians, mainly British, without a continental (or woman) in sight. It is guaranteed to be a scholarly bestseller. There is hardly a contribution (each restricted to some 20 pages, and splendidly cross-referenced) that does not contain a golden nugget or a suggestive idea. This deconstruction of Churchill's political life is revisionist history at its very best. A nuanced introduction and a beautifully written final essay by Robert Rhodes James on the 'parliamentarian, orator and statesman' point to the central paradox in any assessment of Churchill's career. In 1939 Churchill was 65 years of age. The man for whom politics was a central passion had been out of office for 10 years and, excepting the Liberal reform years of 1909-11, his career might well have been dismissed as a study in failure. He could have been consigned to David Cannadine's list of Marlboroughs distinguished by too many debts, too much gambling and too much drink. Yet in 1940 Churchill's faults became virtues and, despite costly mistakes and terrible misjudgments, he emerged from the war as one of the greatest statesmen of our time, the only one of the three war leaders to retain almost untarnished his claim to greatness. Even Churchill's greatest strength, the masterly ability to use words in a way few could match, stemmed not from a natural facility of speech but from preparation of the most detailed kind. The effect of his rhetoric in the inter-war period was to make enemies in the Commons and to be judged boring, repetitive and prejudiced by his political peers. It was in 1940, with the brief but unforgettable 'blood, toil, tears and sweat' speech that man and moment matched. It is hard to believe that in that year, as DJ Wendon records, only five of Churchill's speeches were broadcast to the nation, for the prime minister's oratorical skills lay at the very heart of his mobilisation of the nation. The aristocrat by birth, who had probably never travelled on a bus, became the people's hero. Churchill's egotism and driving ambition did not make political friends. His lifelong faith in the greatness of Britain and the strength of her empire already seemed archaic and dangerously romantic in the inter-war period. Beyond this constancy of belief, Churchill was a mass of contradictions, shifting between parties and policies with unacceptable frequency. Writer after writer in this collection, with but one or two exceptions, exposes the gap between the image and the reality of his achievements - the creation of the Anglo-American 'special relationship', the bulldog stance of 1940, the prescient 'cold warrior' of the Stalinist period, and the great 'European' of the Zurich speech. In one of the few contributions which singles out Churchill's permanence of vision, Paul Addison points to the element of paternalism which coloured his attitude towards social reform. In many ways, Churchill remained faithful to the precepts of his Edwardian inheritance; in others, he was the supreme realist and pragmatist. In the most passionate critique of Churchill's policies, Sarvepalli Gopal argues that India was and remained Churchill's blind spot and that his visceral dislike of Gandhi, Congress and at times all Indians, brought out the harshness and cruelty in his nature. Yet even here there was an element of realism. Once India went, he knew that the empire and the main source of British power would disappear. Elsewhere in the Empire, he looked to compromise and reconciliation. Churchill was a man of prejudices and preferences but, with the exception of India and a dangerous under-estimation of the Japanese, these rarely blinded him to the needs of the moment. Apart from John Keegan, who makes a case for Churchill's Mediterranean strategy, other writers on military matters dwell on his failures. Churchill's passionate interest in war and the tools of war was a double-edged sword. The restless craving for action, the mania for capturing islands and the 'ceaseless prodding' of generals and admirals often resulted in disaster. Churchill's fascination with science and technology, as illustrated by RV Jones, and his unusual and all-important interest in intelligence were key actors in Britain's victory. Sir Harry Hinsley, however, argues that it was in reaction to the prime minister's use of the Bletchley decripts that a proper system of assessment and use was developed. Churchill could inspire men and energise Whitehall but he was also a notable bully. Only a few, Alan Brooke and Montgomery the most notable among them, could withstand his formidable tongue. The strongest indictment of Churchill as strategist and war leader comes from Richard Ollard's discussion of the Navy, for not only did Churchill never grasp the nature of sea power but he never appreciated the quality of the men who served him. This may strike many general readers as the most surprising argument in the collection. Even in 1940 Churchill's stance was not quite what it seemed. As shown by Robert Blake and David Reynolds, Churchill came to the prime ministership by default. His political weakness meant that he had to consider the possibility of peace in the terrible month of May. David Reynolds draws back the Churchillian curtain to reveal a more complicated story than that found in Churchill's own account. Nevertheless there is little doubt that the prime minister's decision for continuing the war and his ability to galvanise the nation behind him created an unforgettable kinship between the man and the people. Archaic ideas expressed in glorious prose created 'their finest hour'. Apart from his self confidence and faith in the nation, Churchill had only his belief in America's entrance into the war and a mistaken impression of German weakness to back his resolve. Twenty-nine essays do not create a composite picture and no one here quite tackles the reasons why, after all the mistakes are revealed, Churchill emerges with his 'integrity and greatness' intact. It is because John Charmley has cast doubt on the Churchillian decision taken in 1940 that he has incurred the wrath of so many historians. He fully deserves his moment of notoriety. This book is full of interest and important insights. He makes useful connections, between for instance, Churchill's stubborness over India and his determination to fight on in 1940. Charmley clearly enjoyed writing this book and this shows on almost every page. But his central thesis is fatally flawed. Churchill was not responsible for the fall of the British empire, nor can he be blamed for the country's decline from power. He did, at a crucial moment, mainly through force of personality, avoid linking Britain with Nazi Germany. This saved his fellow countrymen from having to make unacceptable decisions. Ask any Frenchman over the age of 60. It was the right choice and one which will never be forgotten. The Marlborough genes finally turned up trumps. But of the making of Churchill books there shall be no end.</p>

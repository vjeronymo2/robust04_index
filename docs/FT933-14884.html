			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Observer: Flotation As the New York Post sinks in the west, Rupert Murdoch is evidently preparing a new launch in the Pacific. Although he gave up keeping a yacht after moving from Australia to London, his move to sunny Los Angeles has set sea fever burning again. The result is a custom-built sailing boat which, if it successfully completes its trials in the Mediterranean later in the summer, will set course for California and the South Seas. A sign that the News Corporation boss is beginning to wind down for retirement? On the contrary, the buzz round the fleet is that it more probably portends his intention to establish new business beach-heads in Asia. Accordingly - and even though, at 100ft-plus overall, the vessel is modest compared with the flagships of other media moguls - it would be more fitting to address him as Admiral than Cap'n.</p>

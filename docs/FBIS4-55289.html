			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the </F> Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Istvan Joo; place and date not  given: "We Cannot Expect Self-Restraint From the Winner"]    [Text] [Joo] Why was there such a big gap between the  expectations of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the  result of the voting?    [Lezsak] I do not believe that the country voted against the  change of the regime, and not really against us, either. People  probably made this decision because of the afflictions and  disappointment. I am very sorry that even the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] did not manage to take over and  save what was impossible for us to keep because the majority of  voters lost confidence in us. We knew that we would reach fewer  votes at these elections than in 1990; nevertheless, we were  quite wrong in our estimates. It is only now, with hindsight,  that we can precisely see that the country felt that it had been  unable to have a say in the details of changing the regime. In  a period when more than 400 laws had to be passed, dialogue was  forced into the background because of the pressure of time.    [Joo] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which gained  the second largest number of votes, now claims that it is the  alternative to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] which has so  far dominated by far.    [Lezsak] This is a campaign trick of the SZDSZ. This is the  only chance of the Free Democrats to gain many mandates. This  is a temporary phenomenon; after the second round, the SZDSZ  will be seeking the factors that link it with the MSZP. This is  leading directly to their coalition.    [Joo] It is a common occurrence that the big losers of the  first round face further difficulties in the second round  because many people like to stand by the winners....    [Lezsak] We are over the abyss. It is impossible to make  the failure of the first round any worse. We have realistically  assessed our possibilities: Every single electoral district  that we win can only improve our situation.    [Joo] Will the MDF's basic political attitude change in the  new situation? According to some speculations, a move over to  the right, and according to others, a move in the liberal  direction can be expected.    [Lezsak] We will continue to represent the MDF's fundamental  values -- this party will remain in the center right. We began  to reorganize the MDF in the autumn of 1993. The result of this  was that we managed to remain in the contest in more than 100  electoral districts and avoided a total defeat. It seems that  we will be the strongest opposition party in the new parliament.  The MDF has some experience from the period before 1990. For  the first time, a period is starting when we have to fulfill our  tasks having gained experience both in opposition and in  government. Our main goal is to prevent the situation from  falling back to the level of a tamed dictatorship.    [Joo] Will there be another four years, a full parliamentary  cycle?    [Lezsak] In the interest of the country's stability, the  protection of domestic and Western investments, and new owners,  it is essential for the new parliament to operate undisturbed.  It would be a crime against the country's security if we  questioned these four years.    [Joo] Do you think that the MDF will be given as big a scope  for maneuver from the victorious political opponents as they  received in 1990 from the MDF?    [Lezsak] I do not think that the MSZP-SZDSZ government will  be capable of self-restraint. The negative experiences of the  past four years confirm the feeling in me that the discrediting  of the MDF and some of its politicians will be continued -- now  on a governmental level.    [Joo] Do you feel that the MDF is responsible for the fact  that the media organs that were fair to it are left without any  guarantees for survival?    [Lezsak] We already admitted earlier, not only with  hindsight, that the MDF and the government did not have enough  strength to create a sound media organization. It has to be  acknowledged that, between 1988 and 1990, the MSZP had prepared  its media policy for the past four years very professionally.  However, we were not incompetent, rather, we were forced to  concentrate on other issues.</p>

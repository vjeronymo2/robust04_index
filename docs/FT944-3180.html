			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Outstandings in OTC contracts top Dollars 30,000bn The total value of outstandings in the over-the-counter derivatives market seem likely to exceed Dollars 30,000bn by the end of this year, according to Swaps Monitor, the specialist New York-based publication. The figures imply 1994 growth of at least 20 per cent. Swaps Monitor estimates that the global market in interest rates swaps  - one of the most popular derivatives contracts  - will be more than Dollars 12,000bn compared with Dollars 8,200bn in 1993 and Dollars 6,100bn in 1992. The figures are contained in the publication's annual review of the derivatives industry*, which is based on a detailed breakdown of figures for 1993. The survey shows that the outstanding value of OTC contracts increased by 20 per cent last year to reach Dollars 25,500bn. Foreign exchange forward contracts  - the biggest single class of business  - increased to Dollars 9,500bn from Dollars 8,400bn. The outstanding value of two other classes of OTC contract  - forward rate agreements and interest rate options  - also rose, to Dollars 3,500bn from Dollars 3,300bn and to Dollars 2,000bn from Dollars 1,200bn, respectively. The survey also shows that the average gross replacement costs for swaps range from 1.18 per cent of notional value for currency forwards to 1.3 per cent for interest rate contracts, 1.59 per cent for OTC exchange rate contracts, 2.88 per cent for interest rate swaps and 5.97 per cent for currency swaps. Overall these figures imply that the gross replacement cost of the global OTC derivatives market was approximately Dollars 900bn as of the end of 1993. The survey says, however, that the true exposure is lower than these amounts because most counterparties have master agreements in place which permit netting. The survey also indicates that there is a high degree of concentration in the OTC market with a few large players controlling large chunks of business. In the interest rate swaps area, for example, five banks  - Chemical Bank, J. P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Paribas, and Bankers Trust  - account for a combined market share of 30 per cent. Ten banks control 47 per cent of the same market. J. P. Morgan, Paribas, Bankers Trust, Swiss Bank and Deutsche Bank are the biggest players in the currency swap market, accounting for 28 per cent of total outstandings. Citicorp, Barclays, Societe Generale, Canadian Imperial and Swiss Bank lead the market for forward rate agreements, collectively accounting for 31 per cent of the total in 1993. Swaps Monitor points out that the numbers understate slightly the degree of concentration because certain firms that would be large enough to qualify for a place in the top five or top 10 do not disclose their outstandings and are therefore excluded from the table. * The World's Major Derivatives Dealers: Swaps Monitor Publications, Inc 648 Broadway, suite 705, New York, NY 10012 Telephone (212) 254 9500</p>

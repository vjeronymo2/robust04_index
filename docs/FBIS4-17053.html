			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 19, BNS -- The leftist Democratic  Initiative Center [DIC] party will not participate in the local  government elections in order "not to take away votes from other  political organizations," said party spokesman Olegs Vovks.    The local government election law does not correspond to the  party's program that supports the franchise of all residents,  Vovks said.    Commeting on the League of Stateless Persons, Vovk said it  had no rights to represent all 700,000 non-citizens of Latvia in  the local elections as it wanted to do.    The Democratic Initiative Center would endorse a popular  referendum on citizenship proposing a five year residence  qualification, language skills and knowledge of basic principles  of Constitution as terms for naturalization, Vovks said.    Vovks conceded that he did not believe that Latvian citizens  would support DIC version for the country's citizenship law.  But he said the party would still demand a referendum to bring  the citizenship problem in the focus of popular attention.    DIC was founded in 1989. It has a membership of 53 now.</p>

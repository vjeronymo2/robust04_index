			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Temple Bar subject of contract buy out bid BZW Investment Management, the fund management arm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, yesterday took the unusual step of offering to buy out the management contract for an investment trust in which it is a shareholder because it is concerned about the existing managers. BZWIM aid it had made 'a substantial cash offer' to buy out the mangement contract of Temple Bar Investment Trust, which is currently managed by Guinness Mahon. 'On behalf of its clients, BZWIM has been a long-term shareholder in Temple Bar Investment Trust and has become concerned with the recent changes in the management of the company.' Several weeks ago, BZWIM approached Sir Roland Smith, Temple Bar's chairman, and asked to acquire the management contract. BZWIM was rebuffed, although the full board will meet shortly to consider the proposal. Under the proposal, BZWIM would pay a sum, believed to be equal to one year's management fees, to the board of Temple Bar in exchange for the contract. The trust, with roughly a 14 per cent exposure to property, would then be managed using BZWIM's traditional and quantitative management techniques.</p>

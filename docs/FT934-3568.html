			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Inspirations group to be listed on USM The tour operating sector acquired its third quoted company yesterday with the placing of 28.3 per cent of the shares of Inspirations, the holiday company. The company is to be listed on the Unlisted Securities Market, with dealings expected to begin on December 13. The two other quoted companies involved purely in the package holiday business are Airtours and Owners Abroad, the second and third largest tour operators. The holiday market leader, Thomson, is a Canadian-controlled public company, but also has extensive media interests. Mr Vic Fatah, Inspirations' chief executive, was the founder of Sunmed Holidays, which merged with the tour operating arm of British Airways in 1987 to create Redwing Holidays. Redwing was sold to Owners Abroad in 1990. The placing by stockbrokers Beeson Gregory values the company at Pounds 23m. The company said the placing was twice subscribed. In the 11 months to September 30, Inspirations made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m on Pounds 118.4m turnover. The company carried 166,700 people during the period. In the year to October 31 1992, pre-tax profits were Pounds 749,000 on turnover of Pounds 49.7m. The company sells holidays under the Inspirations and Style brands. It also has a retail arm with five travel agency outlets. Under an agreement reached last May, AT Mays, the UK's fourth largest travel retail chain, manages the chains. Inspirations has undertaken to acquire or start up a minimum of 50 retail outlets by the end of next year. It also has an airline seat broking business.</p>

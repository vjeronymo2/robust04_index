			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Multimedia link launched Canada's nine biggest telephone companies have launched MediaLinx, a national multimedia highway, to compete directly with the cable television industry, writes Robert Gibbens. MediaLinx is 60 per cent owned by BCE, Bell Canada's parent company. It will offer consumers video-on-demand entertainment, interactive home shopping and financial services, education courses, data, healthcare, publishing and some government services. It has a five-year budget of CDollars 250m (USDollars 186.5m) to develop the technology needed. MediaLinx, made possible by a regulatory decision last month, is part of the CDollars 8bn Beacon project through which the phone companies will upgrade all their transmission systems to fibre optics with co-axial connections to the home over the next decade.</p>

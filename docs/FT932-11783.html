			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Paper profits encourage flotation - The development of Inveresk since its management buy-out INVERESK, the Scottish speciality paper company, the subject of a management buy-out in 1990, is coming to the market via a placing and intermediaries offer to raise Pounds 30m. The issue would value the company at over Pounds 75m. The pathfinder prospectus will be issued next Thursday and Inveresk will join the diminished band of quoted British-owned paper companies in an industry dominated by large foreign-owned groups. Yet it believes it can not only survive but also expand, partly through acquisition, in the European speciality paper sector. Inveresk is a famous name in British paper-making, formed after the first world war as a grouping of private mills. In 1981 it was bought by Georgia-Pacific of the US. When problems at home hit GP it co-operated in allowing Mr Stefan Kay, Inveresk's managing director, to put together a management buy-out backed by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital. The MBO brought a powerful dose of managerial energy and also allowed Inveresk to make investments, running at between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m a year in each of the last two years, in improved capacity, which had not been possible in the later stages of GP's ownership. After little more than a year Inveresk was able to pay back about Pounds 20m of senior debt and mezzanine financing out of improved cash flow Mr Kay is keen to dispel the notion that the paper industry consists solely of very large companies with capital investments running to Pounds 250m per machine, exposing them to violent cyclical swings in what are, in effect, commodity markets. 'We are a major force in speciality paper making worldwide,' he said. James Capel, the company's broker added in a circular that Inveresk should not be seen as 'a small fish in a big sea' but rather as having a significant presence 'in a number of rockpools'. Each of Inveresk's four mills, three of which are within 40 minutes drive of the head office in Dunfermline, Fife, with the fourth, near Wells in Somerset, have strong positions in specific areas, such as business stationery, label papers and coated graphic boards. Although Inveresk now exports 44 per cent of its output it has been hit by the recession in the UK, with turnover falling from Pounds 98m in the year to December 1 1990 to Pounds 88m last year. However, operating margins increased from 7.6 per cent in 1990 to 9.8 per cent last year when pre-tax profits increased marginally from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 5.8m. Mr Kay said that while the results did not at first sight look a spectacular basis for a flotation, they actually represented a very sound performance. 'We've fought our way through a very difficult climate and invested heavily. We've got great capacity for organic growth, none of our mills is running at capacity. We can expand without taking on more people.' Though there are no directly comparable quoted paper companies, analysts regard the performance as impressive. Mr Kay said the MBO was designed with a relatively early exit in mind. The institutions which backed it - Morgan Grenfell, County NatWest Ventures and 3i - would be keeping about 65 per cent of their holdings, while management would retain between 80 and 85 per cent of their stakes. GP, which had the right to 5 per cent of the proceeds of a flotation, is taking a 3.3 per cent stake. After the flotation the existing institutional shareholders should end up with about 40 per cent of the company with management having between 25 and 30 per cent and new shareholders holding the rest. About Pounds 5m of the money raised will be new cash. 'This is a tactical manoeuvre to get out of the (rather restrictive) MBO mode into quoted company mode,' said Mr Paul Dollman, finance director, who joined the company last month from Maddox Group. 'It is not about building up a war chest. We've still got a Pounds 20m loan facility which we've never used. We will be debt free from day one,' he said. Mr Kay said there were acquisitions to be made among speciality papermakers in the UK and northern continental Europe both in family-owned companies and the 'orphan children' of bigger groups, which Inveresk was itself before the MBO. James Capel, however, pointed out that, once floated, Inveresk would be attractive as an acquisition for other paper companies, naming Portals, a quoted British speciality paper maker, as a potential predator. 'We have no ambition to be taken over,' said Mr Kay. He added that performance in the first four months of this year had been very encouraging, ahead of last year in both sales and volume in the 'extremely modest' UK recovery. The full prospectus will be issued on May 20 and dealing in the shares begins on June 2.</p>

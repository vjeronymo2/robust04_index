			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The royal dilemma that won't go away: David Cannadine predicts that 1993 will contain even more bad news for the beleaguered House of Windsor which they almost certainly are - the Queen's annus horribilis is going to drag out through every remaining day of this month until the bells ring out the old year at midnight on December 31. But it seems inconceivable that things will end there. For despite the expressions of sympathy and support, there now appears every prospect that, for both the Queen and her visibly disintegrating family, 1993 may well be an annus even more horribilis. Consider the facts. In the course of the past seven days, there has been the announcement of the Princess Royal's second wedding, which is being rushed through today with express speed. In between, there has been the news of the apparently amicable separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, by comparison with which all the previous royal exposures, conflagrations and publicity disasters of this year pale into insignificance. Despite conservative fears and republican hopes, the monarchy is not self-destructing. However open to ridicule it is in danger of becoming in the popular press, the show will go on. But the stage has been reached when the monarchy is pushing the panic button, loud and clear. For the only conclusion that can be drawn from the terms of the separation settlement is that neither the palace nor the government has the slightest idea what will happen next. It is being insisted in certain official quarters that this separation arrangement is itself the solution; that the Prince and Princess of Wales should now be allowed to live their separate and private lives; and that the future is assured because they will one day come together again as king and queen. But the settlement has only to be summarised in this way for it to be clear that, far from being a solution to a problem, it will only make things worse. It might well be the case that, the bizarre nature of these terms and future provisions notwithstanding, nothing else could have been done at this time. The royal couple could not have gone on as they were; but neither party wanted an instant divorce, so what else was there to do? And it is also the case that, now the long-expected and long-predicted separation has actually happened, the mood of the public is not as easy to gauge or to predict as had seemed likely before the event. The truth is that it is not yet clear - and might not be clear for many months - just how this latest royal misadventure is going to play out in terms of the public's reaction and response. Already, though, there are ominous signs that this settlement is not going to work. For all the claims that there are no constitutional issues and implications, there seems a real possibility that the monarchy will suffer grave damage. And if a gravely damaged monarchy is not a constitutional issue, then what is? Take Prince Charles first. Whatever the reality of his marriage and its breakdown, recent press coverage shows he is regarded widely as a man who has failed spectacularly to do the one thing which, rightly or wrongly, people still expect the heir to the throne to do: namely, to live his family life successfully. The prince, so this argument runs, has spent a great deal of time telling society what is good for it. But what right has he to do this when he has made such a conspicuous hash of his own life? This leads us to Princess Diana. She might be the most glamorous woman in the country - indeed, in the world - combining in a remarkable way the attributes of mother and martyr, saint and cover girl. And it might also be that this settlement, in which she keeps both the children and her crown, is a personal triumph for her which she was able to accomplish only because of her extraordinary public standing. But the idea that, despite all the sadness of her marriage to Prince Charles, she might still want - and expect? - to be queen, seems incredible. Then there is the question of Charles and Diana as separated spouses. What is going to happen now? Will they have affairs and take lovers? Is it realistic to suppose that they will be able to keep it a secret if they do? The prospect of the heir to the throne and his wife leading separate sex lives must surely be a tabloid editor's dream. In short, the insatiable appetite of the media for more scandals and more revelations inevitably will be stimulated by this separation settlement. What, then, are the realistic prospects of their joint coronation? Only royal advisers desperate to find a ray of hope - and completely out of touch with the public mood - could have expected that this proposal would fly. The idea that at some future, unspecified date, Charles and Diana will give up their separate lives and come together once more, however briefly, as king and queen, is an insult to common sense and to the Church of England under whose auspices the sacrament of their coronation would take place. Then there is the unfortunate figure of Prince William: the product, like his mother, of a broken marriage. Already, he is being seen in some quarters as the next best hope. If only the Prince of Wales will renounce his right of succession, the argument runs, the crown can pass on, unimpaired, to his eldest son and this regrettable interlude can be forgotten. But it is not clear, despite much speculation on the subject, that William - who must have suffered much already - can be the person to solve the difficulties caused by his parents' marital break-up. In short, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this separation settlement will not settle or stabilise anything. On the contrary, in many ways it can only make matters worse, more risky and more uncertain than when the royal pair maintained an official fiction of marriage. The uncertainties will last, not just into 1993 but for an unforeseeably protracted future. There might indeed have been no alternative: but that serves only to show how intractable things have become, and how miserable the prospects appear. This brings us to the broader issue to which this latest royal disaster relates. The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales will not only intensify the prurient intrusiveness of the tabloid press: it will also intensify the debate about the purpose, function and future of the monarchy itself (a debate, it must be remembered, to which the Queen herself gave her royal imprimatur recently). In the long perspective of history, the problem which, it seemed, the British had solved brilliantly was that of finding something for a monarchy to do once its traditional functions - as law-giver and warrior - had been given up or taken away. The solution which evolved was 'constitutional monarchy' which, essentially, meant trading power for pageantry, dynastic profligacy for a royal family, and Germanic accents for an imperial crown. The fundamental difficulty for the monarchy today is that, during the present queen's reign, these functions and justifications have been gradually but inexorably eroded. She herself is among a declining number in England who believe in the Commonwealth. And the pageantry of which royal weddings were such an integral part has surely now become questionable: it certainly has for Princess Anne at Crathie church today. Deprived of these 'traditional' functions, it is not altogether clear what there is left for the British monarchy to do. Or, put more depressingly, it is not at all clear what the sovereign, her relatives and her advisers believe there is to do. Perhaps the course is set already and a Monaco monarchy - trivialised and a perpetual scandal-machine - is indeed the only future function on offer. (After all, in the long run, the British monarchy has swung repeatedly from respectability to scandal and back to respectability again. Perhaps what we are now witnessing is merely the next inexorable swing of the pendulum). The British monarchy has survived damaging troublesbefore - most obviously in the time of the delinquent children of King George III - and it could well be that it will survive the latest scandals as well. But the 1990s are not the 1820s. Then, Britain was a rigidly hierarchical society and, in the majority of countries, monarchy was still the natural order of things. Today, by contrast, monarchy can be seen as an anachronistic relic which, if it is to survive as anything more than a tawdry and demeaning soap opera, must do something serious, sensible and substantial to justify itself. Thus far, that is the challenge to which the embattled and beleaguered House of Windsor has failed conspicuously to rise this year. What is the British monarchy for? What sort of monarchy have we got? What sort of monarchy do we need? Do we need a monarchy at all? As the royal family falls apart before our curious eyes, these questions are going to become more, not less, insistent. If the Queen is serious in wanting debate on the monarchy, she will be well advised to address the issues in her Christmas message. Platitudes about peace on earth, happy families and her annus horribilis will no longer suffice.

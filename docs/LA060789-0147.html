			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUNDREDS QUEUE IN SINGAPORE FOR FUNDS FROM BANK OF CHINA  </P> <P> Hundreds of Singaporeans lined up for more than a mile outside the Bank of  China today to withdraw their savings because of concern over the turmoil in  China.  </P> <P> The Chinese bank, which remained open until 10 p.m. Tuesday to clear the rush  of about 3,000 depositors, paid out more than $13.5 million, Deputy General  Manager Min You-Chi said.  </P> <P> "This is a fraction of our total deposits. The bank will try to accommodate all  who want to withdraw their money," he said.  </P> <P> Many customers who lined up today brought packed lunches, anticipating a long  wait. Police guided the crowd inching toward the bank building in the heart of  the business district.  </P> <P> "I want to withdraw all my savings because I fear my money is not safe with the  bank," said a housewife who got in line at 4 a.m.  </P></p>

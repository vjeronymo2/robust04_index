The academy, a centre of the development of the chuche-based  agro-science, was founded on December 29, 1948.    The great leader President Kim Il-song who is always deeply  interested in the agricultural development of the country,  visited the academy on some 110 occasions and indicated the  direction of comprehensively developing all fields of  agricultural sciences and has wisely led the work for its  realization.    Today the academy has more than 30 central institutes  specialized in rice, maize, soil, cultivation, agrobiology,  agro-chemistry and agricultural irrigation.    There are over 180 scientific research bases including  branches of agricultural science and experimental farms in each  province.    Thousands of scientists work there.    Among them are Kim Sang-yon and Kim Chong-hui, authoritative  academicians, professors and doctors in the field of rice  breeding and veterinary science, Yi Pong-hwi, a famous doctor in  the field of maize breeding and hundreds of other people with  academic degrees or titles.    According to data available, scientific research bases and  ranks of scientists have increased tens of times and ranks of  people with academic degrees or titles hundreds of times  compared with the early period of its founding.    The academy has registered a large number of successes in  the  development of agricultural science of the nation since its  foundation.    Upwards of 600 varieties bred introduced by researchers are  now introduced.    They have rounded off farming methods suitable to region and  soil on the principle of right crop in right time and proper  crop in proper area.    It is noticeable in the field of cultivation that a signal  success is recorded with the completion of a farming method in  highland 1,000-1,400 metre high above sea level and double  cropping method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and  other mild climate areas.    And different kinds of chemical fertilizers suitable to  growing condition of crops have been studied and developed and  their qualitative composition improved.    Now fertilizers are applied to all crops in the Korean  countryside on the principle of complete manuring system.    Besides, a large number of farm machines have been invented  and introduced by researchers of the Academy of Sciences. As a  result, all farming work has been mechanized and a great success  garnered in developing overall fields of agricultural production  including soil and irrigation.    Researchers are now directing great efforts to getting new  strains of rice and maize for a higher and stable yield and  researching and completing a variety of fertilizers with  domestic resources.</p>

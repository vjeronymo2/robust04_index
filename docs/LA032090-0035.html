			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAN SHIFTS COST OF VENTURA BLVD. WORK TO LANDOWNERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles city planners proposed Monday that developers of new projects on  Ventura Boulevard pay a smaller share of the $200-million-plus price tag for  improving traffic conditions, shifting the balance to existing commercial  property owners.  </P> <P> Senior City Planner Bob Sutton said the fees the Planning Department originally  proposed last month, as part of an overall plan to control growth along Ventura  Boulevard, had to be sharply revised because they would have faced legal  challenges.  </P> <P> The first system called for developers to pay the entire cost of upgrading  Ventura Boulevard to make it possible for it to handle more traffic without  strain.  </P> <P> But in a report released Monday, city planners concluded that all property  owners should bear some financial responsibility for improvements. Sutton said  the city attorney's office had warned that new developers could only be  assessed fees to mitigate traffic impacts directly related to their projects.  </P> <P> Business owners frowned on the proposed assessment district.  </P> <P> "We have trouble now collecting rents, and we're not going to be happy at all  with another assessment," said Hy Termin, who owns the 10-shop Sherman Oaks  Village Shopping center. "That cost will have to be passed on to our tenants,  who are already screaming that rents are too high," he said.  </P> <P> Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said the proposed assessment  district would not work without a moratorium on all construction. "There still  needs to be a halt on construction until the funding mechanism for the  improvements is worked out," Silver said.  </P> <P> While some homeowners and property owners along the boulevard pondered the  plan's revisions Monday, a group of developers and business owners urged City  Council members and their representatives to adopt the specific plan as soon as  possible.  </P> <P> "The plan is not perfect, but no plan ever is," said developer Michael  Zugsmith, who was a member of the citizens advisory committee that drew up the  original proposal. "But the plan should be approved now. We all have individual  reservations about the plan, but there are mechanisms to change it once it's in  place. To delay it any more would be a joke."  </P> <P> The fees to be assessed on developments are a critical element of the Ventura  Boulevard Specific Plan, which will be reviewed by the city's Planning  Commission on Thursday. The plan also must be considered by the City Council.  </P> <P> Planning officials also recommended a revision that would exempt developers  from paying the traffic impact fees if they build pedestrian-oriented retail  stores on the ground floors of their projects.  </P> <P> Sutton said the revision was prompted by homeowners who want to encourage  neighborhood businesses. They had complained that the heavy fees proposed in  the earlier version of the specific plan would make neighborhood-oriented  retail developments economically unfeasible and would lead to even greater  pressure to build office projects. The plan would establish a ceiling of 8.6  million square feet of additional commercial construction along the San  Fernando Valley's major artery. That much new development would produce about  30,000 extra auto trips per hour during the afternoon rush-hour.  </P> <P> The existing 19 million square feet of commercial development along Ventura  Boulevard generates about 70,000 auto trips per hour.  </P> <P> Traffic planners predict it will be possible to add 30,000 vehicle trips to the  boulevard without worsening current traffic conditions -- but only if the city  spends about $200 million on traffic improvement projects.  </P> <P> The projects needed to prevent gridlock on Ventura Boulevard include widening  30 intersections to permit new right- and left-turn lanes and installing a  computerized traffic signal system.  </P> <P> Originally, the specific plan called for developers to pay an average fee of  about $5,800 for each additional auto trip on Ventura Boulevard generated by  their projects. But Monday's report recommended an average fee of $3,600.  </P> <P> The fee system also calls for $42 million of the cost of the traffic  improvements to be spread out over all commercial property owners along the  length of the 17-mile boulevard.  </P> <P> Setting up a benefit assessment district, which would allow collection of that  money, would require a two-thirds vote of the 15-member City Council. That  action, however, could be blocked by a majority of the affected property  owners.  </P> <P> If a benefit assessment district were not established, growth along the  boulevard would have to be restricted to far less than the 8.6 million square  feet of development contemplated under the current proposal, Sutton said.  </P> <P> Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said he welcomed the changes  in the plan. "They're just what we need to preserve our community," Close said,  referring to the emphasis on the development of pedestrian retail areas.  </P> <P> "Having that kind of development answers our needs because we can't widen  Ventura," he said. "Now there's some innovation to solving these problems  rather than erecting large parking lots and offices."  </P></p>

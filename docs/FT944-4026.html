			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Marking time over rates - Banks and societies await next move The government's defeat on Tuesday night over value added tax on domestic fuel was followed swiftly by a half percentage point base rate rise on Wednesday morning. And while the markets had been expecting an increase, its timing could have been accelerated by events in the House of Commons. The base rate now stands at 6.25 per cent but Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, indicated that further rises could be necessary to control inflation, although he hoped they would reach a plateau 'fairly soon'. Banks and building societies have been reluctant to respond. Many may be waiting for indications of when the next base rate rise is due. If they think it will come soon, they may decide to save administrative costs by making a single move then. One exception was Northern Rock, which broke ranks soon after chancellor Kenneth Clarke delivered his mini-Budget on Thursday. It will raise its mortgage rate to new and existing borrowers on December 19 from 8.14 per cent to 8.54 per cent. The rise will add Pounds 11 a month to payments for a Pounds 40,000 loan. General manager Alan Applegarth said: 'I find this government very hard to read, so there is no point in waiting. I can't see the others holding out for very long.' Halifax, the largest society with 12m savers and and 1.8m borrowers, maintained yesterday that it had no immediate plans to put up mortgages but said: 'Savings rates are the crucial element. 'Moving on the mortgage side does not influence us but, if rates to savers go up, we will have to put ours up to be competitive.' Since Northern Rock will increase its rates to savers from January 5, there might not be long to wait. It hopes to announce the size of the increase by the end of next week. One reason for lenders' reluctance to put up mortgage rates is the potential dampening effect on the housing market. The Halifax said it was 'very disappointed' because the base rate rise would damage an already fragile housing market recovery. The Council of Mortgage Lenders added yesterday: 'The housing market is still quiet, and the recent announcements of cutbacks in income support and rising interest rates are unlikely to assist its recovery.' The National Association of Estate Agents is resigned to the move. Its president, Eva Lomas, said: 'It is better to have the increase in the pre-Christmas period, in what is traditionally a quiet time, than to have it foisted upon us in the new year or early spring when the property market usually picks up.' Housing affordability still remains good, but the CML said the negative psychological impact was harder to quantify. 'If people are worried about the future direction of interest rates or about their own financial prospects, this will weaken their confidence in choosing to buy a home.' Ian Darby, of mortgage-broker John Charcol, believes that the profits of many societies are healthy enough to allow them to put up rates to savers and keep mortgage rates unchanged. 'That is one option,' the Halifax conceded. 'But the standard mortgage rate has become less important than before because of the availability of discounts.'</p>

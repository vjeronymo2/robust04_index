Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291&hyph;6309. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. Test procedures shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedure is not required if the Department of Energy determines by rule that one cannot be developed. Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eighty days after a test procedure for a product is adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumption or cost of energy consumed by the product except as reflected in tests conducted according to the Department of Energy procedure. Section 323(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the 180-day period referred to in section 323(c)(2) may be extended for an additional 180 days if the Secretary determines that the requirements of section 323(c)(2) would impose undue burden. Section 323(c)(3). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labeling rules for household appliances and certain commercial products are administered by the Federal Trade Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

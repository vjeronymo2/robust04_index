			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / People: BT and Mercury set for gridlock? Two former top executives at Cable and Wireless and British Telecommunications have joined forces to spearhead a challenge by the National Grid Company to the telecommunications duopoly operated by their erstwhile employers. Gordon Owen, group managing director of C and W until last year, became special adviser to the project, called Telecom Electric, at the beginning of the month. Previously he was in charge of C and W's subsidiary, Mercury Communications, which is BT's main rival in the UK market. David Dey, managing director of BT's business communications division until last year, has joined as Telecom Electric's project leader. Before working for BT, he was in charge of Plessey's telecommunications business. If a pilot project is successful, the intention is that Owen will become chairman and Dey chief executive. The appointment of such senior figures in the telecommunications industry is being interpreted as evidence that the National Grid intends to make a big push into the newly liberalised telecommunications market. ***** Tokio Katayama has arrived as the new director general in London of the Japan External Trade Organisation, JETRO's largest overseas office. Like all appointees to this post, Katayama comes from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). Since 1990 he has been director of the electric power administration division of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy. Before that he had picked up experience of trade relations as a director of the North Asia division of Miti, dealing with Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. At Miti since 1969, he spent three years as first secretary in the Japanese embassy in Singapore, where he was concerned with Japan/Singapore trade relations. He succeeds Shun-ichi Nakao, who is returning to Japan after two years in the UK - which included the Japan Festival, a 'highlight' of his tour, according to an official. Nakao becomes executive director of the New Office Promotion Society, which is aiming to improve conditions for the country's office workers. While JETRO these days concentrates on promoting foreign imports, rather than Japanese exports, Katayama is giving nothing away as to precise plans for his UK sojourn. The statement that emerged from his office read: 'It is most gratifying that as a result of mutual effort over many years, Anglo-Japanese relations are so good. Although there have been some problems between the two countries, we have always been able to iron these out, and I believe that the most important thing is our continuing will to deepen and widen this good relationship for the future.' ***** Imperial Chemical Industries has reorganised the top of its troubled chemicals and polymers division following the appointment of Michael Brogden as divisional chief executive in April. Deryk King (left), 44, has been made general manager of a new fourth group within the C&amp;P division, comprising its polyester intermediates business and 'Melinar' polymers operations. The other three groups within the division are chlor, petrochemicals and plastics, and chemical products. King, currently general manager of ICI fertilisers into which the industrial ammonia and methanol operations are to be integrated, will report to Brogden. ***** Timothy Newman has been promoted to group treasurer of The HAMMERSON PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. ***** David Newman, formerly director of finance at Shell Ventures UK, has been appointed finance director of the SIRA Group of companies. ***** Ian Storey has been appointed international marketing director of MARLOW FOODS; he moves from Unilever. ***** Andrew Allner has been appointed director of financial control at GUINNESS; he joins from Price Waterhouse, where he dealt with Guinness among other companies, and succeeds Philip Yea who was recently appointed director of finance for Guinness Brewing Worldwide. ***** John Gaydon, formerly a director and executive producer of Medialab, has been appointed md of POLYGRAM TELEVISION INTERNATIONAL. ***** Paul Seftel has been appointed md of BENDICKS of MAYFAIR, the UK subsidiary of The Storck Group. ***** Terry Dabbs, md of Electrolux Service, has been appointed senior vice-president of After Sales, Europe. ***** Martin Sanderson, finance director of Carbo, has been appointed to the board of its parent, The HOPKINSONS GROUP. ***** John Cope has been appointed to the board of PORTALS GROUP and md of its protection and control division. ***** David McNair has been appointed marketing director of Hiram Walker, the spirits and wine sector of ALLIED-LYONS; he moves from United Distillers. ***** William Whitehead (below), formerly director of manufacturing operations, has been appointed to the main board of ROYAL DOULTON as production director.</p>

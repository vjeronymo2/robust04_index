			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK banks The more optimistic tone of the UK property market is good news for the clearing banks. For once, there is a chance that their bad debt provisions may be a pleasant surprise. Touche Ross had more good news last week on receiverships which fell nearly 30 per cent in the first five months of the year. Queens Moat apart, there has been a remarkable dearth of large corporate problems. Perhaps, despite Speyhawk, banks are learning not to call in their loans as soon as collateral values start to rise. Small companies certainly seem less squeezed than usual for this stage of the cycle. The unexpected fall in unemployment also promises fewer defaults on personal loans. The largest beneficiary should be Barclays whose results last year included an abnormally large Pounds 226m increase in its general provision. There should be little need for that to be repeated this year. Indeed, talk may even turn eventually to the possibility of a release from general provisions if loan growth remains weak. Better pre-tax profits may not, though, have much immediate impact on dividends. Having flagged 6 per cent as its target ratio for tier one capital, Barclays will need to concentrate on retaining earnings. National Westminster also needs to build up its 5.2 per cent capital ratio. Apart from mortgage lending, on which they enjoy high margins at present, many banks are still heavily dependent on cost cutting for gains in operating income. After outperforming by 15 per cent so far this year, the sector needed good news on provisions to justify its advance.</p>

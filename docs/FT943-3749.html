			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Israeli-PLO aid row moves to Oslo Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, meet in Oslo today to try to resolve a row over foreign aid which derailed last week's international donors conference and delayed the release of money for the cash-strapped Palestinian self-rule authority. The row focuses on Palestinian demands for donors to fund projects in Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem and is yet another example of the tortuous problems both sides have in implementing their fragile peace agreement signed exactly a year ago. Last week's aid meeting in Paris broke down after Israel flatly refused to allow East Jerusalem projects to be considered as part of the 1995 aid-funded Palestinian budget. Under the self-rule agreement, both sides postponed discussions on the future of Jerusalem until late 1995. However, the plight of Arab East Jerusalem remains the most emotive issue to Palestinians and a constant rallying point of Mr Arafat's critics who say he has conceded too much in peace talks with Israel. For the moment, the Palestinians have little alternative but to give in to Israeli opposition. The authority urgently needs donors to speed up the release of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised aid to help with economic development and meet high economic expectations. The PLO has presented a revised budget deficit of Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.1m) a month. Israel has said it is reluctant to proceed with the transfer authority over health, welfare, taxation and tourism to the Palestinians in the still occupied West Bank until there are firm commitments by donors to meet the financial gap. The PLO is also desperate for an aid agreement to establish a 'Cop Fund' worth Dollars 7m a month to pay for the 9,000-strong Palestinian security forces. For their part, international donors continue to insist the PLO demonstrates better financial management, institution building and commitment to tax collection. Mr Arafat and Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, met in Gaza yesterday to ease the row that Mr Shochat called 'a small crisis'. The US yesterday announced financial backing for five business ventures in Gaza, Jericho and the West Bank by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Vice-president Al Gore said loans and political risk insurance would be provided for various projects which amount to nearly Dollars 90m in American business investment.</p>

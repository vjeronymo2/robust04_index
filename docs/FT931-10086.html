			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Seoul awaits new stimuli after late rally in 1992 - The recent recovery in South Korea The recent cut in South Korea's official interest rates is expected to have mixed effects on the Seoul equity market this year. Most analysts believe that the cut will lay the foundation for a recovery in the second half of the year as economic conditions improve, although it will not match the gains which the market has achieved in the past six months. The immediate result has been profit-taking, and a fall in the Korea composite index from a January 9 high of 709.77 to yesterday's 675.33. The market had already anticipated the interest rate cut, rising by 55 per cent from last year's low. The rise in share prices also reflected investor confidence in the country's political stability following the mid-December election of Mr Kim Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party as the country's next president. Expectations that the economy will rebound this year after a dismal 1992 was another reason for the advance. There are predictions that the market will reach the 800-point level later this year after a sluggish first half. 'The recent downturn in share prices is natural given the highly speculative nature of the Seoul market,' says Mr Andrew Holland, research director for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in South Korea, but falling interest rates are expected to encourage the placing of more funds in the liquidity-driven equity market, as bonds become less lucrative. More foreign money is also expected to flow into the Seoul bourse if the government keeps its promise of increasing the foreign investor ceiling from the current 10 per cent to 15 or 20 per cent later this year. The foreign shareholding limit has been filled for about 10 per cent of the 691 companies listed on the exchange. Foreigners made a net investment of Dollars 2.07bn in the market in 1992, the first year the bourse was open to direct investment from abroad. Foreign investment could double this year due to the expanded foreign shareholding quota; in January, at Dollars 476m, it reached its highest ever monthly total. The relaxation on foreign investment controls should coincide with an improvement in earnings, as lower interest rates reduce the financial costs of Korea's overleveraged companies. The Ministry of Finance estimates that falling interest rates will reduce total corporate financial expenses by Won3,000bn (Dollars 3.7bn); analysts predict that earnings will increase by 10 to 20 per cent. The interest rate cut is considered a preliminary step to several stimulative measures the new government will take this year to boost economic growth. Officials hope to achieve GNP growth of 6 per cent in 1993, against an estimated 4.5 per cent last year, the worst economic performance since the 1980 recession. Several large infrastructure projects could boost the share price of construction stocks, while lower interest rates may benefit financial shares. Investor interest in small and medium-sized companies is expected to recover: the state plans to provide more credit to these concerns to prevent a further wave of the bankruptcies which reached a near-record level last year. Bank shares may also be bolstered as the government unveils proposals in mid-year about a restructuring of the financial industry, which could include plans for bank mergers. Analysts warn, however, that the bourse is likely to peak at around 800, as institutional investors sell a large overhang of securities which they acquired in 1990 when the market was last at that level. An administrative guideline introduced last August - requiring institutional investors to buy more stock than they sell - has so far prevented them from disposing of their share surplus. But this market-boosting measure is unlikely to be extended by the government past May or June. An expected increase in share offerings to take advantage of an expiring corporate tax deduction could also soak up liquidity and depress prices. Another possible adverse factor is interest rate deregulation. Most lending and deposit rates are scheduled to be freed this year, which is expected to drive up interest rates in the short term. Although industry generally considers interest rate reform essential to its future prosperity, the immediate effect may be to curb the market's climb.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> "I'm 50," says Ted Turner with a melancholy moan. "It's amazing how it sneaks  up on you, isn't it? Seems like only yesterday I was younger."  </P> <P> Actually, yesterday he was younger. And tomorrow he'll be older still. But  something about Ted Turner still suggests the bloom of youth. He still has  visions, some of them goofy, and still has dreams. Whatever one may think of  him -- and just about everyone has an opinion -- no one can take away his place  in modern communications history.  </P> <P> He made his mark, and the mark is CNN, the Cable News Network, launched by  Turner in 1980 when cable was still a soggy baby. The first 24-hour all-news  network, CNN has survived some rough early years to become a prominent and  valued landmark on America's electronic horizon.  </P> <P> But as Turner's empire has grown, his own role within it has shrunk. Top-heavy  with debt, Turner had to bring in other investors and share control of his  company with them. Only recently, when Turner wanted to make a bid on the  Financial News Network (FNN), another cable outfit, the board of directors of  Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. put the kibosh on the deal.  </P> <P> "It slows us up some over what it was before," Turner acknowledges.  </P> <P> He speaks in his trademark sleepy drawl, his droopy eyelids at half mast. But  Ted Turner is hardly out of energy. He is not a man to run from a fight, and is  much more likely to start one. Lately he's been attacking NBC, owners of CNBC,  the new "consumer news" cable channel that signed on April 17. Chartered not to  be a duplicate of CNN, Turner is nevertheless suspicious.  </P> <P> "What's 'consumer news' ?" he asks. "News of interest to consumers. Like, what  happened in the world today."  </P> <P> That's the mild version of his objection. A more Turneresque torpedo was fired  during a speech to Washington's Metro Cable Club on March 8. He called GE,  which owns NBC, "the most corrupt corporation in America."  </P> <P> Ah, Captain Outrageous, ever unvarnished. But another of Turner's controversies  has to do with varnish he does apply: the computer coloring of old  black-and-white movies from the MGM, Warner Bros., and RKO libraries that  Turner bought. He is completely unapologetic about it, though he does concede  that colorizing was pretty ghastly when first introduced.  </P> <P> Turner's old movies, colorized and uncolorized, are unreeled on WTBS, the  Atlanta-based SuperStation that goes to hundreds of cable systems, and on TNT  ("Turner Network Television"), the latest venture, set up mainly to help  amortize the costs of buying the movies in the first place.  </P> <P> In addition to all these enterprises, Ted Turner has one other big passion:  saving the planet Earth from destruction. He started the Better World Society  to encourage pacifist and ecologically minded programming. He himself ordered  production of "Portrait of the Soviet Union," a seven-part glasnosty travelogue  that was so glossy and rosy a view of the U.S.S.R. that the Soviets themselves  ran a disclaimer when they showed it on state-owned television.  </P> <P> Again, Turner has no apologies. He says "Soviet Union" was no more positive  than was his "Portrait of America" series, shown previously on his cable  channels. "That's why I didn't say 'picture.' I didn't say 'Accurate Picture of  the Soviet Union.' I said 'portrait.' And when you're painting a portrait, you  leave out the blemishes, right?"  </P> <P> There would be plenty of blemishes to leave out of a portrait of Ted Turner.  But there is also much to admire. He scoffs at those who play it safe --  whether individuals or companies -- and who shy away from new risks. "The  golden age of cable is dawning," Turner says. If so, he has played an enormous  role in bringing it about. He's the Charles A. Lindbergh of cable television,  still flying bravely by the seat of his pants.  </P></p>

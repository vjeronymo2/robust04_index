			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nuri Najm al-Marsumi: "Once Again, Dwarfs </F> Playing With Fire!"]    [Text] Every time it seems that the Security Council agrees  to review the issue of the criminal sanctions imposed on Iraq,  the dwarfs ruling the governorate of Kuwait start to fabricate  some problem or promote some dead problem, long after it became  clear to all that what was called the "Kuwaiti prisoner crisis"  has no basis in fact, that it is merely a card played by the  al-Sabah dwarfs to put pressure on Iraq. A few days before the  criminal aggression against the border control station, they  fabricated and began to agitate about the tunnel they dug and  its passage through Iraqi territory that Iraqi farmers refused  to give up. No one but them, with the bribes they paid so some  hirelings and agents content to live on the crumbs from  foreigners' tables, and to media mercenaries and Western  intelligence--it is they who made up the lies and fabrications  about Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the south.    The dwarfs, installed by force of arms by the  American-Zionist alliance as rulers in the governorate of  Kuwait, are playing with fire and have apparently become  proficient at committing crimes against the people and the  nation, having incited and taken part in committing the crime of  the age against Iraq and continuing their futile efforts against  the enduring and steadfast nation.    We say it frankly: Iraq has honored all of its commitments  relating to the Security Council resolutions, despite the  suffering and oppression it endured. If it is expected to  continue this policy, it is awaiting a positive and honorable  stand from the Security Council, not influenced by the dwarfs of  the governorate of Kuwait and the other terrified agent rulers  in the region, who have sold out their countries and peoples for  a pittance.    A final word about the al-Sabah: they will be judged at a  time when regret will be of no avail. And when that time  comes--and it will come, God willing--they will regret the day  they were born.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> 1989 HIGHLIGHTS: HALIBUT, SEA BASS, SAND BASS ABUNDANT IN LOCAL WATERS  </P> <P> Reflecting on last year's sportfishing season for South Bay anglers:  </P> <P> The spring run of halibut in Santa Monica Bay was good.  </P> <P> White sea bass at the Deep Hole provided tackle-busting action.  </P> <P> The reliable migratory sand bass returned to sandy beaches and limits on day  and sundown trips were reported.  </P> <P> Barracuda roamed a wide area and anglers had to be at the right spot at the  right time. One day it was a wide-open bite at Rocky Point, the next it was  Catalina Island action only.  </P> <P> After a slow summer start, exotics made a strong showing in late July. Albacore  were located 100 miles from Point Loma, averaging six to 10 pounds. South Bay  boats chased the long fins on three-day trips.  </P> <P> This changed in early August as bluefin and yellowfin tuna moved to within a  one- or two-day trip for South Bay sportfishers.  </P> <P> The Shogun from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned Aug. 19 with 581 tuna up to  100 pounds, a possible record catch for a South Bay sportfisher.  </P> <P> At Avalon, 1989 was the best year ever for marlin. Those weighed in shattered  all previous records.  </P> <P> The fishing outlook for this year is optimistic. The water is warmer and has  sparked game-fish action.  </P> <P> Bonito and yellowtail have been interested in baited hooks at Rocky Point and  San Clemente Island.  </P> <P> An armada of shark fishermen in small boats has been covering an area from  Santa Monica Beach to Malibu seeking great whites.  </P> <P> It started with West Los Angeles shark fisherman Bill Barlow landing a  170-pound white shark two weeks ago. Three have been caught since.  </P></p>

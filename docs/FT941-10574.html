			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Debate launched on radio FM slots The Radio Authority yesterday launched a debate about what to do with new FM frequencies which will be available from 1996 - the last likely to come to commercial radio for the foreseeable future. Possibilities for the 105 MHz to 108 MHz frequencies include a fourth national commercial radio service and a new local service for all areas that already have a local commercial station. The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, suggested yesterday that the industry's rate of growth was also an important factor to be considered. The authority set out four options, most mutually exclusive, for discussion: A fourth national network that could reach more than 90 per cent of the population. Services similar in size and number to the present Independent Local Radio network, including the possibility of stations switching from AM to FM frequencies. A new network lattice of stations classified by size, for example reaching a radius of up to 10km (6 1/4 miles), 15km or 40km. A combination of the services in the second and third options but concentrated in populated areas.</p>

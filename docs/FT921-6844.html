			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Perilous niches THE HUMBLING of Rolls-Royce, the luxury motor-car maker, should be a salutary warning to British manufacturers who wish to nestle in cosy, upmarket niches. After selling through thick and thin to very rich consumers, largely sheltered from recessions, the Rolls-Royce has become a cyclical product. The lesson for Rolls-Royce, part of the Vickers engineering group, is that even if a product is steeped in history, its manufacturing needs to be grounded in today. With Mercedes-Benz pouring huge resources into the development of increasingly sophisticated cars, in the face of a mounting challenge from Japanese producers, the luxury car market is becoming increasingly competitive. Rolls-Royce is implementing changes to working practices, but too late. Vickers is also looking for an international partner to help launch a new model range. This is the path trodden by other UK luxury carmakers, such as Aston Martin and Jaguar, now owned by Ford, and Lotus, owned by General Motors. Rolls-Royce may survive without a partner, but as a maker of instant antiques, rather like the Morgan sports car company. It will become part of the heritage industry. If manufacturers occupy small, upmarket niches, the technological ground is likely to slip from beneath their feet. Hotels and restaurants, shops and theme parks may trade on heritage and a reputation for old-fashioned service. But manufacturers need more than the smell of leather and a glint of burled walnut to retain a reputation for luxury. They need to master modern manufacturing technologies as well.</p>

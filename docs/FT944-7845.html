Mr Portillo said that too many people in Brussels sought to protect those already in work rather than tackling unemployment. He called for a deregulatory 'jobs agenda for Europe'. Echoing his Eurosceptic speech at last month's Conservative party conference, he said: 'I cannot accept that a Europe which excludes 20m people from sharing in its prosperity is a Europe which is working.'</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAST 'EM FROM THE SKIES?  </P> <P> Earlier this month Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sponsored a last-minute  amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill. The McConnell amendment  would authorize the shooting down of civil aircraft if a flying agent -- of the  Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration or Customs Service -- concludes  that the pilots do not intend to follow directions to land immediately. The  amendment further would indemnify these agents from any responsibility for  their actions.  </P> <P> Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) proposed a vote to kill that amendment. He found  strong support from Sens. Sam Nunn, (D-Ga.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio), but the  motion was defeated in a 45-55 roll-call vote.  </P> <P> Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner previously expressed his  opposition and deep concern about this issue to William J. Bennett, director of  the office of National Drug Control Policy. Still, the defense authorization  bill with its McConnell amendment was passed in the Senate and will become law  unless changed in conference between the House and Senate.  </P> <P> Great Jumping Jehosaphat! What is this country coming to that it would permit a  drug agent of the Coast Guard, DEA or Customs Service, however well  intentioned, to declare virtual war on any civil airplane that flies openly  through our skies?  </P> <P> Interpretation of intentions can be very inexact. Yet this provision would  leave to the judgment of one enforcement person in the air whether or not to  kill people -- perhaps a whole family returning from a business or pleasure  trip abroad.  </P> <P> There is no way short of accurate intelligence to know what an airplane carries  or who is on board. Fortunately, we do have some good intelligence. We need to  get better. There are aviation regulations already in force that govern  airplanes flying to or from the United States, including one requiring a pilot  to land immediately when so directed.  </P> <P> We do have a war on drugs and it must be won. We do not have a state of war  that sacrifices our civil air commerce. The Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean is  not the Persian Gulf, where many lives have been lost because of  misidentification. Do we, as a nation, wish to create that aura in our skies?  Who would be responsible if an airplane shot down by a DEA agent crashed into a  house or a hotel? If McConnell's amendment is enacted, such a disaster is  likely to happen sooner or later. More than 137,000 general-aviation business  or pleasure flights were made into the United States last year.  </P> <P> I have fought in three wars for our nation and know full well how honest  mistakes can be made in the air, even by those trained to fly in a combat  environment. We have the best aviation system in the world. Let us not permit a  few zealots to destroy the majority's right to free passage in the air. Let us  find a way to arrest those who defy the law, not hazard all who fly.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valentina Nikiforova "Parliamentary Diary": "Passions </F> Aroused Over Budget"]    [Text] Yesterday the State Duma discussed the most dramatic  document -- the draft law "On the Federal Budget." The report  delivered by acting finance minister S. Dubinin notes that  revenue is around 120 trillion rubles [R] whereas expenditure is  R180 trillion. Well, the deficit is not all that alarming.  Especially since the speaker gave an assurance that social  needs have been protected. True, a comparison of the figures  (48.5 trillion for defense and the law enforcement organs, 12.3  trillion for social needs) does not bear that out. The  deciphering of the budget, item by item, alarmed the deputies.  Deputy Bikalova characterized it thus:    "The whole social sphere is under threat. You ask, where can  expenditure be cut? I say, in the sphere of administration!"    "It is impossible not to adopt the budget but it will be  even  worse if we adopt it in this form," Deputy Gordeyev from the  Russian Federation Communist Party said. "If we do adopt it  then in September-October we will be facing the problem of  nonpayments. Production will stop once and for all. On 12  December the people said that there must be an end to the  euphoria of the pseudomarket reforms. The optimism over the  small deficit is unfounded. Tax receipts are falling,  everything has been given to the private sector but it is  uncontrollable. The government should not talk about objective  difficulties but propose a set of measures making it possible to  increase the revenue section of the budget. And expenditure  must be taken under tight state control."    Is that not too simple? But in that simplicity is the nub of  the problem. For example, supposing that you try to check why  it is that even those small amounts of money allocated to the  agro-industrial complex have still not reached people in the  countryside? Perhaps the power structures should try to find  out which banks this money is languishing in, enabling devious  officials to get rich? Or perhaps ministers do not mind the  fact that they are greeted by a new picket every morning, as if  to schedule? But what will happen if one day, for example, all  of Russia suddenly unites behind the single demand: "If you  cannot govern, get out"?    The draft budget was adopted as a basis at the third  attempt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Message to Saddam: Talk With </F> Kurds"]    [Excerpts] The talks that have been held with the Iraqi  delegation in Ankara did not focus only on the question of the  oil in the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq. The question of  northern Iraq was also discussed, as we mentioned that it would  in our column last week. The Turkish side brought up the  matter. The Turkish delegation headed by Ozdem Sanberk, under  secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, outlined Turkey's  position on the matter and said that "tension continues to exist  in northern Iraq."  <H5>  Let Them Come To Hold Talks </H5>   "We support Iraq's territorial integrity. We want the  situation in northern Iraq to be resolved within that framework.  However, you should first disclose that Iraq will comply with  the UN resolutions."    That was Turkey's general approach. The Turkish delegation  also conveyed a direct message to Baghdad, which Ankara has  wished to do for a long time: "Hold talks with the Kurdish  leaders in northern Iraq and resolve that problem among  yourselves."    Apparently, the Iraqi delegation was prepared for that  message. The Iraqi officials said: "You have always said that  you support Iraq's territorial integrity. However, you have  allowed the Hammer Force, which is opposed to Iraq's territorial  integrity, to remain in your country."    That brought Turkey's problem into the light. However,  Turkey's initiative was based on its conviction that the Hammer  Force will not remain in the region indefinitely.    Regarding Turkey's message to Baghdad that it should hold  talks with the Kurds in northern Iraq, the Iraqi officials  failed to respond by saying that they "agree to hold talks" with  them. They merely said "we can hold talks with them if they  wish to do so."    Obviously, Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud  Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani  will not be satisfied with that reply. It can be easily assumed  that Barzani and Talabani, who are pressed by the United States  "not to hold talks with Baghdad," will be dissatisfied with the  Iraqi official's unwilling compliance and refuse to hold talks  with them.  <H5>  BOTAS Cannot Resolve the Problem by Itself </H5>   A certain amount of progress was made on the question of the  withdrawal of the oil in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The  matter was also discussed with BOTAS [Pipelines and Petroleum  Transport Corporation] officials yesterday. However, the  problem cannot be resolved through the talks that will be held  between Turkey and Iraq. The letter U.S. Assistant Secretary of  State Oxman wrote before he left Ankara in December 1993  explained the matter in detail. Turkey can withdraw the oil  that belongs to it. However, each and every step after that  will be subject to UN approval. In short, Turkey has to discuss  the matter with the UN officials and Washington, regardless of  the two-day talks the Turkish officials held with the Iraqi  delegation in Ankara. Apparently, the matter has a political  aspect that goes beyond the BOTAS officials' authority.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Fayda Talks Have Been Cut </H5>   It seems that Ankara's anxiety on matters related to  northern  Iraq is gradually increasing. However, the Foreign Ministry  circles have not admitted that state of affairs. Interesting  developments are taking place in that region. Undesirable  incidents may take place at any time. For example: The  Turkish, U.S., British, French, and Iraqi officers met to  exchange views and information after the Gulf War once a week.  The meetings were held in an Iraqi military garrison in Fayda,  a district center that is 30 km from Turkey's border. They  maintained their talks even in the tense atmosphere after the  war. The weekly meetings have been cut since the clashes in  1993 because the Iraqi officers failed to attend them.    The meaning of that state of affairs is obvious. The  mechanism for mutual agreement and exchange of information to  obstruct serious clashes in the region does not exist anymore.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Turkey's Guarantee </H5>   To what extent can the Kurds in northern Iraq trust Saddam  Husayn even if they conclude an agreement with Baghdad? They  reached several agreements in the past but they were all  violated. Considering the psychological situation in the region,  the question of a "guarantor country" will definitely be placed  on the agenda after a possible agreement on northern Iraq. An  effective mechanism will be required in the region when the  Hammer Force withdraws from Turkey. Obviously, Turkey will have  to decide the policy it will adopt. Either a mechanism similar  to the Hammer Force will have to be established or Turkey will  have to act as an effective guarantor country in the region.  Does that matter not concern NATO, which has very little to do  at the present time?</p>

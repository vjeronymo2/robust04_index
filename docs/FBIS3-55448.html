According to Estonian radio,  the government still lacks four key ministers. President  Lennart Meri today appointed Juri Luik as the new foreign  minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. However,  these two people refuse to take up their posts unless the  president also ratifies the other changes of ministers proposed  by Prime Minister Mart Laar. President Meri is not, however,  willing to dismiss the current economics minister and will not  ratify the prime minister's candidate for a new finance minister  either. Prime Minister Laar is prepared to take the dispute as  far as the constitutional court.</p>

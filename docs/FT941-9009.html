			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Top Israeli bankers may be jailed for five years Several of Israel's former top bankers face jail sentences of up to five years after being convicted yesterday of criminal responsibility for a stock market crash a decade ago that cost the government an estimated Dollars 7bn and severely undermined Israel's banking system. At the end of a four-year trial, Jerusalem District Court Judge Miriam Naor ruled that four leading banks, a holding company, and six leading bankers had violated a 1977 law against selling shares under false pretences. Two of the banks, and several executives, were also convicted of securities fraud. Two executives, and a third who has since died, were acquitted. Hearings on sentencing are scheduled to start next week, with sentences likely in about a month. The four banks involved were Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Discount and Bank Mizrahi. Former chairman of Bank Leumi, Ernst Japhet, who fled to the US in 1987 and returned last month following an extradition request, will be tried separately. The 1983 crash was caused by the country's leading banks manipulating their own share prices - by buying each other's shares and vigorously encouraging their customers to purchase too. Bank shares became overvalued and when, on October 6 1983, shareholders began selling en masse, the bubble burst. The government was forced to step in, guaranteeing to redeem shares at their pre-fall value to the tune of Dollars 7bn.</p>

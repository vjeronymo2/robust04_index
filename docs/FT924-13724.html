			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: A complete package for the holiday industry  -The growing consolidation of tour operators and travel agents THE SPECULATION that tour operator Owners Abroad is about to be taken over and the search for a rescuer of the Dan-Air airline appear to bear out the fervent hope of the large UK travel companies that consolidation of the fragmented British holiday industry is under way. After a summer which saw some fierce price-cutting, Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the biggest UK tour operator, said he would be happy to see the back of some of his smaller rivals. 'There are certainly one or two companies that won't survive and the travel business will be well rid of them,' he said. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) says 54 of its members have collapsed this year. The largest survivors are buying, or thinking of buying, ever bigger parts of the business, attempting to establish a presence in all sectors of the market: arranging holidays, selling them, and flying the customers to their destinations. The recent history of the UK travel business suggests, however, that having a stake in each sector is no panacea. And the industry is no respecter of size. Last year saw the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group (ILG), then the second biggest operator. ILG's attempt to build up a scheduled airline business brought down its aggressive package tour operation. The rumoured bidders for Owners Abroad, currently the second biggest UK tour operator, include Airtours, the third biggest operator, and LTU, a large German travel group. Airtours last month bought Pickfords Travel, the third largest UK travel agency. LTU earlier this year bought Thomas Cook, the UK's second largest travel agency chain. LTU has also been mentioned as a possible buyer of Dan-Air. Both LTU and Airtours believe it is important to own companies in all sectors of the holiday industry. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said owning Pickfords would enable his group to sell its holidays more effectively. Mr Wolfgang Osinski of LTU, while refusing to comment on the group's intentions towards Owners Abroad or Dan-Air, said: 'Offering the complete product at every stage of the holiday, from the booking to the airline to the hotel, means you can ensure quality all along the line.' All three market leaders - Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours - have their own charter airlines. Thomson has owned Lunn Poly, the largest UK travel agency chain, for 20 years. Thomson and Lunn Poly insist that they operate at arms length - a claim generally accepted by rival travel companies. By contrast, Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, made no attempt to hide the benefits he expects to get from owning Pickfords. Mr Crossland said that if each of Pickfords' 333 branches took an additional Airtours booking every week, it would add Pounds 2m to the enlarged group's pre-tax profits. He said that although the average Pickfords branch had 150 display rack spaces, Airtours brochures occupied only four of them. He made it clear that the number of Airtours brochures at Pickfords branches would increase. Others were less convinced by Mr Crossland's reasoning, and worried about the consequences of yet another travel agency being owned by a tour operator. Travel agents are expected to offer a wide range of holidays from various operators. Rival tour operators were worried that Pickfords would promote Airtours' holidays in preference to theirs. Travel agency chains, for their part, warned that if Airtours favoured Pickfords unduly it could throw into doubt Airtours' long-term contracts with other agents. Mr Crossland said he did not think rival tour operators would refuse to sell their holidays through Pickfords because of its Airtours link, simply because they would not want to abandon a retail outlet with 333 branches. Thomson holidays accounted for 20.6 per cent of Pickfords summer business this year, with Owners Abroad taking 13.9 per cent and Airtours 12.4 per cent. As for the other travel agents, they had already demonstrated that, far from being reluctant to sell Airtours' holidays, they wanted to be sure they could continue to do so. He added that the combined buying power of Airtours and Pickfords would also enable them to reduce advertising and marketing costs. Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, said he would carefully observe the development of Airtours' relationship with Pickfords before deciding whether its own contracts with the operator could continue. 'I can't see a change in our relationship (with Airtours) overnight. But our agreement with them binds both sides. If the other side provides less than full support to us, the agreement will be broken.' An additional concern was how consumers' might react. Mr Rothwell said: 'If I was a customer and I knew I was going to be pushed into buying a particular product, I would object. A travel agent is respected for impartiality. That's why people go to travel agents rather than to tour operators direct.' Ms Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? magazine, pointed out that some tour operators already offered travel agents inducements like free flights and cut-price holidays. 'Obviously, to have another arrangement, like ownership, is a worry.' Mr George Marcall, Airtours sales director, insisted the traveller had nothing to worry about. 'The consumer is king. Whatever the consumer wishes to buy, we will provide it.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------                    TRAVEL AGENTS' OWNERSHIP  --------------------------------------------------------------- Agency chain              Owner                   Branches  --------------------------------------------------------------- Lunn Poly                 Thomson (UK)                 511 Thomas Cook               LTU (Germany)                330 Pickfords Travel          Airtours (UK)                333 AT Mays                   Carlson (US)                 310 Hogg Robinson             Independent                  212 Co-op Travel              Independent                  130 Others                                               5,124  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ABTA/Mintel; Pickfords Travel Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Romanian polls postponed as parliament rejects electoral law ROMANIA is unlikely to hold general elections until October following parliament's rejection of electoral legislation late on Monday night, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Despite a compromise reached in the House of Deputies, the lower chamber, last week, which set an election date of July 26, a combined session of the House and the Senate overturned the decision by 240 to 182 votes. The decision comes as a blow to the coalition government, led since October by Mr Theodor Stolojan, which has pressed parliament to adopt the legislation since March.</p>

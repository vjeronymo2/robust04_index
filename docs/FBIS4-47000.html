Yusin: "Moscow and Tallinn Seek Measures To </F> Influence Each Other"]    [Text] Russia probably has not had such strained  relations developing with any other republic of the former USSR  as with Estonia. The brief visit by Andrey Kozyrev to Tallinn  confirmed that there is still very far to go to a true  partnership and good neighborliness.    "Kozyrev = Goebbels"--this sign in the hands of an Estonian  girl greeted the Russian minister in Tallinn. Kozyrev, however,  did not leave that unanswered. "We shall not withdraw troops  from Estonia until questions connected with military pensioners  are settled," he declared at Vnukovo Airport a few minutes  before departing for the Estonian capital. While the next day,  appearing before Russian- speaking residents of Tallinn, the  head of Russian diplomacy was even more frank: "We shall apply  every measure of economic, political, and sociological pressure  so that Estonian authorities will observe the rights of national  minorities."    Russian-Estonian relations are clouded by three main  problems. First of all by the presence of Russian troops, the  withdrawal of which Tallinn has been demanding without success  for some three years. Today Estonia remains the only Baltic  country that has not settled that issue with Russia. In  Lithuania, as commonly known, there are no more Russian  soldiers, while they will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August  1994, in accordance with the recently signed agreements. Russian  military presence in Estonia is not all that significant--there  are around 2,000 soldiers and officers in the republic. It would  seem there should be no serious difficulties with their  withdrawal, all the more since as long ago as last year Russia  promised to complete the evacuation of troops by the fall of  1994.    The situation, however, underwent a change. The flare-up of  nationalist moods in Russia could not help but be reflected in  the attitude toward Baltic countries. Among the Russian  political elite it became fashionable to prove one's patriotism  with hard-line declarations directed at Latvia and Estonia. The  authorities of these two republics in turn promoted the  aggravation of relations with the Kremlin by passing a series of  laws which Moscow viewed as discriminatory toward the  Russian-speaking population. The result was quick in  coming--Russia withdrew its promise to move out the troops by 31  August.    That step certainly did not improve our reputation in the  world. Western leaders did not conceal their negative attitude  toward preservation of the military presence of Moscow on the  territory of sovereign states contrary to the will of their  governments. Judging by everything, Russian authorities  themselves felt uncomfortable: having "intimidated" Latvia and  Estonia, they simultaneously initiated negotiations with them,  letting it be understood that in exchange for certain  concessions they were prepared to withdraw their forces by the  deadline.    With Latvia that tactic worked, but the Estonians displayed  much more stubbornness, and primarily, with regard to the  question concerning the status of military pensioners. Moscow  demands that these people (of whom there are 10,500 in the  republic, and with family members--over 40,000) be given  residence permits. Tallinn refuses to do that, considering that  the retired military constitute a threat to state security.    The Kremlin took a rigid position--if the Estonians do not  comply with Russian demands, the troops will not be withdrawn by  31 August. At the same they understand both in Moscow and in  Tallinn that this is no more than a delay, sooner or later the  troops will leave anyway. Otherwise it will be difficult to  understand the behavior of Russia other than as an  occupier--with all of the resulting consequences to relations  between Moscow and the West. It is hardly likely that President  Yeltsin will go for that. It is more likely that those measures  of political and economic pressure, which were mentioned by  Kozyrev, will be applied against Tallinn. It is not precluded  that with time Moscow will decide to introduce sanctions, even  though at the present time members of the Russian delegation  insisted that this question is not being considered.    As far as political pressure is concerned, there is no  denying that the Russian minister of foreign affairs is  persistent. Over the past several months there has not been a  single European forum at which he did not raise the issue of  discrimination against Russians in Estonia. The Tallinn Baltic  countries foreign ministers' conference was no exception.  Initially Kozyrev had no plans to travel to the Estonian  capital. The doubts disappeared after Moscow received assurances  that the Baltic Council will establish the post of a special  commissioner for human rights, following the example of the  CSCE. Kozyrev decided to abandon his boycott of the conference  and express his attitude toward the policy of Estonian  authorities in another way. The conference had barely opened  when the Russian minister delivered a surprise, making public a  letter recently received by the Russian Embassy. The war  veterans complained about Estonian bureaucracy requiring  countless certificates in order to obtain a residence permit,  including results of tests for AIDS and syphilis (which Kozyrev  emphasized in particular).    A third painful problem in Russian-Estonian  relations--territorial claims of Tallinn against Moscow, also  surfaced in the course of the visit. Estonians are demanding the  return of lands seized by Stalin shortly after Soviet  occupation. Russia refuses even to discuss that matter. Estonian  claims produce ill concealed irritation in Moscow, and in most  of the European capitals--skeptical smiles.    At the final press conference a squabble developed between  Kozyrev and his Estonian colleague Juri Luik. Luik stated that  he will be raising the territorial issue at the Paris conference  on stability in Europe, where both ministers were to fly  directly after the Baltic conference. Kozyrev promised that in  France that issue will not even be studied. "As you see, I have  kept my word," the Russian minister declared with satisfaction,  two days after the Paris forum ended. "Not a word was said about  the territorial claims of Estonia."    Russian diplomats pin their main hope for overcoming the  crisis in bilateral relations on Estonian President Lennart  Meri. Recently he has spoken from very moderate positions,  thereby invoking the anger of supporters of a rigid policy.  Negotiations between Kozyrev and Meri continued for two hours  instead of the scheduled 30 minutes. It was decided to renew  negotiations discontinued in April in the immediate future. On  Smolensk Square they are hoping that Tallinn will still agree to  a compromise on the issue of pensioners. An impression is  forming that Meri is gravitating toward the same decision,  however, he will find it difficult to overcome the opposition of  Luik and that of Prime Minister Mart Laar who hold a more  radical view.    "Let us look truth in the eye. The world does not understand  our concern about the military pensioners. We must realize that,  no matter what, we will not be able to get rid of most of the  Russian retired officers," Toivo Klaar, director of the  Political Department of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, declared. His article was published on the day of  Kozyrev's arrival. According to Klaar, Estonia has no intention  of deporting "70-year-old war veterans." Questions arise in  connection with the 35-40-year old KGB and GRU officers who  retired following the August putsch. In the view of Estonian  authorities, it is specifically these people who pose the  principal threat to the security of the nation. Up to now,  however, Russia is not agreeing to the separation of pensioners  into those who are seventy and those who are younger. It is  possible to assume that at the forthcoming negotiations this  issue will become a stumbling block and Moscow, despite  everything, will have to take into account the concern of  Estonians and manifest some flexibility.</p>

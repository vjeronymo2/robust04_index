This is being done to safeguard the economic reform in the  country and defend lawful rights of the foreign investors, Ren  said when calling on Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew  this afternoon.    Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia  on Wednesday [12 January] for an official visit from 11 to 15  January at the invitation of Singapore's Chief Justice Yang Pung  How.    He told Lee that China and Singapore agreed to sign a  judicial agreement in a proper time to better protect the lawful  interests and rights of Singapore investors in China and to  ensure a smooth development of the economic cooperation between  the two countries, especially the planned Singapore-Suzhou  industrial township which is a government-support project.    Lee said it was only after 35 years of consistent and great  efforts that Singapore established its current legal system, and  it is just understandable that China, with its vast land and  large population, would need several decades to achieve it.    Ren expressed his appreciation to Lee's view and said that  China is determined to reinforce its legal system with the  efforts of not only this generation but also the following one.</p>

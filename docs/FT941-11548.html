			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Egypt expects to double cotton exports Egypt's state-owned Cotton Holding Company is expecting exports to double this year - following price cuts and some liberalisation moves in the sector designed to reverse years of falling sales. Export commitments have already reached 80,600 bales for 1994, compared with total shipments of 54,500 bales last year, according to Mr Samir Anis, the holding company's commercial director. He said Egypt expected to win export commitments for more than 100,000 bales by August, the end of the country's cotton marketing year and start of its harvest. Mr Anis said export commitments had risen across the board in Egypt's 20 or so main export markets following the government's decision last autumn to cut export prices sharply. Prices of extra-long stable grades of cotton were cut by 15-20 per cent in September in a bid to recapture market share in the face of years of strong competition, particularly from US brands. Cotton is among Egypt's most important agricultural exports but the days when the country was able to dominate world prices for some grades are long past. Output, yields and exports have fallen considerably since the early 1970s, largely as a result of low official procurement prices paid to farmers. Total export revenues from cotton fell to Dollars 43m in 1992-93 from Dollars 52m in 1991-92, according to US embassy figures. Cotton is Egypt's sixth biggest foreign exchange earner, after remittances, tourism, oil, Suez Canal receipts and rice sales. But exports, which stood at 685,000 bales in the 1981-82 season had dwindled to a low of 48,000 bales by 1990-91 - a disastrous plunge, which the government has in the past two years sought to reverse. A raft of liberalising measures is planned to arrest the decline, and some have been implemented. Improved pesticide use and other agronomic improvements helped to improve yields by more than a third in 1992 despite a continued fall in the total acreage under cotton across Egypt; and the cotton production area in 1993 was 40 per cent of the total under cultivation in 1961. Total cotton output this year is expected to reach a level similar to last season's, about 1.08m bales. Further liberalising moves are planned. The country's parliament is considering a draft law to free prices, increase competition from the private sector in what remains a strongly government-controlled sector and to re-establish Alexandria's cotton exchange.</p>

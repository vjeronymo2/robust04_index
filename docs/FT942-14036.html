			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Nato faces air strike dilemma in Bosnia: Political and moral pressure is mounting for western forces to bomb Serbs for defying UN As Nato diplomats prepare to meet in Brussels to consider the latest proposals from military experts and President Bill Clinton on air strikes in Bosnia, they face a minefield of national and institutional sensitivities. These sensitivities have to be balanced against revulsion over the Serb attack on Gorazde and political pressure for concrete military action. Among European countries such as Britain and France, who have contributed ground forces to the UN effort in Bosnia, there is lingering nervousness about Washington's intentions. Any suggestion of a broad air attack on the Serbs, which dropped all pretence of neutrality in the conflict, will be viewed with deep alarm by Washington's European allies. Greece and Canada have always had considerable reservations about air strikes and these are to some extent shared by Germany, which is conscious of the danger of alienating Russia. However, there was relief among European governments on Wednesday night when President Clinton's televised statement on Bosnia focused heavily on existing mandates, notably the UN security council's resolution 836. That resolution, approved last June, cleared the way for the use of force, including air power, to protect six 'safe areas' of Bosnia: Sarajevo, Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac. Technically, the air strikes carried out near Gorazde 10 days ago were intended to protect UN personnel, as opposed to shoring up the safe haven. Neither purpose was achieved. Mr Clinton says he wants to extend to the other five areas the 'Sarajevo approach' - a combination of threats and diplomacy that was used in February to bring a truce to the Bosnian capital. In Srebrenica, and more recently Gorazde, the Serbs have established such a tight stranglehold that the term 'safe haven' has become meaningless. Establishing those places as fully-fledged havens would mean extracting a huge concession from the Serbs, whose will to fight and anti-aircraft capacity has been underestimated by the west. However, the main western governments seem to agree that the political and moral pressure for an escalation of air strikes is now unstoppable, and they  -as well Nato's secretariat - are determined that in military terms, any operations should be carried out professionally. In practice, this means giving Nato some flexibility in deciding which weaponry constitutes a threat to the safe areas and therefore in selecting targets. 'The UN will have to determine the overall mandate, but we in Nato will determine how we will do it militarily,' commented one official in Brussels. Nato has not always acted as a mere executor of UN instructions, as diplomats point out. In February, the 10-day deadline for the removal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo was determined by the alliance, not the UN. There is resistance in Brussels to the idea of taking detailed instructions from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, or other 'bureaucrats' in New York. However, Britain and France will both insist on close co-ordination with UN military commanders on the ground. One Nato diplomat said: 'There needs to be unity of command and control between the UN ground forces and Nato. 'The procedure must be better than in the past. That does not mean we want to control the whole thing. 'But there must be more flexibility as far as our objectives are concerned, and they must not be limited to what Mr Boutros Ghali is asking us to do.' Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said yesterday that more air strikes made little sense unless they were part of a political plan. 'However determined we are to use air power there is no lasting solution unless it is political,' Mr Juppe said. 'An air strike only makes sense if its is carried out as part of a political plan, as in Sarajevo. We must pursue the diplomatic route and accelerate it.' Other members of the French government are thought to harbour even greater reservations than Mr Juppe about the use of air power, and there is an instinctive suspicion in Paris at the idea of handing too much power to Nato's military structure. France is also stressing the need to keep US, European and Russian policy in as close harmony as possible.</p>

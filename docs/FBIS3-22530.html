The dreaded mosquito that plays hostess to the  malaria parasite has left behind a toll of over 20,000 cases in  Bombay this year.    But city doctors are particularly alarmed about the growing  incidence of falciparum, commonly known as cerebral malaria,  which can be fatal if not detected early enough. While the  Bombay municipal corporation (BMC) claims that there have been  2,400 cases and 14 deaths, doctors point out that many more  deaths remain unreported.    "Ten years ago malaria hardly ever necessitated a hospital  admission," says Dr. Zarir Udwadia, who is affiliated to the  Hinduja and Parsi General Hospitals. "Today I get one to two  cases of falciparum in a week."    Over the last few years, two things have happened. First,  the  mosquito of this particular strain has grown resistant to  insecticides like DDT. Second, the parasite has developed an  immunity to chloroquine, which is the most widely-prescribed and  cheapest drug used to cure malaria.    [Passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent viktor demidenko, mikhail </F> melnik]    [Text] Kiev 23 June TASS -- In the run up to presidential  elections in Ukraine, Ukrainian democrats decided to close their  ranks in order to back presidential candidate Leonid Kravchuk.  Chairman of the "Ukraine" democratic association, Dmitriy  Pavlychko, said that the "Ukraine" wants Leonid Kravchuk to  remain in the post of the Ukrainian president.    Public opinion polls show that Kravchuk enjoys the support  of  62 per cent of Ukrainian women, 42 per cent of rural residents  and 90 per cent of the population of Ukraine's western regions.  However, Kravchuk's rating in the east and the south is not so  high. However, experts reminded of the fact that during the  first presidential elections Kravchuk had won with only a 10 per  cent rating in his favour reported in the Galichina region.    Observers noted that Kravchuk's popularity has been growing  in recent weeks. Primarily, this can be accounted for by his  decision on the indexation of the population's deposits in  saving banks, the allocation of 40 million karbovanets for the  organisation of summer vacation of children from low-income  families, taking currency back to Ukraine, signing an agreement  on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and EC.    Representatives of the old generation welcomed the election  of Vitaliy Masol to the post of the premier, whose candidacy had  been suggested by the president. Political experts believe that  Kravchuk is such a clever politician that he would manage to win  over to his side 18 per cent of electors ho had not decided yet  for whom they would vote in the elections.</p>

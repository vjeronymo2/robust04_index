The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gleason Works (37 acres/721,371 sq.ft.) is located at 1000 University Avenue, in central Rochester (Monroe County), New York. The facility (777 employees) is used to produce spiral bevel and parallel axis gear manufacturing equipment, including gear generators, hobbers, grinders, sharpeners, testers, and gear lapping equipment (duty rate range: 4.4_5.8%). Components purchased from abroad (some 12% of total) include ball screws (HTS <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8483.40.8000, duty rate_5.7%) and process controllers (HTS <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8537.10.0030, 5.3%). The finished machinery is used in the automotive, aerospace, truck and heavy equipment industries. Some 50 percent of the equipment is exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt Gleason from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production. On its domestic sales, Gleason would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished gear production equipment for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve Gleason's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is on June 13, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to June 27, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Commerce Branch Office, 111 East Avenue, suite 220, Rochester, New York 14604,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John J.

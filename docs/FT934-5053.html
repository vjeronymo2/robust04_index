			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: GDP growth forecast lifted to 1 3/4% for 1993; inflation to rise and fall again This section explains in detail recent developments in the economy and its short-term prospects. G7 growth slowed in the first half of 1993 and is forecast to be only 1 per cent in the year as a whole. Faster, but still modest, growth is projected for 1994. Inflation in the major countries is forecast to continue falling. In the UK, growth has been stronger than expected at the time of the March Budget and is now forecast at 1 3/4 per cent in 1993. The 1994 forecast is a rise in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent, slightly below the average of the forecasts from the Panel of Independent Forecasters. Underlying RPI inflation has been lower than forecast in the March Budget. It is likely to rise in the first half of 1994 because of the short-run impact of tax changes. But it is forecast to remain within the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range and to fall back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end of the year. The average forecast from the Independent Panel is marginally lower. Unemployment has fallen 137,000 since the beginning of the year and is now below 2.9m, a much better outcome than generally expected. The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2 bn, with the invisible surplus stronger than in recent years. Despite a fallback in the invisible surplus and stronger growth in the UK than in continental Europe, our main export market, the current account deficit is expected to increase only slightly in 1993. It is forecast to be Pounds 9 1/2 bn in both 1993 and 1994. The sterling index has been fairly steady this year. Long-term interest rates have fallen significantly reflecting lower inflation expectations. The PSBR in the current financial year is expected to be very close to the Pounds 50bn forecast in March. As a result of Budget measures and economic recovery it is forecast to fall to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95. The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that sterling remains close to recent levels. Oil prices are assumed to average Dollars 17 a barrel. World economy The pick-up in world economic growth most forecasters were predicting at the time of the March Budget has been slow to materialise. Growth in the US in the first half of the year was less than forecast, though it seems to have recovered strongly in the second half. Japanese GDP and industrial production fell again in the second quarter. And although activity in continental Europe may have stabilised there are few clear signs of recovery; confidence remains low in most European countries. For the major seven countries (G7) as a whole, industrial production stopped falling towards the end of 1992, but there has been little recovery yet; weakness in Japan and continental Europe has largely offset rises in the US. GDP growth in the G7 between the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993 slowed to under 1 per cent at an annual rate, compared with growth of 1 3/4 per cent in 1992. Against this background, policy has remained expansionary in the US, and there has been a steady easing in continental Europe and Japan. US short-term interest rates have been around 3 per cent for over a year, consistent with a real interest rate close to zero. In Japan the official discount rate has been cut to a record low of 1 3/4 per cent, and the government has introduced a further stimulatory fiscal package - the third in just over a year. In continental Europe, however, despite cuts in nominal rates, real interest rates remain higher than usual at a cyclical trough. Fiscal deficits in Europe have risen sharply, partly because of the recession. Weak activity in the major countries has kept non-oil commodity prices close to their lowest level in real terms since the early 1970s. The Brent oil price has fallen since the spring, dropping below Dollars 15 a barrel towards the end of November, compared with over Dollars 18 in the first half of the year. It has averaged just under Dollars 16 1/2 a barrel in the last three months and is assumed to average Dollars 17 a barrel during the forecast period. Low commodity prices have contributed to a continued easing of inflationary pressure in the major countries. Since the beginning of the year consumer price inflation has fallen  3/4 per cent in Germany and  1/2 per cent in the US, and has been steady at historically low levels in France and Italy. In Japan, inflation fell below 1 per cent in the early summer before rising again as poor weather temporarily boosted food prices. Weak inflationary pressures and falling inflation expectations have contributed to a rally in world bond markets, taking long-term interest rates down to their lowest levels since the late 1960s. GDP growth in the G7 is forecast to be 1 per cent in 1993. This is  1/2 percentage point below the March Budget forecast, reflecting weaker than expected activity in the first half of the year and only patchy signs of recovery in the second half. Growth is forecast to rise to 2 per cent in 1994, but with recovery still some way off in Japan and continental Europe, marked differences between the growth rates of individual countries are likely to persist. In the US, growth of around 2 3/4 per cent is forecast for 1993 and 1994, close to the rate in 1992. This continues the pattern of fairly modest recovery since the trough in early 1991. Following substantial upward revisions to past GDP data, the recent US recession looks to have been one of the shallowest since the war, implying less scope for the very rapid growth rates recorded in previous recoveries. In Japan, GDP is now forecast to fall by  1/4 per cent in 1993. This would be the first annual fall since 1974. Although last year's fiscal package is beginning to provide a boost to public sector demand, private demand has been much weaker than expected. With the high yen now likely to restrain export volumes, growth is forecast to be only 1 per cent in 1994. GDP in western Germany may be levelling out, at around 2 1/2 per cent below its early 1992 peak. But prospective tax increases and the deterioration in competitiveness over the past two years are expected to hold back recovery next year. Although output in the east continues to rise, growth in Germany as a whole is forecast to be only  3/4 per cent in 1994, following a fall in output of 1 1/2 per cent this year. GDP in the European Community is forecast to fall by  1/2 per cent in 1993, and recover by only 1 1/4 per cent in 1994, similar to the recent Commission forecast. EC unemployment has risen from 8 1/2 per cent in 1990 to 10 3/4 . Growth in 1994 is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent further increases in unemployment over the next year. Low commodity prices and spare capacity in G7 countries should continue to exert downward pressure on inflation. Consumer price inflation in the G7 is forecast to fall from its current level of 2 3/4 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 1/4 per cent by mid-1995. The largest fall is likely to be in Germany where inflation - currently second highest in the G7 - is forecast to be below 2 1/2 per cent by the first half of 1995. Growth of world trade in manufactures is forecast to slow from 5 per cent in 1992 to 2 3/4 per cent in 1993, as a result of the slowdown in continental Europe and Japan. Growth elsewhere in East Asia and in Latin American countries has remained buoyant, and imports to the US have been surprisingly strong. But in Europe - the UK's main export market - weak domestic demand appears to have depressed imports severely (although trade volumes may have been distorted by the introduction of Intrastat, the new system for recording intra-European Community trade). As a result, UK export markets are forecast to grow by only 1 1/4 per cent this year, 1 1/2 percentage points less than world trade. With faster growth in the industrialised countries, growth of world trade is forecast to be stronger in 1994 than in 1993, at around 5 1/4 per cent. Growth of UK export markets is also expected to increase but to remain below that of world trade. UK demand and output As a result of the rebasing of the national accounts to 1990 prices and other data revisions, the trough in GDP is now estimated to have occurred in the first quarter of 1992. During the recession non-oil GDP fell by 3 3/4 per cent, rather less than the 5 1/4 per cent fall in the early 1980s recession. The recovery has proceeded fairly steadily so far, with an uninterrupted expansion in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent over the six quarters to the third quarter of 1993. Output has risen in most sectors. North Sea oil and gas output has risen particularly strongly, the fruit of heavy investment in recent years. Output has increased by about 2 1/2 per cent in both manufacturing and services, and service sector output is now above the level seen at the peak of the cycle. The impetus to recovery has come mainly from consumer spending and exports. Since the trough in output, consumer spending has contributed 2 per cent to the growth in GDP and exports 1 3/4 per cent. Stocks too made some initial contribution. During 1992 the positive contribution of exports was more than offset by rising imports, but this year exports have accelerated, despite weak demand in continental Europe, and import growth has fallen. Some improvement in trade performance was to be expected in the wake of gains in competitiveness, but its extent is uncertain given the change in the way intra-European Community trade has been recorded since the turn of the year. While the recovery so far has been remarkably smooth, it would not be surprising if the profile of output were more uneven from now on. Nevertheless growth is expected to continue in the final quarter of 1993. Although growth in manufacturing output appeared to falter over the summer, business surveys point to resumed expansion, albeit at a modest pace. North Sea output is rising and there is little sign of a break in the upward trend in consumer demand, much of which is reflected in higher output in the service sector. So GDP growth in 1993 is now forecast to be 1 3/4 per cent, a stronger performance than forecast in the March Budget. Faster growth is forecast for 1994, with GDP increasing by 2 1/2 per cent, 2 1/4 per cent excluding North Sea oil. This acceleration largely reflects a pick-up in business spending: improved company finances and modest increases in capacity utilisation should boost spending on fixed assets and stocks. Export growth should increase a little as continental Europe recovers, although imports are forecast to grow more strongly too. Annual growth in non-oil GDP is forecast to be slightly stronger again in the first half of 1995, but with growth of North Sea output slowing, total GDP growth is forecast to remain at 2 1/2 per cent. Personal sector and the housing market Consumer spending started to recover in the second quarter of 1992, having fallen 3 3/4 per cent in the recession. By the third quarter of 1993 most of this fall had been reversed, with spending rising on average by  1/2 per cent a quarter. The initial recovery followed a substantial fall in interest rates and was accompanied by strong growth in real personal disposable income. This year, however, growth of aggregate real incomes has weakened and the saving ratio has fallen from 12 3/4 per cent in 1992 to an estimated 11 3/4 per cent in the first three quarters of the year. Weaker real income growth is mainly the result of the slowdown in real average earnings growth and smaller increases in dividend income following strong growth in 1992. Events of the past 18 months have shown that consumer demand can recover while the housing market remains weak. Even so, a stronger housing market would help underpin the consumer recovery. The housing market has shown signs of emerging from its slump, but both turnover and prices have moved erratically in 1993. It is clear that the Autumn Statement package of measures designed to take empty properties off the market played an important role in the recovery of turnover in the early months of the year. Indeed there was a small surge in housing starts in the spring as builders sought to replace properties sold into the programme. While the early pace of recovery was not sustained, with some weakening in the summer, activity and prices in the third quarter were both well above their troughs. With mortgage rates at their lowest levels since 1969 and house prices lower in relation to incomes than since 1985, home ownership is more affordable than for many years. Now that prices are rising, unemployment is falling and there is a growing perception of more general recovery, increasing confidence should lead to higher activity and prices in 1994. Personal sector spending is likely to remain restrained by past standards, given a desire for further balance sheet adjustment. Nevertheless there are reasons for expecting a further decline in the saving ratio. Unemployment has begun to fall, reducing the need for precautionary saving. Inflation is forecast to remain low, reducing the need of households to save to maintain the real value of their financial wealth, and lower interest rates have eased the burden of household debt. A decline in the saving ratio combined with continued growth in real personal disposable income should permit consumption to increase in 1994 at around its recent rate. Despite the tax increases due to take effect, real personal disposable income could rise by 1 per cent in 1994, the same as in 1993, largely reflecting recoveries in self-employment and net investment incomes. Numbers of self-employed in work have been increasing and net investment income is being boosted by lower interest rates and high rates of net accumulation of financial assets. In addition there is the prospect of rising real income from wages and salaries before tax. Consumers' expenditure is forecast to rise by 2 1/4 per cent in 1994, following an increase of 2 per cent in 1993. Personal sector investment in dwellings - which includes both new houses and improvements to existing houses - is expected to grow faster than for several years as housing market activity increases. Although the saving ratio is forecast to fall and housing investment to rise, the personal sector financial balance is projected to remain in sizeable surplus in 1994 - around 6 per cent of personal disposable income. The debt/income ratio has fallen over the past couple of years. And with interest payments falling sharply as a result of lower interest rates, the burden of debt is much reduced. Corporate sector and investment Following concerted efforts to cut costs, the corporate sector has now begun to reap the benefits. Having been more or less static through the recession, industrial and commercial companies' (ICCs) profits in the first three quarters of 1993 were 14 per cent up on a year earlier. With sharply reduced short-term interest payments, down a quarter, and further reductions in tax payments, company saving (undistributed income) is estimated to have risen by about a third over the same period. Profitability, as measured by the real rate of return, is expected to be well up in 1993 on its 1992 level. In 1994 it is forecast to pick up further as recovery strengthens, labour costs remain in check, and pressure on margins eases further. Despite higher tax payments in 1994, higher profits are expected to carry through into a further marked increase in company saving. Business investment in the first three quarters of 1993 was 1 3/4 per cent down on a year earlier, although manufacturing investment rose slightly and North Sea investment increased by 7 per cent. But at its projected trough in the second half of 1993, business investment as a share of GDP is still above the levels seen between 1970 and the mid-1980s. Investment intentions have improved over the past year, and are now pointing to modest growth in manufacturing investment over the year ahead. Moreover the improvement in companies' profitability and balance sheets will ease constraints on investment. The degree of spare capacity will, on the other hand, continue to be a restraining influence until recovery is further advanced. Business investment is forecast to rise by 3 3/4 per cent in 1994 and by 4 1/2 per cent in the year to the first half of 1995. General government investment in fixed assets rose 8 1/4 per cent in volume terms in 1992, and is projected to rise by a further 11 3/4 per cent in 1993, in part due to the temporary relaxation of the rules for spending out of local authority capital receipts. In 1994 it is forecast to fall 3 per cent, as this temporary measure unwinds. But government investment is projected to remain at historically high levels. Fixed investment in the economy as a whole is forecast to grow by  1/2 per cent in 1993 and by 3 per cent in 1994, reflecting the forecast pick-up in business and housing investment which more than compensates for lower general government investment. Typically stockbuilding makes a positive contribution to growth during periods of economic upswing. The slowdown in the rate of destocking in 1992 contributed  3/4 per cent to GDP growth, following three years when the stock cycle made a negative contribution. But this year, with destocking continuing at much the same rate as in 1992, stocks are expected to make only a small contribution to growth. Stocks are forecast to contribute  1/2 per cent to growth in 1994 as stockbuilding resumes. Latest information suggests that ICCs moved into small financial surplus in the first three quarters of 1993, for the first time since 1987. The expected buoyancy of company saving and relatively modest growth of capital spending imply a larger financial surplus in 1994. This would partly restore the damage done to company balance sheets by the substantial deficits incurred in the five years to 1992, and particularly in 1989 and 1990. Labour market Employment rose between March and June 1993, for the first time in three years. The fall in employment during the recession was partly associated with a productivity performance which was abnormally strong for a cyclical downturn, perhaps reflecting the effects of labour market reforms. Although the recent turnround in employment was accompanied by a slowdown in productivity growth, non-oil productivity in the second quarter of 1993 was still 3 3/4 per cent up on a year earlier, and manufacturing productivity in the third quarter was 5 per cent up. As the recovery becomes more established, annual productivity growth could fall further from its recent high rates. Unemployment rose by 1.4m between April 1990 and its peak in January 1993 - considerably less than the fall in employment. But by October 1993 it had fallen 137,000. This is a much better performance than expected by most at the time of the March Budget. Trade and the balance of payments The introduction from 1 January of a new system for recording visible trade with the European Community - Intrastat - has made it extremely difficult to interpret recent trade performance. Not only have the figures recorded in the first few months of the new system been more liable to revision than usual, but some of the movements - such as sharply divergent changes in imports from the European Community and from elsewhere - are difficult to explain. Due to the new method of collection there may well have been a break in the European Community trade figures at the start of the year, implying that year-on-year growth rates in 1993 are unreliable. Part of the problem may lie with the split of values into prices and volumes. As the new system settles down, however, shorter period movements should become more reliable. In the meantime the forecast gives more weight to the fundamental influences on trade performance than to recent outturns. The main influences on actual trade flows over the next year or so are the improvement in competitiveness already achieved and the cyclical position in the UK compared with elsewhere. Cost competitiveness so far in 1993 has turned out much as expected. Unit labour cost performance in the UK has been unusually good. In 1993 as a whole, unit labour costs in manufacturing could be 1 per cent lower than in 1992, and they are forecast to remain unchanged in 1994. By contrast competitors' unit labour costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise. Cost competitiveness, after allowing for exchange rate changes, was probably around 20 per cent better in the third quarter of 1993 than a year earlier, and is forecast to remain close to that level during 1994. On the recorded figures export price competitiveness has improved much less. This may partly reflect exporters taking the opportunity of the lower exchange rate to widen profit margins which had previously been squeezed, but it is also possible that the recorded increase in export prices is too high. The recorded figures for imports so far this year are lower than past experience would have suggested. Although the effect of the improvement in competitiveness may have been stronger than in the past, it is possible that the import volume figures in 1993 are understated by comparison with the figures for earlier years. The sharp fall in imports from the European Community is particularly difficult to understand against a background of little change in imports from elsewhere. Recorded non-oil import volume growth may be only 2 1/2 per cent in 1993, following a rise of 7 per cent in 1992. The forecast assumes that the usual relationships between the growth of imports, domestic demand, and competitiveness are re-established from now on. These point to UK imports growing faster than UK domestic demand, reflecting the progressive specialisation of world production. Increased specialisation is evident in the consistently higher rates of growth for measures of world trade than for measures of world demand and output. Although improved competitiveness will be a moderating influence on import growth, its effect is unlikely to be strong enough to bring underlying import growth below domestic demand growth. Non-oil imports are forecast to increase by 5 3/4 per cent in 1994. The sustained improvement in competitiveness will help UK exporters to increase their market penetration. But overseas demand is itself weak. UK export markets may grow by only a little more than 1 per cent in 1993 because of the particular weakness of demand in continental Europe. In 1994, however, UK export markets are forecast to rise 4 per cent. Recorded non-oil exports may be around 3 1/2 per cent higher in volume terms in 1993 than in 1992. But the statistical problems discussed earlier may have reduced recorded export growth - actual growth may have been somewhat stronger. In 1994 non-oil export growth is forecast to be around 5 1/4 per cent. Recorded prices for both exports and imports have moved erratically in 1993, with no clear trends. Non-oil import prices have risen about 10 per cent in the year to the third quarter, less than exchange rate and world price changes would imply. This may be because importers are finding it difficult to pass on the exchange rate effects fully in the face of low consumer and producer price inflation in the UK. Non-oil export prices have also risen 10 per cent - again a good deal slower than world prices measured in sterling. Comparing 1993 as a whole with 1992, the terms of trade, as recorded, may improve by around 1 1/4 per cent, recovering from their sharp fall in the immediate aftermath of last year's devaluation. Little change is expected in 1994. North Sea output rose 8 per cent in 1992 and it has risen even faster during 1993. In 1993 as a whole, output is expected to be around 15 per cent higher than in 1992, with a further rise of nearly 20 per cent forecast in 1994. Oil output is expected to be in the upper half of the 1993 Brown Book range. Gas output, which has increased strongly this year, is forecast to rise further. As a consequence of higher production, the surplus on trade in oil is forecast to rise to Pounds 4bn in 1994, its highest since 1987. The surplus on invisibles in 1992 was Pounds 5bn well above early estimates. The surplus on net interest, profits and dividends (IPD) was particularly strong in the second half of the year, at Pounds 4bn, compared with under Pounds 2bn in the first half. But much of the increase probably resulted from abnormally high activity in the foreign exchange markets around the time of last year's ERM crisis. High IPD surpluses have not been sustained in the first half of 1993. And the balance of transfers - consisting largely of net transfers to the European Community and aid and other government spending overseas - has continued to deteriorate. The balance on services, on the other hand, which was depressed by insurance claims relating to Hurricane Andrew in the second half of 1992, rebounded strongly in the first half of 1993. It should also benefit from the improvement in competitiveness. Exports of services are forecast to rise by 4 per cent in volume terms in 1994, slightly more than in 1993. Imports of services could grow by 4 3/4 per cent in 1994 following a small fall in 1993. But an increase in the services balance is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the deterioration in IPD and transfers. Overall the surplus on invisibles is projected to be Pounds 2bn in 1993, well down on the previous year. It is forecast to fall a little further in 1994. The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2 bn from Pounds 12bn estimated at the time of the March Budget. The deficit is forecast to widen slightly to Pounds 9 1/2 bn in 1993, with a fall in the invisible surplus partly offset by a smaller visible deficit, and to remain at that level in 1994. Inflation Both cost and price inflation have been significantly lower during 1993 than forecast a year ago and in the March Budget. Despite the depreciation of sterling, underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), is expected to be lower at the end of 1993 than at the end of 1992. There are clearly considerable domestic disinflationary pressures. Underlying average earnings growth was 3 per cent in September, down from 5 1/2 per cent a year earlier. Pay settlements have also continued to fall. Latest data from the CBI show the average of settlements in manufacturing and services at about 2 1/2 per cent in the third quarter, compared to over 4 per cent a year earlier. On its own, this would point to further falls in earnings growth because settlements take time to feed through fully. On the other hand, there may be some upward pressure on earnings as profits increase and labour markets become less slack. Falling earnings growth combined with strong productivity growth has led to exceptionally good unit wage cost performance this year. Unit wage costs in manufacturing were  1/2 per cent lower than a year earlier in the third quarter, and in the year as a whole are forecast to be around 1 per cent lower than in 1992. In the private sector, unit wage costs are forecast to increase only marginally between 1992 and 1993. Falling unit wage costs in large part explain why producer prices have remained unexpectedly subdued, despite higher import prices and some rebuilding of profit margins. Producer output price inflation rose to 3.2 per cent in October, from a low point of 2.0 per cent in the autumn of 1992. Producer input prices had shown more of an impact from import prices earlier this year. But in the year to October they increased by only 1.0 per cent, further evidence of a squeeze on importers' margins. Producer output price inflation is forecast to be 3 1/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993. It may then rise a little, as manufacturers continue to rebuild margins against the background of less favourable movements in unit wage costs and adjustment to higher import prices. But as these factors run their course, producer output price inflation is forecast to fall back to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 3/4 per cent by mid-1995. Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding MIPs, fell to 2.8 per cent in early summer; its lowest rate since 1968. It rose subsequently, but this was fully reversed by a sharp fall back to 2.8 per cent in October. Underlying inflation is forecast to rise somewhat during the first half of 1994, while remaining within the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range, before falling back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end of the year. This temporary increase in underlying inflation reflects the short-run impact of tax changes. Over-indexation of excise duties, the new taxes in the Budget, and the first tranche of VAT on domestic fuel and power announced in the March Budget, are together estimated to add  3/4 percentage point to the annual rate of underlying inflation in the fourth quarter of 1994. Underlying inflation is forecast to fall further by the second quarter of 1995, to 3 per cent. Given the path of underlying RPI inflation, the outlook for the all-items rate will depend on what happens to mortgage rates. Other things being equal a 1 percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of the all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent. The prospects for the GDP deflator (which measures the price of domestic value added - principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output) differ from those for retail prices primarily because of its wider coverage. The GDP deflator is forecast to rise by 3 1/4 per cent in 1993-94, increasing to 4 per cent in 1994-95. This mainly reflects a forecast acceleration in investment goods prices from very low levels. Financial developments Sterling has been relatively stable this year. Following a short period of weakness in February and March, the sterling index has mostly traded in the range 79 to 82; over the past three months it has averaged 80 1/2 . Against the Deutschemark it has averaged DM2.48, 12 1/2 per cent below its average level during the three months prior to suspension from the ERM. Sterling was not significantly affected by the turbulence in the European Monetary System in the summer which ended in the widening of the permitted bands of variation. Base rates have been reduced twice this year, in January and November. Short-term interest rates in the UK are currently the lowest in the European Community. Long rates have fallen significantly. Ten-year gilt yields, which stood at 8 1/4 per cent at the beginning of the year, have recently been under 7 per cent. The fall in long rates reflects improved confidence in the prospects for sustained low inflation. Equity prices grew strongly after sterling's suspension from the ERM. They have continued to rise in recent months, reaching new highs. The commercial property market has remained subdued, though capital values may have stopped falling. House prices, as measured by the Halifax index, have been erratic though rising slightly in recent months. The 12-month growth rate of M0 has been above its monitoring range for most of this year; and in November it was just over 5 per cent. A period of relatively strong growth, and correspondingly low velocity growth, is not surprising following the sharp cuts in interest rates which reduce the incentive to economise on cash. M4 growth has remained close to the bottom of the monitoring range set in the March Budget. Low interest rates, relative to returns on other financial assets, reduce the attractiveness of deposits as a savings medium. The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private sector - has remained weak. The 12-month growth rate has mostly been between 3 and 4 per cent throughout 1993. Company sector borrowing in particular has remained weak, with industrial and commercial companies repaying bank borrowing. Companies have moved into financial surplus, reducing their need to borrow, and capital issues have been substantial, probably reflecting the strength of the stock market. Lending for house purchase has been one of the stronger areas, reflecting the rise in housing turnover. Risks and uncertainties All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. One way of assessing their extent is to examine average errors from past forecasts, which are shown in an accompanying table. The range of forecasts from the Independent Panel is another indicator of the uncertainties, as is the evolution of the forecasts over time. Successive Treasury forecasts of GDP growth in 1993 have been progressively revised up over the past year, while forecasts of underlying inflation in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993 have been revised down. The projected current account deficit for 1993 was increased in March, but has since been revised down below last year's Autumn Statement forecast, reflecting revisions to 1992 and lower than expected outturns so far this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD ECONOMY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Percentage changes on a year earlier                                           Forecast                                 1992      1993      1994    1995 H1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Major seven countries1  Real GDP                      1 3/4     1         2          2 1/2  Domestic demand               1 3/4     1         2          2 3/4 Industrial production           -3/4     0         2 1/2      3 1/2 Consumer price inflation2      2 3/4     2 3/4     2 1/2      2 1/4 World trade in manufactures    5         2 3/4     5 1/4      6 1/2 UK export markets3             4         1 1/4     4 1/4      5 3/4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 G7: US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy and Canada. 2 Final quarter of each period.

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / People: Bodies politic Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher and chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, is to switch retailing horses. After nearly seven years on the CBI panel, he is now to take up the position of chairman of the British Retail Consortium. His replacement at the CBI is Alastair Eperon, director of corporate affairs at Boots, and a previous chief executive of McAvoy Bayley, the public relations firm. Whittaker's new job as non-executive chairman is largely an honorary one. However, it may have help to improve the BRC's links with the CBI's panel. James May, the director general of the BRC, has admitted in public that he remains distinctly unconvinced by the accuracy of the CBI distributive trade survey. Whittaker, however, is - naturally enough - a great fan of the survey he has presided over for the past seven years.</p>

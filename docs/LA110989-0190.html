			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CEBALLOS HAS GAME-HIGH 37 IN TITANS' INTRASQUAD GAME  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's basketball team, struggling and uncertain a year ago, put  on a solid and confident exhibition in an intrasquad game Wednesday night at  Titan Gym.  </P> <P> The starters, in Blue, took a 57-29 lead at halftime before the lineups were  shuffled. The Blue team eventually defeated the Orange, 103-74.  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos, a first-team Big West Conference forward last season, scored  37 points, and guard Mark Hill, the Titans' second-leading scorer last season,  had 26.  </P> <P> Among newcomers, freshman Aaron Wilhite, a 6-foot-7 forward, scored 16 points;  junior guard Dareck Crane had 13; freshman forward Bruce Bowen had 12, and  sophomore forward Agee Ward, ineligible last season under Proposition 48  guidelines, had 11.  </P> <P> Fullerton struggled in its intra=squad game last season, with only 10 players  available less than a week after George McQuarn suddenly resigned as coach.  John Sneed, an assistant under McQuarn, replaced him and is beginning his  second season.  </P> <P> "You think of last year's intrasquad game -- it was almost an embarrassment for  us," Sneed said. "I think we showed how much further along we are."  </P> <P> Fullerton, which has been picked to finish from second to fourth in the Big  West, played with the pressing, running style that evolved last season.  </P> <P> Sneed said he was particularly impressed with his team's passing.  </P> <P> "I thought we played very unselfish ball," Sneed said. "There was some good  passing. That was a problem sometimes last year, passing and shot selection."  </P> <P> The Titans must replace one starter, forward Derek Jones, and appear likely to  start a smaller lineup that moves Ceballos to power forward and brings in  senior Van Anderson and his defensive skills at small forward. Anderson had 14  points Wednesday.  </P></p>

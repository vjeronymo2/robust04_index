			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Bosnia holds crucial independence vote THE central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina will today hold a crucial referendum on independence against a background of renewed efforts by Serbia and Croatia to carve up this ethnically mixed republic. The outcome of the referendum is likely to determine if Bosnia will slide into instability just weeks before the expected deployment of UN troops in neighbouring Croatia. Efforts to partition the republic were held during a round of secret talks in Graz, southern Austria last Wednesday between Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, and an envoy of President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. If Croatia and Serbia succeed in their goal, the Moslems of Bosnia, who make up 43 per cent of the 4.3m population, would either be without a home, or else would fight to prevent the break up of Bosnia. Serbs make up 31 per cent of the population, followed by Croats, who make up 17 per cent. Western diplomats in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday said they feared the outbreak of bloodshed among the republic's closely intertwined national communities. 'It means war if the Croats and Serbs actually try to divide the republic,' said a diplomat. But Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said 'there is no way secret plots can succeed. Democracy will win'. Bosnia's Serb leaders have called for a boycott of the referendum on the grounds that Serbs have already chosen to remain within a Yugoslav state, and with Serbs from outside of Bosnia. Mr Karadzic, who takes his instructions from Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, said: 'Serbs comprise the majority in 30 of the 109 counties (in Bosnia) ..We have already held our referendum.' The referendum must gain 50 per cent approval in order to satisfy the European Community requirements for recognition. Fears that the republic could slide into ethnic violence were heightened by reports of an explosion last Thursday which damaged a 450-year-old mosque in Banja Luka, north west of Bosnia, where many Serbs live, and where Serbs have declared a republic within a republic. Explosions have have also taken place in Mostar, a predominantly Croat and Moslem city, where much of the federal air force industry is based.</p>

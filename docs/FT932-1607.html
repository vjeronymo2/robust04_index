			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine set for lengthy absence MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who suffered a mild heart attack on Monday, is unlikely to resume his ministerial responsibilities until late summer, Michael Cassell writes. Mr Heseltine is recovering in hospital in Venice, where doctors said yesterday they were satisfied with his progress. He is expected to remain there for a few days before being given medical permission to be flown home. In spite of Mr Heseltine's central role in Mr John Major's government it is expected that he will not return to Westminster before the parliamentary summer recess, towards the end of July. He would then be able to extend his period of recuperation well into the holidays, with the possibility that he could re-emerge on the political scene at the Tory party conference in early October. Mr Major said yesterday that Mr Heseltine was comfortable and news of his progress was 'quite encouraging'. The British Embassy said the minister was 'cheerful'. His condition was satisfactory and he had seen his family during the day.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interviews with officials following nuclear reactor </F> dedication, by M.B. and A.B.; place and date not given]    [Text]  <H3>  Mr. Li Dingfan, Head of the Chinese Delegation: `A Sound  Base for Scientific Development in Algeria' </H3>   Vice-minister of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Li  Dingfan is also vice-president of the Chinese Atomic Energy  Agency and a university professor. In addition to his functions,  he was heading the Chinese delegation that helped build the Es  Salem reactor. He kindly answered our questions on this project,  which constitutes a symbol of Algerian-Chinese friendship.    [EL MOUDJAHID] How would you evaluate this project?    [Dingfan] Today is a joyful day for everybody. It is an  important page in Chinese-Algerian collaboration. It is  memorable. I expressed this in writing in the visitors' book. I  hope that this blossom of nuclear science and technology, grown  by the Algerian and Chinese parties, will bear fruit as soon as  possible.    [EL MOUDJAHID] What does this project mean to you?    [Dingfan] It is the living symbol of cooperation in  development through energy. At least, it is a sound base for  scientific development in Algeria. We may say that it boosts the  Algerian people's reputation throughout the world.    [EL MOUDJAHID] Will the Algerian-Chinese cooperation in the  nuclear sector continue?    [Dingfan] If there is a desire for cooperation, there is no  doubt that we shall be available and present. We have been  collaborating for six years.    I hope that Algeria will be able to continue its development  peaceably and peacefully. I wish that the people may enjoy the  benefits of this reactor.  <H3>  Mr. Abdellah Laid (Doctor in Nuclear Physics):  `Possibilities for Serious Work' </H3>   Being a researcher at Ain-Oussera is not a pleasure; it is a  passion which, alone, makes it possible to overcome all  problems. Mr. Abdellah Laid is head of research at the physics  department. He talked to us about it.    [EL MOUDJAHID] How important would you say this reactor is?    [Laid] It is very important for the future of the nuclear  sector in Algeria. The entire nuclear sector will be  concentrated around this site. The reactor design will allow the  peaceful use of nuclear energy. For instance, we will be able to  dope selenium, to produce radioisotopes, which are very  important in Algeria for nuclear medicine and for the industry.  Studies and surveys of manufacturers and hospitals throughout  the country have shown that there is a large demand for  radioisotopes. This reactor being equipped with irradiation  channels, we can produce these radioisotopes for medicine and  the industry. For research and agriculture, some radioisotopes  are currently used in small amounts, but we can supply more now  that we have this reactor.    [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell me where you studied?    [Laid] I have a doctorate in nuclear physics. I studied my  specialty in England for a few years.    [EL MOUDJAHID] Have you received offers to work in other  countries?    [Laid] Yes, but I preferred living in my country. It is very  important for us. Especially considering that, this time, things  are taken seriously and we have the possibility of doing serious  work.    [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell us how much you get paid?    [Laid] I cannot tell you. But it is insignificant compared  with foreign offers. I am not interested in money; rather, I am  interested in encouraging researchers and having them work  around this tool. We have here a great many researchers who  deserve every kind of encouragement.  <H3>  The Minister of Foreign Affairs: `A Symbol of the  Strengthening of Peace and Security' </H3>   [EL MOUDJAHID] Mr. Minister, how would you evaluate this new  nuclear acquisition?    [Minister] It is a universal factor for anything that has to  do with the use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends, especially  in the sectors of agriculture, health, and of course energy.  Many countries produce nuclear electricity. In Algeria, there  are huge potential uses for nuclear energy, including the  desalination of sea water. Today, we very explicitly mentioned  that our nuclear program was set up for peaceful purposes.  Algeria solemnly announced that it now intends to adhere to the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This rules out any possibility  of using it for military purposes. That was the message given at  this inauguration. At the same time, we wanted the inauguration  to take place under conditions of absolute openness. The  international press as well as the entire diplomatic corps  accredited in Algiers were present. This project is a symbol of  the strengthening of international peace and security. It also  shows that our country possesses a powerful scientific and  technological potential, that Algeria is the kingpin of Maghreb  and that it currently contributes much to consolidate not only  Maghreb unity, but also everything that contributes to the  economic, cultural and social development of the Maghreb  community.    [EL MOUDJAHID] How would you evaluate relations between  Algeria and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]?    [Minister] Mostly, we should note that we have excellent  relations with the IAEA. Its general director just sent a  message on the occasion of this inauguration.    [EL MOUDJAHID] This inauguration coincides with the 35th  anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between  Algeria and China. How would you evaluate these relations?    [Minister] First, I would point out that these relations  developed satisfactorily since, during our national liberation  struggle, China was one of the first countries to recognize  Algeria as a sovereign state aspiring to independence. After  independence, we developed our relations and strengthened them  in the economic, commercial, and cultural sectors. This Ain  Oussera center is the best example of the development of our  relations.  <H3>  The Minister of National Education: `The Hard Core of  Research' </H3>   [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell us why it was the Ministry of  National Education that was the nuclear reactor project leader?    [Minister] This project is in line with Algeria's research  policy. The research sector depends on the ministry delegated to  higher education which, as its name indicates, is itself  delegated to the Ministry of National Education.    [EL MOUDJAHID] What benefit does Algeria derive from this  reactor project?    [Minister] It is an important, even a decisive stage,  following the first stage, which was that of the Nour reactor.  The latter was a 1-MGW [as published] research reactor. The new  Essalam reactor has a 15-MGW power output; in other words, it  allies research and production, especially the production of  radioisotopes for agriculture, medicine, and pharmacy. It is  also a future provider of services for product control and  analysis through nuclear methods. We have reached a stage where  Algeria can use this nuclear tool for its economic and social  development.    [EL MOUDJAHID] What benefits did Algeria derive from the  operation of the first Nour reactor?    [Minister] In spite of its modest capacity, Nour enabled  Algerian researchers to access the nuclear field for the first  time. Note that this is the peaceful nuclear field since we are  talking about peaceful nuclear activities. Nour enabled us to  access this huge and extremely complex field, to familiarize us  with it, and it enabled our researchers to master the essential  aspects of nuclear-related research.    [EL MOUDJAHID] Is the research personnel entirely Algerian?    [Minister] Yes, 100-percent Algerian; but we wish to  increase  their number. According to our Chinese friends' evaluations,  Algerian researchers are of appreciable quality. They are young,  very dynamic, dedicated in spite of difficult living conditions.  Some are away from their families. Therefore, we should train  more personnel so as to provide this reactor with optimum human  capacities in order to benefit from all the possibilities it  offers. Currently, there are fewer than 100 researchers and  technicians; we should increase that number to 300 researchers,  technicians, and engineers.    [EL MOUDJAHID] On several occasions, technicians and  researchers mentioned their difficult working conditions. Have  you considered taking care of their complaints?    [Minister] First, I would like to say that most of them were  educated in Algeria, in universities and research institutes. We  have 17 research centers, this is the 18th; in a way, it is the  hard core. Its personnel was educated in Algerian schools and  Algerian universities. I just promised them that we would very  seriously consider the matter of their material living and  working conditions. We must improve these conditions.  <H5>  The Minister of Agriculture: `Multiple Applications' </H5>   The impact on agricultural production is manifold.  Applications to agronomic research are varied. To study problems  of nutrition or fertilization, we often use fertilizers that  have been rendered radioactive so we can see what happens to  these elements in plant nutrition. There are various  applications in plant biology, in conservation, and even in  seawater desalination.    If we can manage to control desalination costs through the  use of nuclear energy, it will be extremely useful for  agriculture, through many future projects, for instance, in  irrigation. The only problem is one of cost. At any rate, as far  as conservation or fertilization are concerned, applications  have become quite common in certain countries.    This might happen in our country, too. If we put our  agricultural economy in order. The center is there; so are the  researchers, and the land close by; all we have to do is to  create the environment required to mobilize these capacities and  technologies in order to enable certain sectors to use nuclear  energy.</p>

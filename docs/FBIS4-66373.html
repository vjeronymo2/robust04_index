			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhai Peitian [5049 1014 1131]: "Nuclear Power </F> Experimental Base Area Being Built in Chengdu; General Secretary  Jiang Zemin Is Concerned About the Nuclear Power Industry"]    [Text] During the last part of August, 1993, the State  Planning Commission and National Defense Science, Technology,  and Industry Commission authorized the China Nuclear Industry  Corporation to evaluate construction of a nuclear power base  area in Chengdu's Shenxianshu High and New-Tech Industry  Development Zone, and they have approved establishment of the  project.    In June, 1991, the Academy of Nuclear Power centralized the  opinions of experts to develop China's nuclear power industry  and sent a written report to General Secretary Jiang Zemin. On  15 June 1991, General Secretary Jiang made important comments  regarding acceleration of China's nuclear power base area  construction.    According to the general secretary's comments, under the  concern and support of the State Planning Commission, National  Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission, Sichuan  Provincial CPC Committee, Sichuan Provincial Government, and  China Nuclear Industry Corporation during the past two years,  the Academy of Nuclear Power organized the relevant experts to  speed up the preliminary design for this project. The Second  Academy of Nuclear Industry also gave great support in the  preliminary design.    On 29 April 1993, Chengdu City and the Chengdu High and  New-Tech Industry Development Zone Management Committee  organized relevant experts to conduct a preview of the  preliminary design. The experts feel that the external  conditions for construction of this project have been basically  implemented, the design conforms to the state's environmental  protection stipulations, and the operational safety and  fire-fighting designs were rational.    The new reactor experimental base area is tracking the  world's advanced nuclear power technical levels and will build  11 experimental devices including an experimental  shock-resistance device, main pump testing console device,  control rod drive line cold state hydraulic experimental device,  drive line earthquake resistance experimental vertical device,  complete core hydraulic simulation experimental device, large  thermodynamics experimental device, and so on for the primary  equipment for the reactor.    These experimental devices are essential for China's nuclear  power development and after they are completed they will assume  responsibility for preliminary research on the key technologies  for China's nuclear power and for development research for the  technology in the initial phase of the nuclear power project,  which is very important for achieving a shift to domestic  production of nuclear power equipment in China.    Based on the state's needs, the Academy of Nuclear Power  will  move quickly to work on the construction blueprint design and  construction preparatory work, strengthen management, strictly  control investments, determine project quality in accordance  with its experimental tasks, strive to play a role as quickly as  possible, and contribute to the development of China's nuclear  power industry.</p>

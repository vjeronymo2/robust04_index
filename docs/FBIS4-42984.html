			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed MTH: "Delors' Succession: Tindemans Comes </F> Out in Favor of Dehaene"]    [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (ANP) -- On Wednesday [1 June], Leo  Tindemans of the CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party], who is  chairman of the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament  (EP), announced on a Netherlands commercial television station  that he was in favor of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene  succeeding Jacques Delors as president of the European  Commission (EC).    The statements by Tindemans were greeted with astonishment  by  both his entourage and by Dutch members of his political group.  The former Belgian prime minister will announce his choice to  the new group that is elected as soon as it takes up its duties  after the European elections next 9 and 12 June. The EPP  [Group of the European People's Party] chairman Wilfried Martens  said he was "embarrassed" by the statement made by Tindemans,  for there had been no consultation with him, nor any decision  within the party on a potential candidate to succeed Delors.    Up to now, the only candidate declared by the PPE group is  former Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who has  officially submitted his candidacy to succeed Delors, something  which the Belgian prime minister has not done.    "I would not attach too much importance to these  statements,"  Martens affirmed.    According to him, if the PPE decides to present a single  candidate for the post of EC president, it will make its  decision at the summit meeting of the heads of government and  chairmen of Christian Democratic parties to be held in Brussels  on 22 June.</p>

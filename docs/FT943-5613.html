			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT wanted Yield considerations and a surge of optimism over US tobacco sales gave an early boost to BAT Industries, the international tobacco and insurance conglomerate. Initially, buyers responded to a move from US rival Philip Morris which increased its quarterly dividend by more than expected and announced a share buy back. The raised dividend follows recent reports of increased cigarette sales in the US and adds weight to expectations that BAT will report improved figures for tobacco sales in November. Several UK securities reiterated their positive stance on the stock at their morning meetings. SG Warburg, among them, also pointed out that the yield on the Eagle Star parent had risen to 6.2 per cent against 5.8 per cent for rival composites. The house believes they should trade at parity and says the imbalance implies a potential 5 per cent upside in BAT's share price. BAT were up 8 at best and held out against the broader market's sharp fall in late trading to close a penny higher at 443p with 5.6m traded. Rothmans also benefited from the improved tobacco sentiment to close 4 higher at 394p. Optimism over cyclical recovery potential next year for Hanson, the internationally traded conglomerate, was offset by some heavy selling in the US. A number of brokers have factored in earnings per share growth of around 20 per cent for next year. The stock has held up against the market since going ex-dividend on Tuesday and yesterday the shares resisted the early fall in the market to rise 2p. However, Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, dealt 1.2m American Depositary Receipts - equivalent to 6m shares - at the dollar equivalent of 256p and the shares came off the top to close marginally easier at 255p. Household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman slid 25 to 627p as the company announced that first-half profits had fallen to Pounds 123.3m from Pounds 143.6m previously. The company took an exceptional charge of Pounds 56m to cover reorganisation costs in Europe and gave a disappointing trading statement. A two-way programme trade featuring a few sizeable individual deals affected Reuters and Zeneca. The former slipped a penny to 510p as 600,000 shares were taken out of the market while Zeneca fell 11 to 828p as the shares felt the pressure of an additional 700,000 in the market. Hoare Govett was behind the surge in activity in TSB, with the broker recommending the shares to its clients on the basis that the bank's profit margins are being maintained and that the bank retains its high dividend paying capacity. Hoare's banks team increased its profits forecasts for the bank, lifting its current year expectation from Pounds 480m to Pounds 500m and that for next year from Pounds 590m to Pounds 610m. The broker also highlighted the 11 per cent underperformance of TSB shares this year. TSB stock closed 2 firmer at 224p, after 226p, with turnover reaching 9.3m shares, the highest single day's turnover since January this year. Abbey National jumped 8 1/2 more to 414 1/2 p as the market absorbed news that the company had increased rates on its fixed rate mortgages and that the shares had broken out of their recent range. The recent institutional buyer of Royal Bank of Scotland reappeared yesterday, via Credit Lyonnais Laing, and drove RBOS shares up 4 1/2 more to 430 1/2 p. Strong US buying was again noted in food and drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes. The shares closed a penny ahead at 491p, on volume of 2.4m.</p>

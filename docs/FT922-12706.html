			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Accounting panel change THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is restructuring the way it arbitrates contentious accounting practices following complaints from companies that the mechanism is undemocratic, it emerged yesterday. The changes will affect the operation of the urgent issues task force, which was established by the ASB last year to give swift rulings on the legitimacy of accounting practices as soon as they emerged. The task force will publicise the subjects it is considering more widely, produce an interim discussion of a subject and then allow at least a month for additional consultation before its binding 'abstract' on a topic is released. The move follows widespread disgruntlement from businesses that they have been taken by surprise at the speed and impact of previous task force pronouncements. These include a controversial guideline on the treatment of goodwill on the disposal of an acquisition, which was considered by the task force in October, issued in December and came into force in January. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said: 'People have felt they haven't quite understood what was happening. This gives them more chance to comment. It's a bit more democratic.' The calls for more openness and a longer period to consider proposals come in spite of the fact that the 16-strong task force includes five representatives from industry. Two other task force abstracts have already been issued - on restructuring costs and premium put options. Another three are under discussion - on post-retirement benefits, long-term debtors in current assets and low-start finance. The task force has advertised in the financial press to try to boost its circulation list.</p>

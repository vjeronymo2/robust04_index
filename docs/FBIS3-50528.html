In a  bold operation, 30 drug traffickers of the Red Brigade invaded  the Engenho Novo Police Precinct in Rio de Janeiro and rescued  38 inmates from the cells.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The gang closed 24  de  Mayo Street, one of the busiest in the outskirts of Rio de  Janeiro. The group comprised 30 men, armed with rifles and  machine guns, who wore civilian police vests. The seven  detectives who were in the precinct were taken prisoner and  handcuffed. The gang opened cells and released the 38 inmates.  The gang took all the weapons from the police precinct and even  used a police vehicle to escape. A man who was riding a  motorcycle in the area was beaten. Within 30 minutes, more than  100 policemen had begun the search for the gang. The  shantytowns of surrounding areas were cordoned off, but only two  inmates were recaptured. Another inmate was found dead in a  street close to the precinct. He was a police informer who was  murdered by the gang.    The police knew that the order to take over the police  precinct came from drug trafficker Atlas Ferreira, aka Adam, one  of the principal Red Brigade chiefs and a drug trafficking  leader in the Vigario General shantytown. The police believe  the main objective was to rescue one of the gang leaders, Luiz  Carlos Goncalvez who has been sentenced for homicide, assault,  and kidnapping, and who was to be transferred to a high security  prison today. The police were impressed with the boldness of  the gang. As they left, they fired shots in all directions  leaving marks on the walls and scaring the neighborhood. One  shot entered the window of the house next to the precinct. [end  recording]</p>

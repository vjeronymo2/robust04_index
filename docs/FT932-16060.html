			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Turkey sets another record high ISTANBUL continued its record-breaking ways, closing 3 per cent higher yesterday for a cumulative rise of 19.2 per cent since Monday of last week. The market index climbed 196.47 to its third consecutive all-time peak of 6,740.58. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London said that the strong performance was the result of a big inflow of cash as investors returned after the Ramadan holiday. He added that the market's gains this year followed moves to lower short-term interest rates as the government attempted to lengthen the maturity of its debt. Equity investments had also benefited from new favourable tax treatment for mutual funds which kept more than 25 per cent of their investments in shares. The new investable index price series on emerging markets from the International Finance Corporation show that, in dollar terms, a 9.2 per cent fall in March still left the Turkish market with a 32.1 per cent gain for the first three months of this year.</p>

The meeting participants decided that the  province's guiding principle for this year's foreign economic  relations and trade is to correctly handle relations between  foreign exchange earnings and economic returns, to  simultaneously create foreign exchange earnings and improve  economic returns, to simultaneously develop foreign economic  relations, foreign capital, and foreign trade, and to fulfill or  overfulfill various tasks in foreign economic relations and  trade.    The meeting pointed out: This year, there is a need to  deepen foreign trade system reform, to expedite the  transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms, to  gradually establish a modern enterprise system, to transform  enterprises from state plan enforcers into import and export  commodity dealers, to switch from state monopoly to market  exploration, to bring about development amid fair competition,  to form combinations between trade, industry, and commerce, to  introduce the agency system, to take the development road of  conglomeration and internationalization, to establish a personal  responsibility system and improve it, to form a financial  accounting and supervisory system, and to establish a mechanism  for independent operation under which enterprises assume sole  responsibility for their losses and profits, carry out self-  development, and exercise self-control. In the meantime, it is  necessary to cultivate a mentality of macro foreign trade, to  help large and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial  sectors, and materials supplying enterprises to cater to the  international market, and to further explore import and export  channels. This year, a small number of enterprises with good  economic results will be selected for reform experiments, and  their experience will be gradually popularized.    To fulfill this year's export task of $100 million, the  meeting requested foreign trade departments to exercise proper  control over commodity purchases, to abide by a diversified  strategy, to actively explore new markets, to encourage large  and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial sectors, and  materials supplying enterprises, as well as foreign trade firms  to tour the neighboring countries, to establish trade networks,  and to expand foreign sales.    Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng addressed the closing  ceremony. He hoped that staff members and workers in the  foreign trade field would display the spirit of hard struggle  and selfless devotion in developing the province's foreign trade  to a higher level.</p>

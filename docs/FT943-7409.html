			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down again in face of yen's continued strength The yen's continued strength against the dollar eroded investor confidence and the Nikkei lost ground on arbitrage selling in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average fell 118.12 to 20,394.58 after a high of 20,538.21 in the morning and a low of 20,380.48 in the final hour of trading. Domestic institutions and dealers remained inactive as arbitrageurs unwound their positions. Volume totalled 182.5m shares against 254m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.37 to 1,637.45 and the Nikkei 300 declined 1.16 to 297.78. Declines led advances by 642 to 288 with 225 unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead by 0.09 to 1,326.30. The yen, which rose to a three-month high last Friday, hit share prices of exporters. Sentiment was also hurt by weak technical data, with the Nikkei index heading down towards the 26-week moving average. 'The market is opaque on very low volume,' said Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley, adding that the weakness in high-technology exporters was having a negative effect on an otherwise stable index. Meanwhile, some traders feared a recurrence of last year's East Japan Railway fiasco, when confusion over trading in the railway group's shares prompted a sharp downturn in share prices following its listing. Many market participants are wary of a similar situation triggered by Japan Tobacco's listing in October. 'If Japan Tobacco is priced over Y1m it will take too much money out of a thin market,' said one analyst. Most high-technology stocks lost ground. Ricoh lost Y12 to Y946 and Hitachi declined Y6 to Y979. Brokers were hurt by the prospects of lower than expected earnings, because of low trading volume. Nomura Securities fell Y10 to Y2,270 and Daiwa Securities declined Y50 to Y1,560. Buying by overseas investors supported steel companies. NKK rose Y1 to Y284 and Kawasaki Steel added Y4 to Y411, but others were lower on profit taking, with Nippon Steel down Y6 to Y362. Some drug makers, unaffected by currency movements, gained ground. Sankyo rose Y30 to Y2,330 and Takeda Chemical Industries added Y10 to Y1,260. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 131.21 to 22,848.85 in volume of 82m shares. Roundup Sentiment was generally mixed in the region. Bombay was closed for a two-day holiday. SINGAPORE slipped on a bout of profit-taking in blue chips. Foreign institutions were said to be main culprits behind the selling wave. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 26.23 to 2,230.94. Property and shipyard stocks were particularly hard hit, with DBS Land skidding 8 cents to SDollars 4.58. However, Malaysian shares traded over the counter extended their recent winning streak, as speculators pushed the UOB OTC index 8.84 higher to 1,253.97. KUALA LUMPUR itself closed higher in the heaviest trading in six months, on speculative buying spurred by a string of takeover announcements in recent sessions and on renewed hopes for an early general election. The composite index added 9.50 to 1,150.20 as volume swelled to 591m shares, the highest since 621.5m on Feb 22. Telekom Malaysia rose 60 cents to MDollars 21.50. SEOUL climbed in brisk trade as a widely expected downward correction failed to materialise. The composite index closed 15.90, or 1.7 per cent firmer at 962.96. TAIPEI ended off its highs as late profit-taking eroded early gains. The weighted index finished 32.76 stronger at 6,838.60 after peaking at 6,902.17. Cement shares, laggards in recent sessions, led the winners while previous favourites such as electronics and plastics dropped on selling by institutions and brokerage houses. SYDNEY edged higher in a dull session ahead of a flurry of big corporate reports later in the week. Goodman Fielder was the most actively stock, rising by a cent to ADollars 1.48 with 4.4m shares changing hands on renewed talk that it may be taken over. The Australian Financial Review reported that Goodman has been soliciting offers from friendly food groups to fend off major shareholders who have requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting for October 13 to vote on the board's composition. HONG KONG closed higher on late afternoon buying by foreign brokerage houses. Investors spent most of the day sidelined ahead of today's land auction and Thursday's announcements of interim results from Cheung Kong and Hutchison. The Hang Seng Index firmed 52.89 to 9,457.33; turnover was thin at HKDollars 2.79bn. Much of the late buying was concentrated on the index heavyweights, HSBC and HK Telecom. HSBC climbed HKDollars 1.25, or 1.4 per cent to HKDollars 89.25, while HK Telecom added 40 cents to HKDollars 16.65. However, mainland Chinese stocks suffered as the H-share index lost 17.56, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,235.11 after sell orders emerged following the release last week of weaker-than-expected results from Tsingtao Brewery, which ended five cents lower at HKDollars 6.15. COLOMBO dropped sharply on the first day of trading since the People's Alliance came to power last week. Turnover was thin as foreign and domestic institutional investors awaited further clarification of the new government's economic policies. The all share index fell 17.21 to 999.92 in a session dominated by retail selling.</p>

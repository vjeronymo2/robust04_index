Hillgard, M.D.; Denial of Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 10, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Else M. Hillgard, M.D., of Arlington, Virginia, proposing to deny her application for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Hillgard's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Hillgard on August 13, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Dr. Hillgard. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr. Hillgard or anyone purporting to represent her. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Hillgard has waived her opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, a DEA investigation revealed that Dr. Hillgard prescribed controlled substances to several individuals that were admitted drug abusers. When Dr. Hillgard became aware that she was under investigation for excessive prescribing, she voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate of Registration, AH8248153 on July 25, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 22, 1990, Dr. Hillgard signed a Memorandum of Agreement with DEA in which she was granted a Certificate of Registration to handle only Schedule II non-narcotic and Schedule IV controlled substances, subject to certain terms and conditions. On September 4, 1990, DEA issued Dr. Hillgard DEA Certificate of Registration, BH2412687. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In September 1990, the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received information that Dr. Hillgard was again excessively prescribing controlled substances to known drug abusers for no legitimate medical reason. As a result, on October 23, 1991, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine was suspended by the Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (Board). On October 24, 1991, Dr. Hillgard voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate of Registration, BH2412687. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 15, 1992, the Board revoked Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine. The Board found that Dr. Hillgard was selling, prescribing, giving away or administering drugs for illegal or illegitimate purposes. Based in part upon the Board's findings regarding Dr. Hillgard's prescribing practices, and subsequent decision to revoke her medical license, effective February 28, 1994, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia was also revoked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that as of September 15, 1992, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the State of Maryland was revoked, and effective February 28, 1994, her license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia was also revoked. As a result, she is unable to handle controlled substances in the state in which she is registered with DEA. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Hillgard's application for DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration, executed by Else M. Hillgard, M.D., be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective October 7, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY TRANSIT AGENCY SHELVES PLANS TO BUY LAND ALONG RAIL ROUTE  </P> <P> In response to homeowner protests, the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission on Wednesday shelved plans to buy land along a San Fernando Valley  railroad line that is one of two routes under consideration for a mass transit  system.  </P> <P> Homeowners along the so-called Chandler-Victory route had complained bitterly  that buying the land suggested that the freight corridor had already been  selected for the cross-Valley line.  </P> <P> One homeowner leader along the route, which roughly parallels Chandler and  Victory boulevards from North Hollywood to Warner Center in Woodland Hills,  Wednesday compared the proposed buying of land to "constructing a gallows  outside the courthouse before an accused is tried."  </P> <P> The leader, Robert Silver of Van Nuys, afterward called the commission's  unanimous vote a "small victory."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freeway Route  </P> <P> In addition to the Chandler-Victory route, the commission is studying the  possibility of building a rail line on pillars along the Ventura Freeway from  Universal City to Warner Center.  </P> <P> That route has also drawn strong opposition from residents, who complain that  the trains, running every three minutes during rush hours, would bring noise,  traffic congestion and ground vibrations to their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> While there is strong opposition from those who would be immediately affected  by the trains, opinion polls indicate widespread support for some sort of  east-west transit line in the Valley.  </P> <P> Preliminary results of a $2.1-million study of the two proposed routes are  expected in September.  </P> <P> The commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines, plans to  pick a route by March and also determine whether it should be part subway or  ground-level light rail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appraisal Studied  </P> <P> At issue Wednesday was whether to direct the staff to begin an appraisal of the  little-used freight line, which Southern Pacific announced several months ago  that it wants to sell.  </P> <P> Last week, the commission's Transit Committee voted 3 to 0 to recommend that  the 11-member commission authorize buying several properties along the corridor  that are "ideally located for station sites."  </P> <P> In addition, the committee voted to recommend that the commission hire an  appraiser to determine the value of the 14-mile-long corridor itself.  </P> <P> Both recommendations were tabled by commissioners Wednesday at the suggestion  of Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who represents the Crenshaw  district but has developed close ties to Valley rail opponents.  </P> <P> Holden said it would "show some good faith" to withhold any action affecting  the Chandler-Victory route until the feasibility study is completed this fall.  </P> <P> Transit Committee members had argued that there were competing buyers for the  properties and that the commission could always sell the land if a different  route was selected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notice Served  </P> <P> But opponents countered that rival buyers are unlikely to purchase and invest  in improvements to land that the commission has served notice that it might  acquire by condemnation in the near future.  </P> <P> While placing land purchases along the Victory-Chandler line in limbo, the  commission authorized appraisals of three other Southern Pacific lines in  Southern California, including the coast main line, which crosses the Valley  diagonally from Burbank to Chatsworth.  </P> <P> That line is being studied for a twice-daily commuter rail line, which, unlike  light rail, would operate on existing freight tracks and would utilize standard  rail passenger cars.  </P></p>

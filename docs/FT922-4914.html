			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Aerospace just in black DEUTSCHE Aerospace (DASA), the defence and aerospace subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, scraped into the black with a profit of just DM50m (Dollars 31m) last year, on turnover of DM12.4bn, compared with a loss of DM135m in 1990. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive, warned that the company still faced 'difficult times' in the coming years, with uncertainty over a string of public-sector projects. 'Uncertainty and change will accompany us in the future, but there is also confidence, clearer structures and an increasingly vivid vision of a truly global company,' he said. The most immediate uncertainty concerns the European Fighter Aircraft, in which DASA has a 33 per cent stake. The German government is expected to pull out of the project by the end of the month. At the same time, a question-mark hangs over the company's two space projects, the Hermes shuttle, and the Columbus space station, both of which will be delayed and may be cut back because of the budget squeeze in Bonn.</p>

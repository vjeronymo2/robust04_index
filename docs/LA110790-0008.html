			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPARATIONS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS  </P> <P> To black leaders such as Daniels drumming the issue of reparations, I have to  say that this door you're opening is the lid on Pandora's box, from which great  evil will arise. Does every white American bear the guilt for enslaving blacks?  We must, since we are all going to have to pay.  </P> <P> And if so, we have established the principle of racial guilt. I as a white man  am guilty of wrongs -- not even crimes, for slavery was legal and had existed  for all of human history before we in the Western world decided it was wrong  and put a stop to it. But I am guilty of these deeds now perceived to be wrong,  committed more than a century ago by people with whom I am associated only by  skin color, not, and I emphasize, by descent -- for my ancestors were not in  this country 100 years ago.  </P> <P> But if I am guilty because of my skin color, we have established a principle of  jurisprudence of racial guilt, and we had all better think carefully if we want  to abandon the principle of individual responsibility in favor of collective  guilt.  </P> <P> I think it is apparent from this formula that what is being proposed is nothing  less than a recipe for increased strife between the races, which will only  benefit those who gain power by stoking the fires of hatred, bitterness and  resentment.  </P> <P> MICHAEL McINTYRE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, other commenters said OSHA should revise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercut requirement in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 284&hyph;88, 324&hyph;26). One commenter said OSHA should make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercutting a recommended practice in the final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for innovations in cutting techniques and to allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of various production requirements for cutting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain types of wood (e.g., veneer).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters stated that OSHA should permit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception to the undercut requirement for manual felling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saplings or unmerchantable trees, that is, of trees with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small diameter at breast height (DBH) (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;46,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;5; Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 324&hyph;26). These commenters said that the hazards OSHA was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempting to protect against do not exist for saplings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, undercuts are not necessary. For example, Mr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alex Hanson, of AOL, stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On the smaller, nonmerchantable timber that's two,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three, four, five, six inches, generally not very tall,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 foot or less or maybe taller, and when you slash it,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> you push it over. It doesn't need a face to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the direction of fall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [W]hen trees start getting to be merchantable size,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then you have safety problems. You get a seven inch or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over tree, you want to know where it's going. You  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> don't want to have it just fall anywhere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [Y]ou have to buck those merchantable trees. You have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cut the top out so you just don't want them going  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> everywhere. You want things in line. And if they're  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> everywhere, then it increases the risk for the buckers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally it's the same guy who is falling it, but you  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> want to have things in an orderly fashion so that he's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not having to go everywhere to buck the top. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they're just slashing it, it doesn't really matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where it goes because you're not having to go out there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and limb and cut the tops out and create another hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for yourself (Tr. OR 265, 284&hyph;88).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, other commenters disagreed with AOL about what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size tree requires an undercut. One commenter said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercuts are necessary for any tree that has more than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-inch base (Ex. 9&hyph;16), while another commenter said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercuts were not necessary for trees with a seven-inch DBH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tr. OR 421&hyph;22).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The APA, however, said that even trees with a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DBH should be undercut:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> You heard from one of the associations who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending that with regard to what I call undercuts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they're also called face cuts, that they not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required on very small trees, and there was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion and possibly a recommendation of an 8-inch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 7-inch size limit. Unfortunately, I don't have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. But we do know and I will watch to see if I can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> find any and submit it post hearing. I went through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our files and could not find anything. But it is our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perception, after studying these operations, that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree that's 8 inches in diameter at breast height is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably about 12 inches in diameter at the stump, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it's an oak tree or a Douglas fir tree that's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 feet tall and 8 inches and 12, it's a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass of wood that is difficult to control to get on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground and could cause and probably has caused injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maybe even deaths. There's enough mass there with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 60-foot tree ripping down, uncontrolled in its fall,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cause a death. And you heard from the Montana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> folks, that they have a little bit of a problem with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that too (Tr. OR 485&hyph;88).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, some commenters opposing the undercut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement also admitted that undercuts were necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any merchantable tree, regardless of its size. They said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that whenever a tree has a merchantable stem for a sawlog  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, it must be undercut to protect the fiber recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tr. OR 422, 487&hyph;88). They said undercutting was essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both for production reasons and safety considerations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees bucking the felled tree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the evidence in the record, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes a provision requiring that each tree manually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felled be undercut is necessary to protect employees from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury. According to the WIR survey, four percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees injured said they had been using the wrong cutting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method at the time of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCI report indicated that 10 fellers were injured because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misjudgments in cutting the tree (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, undercutting helps protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feller from injury by reducing the potential for the tree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splitting and falling in an unintended direction or kicking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> back towards the feller. In the final rule, OSHA is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing an exception to the undercutting requirement when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer demonstrates that felling the particular tree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without an undercut will not create a hazard for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee. OSHA believes that when the hazards of splitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trees, tree kickback and misdirected falls are not present,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it may be appropriate to manually fell a tree without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercutting. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of demonstrating that the hazards discussed in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not present. OSHA also notes that the employers cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make a blanket determination that trees of a particular size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> never pose the hazards discussed above if manually felled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without an undercut. The condition of the tree and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding area may make manually felling even a small a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree hazardous if it is not first undercut. The tree and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those conditions must be assessed on a case by case basis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether felling the tree without making an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercut would create a hazard for an employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> ECLECTIC HORNSBY IS EAGER TO PLEASE AT AMPHITHEATRE  </P> <P> No, Bruce Hornsby's alternate career as part-time keyboardist for the Grateful  Dead did not draw caravans of Deadheads to his concert at the Universal  Amphitheatre on Friday. Too bad. Hordes of kids with tie-dyed eyes might have  given the crowd some life. As it was, the pockets of Deadheads who did turn out  seemed to be the only fans physically into the show.  </P> <P> And the pockets of Dead songs that Hornsby and his band the Range peppered  their Dead-length (three hours) set with were among its spunky highlights. So  were bits of Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, Leon Russell. . . . Can you say eclectic?  </P> <P> But if the tall, eager-to-please Hornsby's wide scope is his greatest strength,  it's also his weakness. On Friday, the first of two nights at Universal, he  seemed a bit unfocused, leaving eager-to-please and eclectic as the biggest  impressions of the presentation, and leaving the crowd largely sedate until a  closing string of hits.  </P> <P> Not that Hornsby didn't give it a commendable shot: How many performers of his  mainstream commercial stature would invite written requests from the crowd --  and actually perform several of them? Rather than be a predictable hit machine,  Hornsby wants to be free to surprise his fans with the variety of music he  himself loves.  </P> <P> The fans seemed to lack imagination, though, mostly asking for selections  already associated with Hornsby rather than off-the-wall choices that would  have made this a truly unique night. And with harmonica player Jimmie Wood and  banjo wizard Bela Fleck guesting, the possibilities were vast. Isn't it more  fun to see a band wing it on something a bit out of character than play songs  they've played a thousand times? But at least Hornsby and crew did wing it  some, which is more than most contemporary stars would or could do. STEVE  HOCHMAN  </P></p>

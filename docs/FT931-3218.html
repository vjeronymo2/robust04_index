			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners succeeds The announcement that Owners Abroad had successfully fended off the Pounds 290m bid from its rival tour operator Airtours triggered more hectic activity in the shares as investors took stock of the situation as the dust settled on one of the closest takeover battles in recent times. The early afternoon announcement had been preceded by continued busy activity in Owners shares as BZW, on behalf of Airtours, was said again to have been bidding for stock. It was later announced that Airtours nominees now control 8.21 per cent of Owners ordinary shares. However, dealers also said that Owners' white knight, travel agency Thomas Cook, owned by German travel group LTU, had also been active in the market. One of the first trades of the day yesterday had been struck at 152 1/2 p - the price Thomas Cook had paid to secure a large chunk of the 8.4 per cent stake it snapped up in Owners on Monday. The morning's activity - when 4m shares were traded - underpinned the shares of both protaganists. However, the 3.45pm announcement of Owners' victory prompted a roller-coaster ride in both stocks. Owners immediately tumbled 20 to 118p, before rallying to close at 126p, a fall of 12 on the day. Turnover was moderate by recent sessions at 4.9m. Airtours dropped 19 to 319p, then rallied to end the day 11 adrift at 327p. The company managed to secure 43 per cent of the shares either through nominees or by pledges of support. Sources close to Airtours were blaming a small number of institutions for switching allegiance at the last moment. Analysts attached more significance to the fact that Owners and Thomas Cook had built up a strategic stake of more than 10 per cent on Monday. However, most remained positive on both stocks in spite of the result. A combined Airtours/Owners would have probably sparked a price war with market leader Thomson and this prospect has now diminished. Both companies have also reported strong bookings during the takeover battle. In addition, Owners and Thomas Cook are now expected to cement their pre-bid plans for closer ties.</p>

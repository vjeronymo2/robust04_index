			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's product liability  law will not incorporate a provision requiring consumers simply  to prove that damage from defective products was caused by their  normal use when they seek damage, under a report approved Monday  [4 April] by a ruling coalition task force. Consumer groups  have been pressing for the controversial provision as a way to  fight court battles over damage from defective products.    The report instead calls for a rule allowing manufacturers  to  be free from responsibility for damage caused by defective  products if they prove that such defects were not foreseeable at  the time of development.    Among other proposals, the report rejected a request from  the  Health and Welfare Ministry that blood products be exempt from  the law for the sake of stable supply. The proposals are  roughly in line with a report presented last December by the  Social Policy Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister.    Government officials said they intend to submit a bill on  product liability on the basis of the latest proposal by the end  of April.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Fashion: Peacocks, yes, but never sissies - Last week, the female fashion editors. This week, Richard Rawlinson meets the men THE SELECT male fashion editors on Britain's glossy magazines and newspapers have a lot to live up to. They also have a lot to live down. On the one hand, they are the style gurus who inform the public of the latest trends. Together with the world's top retailers, they decide which looks to promote to the consumer, having studied the images on the catwalks in Milan, Florence, Paris, New York and London six months before merchandise hits the shops. One would expect male fashion editors to be as fulfilled as any professional in the knowledge that their work, like that of their female counterparts, has cultural influences on society and economic implications for the clothing industry But one thing niggles them. Fashion is widely perceived to be superficial and sissy. This often affects how they dress as individuals. 'Most editors would die of horror if anyone suggested they were fashion victims,' says Nick Sullivan, fashion director of Esquire magazine. 'There is nothing wrong with showing an interest in fashion but it should not manifest itself as an obsession. I am interested in clothes because of my job, not the other way round.' Sullivan, 29, never predicted his career path. After studying French at Warwick University, he taught English before finding work on the trade magazine, International Textile. 'I would visit Italian mills and see how suits are made,' he says. 'Fine details in cut are what make menswear either right or wrong.' He wears understated suits by designers Giorgio Armani and Nicole Fahri. His shirts are either classics by Hackett and Van Heusen or funky adaptations of the traditional look by designers Paul Smith and Richard James. He buys silk ties in Milan by Dortani. His fashion pages do not always reflect his sober taste. In a recent issue of Esquire, he wrote about the influence on the catwalks of the film Bram Stoker's Dracula. 'Patrician sophisticate Valentino, trendy duo Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Katharine Hamnett all plugged into the dandy weirdo look sending out frock coats, high-collared shirts with cravats, . . . toppers and little round sunglasses.' Sullivan sees no contradiction between his wardrobe and his work. 'I am not judged on what I wear but on what I produce on the page,' he says. 'Readers want to know what is going on, but to be told in a light-hearted way. I do not say 'you must wear this'.' Peter Howarth, fashion director of GQ magazine, says: 'If you work with clothes every day, you tend to want to switch off in your free time, go to the pub and talk about girls and football. The last thing you want to do is shop. I live out dreams through my fashion shoots.' Howarth, 28, read English at Cambridge University but a holiday job with Paul Smith led to a full-time job. He was poached by Nicole Fahri to head her menswear sales office but, while working there, he wrote freelance articles for magazines including Elle and GQ. Opting for a more casual look than Sullivan, he wears Nicole Fahri suits with turtle neck jerseys by John Smedley or a suit jacket and jersey with Levi's jeans. 'To be comfortable is to be confident,' he says. 'I have developed a wardrobe which I do not need to worry about co-ordinating in the morning. Almost everything is navy or black.' In the April GQ he produced two fashion features: one showing grey, summer suits - more Cary Grant than John Major - and one paying tribute to the 1950s revival: 'So put on your flower prints, new trousers and way-out waistcoats.' 'The overall look is hippie but when individual items of clothing used in the shoot are separated out they can be worn by men who are not going for that look,' he says. 'Readers want to know what is fashionable but they are more concerned about what is the best than what is the latest thing.' The approach of Dave Bradshaw, fashion editor of Arena magazine, is more eclectic than most of his male glossies rivals. 'Arena man is harder to define than GQ or Esquire man,' he says. 'He is not inspired by the depth of turn-ups and is more likely to be influenced by the quirkiness of London street-style. Most editors always seem to be looking for something to connect 25 shows such as the sailor look, whereas I just use individual pieces that I like and put them together. Bradshaw, 30, joined the fashion media after studying civil engineering at Brighton Polytechnic and says he still feels like a round peg in a square hole, in spite of having styled advertising shoots for companies such as Katharine Hamnett, Next and Wrangler, as well as having worked internationally on a freelance basis for magazines. He owns suits by Yohji Yamamoto, Katharine Hamnett and Paul Smith but mixes them with second-hand discoveries from charity shops, achieving an individualistic hotchpotch of old, new, casual and formal. On the day I interviewed him he was wearing a brown, flared, pinstripe suit with a round neck tank top, Adidas trainers and white socks. 'Anyone with money can buy a suit,' he says. 'It is much more intelligent to look smart and contemporary on little money.' Marcus von Ackerman, having edited the now defunct men's section of British Vogue and worked for Vogue Homme in Paris, jumped from men's to women's wear to become the fashion director of Elle. He became disillusioned with what he describes as the 'homophobia of the British male fashion press' and feels he can best express his flamboyant style through women's magazines. 'I find British men's fashion banal,' he says. 'The French and Italians still have a nostalgic view of le style Anglais but in reality they are better dressed than us. At Vogue, I chose desert and mountain locations to shoot the most photogenic outfits, which could be as wild as a fluorescent pink suit. Most men's magazines would not allow this but I feel a duty to challenge and put forward strong directions.' Von Ackerman, 32, displays a love of opulent clothes in person but his image is nevertheless conservative. He has 20 designer suits by either Romeo Gigli or Richard James, his shirts come from Turnbull &amp; Asser and his ties from Gene Meyer in New York or Charvet in Paris. Oversized cufflinks come from Lalique or Chanel. 'I love the extravagance of designers such as Gianni Versace although I tend not to wear loud clothes as I do not like to be stared at,' he says. lain R Webb, fashion editor of The Times, is responsible for covering men's and women's fashion and he aims to use his platform to 'inspire people to have more fun with clothes.' Aged 35, he studied fashion at St Martin's College of Art and Design in London during the punk era and has since worked for the Evening Standard, Elle and Harpers &amp; Queen. 'Fashion is a way of life for me that embraces everything from coffee to clubs to clothes,' he says. Like his contemporaries, he prefers tailored suits, teamed with either shirts and ties or jerseys, to casualwear. But he has already nodded approval to the Dracula look by buying a frock coat by Paul Smith. Instead of wearing black tie at formal occasions he puts on a satin suit by designer Helmut Lang instead. 'Dress codes are for people who are scared to express themselves,' he says. 'There have been times when I have thought I should be more fashionable but I do not feel comfortable if I am too dandified. I like simple, clean lines, single-breasted jackets and narrow trousers.' Looking back over the last 10 years, it seems that some of the taboos of men's fashion have disappeared and for that we have to thank in part the images displayed on the catwalks and in the press - they may seem extreme but they have helped loosen attitudes. Even so high fashion for men is still, by and large, seen as either something for the very young or as a hyperbolic statement which is not to be taken literally.</p>

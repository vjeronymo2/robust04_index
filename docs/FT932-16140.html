			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Severn bridge supplier named in Italian corruption inquiry: Sir Teddy Taylor calls on Heseltine to investigate company THE HEAD of an Italian civil engineering company which last year controversially won the contract to supply steelwork for a Pounds 300m bridge over the river Severn in Britain has been placed under house arrest in Italy following allegations of corruption. Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East, who strongly criticised the award of the contract to Cimolai, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, requesting an official investigation into the Italian company. He said: 'This raises serious issues which must be investigated, given the previous concern over the award of an important contract to a non-British company.' The allegations against Mr Luigi Cimolai, managing director of Cimolai, involve two projects in north-east Italy - the proposed construction of the Plandipan-Sequals highway and the completed Delizia bridge across the River Tagliamento, close to the company's headquarters in Pordenone. Some of the biggest corruption scandals in Italy have involved construction and engineering companies, which were awarded lucrative domestic contracts for public works projects in exchange for making illicit payments to political parties. The arrest is embarrassing for John Laing of the UK and GTM Entrepose of France which are jointly building the privately financed Severn crossing and which awarded the Pounds 7m steelwork contract to Cimolai in November. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of the British construction group, said: 'Our contract is with a company, not with an individual. We were required under EC rules to advertise the job internationally. 'We would have preferred to give the work to a British company but Cimolai offered by far the best terms and has an excellent record for this kind of work. The company's offer and record were checked thoroughly.' Sir Teddy Taylor, however, remains critical of the deal. He said: 'I am concerned that companies from the continent can use EC competition rules to win work in Britain with the benefit of subsidised prices, while British companies find it impossible to make headway in countries like Italy.' The British Constructional Steelwork Association says Italian steelwork companies seeking to gain a foothold in the market have been undercutting prices submitted by local suppliers by up to 20 per cent. Cimolai was recently reported to have won a steelwork contract for the Pont de Normandie viaduct on the A29 motorway near Le Havre in northern France. Andreotti calm as accusers take aim, Page 2</p>

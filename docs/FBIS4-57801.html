			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcio Moreira Alves: "Strategy and Spying"] </F>   [Text] The National Defense Committee of the Chamber of  Deputies has a brilliant group of advisers, some of them former  Armed Forces officers who took the exams to join the legislative  branch. Thanks to this group, seminars on matters of strategic  interest are organized every few months with the cooperation of  centers of civilian studies. The last seminar took place this  week, and its theme was the use of intelligence services in a  democratic society.    The Center for Strategic Studies [CEE] of the Strategic  Affairs Secretariat, which is under the Presidency of the  Republic, is also seeking new horizons. The CEE, which is  associated with the Nucleus for Interdisciplinary Analysis of  Policies and Strategies [Naipe] of Sao Paulo University,  organized the First National Meeting of Strategic Studies. It  will take place at the former National Intelligence Service  [SNI] school in Brasilia from 25 to 27 May. Admiral Mario Cesar  Flores will preside over the opening ceremony. Among the  lecturers are former chiefs of the military regime, such as  General Carlos Meira Mattos, and intellectuals who opposed the  military regime, such as Aspaisa Camargo, Rene Dyfuss, and  Luciano Martins, in addition to diplomats and ministers. It will  be a pluralist meeting of some of the people who have stood out  in the last few years for their devotion to the study of  Brazilian matters.    In commenting on the meeting, the organizers say: "In the  last few years, it has been noticed that there are shortcomings  in the exchange of ideas and in the interdisciplinary debates  about methodological progress in strategic studies in Brazil.  The CEE and Naipe therefore decided to unite and promote a  meeting of people who are interested in studying strategic  matters."    The effort to reorganize the intelligence,  counterintelligence, and strategic analysis of the government is  not simply a result of the dismantling of the National Security  Council and the former SNI, which were promoted during the  Collor administration and officially held responsible for  embezzlement and other crimes committed by the former "service."  It is also a result of the call for openness imposed by the  consolidation of the democratic process.    Democracy and the organs that gather information and design  strategies are not opposed to each other. All democracies have  their services, which report to special congressional committees  and to the president of the Republic. Their task includes the  preservation of the territory and the economic, scientific, and  military interests of the nation from declared or potential  enemies, and also from friends.    During the Cold War, Western intelligence services got tired  of spying on each other. Once the Cold War was over, they set  new goals. In July 1880 [as published], then CIA Director  William Webster said: "We want to be informed about new trends,  national and regional resources and limitations, financial  transactions, and technological progress. This makes us search,  either officially or clandestinely, for the economic information  that our politicians need to make prudent decisions and to make  competition as fair as possible. We need to know what our  competitors do in order to face them or reject them." CIA  spokesman Mark Mansfield added: "In the future, our efforts will  concentrate on three areas: economic capacity and economic  restrictions, commercial and financial strategies, and  technology."    Today, Brazil, which is a midlevel power, has nothing in the  area of intelligence, counterintelligence, and strategy, among  other reasons because almost no one is thinking on a long-term  basis. Three months are long term for most politicians, while 15  years are short term for a Japanese enterprise. The only  exceptions are the Armed Forces and the Foreign Ministry. This  is why these two institutions are trying to use university  resources, which concentrate much of the knowledge that they  need. The meeting in Brasilia is part of that effort.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO SALES DECLINE  </P> <P> After a scalding spring, the market for new home sales in San Bernardino County  cooled considerably during the summer, according to the Competitive Housing  Market Report issued this month by the Meyers Group.  </P> <P> Meyers' audit of all new residential projects in the county from June through  August showed that sales totaled 2,482, which was 16.26% below the 2,974 units  sold from March through May.  </P> <P> As sales dropped during the quarter ending Aug. 31, detached-home prices  increased slightly, with the base median price rising from $153,940 to  $153,990. With limited numbers of condominiums and townhouses available, the  base median price for attached housing remained at $101,990.  </P> <P> The market flattened in part because San Bernardino draws buyers from Orange  and Los Angeles counties, where housing has shifted from a seller's to a  buyer's market, said Steve Johnson, vice president of a Meyers Group division  based in Corona.  </P></p>

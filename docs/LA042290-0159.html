			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVISED AT BEHEST OF MINORITIES, NEW CIVIL SERVICE EXAMS READY  </P> <P> Eight years after the civil service qualifying examination was thrown out  because it discriminated against minorities, the government has devised new  competitive entrance tests that will be given across the country in June.  </P> <P> Americans interested in federal professional and administrative careers will  have a chance for the first time in nearly a decade to compete openly at  hundreds of examination sites around the nation for the roughly 10,000  entry-level jobs on the government's management track. The government estimates  300,000 to 500,000 people will take the exams.  </P> <P> Since the old qualifying exams were thrown out, hiring for entry-level  professional and administrative jobs has been done in a stopgap manner or on  the basis of narrow tests aimed at specific jobs.  </P> <P> Under the new procedure, the Office of Personnel Management will administer six  broad-based tests, each of which covers a range of related occupations. The  tests were developed at a cost of about $100,000 each to select the best  applicants and eliminate "adverse impact" on minorities.  </P> <P> Only 5% of black applicants passed the old Professional and Administrative  Career Examination, or PACE, which was thrown out in 1982. Only .07% of them  received a high enough score to be considered for hiring.  </P> <P> "Everybody wants people selected by the government to be of high quality," said  Richard T. Seymour, director of the employment discrimination project at the  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which brought the original suit  against PACE in 1978. "We just don't want a thumb on the scale of merit."  </P> <P> Since the abandonment of PACE, civil servants have been hired for 118 different  kinds of jobs based on interviews, recommendations, college grade point  averages and, increasingly, from specialized tests developed for specific jobs.  </P> <P> Former Office of Personnel Management Director Constance Horner described the  process as "intellectually confusing, procedurally nightmarish, inaccessible to  students and very difficult to explain."  </P> <P> The hiring process is almost universally blamed for at least part of the  problem described as the "quiet crisis" in the quality of government by the  commission headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. "There is  a widespread sense that the overall quality of federal entry level employees is  declining," the commission said last year.  </P> <P> The new tests will not immediately end litigation over discrimination in PACE  and an earlier test. In 1981 the U.S District Court ruled that once the  government devised a test the court considered non-discriminatory, it would  monitor the situation for five years to ensure that actual hiring was fair. If  the court determines the new tests are non-discriminatory, then the five-year  clock will start ticking.  </P></p>

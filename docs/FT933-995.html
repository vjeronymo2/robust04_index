			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (12): Conserving the interests of the nation - Gerald Cadogan talks to the organisations working to maintain the old - and not so old - buildings that distinguish Britain CONSERVATION societies began when William Morris founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) in 1877. The aim was to defend them against unneeded restoration, a pastime dear to the Victorians - as almost every church in the UK shows. New members are still expected to read and assent to the manifesto. Among other things, it condemns those - academics especially - who attempt to 'restore' a building by fixing its origin arbitrarily at a particular point and ignore its history and life since; he calls this 'a feeble and lifeless forgery.' Morris's broadside hits at the heart of the debate on how to treat old buildings. Would he approve of rebuilding Windsor Castle or Uppark, in West Sussex, both damaged severely by fire, exactly as they were? I doubt it, for that is parody. Far better - and braver - to consolidate the charred ruins and build anew. The SPAB sets the pattern for the other national societies which exist to meet the threats of destruction and public ignorance. It campaigns to save buildings and advise on planning applications to alter or demolish them. Often, they are designated by law to do this, and get some funds from the department of national heritage. They have lectures and field trips and give parties in period dress in buildings they are defending. They also run courses and publish books and pamphlets to teach about the buildings and how to look after them sympathetically. It used to be a battle, and still is sometimes; but, nowadays, government and the public are more understanding. All the same, does the government connect Conservatism and Conservation fully? The SPAB promotes the 'P' in its name by stressing regular maintenance and teaching how to repair by means of handbooks, courses and working parties. As one of the designated 'amenity' societies which planning authorities consult, it concentrates on pre-Georgian buildings, but will step in for any building of quality of any period. Full members have an unusual perk. The society sends them (quarterly) a list of houses for sale that need repair, expecting them to follow SPAB principles if they take on such buildings. In a recent issue of this useful list, which includes properties being sold by local councils, values ranged from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 4.5m. The Ancient Monuments Society (AMS) joined the fray in 1924 and is now another designated amenity society, seeking to look after anything man-made  -from megaliths to cinemas - and resisting unsuitable changes and unjustified demolition. It handles 5,000 cases a year and its newsletter is packed with helpful information. Bright Young Things started the Georgian Group in 1937 when 18th century London was vanishing; indeed, Nancy Mitford offered to chain herself naked to the railings of a terrace under threat. Now another designated amenity society, it has a young and dynamic leadership which, among other things, opposes golf courses that alter the countryside and its 18th century parks. It runs a lively programme of events in and outside London and abroad. The Victorian Society has been a force since it began in 1958 to try to save the Euston Arch in central London - the best symbol in the country of the railway age - and the Coal Exchange. Thanks to relentless campaigning (led, notably, by Sir John Betjeman, the late poet laureate) and now its casework as an amenity society, it has revolutionised attitudes to 19th and early 20th century buildings. Some of its events take place in the untouched late-Victorian house it administers at 18 Stafford Terrace, London W8 (open to the public), which belonged to Linley Sambourne, a cartoonist on Punch magazine. The Twentieth Century Society (TCS), founded as the Thirties' Society, takes the story from 1914 to the present. Aims, methods and programme are like the others (would you care for 'A Morning Walk in Wembley?') but it is not yet a statutory amenity society, although having plenty of casework. Its message that more modern buildings need to be protected from antipathetic adaptations by listing - the FT's old headquarters at Bracken House, near St Paul's cathedral, was one of the first of its era to get this accolade - is, slowly, being heard. Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, announced recently the listing of 95 educational buildings, from post-second world war schools in Hertfordshire to the University of Sussex. The TCS does not take sides when architects and critics joust over 20th century styles; only the quality matters. Save Britain's Heritage, four years older, is solely a campaigning organisation - and one prepared to fight the whole way, as it did (and lost) for the Mappin &amp; Webb site in the City of London. Successes include Billingsgate fish market in London and Calke Abbey (now with the National Trust). It does not arrange a programme and spends all contributions (not 'subscriptions') on the fight. Temples of Steam came out recently: a gazetteer of the pumping stations, water towers, engine houses and dams that are the heritage of the water industry. Friends of Friendless Churches shares subscriptions with the AMS. It is a small, valuable body that picks up casualties from the Church of England's re-organising of parishes, and works at being steward of Britain's huge inheritance of wonderful churches. The Friends now own several of them. The Garden History Society (GHS) began in 1965 to promote the study of gardens and conserve historic ones. It played an important part in preparing the English Heritage (EH) register of 1,200 historic parks and gardens. Its conservation officer says councils now consult the GHS, even though there is no statutory requirement yet for them to notify it or EH of garden applications. The smallest and youngest society (1985) is the Historic Farm Buildings Group, with a dedicated and knowledgeable membership of under 250 which campaigns for the buildings of UK farming history. Indeed, the officers of all the societies have these qualities, and welcome new members. The societies are charities and benefit from subscriptions paid by covenant and Gift Aid. ***** Addresses Ancient Monuments Society, St Ann's Vestry Hall, 2 Church Entry, London EC4V 5HB; shares membership and offices with the Friends of Friendless Churches.

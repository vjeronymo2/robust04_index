			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk agreed  here today to divide the disputed Black Sea Fleet, according to  the ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY.    Immediately after the one-day summit meeting of the  Commonwealth of Independent States held in Moscow on Friday [15  April], the two presidents signed an agreement on splitting the  fleet in a stage-by- stage way.    Under the accord, the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the  Ukrainian Navy, which is to get up 15-20 percent of the fleet's  ships, will be based separately.    It was specified that the details of the fleet division will  be elaborated in 10 days, the news agency said.    Moscow and Kiev have been involved in the dispute over the  fleet with over 380 warships since the disintegration of the  Soviet Union in December 1991.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Labour delights in display of wit and ridicule - Blair reaction The chancellor's speech was ridiculed by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, as a Budget designed to quell divisions on the Conservative benches rather than lay the groundwork for long-term economic recovery. Mr Blair delighted Labour MPs in his first Budget response as Opposition leader with a witty speech accusing the Tories of betraying election promises, stealing Labour policies and financial sleight of hand. It was a performance that appeared to discomfit cabinet ministers, especially when Mr Blair accused the chancellor of exaggerating his additional compensation package for the second stage of value added tax on domestic fuel. Mr Blair said that most of the VAT package had been announced last year or reflected the normal increase in pensioners' benefits to compensate for inflation. 'This will go down in history as the VAT-on-fuel Budget,' he said. 'They (the Tories) fought the last election on the specific pledge that they would not raise VAT. They have broken that promise and they will never be trusted on tax again.' As Labour MPs cheered, Mr Blair sought to increase Tory embarrassment over divisions on Europe and VAT: 'We will challenge all members of the party opposite - both parties opposite - to keep their promise to the electorate upon which they were elected. 'If they break that promise, then the country has been warned that the Conservative party put VAT on fuel and power when it promised it would not, and it cannot be trusted not to put VAT on food, on children's clothing, on books, on papers, if it is ever elected again.' Mr Blair ridiculed the chancellor's picture of a strong economic recovery as evidence that the government had become divorced from the reality of everyday life. He welcomed the chancellor's plans to cut tax avoidance and reduce employers' National Insurance payments for the long-term unemployed returning to the jobs market, which he claimed were policies pioneered by Labour. But he accused the chancellor of exaggerating the impact of his plans for the Community Action scheme. He said the plans amounted to an increase on last year's forecast, but a cut in the number of people benefiting from the scheme. Mr Blair provoked wry smiles on the Tory benches as he admitted that the economy was improving but noted that voters were not giving the government credit.</p>

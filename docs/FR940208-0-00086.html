			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Differences From the Draft Recovery Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat does not accomplish the same goals or have as dramatic an effect upon tortoise conservation as does a recovery plan because critical habitat does not apply a management prescription to designated areas. Because critical habitat designation is not a management plan, there was not a limitation on the size of the areas designated, although the designation is consistent with recommendations of the Draft Recovery Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Adjustments to Legally Described Boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations require that the Service define ``*&blank;*&blank;* by specific limits using reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps'' those areas designated as critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12 (c)). After selecting DWMAs as the starting point, the Service made several types of adjustments. To facilitate legal definition, CHU boundaries were adjusted to adjacent section lines, depending upon the amount and quality of habitat within the adjacent sections. The boundaries generally follow the 4,100-foot elevation contour line, except where excluding higher elevations would compromise reserve design principles. When adjacent to cities or towns, critical habitat boundaries were drawn on 1/2 or 1/4 section lines to remove as much unsuitable habitat as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to adjusting DWMA boundaries to meet the requirements to define critical habitat boundaries, the Service made other changes. Some CHUs represent more precisely described desert tortoise habitat within the DWMA boundary, and thus, encompass a much smaller area. For example, portions of DWMAs were not included in critical habitat if unsuitable habitat was identifiable on available maps and the exclusion would not affect the size or configuration recommendations made by the Draft Recovery Plan. Conversely, some critical habitat boundaries were expanded beyond DWMA boundaries to include additional habitat based on information made available to the Service during preparation of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing the above factors, the Service considered existing suitable habitat and desert tortoise populations that were not included in existing DWMAs and areas where additional protection should be considered to reduce the risk to recovery. When including other areas, the Service considered factors similar to those outlined in the Draft Recovery Plan on contiguity, shape, habitat quality, and spacing. Areas with minimal fragmentation were selected over areas with more extensive fragmentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The desert tortoise requires large, contiguous areas of habitat to meet its life requisites. Human activities have reduced much of the habitat in some areas to small, fragmented, and isolated areas that are not expected to support viable populations over time. In some cases, those areas were designated as critical habitat when they were needed to promote future development of large contiguous habitat areas in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Lands Outside of Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not all suitable desert tortoise habitat was included in critical habitat. The Service recognizes the importance of all lands, but did not incorporate all habitat within CHUs, primarily because most of these lands did not meet the designation criteria (i.e., were not associated with an area recommended in the Draft Recovery Plan, were too small to maintain a stable population of tortoises over time, or were already protected). This does not mean that lands outside of critical habitat do not play an important role in the tortoise's conservation. These lands are also important to providing nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow habitat for tortoises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Previously Protected Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current management policies of the Desert National Wildlife Range, Joshua Tree National Monument, and the Desert Tortoise Natural Area provide adequate protection against potential habitat-altering activities because they are primarily managed as natural ecosystems. The Service considered their relative contribution to the tortoise's conservation but did not include them in critical habitat because of their current classification. These lands are essential to the conservation of the species because they provide important links and contain large areas of contiguous habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By themselves, these previously protected areas are not large enough and do not contain sufficient population levels to support viable populations. They will be considered in developing recovery areas for the desert tortoise, in addition to surrounding public lands with desert tortoise habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Management Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's intent in designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise is to provide protection for habitat that contains constituent habitat elements in sufficient quantities and quality to maintain a stable population of desert tortoises throughout their range. The emphasis for future management will be on maintaining or developing habitat that has the characteristics of suitable tortoise habitat and to avoid or reduce the adverse effects of current management practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although critical habitat is not a management plan, the areas selected for inclusion play a role in maintaining a stable and well-distributed population of tortoises. Identification of these areas concluded the first step in the designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Summary of August 30 Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to consider the economic effects and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such areas as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic effects of designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise are the incremental impacts over and above those impacts that occurred as a result of implementation of management plans, such as Federal land management plans, habitat conservation plans that have already been implemented, and previous events, including the listing of the desert tortoise. The economic analysis considers the critical habitat impacts to be those incremental impacts that are expected as a result of the critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

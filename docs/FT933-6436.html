			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hambro Country back in black A PICK-UP in activity in the housing market restored the profitability of Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and financial services chain, which yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m for the half-year ended June 30, compared with an adjusted loss of Pounds 3.87m for the same period in 1992. The return to profitability was accompanied by the restoration of an interim dividend of 0.5p. The turnround in the company's fortunes was attributed to the improvement in the housing market, particularly in the first four months of the year, together with a higher market share by its estate agency chain and an improved contribution from Wright Oliphant and the Hambro Countrywide Relocation's asset management activities. The results included a gain of Pounds 11.4m from the sale of its remaining stake in Hambro Legal Protection to Hambro Insurance Service Group. At the end of June, the group had 452 estate agency office, which sold 23,263 houses in the first six months, a 17 per cent increase over last year. The average price of houses sold fell by 5.9 per cent to Pounds 61,750. The estate agency base financial consultants arranged 8,093 mortgages worth Pounds 364m and 9,458 life assurance policies. Hambro said it was keen to expand its network of estate agencies, which it believed could be profitable in its own right and an effective distribution channel for financial services. It said it expected the Treasury's recent decision about the disclose of commissions and other charges in the life assurance industry to be neutral on Hambro Guardian's competitive position. Earnings per share were 3.77p, compared to adjusted losses per share of 1.26p in 1992. The interim dividend compared with a total payment of 0.05p last year.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING IN STYLE;  </P> <P> THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST;  </P> <P> MALAYSIA AND BEYOND: INSTANT TROPICS. INSTANT POETRY. AND ALL THE CLICHES --  PALM-FRINGED BEACHES, SAPPHIRE SEAS, PLUS EXOTIC, EXCITING CITIES IN WHICH  YESTERDAY AND TODAY INTERMINGLE.  </P> <P> I should like to rise and go  </P> <P> Where the golden apples grow;  </P> <P> Where below another sky  </P> <P> Parrot islands anchored lie . . .  </P> <P>  -- Robert Louis Stevenson  </P> <P> THAT POEM OUT OF CHILDHOOD swirled into mind when I first saw Malaysia,  slipping down from the sky upon the island of Penang. Instant tropics; instant  poetry; all the cliches of palm-fringed beaches, sapphire seas, and the natives  are friendly: I fell in love.  </P> <P> There's something antic about Malaysia, from Sarawak and Sabah, the lands below  the wind on Borneo, to the northern tip of the peninsula in Perlis--a paradise  (in my mind), a land similar in size to New Mexico, nudging Thailand on the  north, looking across the Straits of Malacca and the Java Sea to Indonesia on  the south. The capital is Kuala Lampur; the people are mainly Malay, then  Chinese, then Indian. And this, I should add, has been declared Visit Malaysia  Year.  </P> <P> The real Malaysia is a kaleidoscope, shifting in color, in meaning. Now see the  fresh, almost 21st-century face of K.L., surely the most architecturally  stunning city in Asia. Sun, shadow: Ponder the green depths, the oldest jungles  on the planet, where lemurs still leap and gibbons chatter in the trees. Sip  gins-and-tonic at ye olde English E&amp;O Hotel in Georgetown, Penang; play  squash at the Hyatt Kuantan; feast on satay and nasi padang or hold your nose  and bite the odiferous, addictive durian.  </P> <P> Buy batiks or Selangor pewter or Kelantan silver. Watch Wayang Kulit, the  ancient shadow-puppet theater; shoot the rapids in a longboat on Sarawak's  Skrang River; hike to the summit of Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, loftiest peak in  Southeast Asia, and ogle the world's largest plant, the Rafflesia; slip down  through multi-hued, warm waters at Pulau Tioman.  </P> <P> But Malaysia is only one tile in the vast mosaic of Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> In Singapore: Visit the new-old Empress Place Museum; pray for the Raffles  Hotel to reopen soon; dine (eat, actually) at Banana Leaf Apollo and Newton  Circus carpark; dine at the Shang Palace at the Shangri-La; skip Tiger Balm  Gardens but not Jurong Bird Park; shop.  </P> <P> In Bangkok: Take an expansive dinner outdoors at Chit Pochana downtown and  lunch at the Oriental Hotel's more expensive version across the Chao Phrya  river after a visit to the legendary Jim Thompson's House (now a Museum). If  you can see only one temple complex, make it the Royal Palace at the Wat Phra  Keo.  </P> <P> In Manila: Don't miss the Bayanihan dinner show in the Maynila Room of the  Manila Hotel; visit Intreamuros, the beautifully-restored Spanish walled city;  shop for all your summer clothing at Tesoro's or one of its branches.  </P> <P> In Jakarta: Inspect the National Museum and then leave for Jogjakarta; have  nasi goreng for breakfast at the Ambarrukmo Palace; detour to Borobudur, the  largest, most amazing Buddhist temple in the world.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong: Take salmon and champagne in the lobby of the Peninsula;  breakfast in your room at the Regent; ride the new tram to Victoria Peak and  lunch at new Peak Restaurant. Then a ride on the Star Ferry sets a mood of  romance.  </P> <P> Wherever you wander, breathe in the magic that is Asia, which old hands insist  should include a journey by hydrofoil between Hong Kong and Macao -- that  ancient Portuguese enclave where intrigue is rife along busy streets and in  acient temples and fortunes are exchanged in casinos with a roll of the dice  and the spin of the roulette wheel, day and night.  </P></p>

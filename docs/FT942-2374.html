			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Company route to drug testing - Health Most employees assume that what they do in their own time, and to their own bodies, is their own business. But issues of safety and health can sometimes justify company intervention in personal activities. One such activity which may concern employers is drug use. In the UK, the idea of testing employees for substance abuse in the workplace is fairly new. But in the US, where drug testing has been common since the mid-1980s, some 30 to 40m drug (including alcohol) tests are performed annually in about 4,000 laboratories in the US. There, testing is not limited to industries where safety is the prime motivation for drug surveillance. In the financial sector, many companies test recruits and some will also test incumbent employees if they suspect them of abusing drugs or alcohol. In the UK, there is currently very little information about the extent of drug use in the workplace, nor has anyone proved a definite correlation between drug use and performance. But an increasing number of companies are not willing to take the risk, especially in safety-sensitive sectors like oil and transport. London Transport, for example, has been conducting pre-employment testing since December 1992 and has now introduced unannounced testing of staff in safety critical. 'The driving force for implementing testing was safety, but of course we are concerned about health,' says Dr Pat Diamond, director of London Transport medical service. The Faculty of Occupational Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians is due to publish a report this month* which provides guidelines for testing for substance abuse in the workplace. The report draws attention to the importance of setting up an accreditation system for laboratories, training medical officers and providing information for medical undergraduates and general practitioners. It also stresses the importance of knowing why a company wants to test for drugs in the first place. 'One of the problems is that a lot of companies feel it would be a good idea to have drug testing but have not identified their objectives sufficiently,' says Dr Diamond, who chaired the working party which compiled the report. 'But there is no point in going into this sort of business if you do not come up with the results you wanted in the first place.' A company may wish to test for a number of reasons besides public and employee safety. Other reasons include improving the health status of employees, raising performance standards, protecting financial information, public relations and corporate image or the attainment of a 'drug-free' workplace. Once a company decides to launch a drug testing programme, it must consider what can be quite heavy costs for lab analysis, setting up testing areas, lost working time, while employees await test results, and the added cost of conducting unannounced tests on working sites. 'I think it is very important not to rely on a drug testing programme to prevent drug abuse,' says Dr Diamond. 'I believe that drug abuse policy awareness, discussion and a counselling service are really far more constructive ways for preventing drug abuse than testing itself.' 'Guidelines on Testing for Drugs of Abuse in the Workplace' can be ordered from the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, 6 St Andrew's Place, Regents Park, London NW1 4LB, 071 487 3414</p>

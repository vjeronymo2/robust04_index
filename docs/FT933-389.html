			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Sears cautious despite rebound out of the red SEARS yesterday joined the growing band of retail groups apparently staging a recovery after over-expanding in the 1980s, as it transformed a Pounds 97.1m interim loss last year into a Pounds 38.9m profit. Last year's figure for the group, which includes Selfridges department store, the Wallis, Adams, and Olympus chains and the Freemans catalogue business, was depressed by a Pounds 84.3m exceptional loss on disposal of its men's wear division. There was also a Pounds 32.2m exceptional charge for restructuring British Shoe Corporation, the footwear division. This year's figure includes Pounds 7m exceptional profits on the sale of Sears' stake in Asprey, the upmarket jeweller, and a Pounds 5.5m loss on the closure of ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business. Stripping out all exceptionals, the trading profit from on-going businesses rose 26 per cent, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 37.6m for the six months to July 31. Group turnover in ongoing business rose 6 per cent overall, to Pounds 913.4m. But the shares closed down 3p at 115p after the company expressed caution about its prospects. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, repeated retailers' fears that tax increases in the November Budget could damage trading in the crucial Christmas period. 'We remain cautious about the balance of the year,' he said. 'There is some current evidence of modest economic improvement but it remains slow and erratic.' He added that the recovery at Sears was due more to its own efforts than to a pick-up in consumer spending. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, has taken the group out of men's wear and restructured British Shoe Corporation, reducing staff by more than 2,000 and closing unprofitable stores. Three of the group's four divisions increased trading profits, with British Shoe showing the biggest improvement, from a Pounds 2.5m loss before exceptionals to a Pounds 9m profit. Profits in the high street fashion division fell from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4.8m because of continuing losses at Richards. Earnings were 1.91p, from a 6.26p loss last year, but the interim dividend was held at 1p. Lex, Page 26</p>

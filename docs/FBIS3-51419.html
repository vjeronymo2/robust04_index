			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Reply" to the EZLN by Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexican </F> commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, on 18 January -- recorded]    [Text] To the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]  Command:    I received your communique. I reply to the points in your  message and at the same time I present to you the guidelines of  my actions to facilitate the process of peace and reconciliation.    1. The dynamics of war changes are such that had we not  acted without wasting a single hour in favor of peace, we would  have entered an irreversible process that would have had very  serious historical consequences for the Mexican people.  Precisely because I understand the difficulties in  communication, my replies have not been conditioned to your  replies. The unilateral cease-fire and the amnesty law bill  show the government's willingness to find a political solution.  I understand that the cease-fire from your side and your desire  to participate in dialogue are aimed at finding a political  solution. Citizens and political forces throughout the country  are demanding a political, humanitarian, socially oriented  solution that will guarantee peace and reconciliation.    2. I have made it clear publicly that Samuel Ruiz Garcia,  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, is undoubtedly a citizen,  who with his pastoral duties, has demonstrated his commitment to  peace. He is a trustworthy mediator, therefore, I reiterate  that, for this commissioner, the messages sent to us through him  are recognized as authentic.    Since the positions and the methods used are antagonistic  and  since we do not want to get involved in situations that could  increase our differences, we have been acting within a  negotiation strategy of messages of harmony, with facts, that  could facilitate the political solution of the conflict.  Following a study of the Chiapas situation, of the recognition  of the need for changes, after observing the serious  consequences of violence, and after considering the seriousness  of the violence if it continued, I have come to believe that the  search for peace requires three phases and a negotiation  environment:    1. The suspension of all attacks, the establishment of a  dialogue with the EZLN through reliable paths, that this  commissioner refer to you by your name, and seek to guide public  opinion toward the construction of peace, and through a dialogue  establish specific guarantees for you in the amnesty process.    2. That the unity of the residents of Chiapas facilitate  political unity, adherence to government action, immediate  changes in the application of justice, and serious social  response to the problems of the Indian communities.    3. Once conditions for pacification exist and political  changes for justice and social programs in Chiapas are under  way, Mexican society as a whole and national political forces --  without pressure of the armed struggle and through the political  and legal process -- can reflect upon what happened and agree on  policies and changes to improve the atmosphere of general  political coexistence. If instead of a negotiation in peace  followed by deeds in favor of Chiapas unity for security,  justice, and democracy, we would have waited or wished to  resolve a global agenda amidst violence, today violence would  continue with irreversible consequences for public liberties,  economic stability, and the possibility to carry out the changes  needed in Chiapas.    3. [Number as heard] Regarding your representativeness and  the treatment that would facilitate communications with you, as  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, I answer  this concern. Just as we have spoken about negotiation through  messages with deeds, this response is aimed at the basic point  of your proposal. In one communique, you requested recognition  as a belligerent army. In another communique, you proposed that  only Mexicans by birth participate in the mediation so that the  conflict can be resolved only by Mexicans. That is why, to  reconcile your political decision to obtain representativeness  and not have foreign interference in this conflict, and to  conduct the negotiation process within the framework of our law,  I have addressed you as the EZLN, respecting the denomination  that has given you identity.    4. Finally, you asked me what is my duty and my position.  My duty, as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas, is to create room for communication and negotiation to  solve the conflict by political means. I honestly report to the  Government of Mexico, society, and public so that an objective  and more practical communication, without subjectivity, can be  initiated. I am in touch with broad forces of society to gather  their feelings, and in my proposals, I include what I deem are  the basic positions of the Government of Mexico and sectors of  society, on which the economic and political stability of the  country rests.    Regarding the EZLN, I have done everything that is possible  to stop the war and open paths for peace. Although I am totally  opposed to your methods, I try to listen to your reasons and try  to open paths that offer security to all, and in due time,  possibilities for legal political participation for your  organization. Regarding my personal political position, I have  come to this land willing to seek a political solution to the  conflict. I did it when violence was on the rise; I did it  because I believe in the superior value of peace and the need  for reconciliation. Like Benito Juarez, I believe that the best  way to give vigor to the fatherland is by strengthening the  Republic with free citizens, democratic institutions, just  government, and adherence by all to the law.    Mexico and the world have listened to your reports of  abuses,  discrimination, injustice against Indians and peasants. There  has also been a general rejection against violence. All  political forces in the country are in favor of peace. On  behalf of all the families that want peace and reconciliation,  and aware of the complexity of the problem and solutions, I  honestly tell you that this is the appropriate time to reach the  best results. This is the moment to build a political solution.  Many things can be achieved with the mobilization of society in  favor of peace and justice. However, violence today would  adversely affect society and would further divide the peoples.    From San Cristobal de las Casas, 18 January 1994</p>

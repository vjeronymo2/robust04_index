			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: SIA searches for global 'open skies' policy - An airline concerned at the bilateral system of air agreements SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), one of the airline industry's big success stories of the past 10 years, competing with British Airways for the title of the world's most profitable carrier, has launched a campaign for a global 'open skies' policy to replace the existing regulatory system governing the international air transport industry. The airline is worried its long-term expansion could be undermined unless the current bilateral system of international air agreements is replaced by a more liberal, multilateral approach to regulations. The bilateral system dating back to the 1944 Chicago Convention has become 'the biggest single barrier to airline stability and profitability', Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, warned at two recent aviation conferences. The airline's campaign also coincides with a meeting in Montreal early next month of the International Civil Aviation Conference (ICAO), the air transport arm of the United Nations, to discuss changing the present bilateral system and moving gradually to a more collective, multilateral system reflecting the increasingly global nature of air transport. 'The present bilateral system is outdated,' Mr Michael Tan, SIA's deputy managing director, said in an interview in Singapore. 'The current system is used to protect carriers rather than stimulate growth.' But he conceded that changing the system would be a long process. 'What we are encouraging is that like-minded people and organisations can perhaps sign a mini agreement to act as a catalyst for future change,' he said. The issue is particularly important for SIA because the airline, lacking a domestic market base, has always had to compete internationally to grow. A dispute between the governments of Singapore and Canada over Ottawa's decision to scrap the bilateral air service agreement between the two countries and stop SIA's first transatlantic service to Toronto this summer has further highlighted the problem for the airline. The Canadian move is a vivid example of how governments protect weaker carriers to the detriment of consumers and the wider economy, according to Mr Tan. He now hopes both North American and European Commission proposals to negotiate future air agreements as blocs will help forge a more liberal, multilateral system. But he is also worried the new North American and European blocs could become protectionist. This would probably force Asian countries to consider forming a retaliatory bloc of their own. This would be as a last resort, added Mr Tan, who argued in favour of a system in which multilateral regulation would be intended only to ensure a 'level playing field' and open market access to all airlines. With more and more airlines forging international alliances including cross-border equity investments in other carriers, the structure of international aviation is rapidly changing and becoming global making the old system of bilateral air agreements increasingly irrelevant, according to SIA. The airline has been the first to establish what it calls a 'trilateral alliance' with 5 per cent cross equity investments with Delta in the US and Swissair in Europe. Although the three carriers continue to compete, they see their alliance as a partnership to improve efficiency and productivity and generate more revenue in the world market. SIA is also keen to acquire a minority stake in Qantas as part of the Australian carrier's privatisation. 'Australia is a very important market for SIA and Singapore is very important for Qantas as a hub and operational centre,' Mr Tan explained. 'There is a common desire to forge a link,' he added. SIA has no desire to manage Qantas but wants a seat on the Australian carrier's board. 'We are a conservative company. Taking over airlines is not our business,' Mr Tan emphasised. Mr Cheong recently told his staff that SIA's relationship with Qantas had been erratic in the past. 'One reason why we wish to own part of Qantas is to remove the kinks in our relationship, making it more predictable and conducive to planning,' he said. Like the rest of the airline industry, SIA has not escaped the slump caused by the Gulf conflict and the economic recession in several western markets. But it has fared better than most, with pre-tax profits 7 per cent lower at SDollars 634.5m (USDollars 380m) for the first half of its current financial year ending this month. 'The Gulf war and the recession were blessings in disguise because they reminded us of our mortality,' Mr Cheong told his staff at the beginning of this year. Unlike many of its international competitors, SIA decided not to cancel or defer any of its outstanding aircraft orders. 'We did not downsize the company; our mission is a long-term one and the airline has the strength to cope with ups and downs in between,' Mr Tan said. This confidence reflects the bullish outlook for the Asian-Pacific air travel market. 'A great part of our capacity is deployed in Asia and we see the market going up 8 to 10 per cent in the next three years,' Mr Tan said. SIA is developing new routes in the region and has just started flying again to Vietnam after a 17-year interruption. It is also about to start services to South Africa and to Madrid later this year. But the airline's longer-term growth ambitions are now facing two significant obstacles. The first is the increasing congestion developing at important airports in the Asian region as well as in Europe and the US. To cope with this problem, SIA is one of the airlines actively discussing with Boeing and Airbus the possibility of developing an ultra large 600 seater aircraft by the turn of the century. The second is the risk that instead of liberalising world air transport even further, the emerging new international trade and economic blocs will increase protectionism. Nothing could be worse for SIA.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Louse Fleischer: "Liberal Party To Be the Main </F> Enemy"]    [Text] The Social Democratic Party [SDP] during the  election campaign leading up to the European Parliament election  will define itself by hitting the Liberals. The Liberal Party  will be the main enemy in the campaign leading up to the  election set for 9 June.    The leading candidate for the SDP, Kirsten Jensen,  acknowledged following a news conference at Christiansborg  yesterday that it is the open strategy of the party to hit the  Liberals as much as possible during the campaign. "We will try  to confront the Liberals during the entire campaign. Because  they are most visible. We want to meet with Liberal figures and  debate with them at every opportunity we can arrange," said  Jensen.    During the election the SDP wants to sell itself under the  slogan "A human Europe."    "We will demonstrate that it makes a difference whether one  votes nonsocialist or SDP. Social democracy stands for defending  the national compromise [Edinburgh opt-out package]," said  Jensen.    "Some people are trying to make this into a third referendum  on Danish membership relations with the [European] Union, or a  referendum on the Western European Union. But this is  irrelevant," said the SDP member of the European Parliament.</p>

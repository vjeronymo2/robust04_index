			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Business travel spending 'set to rise' BUSINESS travel expenditure is expected to show a bigger rise in the UK this year than in any other European country except Hungary, American Express said yesterday. Its survey of 3,500 companies in 10 European countries found that UK business travel spending is expected to rise 9 per cent this year to Pounds 19.2bn. This follows declines of 2 per cent last year and 9 per cent in 1991. Expenditure in Hungary is predicted to grow by 14.3 per cent from a low base. Spanish spending will rise by 4.4 per cent. Travel spending is expected to fall 6 per cent in Germany, 4 per cent in France, 11 per cent in Sweden and 5 per cent in Switzerland, the survey says. The largest increases in UK expenditure are expected to occur in the energy and chemicals sector, manufacturing and retailing. Financial services and construction are expected to show the smallest rises, while travel expenditure will decline in the transport and communications sector. The UK has the highest proportion of women business travellers in Europe, accounting for 23 per cent of the total. The proportion has doubled since 1989. In financial services companies, 44 per cent of business travellers are women. Spain had the second highest proportion of women travellers at 17 per cent, followed by Switzerland at 14 per cent and Sweden at 12 per cent. Just 11 per cent of senior UK managers fly first class on long-haul flights, with 48 per cent travelling business class, 26 per cent economy and 15 per cent having no fixed policy. The proportion of first-class UK flyers is in line with the European average, but is below Spain, where 21 per cent fly first class, and Belgium on 19 per cent. UK and Pan-European reports.

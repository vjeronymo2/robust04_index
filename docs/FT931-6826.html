			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Singapore budget will cut taxes SINGAPORE'S budget for 1993, announced yesterday, proposes big fiscal changes, with a 3 point cut in corporation tax to 27 per cent and similar cuts in personal taxes, with the top rate reduced from 33 to 30 per cent. Dr Richard Hu, the finance minister, said the main thrust of the budget was to maintain Singapore's competitiveness as an investment location while encouraging Singaporeans to invest more in the region and develop an external 'second pillar' for the economy. 'Our challenge is to claim a bigger piece of that fast growing economic pie in the region,' said Dr Hu. The incentives include tax credits for overseas dividend income and tax exemptions for venture capital and regional investments funds. 'Individuals will be encouraged to take part in risky but highly profitable ventures, knowing that if they dare and succeed, government will not cream off a large share of their rewards,' said Dr Hu. Analysts said the government was clearly hoping that the tax cuts and a range of additional benefits would reduce public concern about rising living costs. Spending on medical and education schemes to benefit the poor is to be substantially increased. The government plans to introduce incentives to widen share ownership in the run-up to the partial privatisation of the telecommunications utility later this year. Singaporeans are also given a 5 per cent income tax rebate for 1993. Dr Hu said a recently announced 3 per cent goods and services tax will only partially make up for the drop in revenues resulting from the budget's tax cuts and incentives package in the short to medium term. Analysts say the budget reflects Singapore's confidence in its fiscal position. Since 1987 Singapore has been running a budget surplus. 1993 revenues are estimated at SDollars 17.2bn (Pounds 7.3bn) while expenditure is budgeted at SDollars 15.5bn. Singapore's economy grew by 5.8 per cent last year. Up to 7 per cent growth is expected this year.</p>

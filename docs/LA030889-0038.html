			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT ON THE INS  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has decided to replace the controversial Alan  C. Nelson as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But  just finding a replacement for Nelson will not solve all the problems the Bush  Administration inherits in INS.  </P> <P> The Times' Washington Bureau reported this week that Nelson, a California  attorney, will be replaced in spite of his campaign to retain the job to which  he was appointed by Ronald Reagan. Nelson is an old friend of former U.S. Atty.  Gen. Edwin Meese III, and his close ties with Meese helped Nelson through  several scrapes during his seven years at INS. But a recent audit by the  General Accounting Office, which found evidence of mismanagement at INS, has  given Thornburgh the ammunition he needs to oust Nelson.  </P> <P> In fairness, the INS commissioner's job has proven to be a difficult task for  everyone who has held it since the 1970s, when the first of a series of GAO and  congressional studies found management problems in the agency. These problems  resulted from the fact that Congress had not paid much attention to INS since  World War II, leaving the agency chronically understaffed and underfunded. Now,  it is notorious as the most inefficient agency in the federal bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Congress has been trying to make up for its neglect of INS, most recently  voting to hire more Border Patrol agents under the Immigration Reform and  Control Act of 1986. But this belated attention has had only minimal effect on  the INS, because it comes at a time when political turmoil and population  growth in many parts of the world have created a surge of immigration to this  nation, which is overwhelming INS all over again.  </P> <P> Some see this wave of new immigrants as a threat, but we prefer to see it as a  challenge to American ingenuity. How can these newcomers, whether permanent or  temporary, be dealt with humanely? When Congress passed the immigration reform  act of 1986, it took a step in the right direction, but it forget to reform the  agency charged with carrying out the new law.  </P> <P> It's not that there were no proposals to reform INS. Several GAO studies have  suggested the government could more efficiently guard the nation's frontiers if  the Border Patrol were part of a single border-management agency that would  also include other federal agencies, like the Customs Service and Coast Guard,  that currently share the burden and do not always coordinate their activities  well.  </P> <P> And demographers predict that, because of declining natural birth rates in this  country, half of the nation's population growth in the next century will occur  as the result of new immigration. That should have prodded Congress to upgrade  INS' naturalization functions, perhaps putting them into a new bureau of  immigration, so that the government could better help newcomers adapt to  American society. INS is doing that, somewhat haphazardly, under the amnesty  program included in the 1986 immigration law. But if immigration is going to  have the impact on U.S. society demographers think it will have, a more formal  system must be created to deal with its effects.  </P> <P> These long-range issues must not be overlooked by the Bush Administration as it  seeks a new INS commissioner. The right kind of leader for that beleaguered  agency will not just deal with the problems it has today, but prepare INS for  the profound challenges of the future.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in five installments by reporter Im Chae-chong: "A </F> Yalu River Spring: North Korean Change Seen from Dandong, China"]  <H5>  [8 May 94 pp 1-2] </H5>   [Text] [Boxed item: If one goes to Dandong, China, Sinuiju  looks close. The railway bridge linking Dandong and Sinuiju is  shorter than the Han River Bridge. However, it cannot be crossed  freely, and so feels much longer. The impressions of the two  cities seen from the Yalu River are more dissimilar. The Dandong  side overflows with the vitality of openness; the Sinuiju side  is desolate. However, it could be sensed that on the Sinuiju  side too, a soft spring breeze is secretly blowing. This article  will be published in five installments, showing the North Korean  [NK] situation as perceived from Dandong and a view of the life  of Koreans living there.]    Going to Dandong, China's gateway to NK facing Sinuiju  across  the Yalu River, one can sense here and there NK's internal  changes and troubles.    First of all, going to the Dandong Maritime Customs, one can  see the "bundled procession of openness" entering NK. Every day  at about 10 AM and 3 PM, this place bustles with bundle-carrying  peddlers trying to get on the border bus going to Sinuiju from  Dandong.    The enormous gunny sacks on which they sit contain various  daily necessities, from garments, tobacco, alcohol, spices, and  pastries to shoes, umbrellas, glasses, fountain pens, and color  film. There are even those carrying black-and-white televisions.  In the "Choson Store," located beside the maritime customs  office which deals with the peddlers, are displayed Lotte gum,  Kent cigarettes, and even Coca-Cola.    The number of people coming and going by the border bus  between Dandong and Sinuiju alone are estimated to exceed 50  thousand annually. Designated by China in 1992 as a border  economic-cooperation zone, Dandong is China's greatest  border-trade city, and is ambitiously promoting development. The  peddlers are messengers carrying the winds of openness to NK in  their bundles. On the Yalu Railway Bridge, crossing by cargo  trucks is quite frequent. On the trucks coming out of NK were  loaded scrap iron and marine products; on trucks entering NK  from China, black-and-white televisions, machinery, etc. Cargo  trucks too were transporting the winds of openness. One owner (a  Korean) of a restaurant on the banks of the Yalu, with NK truck  drivers as regular customers, said that if they are alone, they  often relax, singing Korean songs. "There are even North Koreans  who ask: wouldn't things get better than they are now if Korea  were unified, even by shooting a gun," conveyed another owner of  a Korean restaurant frequented by North Koreans.    Being adjacent to NK, Dandong sees much coming and going by  North Koreans. There are those who come out, issued a passport  ostensibly for the purpose of visiting relatives, and there are  those who, simply issued a river-crossing pass, come across the  river for only a little while. Of these, there are those who do  not return even though their authorized period expires.    One young NK woman (22) working in a Dandong karaoke bar  confessed that, leaving NK with a three-month passport for  visiting relatives last February, she has remained until now  without returning. This young woman, who claims to have  graduated from a combined middle and high school in Pyongyang,  added, "Returning has now become difficult because of fines."    In Dandong there are two karaoke establishments directly  managed by NK. The place called Pyongyang Kwan is managed by the  Taedong River Trade Corporation; the place called Pyongyang  Yongnamsanjang, by the Potong River Trade Corporation. Young  women sent from Pyongyang work there. These are places where one  can really feel the signs of change in NK.    Pyongyang Yongnamsanjang also plays South Korean [SK] songs,  but Pyongyang Kwan only plays modern NK and Chinese songs.  Pyongyang Kwan too reportedly plans to play SK songs soon. Of  course, this is for drawing SK customers, who have been actively  advancing into Dandong of late. When South Koreans stop by this  place, young Pyongyang women give them bouquets of flowers,  singing in chorus the NK song, "Welcome, Compatriots  [Pangapsumnida Tongpo Yorobun]."    "For NK, opening sooner or later will become unavoidable due  to gradual internal change," said one Korean resident of China  (35, a trade company employee) claiming to have visited NK on  business over ten times. "Although not visible to the eye, when  it reaches a fixed limit, internal change will gain a power  which cannot be turned back."  <H5>  [9 May 94 pp 1-2] </H5>   [Excerpts] Spring ripens in May, even on the Yalu River.  From the early morning, Dandong's Yalu River Park bustles with  people coming out to enjoy their fill of the refreshing spring  breeze blowing down from distant Paektu Mountain. [passage  omitted]    Across the river, the scene in Sinuiju is different. In an  amusement park situated directly across from the Yalu River  Park, there is hardly a sign of anyone and the amusement-park  machinery is motionless. They are said to have been operated  only once: a little while ago for NK's greatest holiday, Kim  Il-song's birthday. Next to the amusement park is a restaurant,  the Amnokkanggak. Compared to its large scale, customers are  almost nonexistent, making it look wretched.    The nighttime scene is even more contrasting. From the  Dandong-side river bank, with its newly-created city sections,  overflows the noisy excitement of a port city experiencing an  openness boom. The Sinuiju-side river bank, however, is hidden  by the darkness of night. Only the light of a passenger ship  going north on a tributary of the Yalu River makes one realize  that Sinuiju too is a port city.    The uniquely NK sound of a bellicose woman's voice flowing  out of a loudspeaker late into the night gives one a feeling of  brutality. Unable to make out what was being said, we asked a  Dandong official. He said the residents of Sinuiju appeared to  be holding nighttime emergency training. This year, resident  emergency training had increased markedly, he said.    There being no border on the Yalu (Chinese-NK common  ownership), one can get on a boat and go right up to the bank on  the Sinuiju side. If one speaks to the people visible on the  river bank, they motion for one to go back without so much as an  answer. When one views both sides of the Yalu River from a boat,  in a glance one can see the development of an open China and the  backwardness of a closed NK.    The Dandong-side river bank is cleanly decorated with modern  buildings, and vehicles frequently go back and forth. On the  Sinuiju-side river bank, there are many structures built during  the Japanese occupation, and no smoke coming from factory  smokestacks. The explanation of our ethnic Korean guide, that  previously Sinuiju had been a much more prosperous city than  Dandong, deepened our frustration.    The midpoint of the Yalu River Railroad Bridge, the great  artery of traffic between China and NK, is the frontier. With  the help of a Dandong official, we were able to go right up to  the border, guided by a Chinese guard. [passage omitted]    This bridge, about 960 m in length, has a railway on one  side  and a road on the other. Although traffic by cargo trains and  trucks was comparatively frequent, passenger cars were rare. The  passenger train between Beijing and Pyongyang makes about four  round trips a week, explained the Chinese guard.    South of this bridge is another bridge broken by the aerial  bombing of U.S. forces during the Korean war. Only the half on  the Chinese side remains. Repair and refurbishing of this place  is now in full swing for developing it into a tourist resort.  They are painting it again and are building restaurants and  souvenir shops on one side of the bridge, taking aim at SK  tourists.    Many South Koreans who lost their homes in the North come to  visit Dandong. They hope to possibly hear news of family they  left behind in NK, since North Koreans frequently come and go  here. Many NK-SK separated families get in contact with each  other and meet in Dandong, reports Deputy Mayor of Dandong Wang  Jun-lian (female). City officials appear to be unofficially  working on behalf of separated families, helping them to get in  contact and meet.    Going north along the Yalu River from Dandong, a little over  two hours by car, one reaches Supung Dam. On the road to Supung  Dam, we saw NK soldiers catching fish with baskets in a  tributary of the Yalu. When we tried to start a conversation,  saying, "We're from South Korea," they packed up their baskets  and disappeared without replying.    Going to the upper reaches of the Yalu River, there is a NK  island across what is now a stream no more than two-to-three  meters wide. Therefore, smuggling is reportedly rampant.  Although there are also escapees from NK, they immediately go  into hiding in Shenyang and other places in the interior. So  they say it is not clear from here how many there are.    Arriving at the shore of Lake Supung, we got on a boat. As  we  came close to the dam, two NK soldiers got in a boat and came  out to observe us. After awhile, apparently concluding that  nothing was wrong, the NK soldiers even waved toward our boat.  The spring flowers near Supung Dam were in full bloom.  <H5>  [10 May 94 p 5] </H5>   [Excerpts] Located on a street called Luidaogou in the  outskirts of Dandong, the Pyongyang Kwan is both karaoke hall  and Korean restaurant. It was opened in January 1993, under the  direct management of Pyongyang's Taedong River Public Service  Corporation, Limited (normally called the Taedong River Trade  Corporation). The first floor is used as a restaurant and the  second floor as a karaoke bar, but when a "special customer"  comes, he is treated to dinner in a separate room on the second  floor.    The atmosphere of the karaoke bar is not much different from  one in SK. People sing and dance to the music in front of a  large screen beneath brilliant Saiki lights. [passage omitted]    Together with the NK songs and music, the background screens  all show scenes of NK landscapes and events. Since Japanese  subtitles come on with the words of the songs, it appears a  Japanese company was commissioned to manufacture [the programs].  With almost every song, bathing or half-naked young women  appear, adopting sensuous poses.    Disco Time [as published] is also interspersed throughout.  Then, noisy pop songs blare. At this time only, the young  Pyongyang women move their bodies to the "enemy Yankee" music.  There are seven young women in their early twenties, Pyongyang  graduates of combined middle and high schools and above, who  were sent to the Pyongyang Kwan when it opened last year.    They all have well-featured faces and conduct themselves in  a  refined manner. Unlike their soft exterior, ideologically they  are rock solid. [passage omitted]    Asking one young woman, "How can you do something like  karaoke in NK?" she answered openly, "We came to earn dollars."  We also asked, "Do you know who the late Pastor Mun Ik-hwan or  Miss Im Su-kyong are?" she answered, "I know a lot about them."  However, when we asked if she knew of the KAL bombing criminal  Kim Hyon-hui, she said, "I don't know of her."    The young women sing and dance with customers. However, they  do not join with them in drinking, nor do they accept tips.  Their personal lives too seem to be quite strictly controlled.  They are said to live together in a dormitory next to the  Pyongyang Kwan and work on ideological study at every  opportunity under the supervision of a woman in her forties sent  from Pyongyang. The women's work periods are in one-year units.  When a year goes by, they must receive reeducation in Pyongyang  before coming back out. This year too, from January through  March, the Pyongyang Kwan was closed for business because of the  women receiving education. It reopened on April 1st. It is said  that there are also women who are unable to return to this place  after entering Pyongyang. This fact too is probably one of the  things controlling the women's behavior.    Up through the end of last year, the Pyongyang Kwan also  played SK songs, but they are prohibited this year. One woman  hinted, "It is planned to play SK songs again if the atmosphere  improves." In light of this, it appears the recent unbending NK  mood resulting from the nuclear issue reaches even this place.  "This year the Pyongyang Karaoke halls in Beijing and other  places were all closed," the woman said.    The main customers of this place are employees of NK trade  corporations, who require entertainment for business, and SK  tourists. Although not as clearly seen as the many SK tourists,  the young women's interest in SK is high. "The women frequently  ask in secret that I get them SK women's magazines," reports one  member of a SK trading firm who generally has his meals here  while in Dandong.    There is another combined karaoke hall and Korean restaurant  in Dandong, directly managed by Pyongyang's Potong River Trade  Corporation. Located in downtown Dandong, the Pyongyang  Yongnamsanjang has a competitive relationship with the Pyongyang  Kwan. Although last year there were more customers here than at  the Pyongyang Kwan, the women sent from Pyongyang were called  back at the beginning of this year. During their absence, the  place is said to be dead. This may be the reason they will still  play SK songs if requested.    The Pyongyang women who were here last year were so  beautiful  that stories were circulating about them. They seem to have  caused some problem, say Korean residents of Dandong. Of the  three women here now, one is from Yonbyon. The two others are  from Pyongyang, but they left NK on passports for visiting  relatives and got work here.  <H5>  [11 May 94 p 5] </H5>   [Text]The area around the double road of 1 ma-ro and 2  ma-ro, located some two hundred meters away from the Dandong  Maritime Customs), is a place similar to SK's Namdaemun Market.  Over 20 businesses with signs reading, "Choson Store," are  crowded together. Most are clothing stores, with an occasional  general store. This place provides articles to NK peddlers.  Around it here and there are located "Choson Restaurants."    There are also a few Korean stores in the vicinity of the  maritime customs office. Most of the people running the Korean  stores are Hwagyo [ethnic Chinese residents of Korea]. Being  Chinese who used to live in NK, many have family still there.    Going to the Korean stores in the evening, one sees people  putting clothing and various daily necessities into enormous  gunny sacks. They are preparing articles to hand over to the  peddlers who will arrive the next day. These Korean stores bring  articles directly from factories in Shenyang and Dalian, and  hand them over to the peddlers.    The articles handled by the Korean stores are very cheap.  This is because if they are not cheap, they do not sell well in  NK. A popular item is clothing of the lowest grade, which sells  for 10-20 Chinese yuan (about 1-2 thousand won [W]). As for  tobacco, the brand "Hongzuima [Hongjoma in Korean]," the  cheapest in China at 4 jue (about W40), is stored and sold in  heaps. The Korean stores doing business with peddlers are also  used by North Koreans as secret contact points. We were looking  at a Korean store near the maritime customs office when a couple  in their forties wearing Kim Il-song badges approached us and  asked, "Are you South Korean?" Then, showing us a picture and  letter from Kwangju, South Cholla Province, they asked, "This is  a relative. Please find and contact him for us."    This couple, claiming to live in Sinuiju, added that they  had  come to Dandong on several occasions and asked around, but had  been unable to make contact. When in the middle of talking a man  in his thirties arrived on a NK truck and entered the store, the  couple hastily took back the letter and picture and disappeared.    The peddlers make a good profit taking cheap goods into NK.  Cloth going for 10-20 Chinese yuan sells for W300-400 in NK  money; tobacco going for four jue in Chinese money sells for W10  in NK money. The official exchange rate is 0.7 NK won to one  Chinese yuan. In actuality, however, one Chinese yuan goes for  10 NK won. Given this fact, the peddlers are making more than  double their costs in profits.    However, since NK money is rather useless, they return to  Dandong having bought gold dust, marine products, etc. These  peddlers are said to make over 1 thousand Chinese yuan each time  they make such a trip between Dandong and NK. When compared to  the approximately 300-yuan monthly pay of the average Chinese  workers, it can be seen that this is a well-paying trade.    Just because they are mere peddlers does not mean that  anyone  can do it. This is because not just anybody can go in and out of  closed NK. Mr. Hwang (60), a Korean living in Dandong with  experience as a peddler, said, "It is only possible if you have  strong backing in NK or pay bribes." Of course, one's class  background must be good.    When I took a picture in front of the maritime customs  office  where peddlers were gathered, a woman who appeared to be in her  forties shouted, "Isn't this a SK spy?" Afterwards, many people  started talking: "If you're going to take a picture, take one of  a good place. Why take one here?"; "Go get a city permit." Some  robust young men in their twenties even came up and pushed aside  my camera.    This year, going back and forth between Dandong and Sinuiju  has become more difficult. Even last year, one could get a  river-crossing pass on demand. This year, however,  river-crossing passes were restricted to one per year. NK is  rumored to have requested this of China. One Korean living in  Dandong, familiar with NK circumstances, thinks such measures  are only temporary.    They believe if only the nuclear issue is concluded, NK will  be the first to hasten opening. They conclude that the Kim  Chong-il succession will be in danger if Kim Il-song does not  achieve openness in his lifetime. Rumors are even circulating  among Korean residents here that Kim Chong-il recently stopped  by Sinuiju and, gazing at the Dandong side, give instructions to  "make Sinuiju more developed than Dandong." With the restriction  on river-crossing passes, counterfeit river-crossing passes are  rampant.    Peddlers are strictly controlled when they enter Sinuiju. If  they want to go to another area, they must be issued another  pass and they must not tell people what they have seen and heard  in China. Even so, the spring breeze of openness goes hidden in  their bundles.  <H5>  [12 May 94 p 6] </H5>   [Text] Dandong is the Chinese city closest to NK's  Pyongyang. There is even clear reception of NK television  broadcasts. It is not very interesting due to the daily-repeated  litany of the idolization of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, but  Korean residents longing to hear the language of their home  frequently turn the channel to it in the evening. There are more  than a few among the Koreans here who say, "Honestly,  emotionally I still feel closer to the NK side."    Compared with Yonbyon and other places, the SK wind started  blowing late in the Dandong Korean community; it appears this  was not unrelated to "psychological distance." Although late in  arriving, the SK wind in the Korean community here has special  significance: it can have a more direct influence on NK. Change  in the Korean community here is more distinct among the younger  generation. Having even graduated from college in Beijing, Ms.  Yu (30, female), a second generation Korean, is part of the  elite, but up until two years ago, she could speak almost no  Korean. Her marriage too was with a Chinese man. However,  feeling a need to learn Korean while working at a trade company,  she can now sufficiently understand and make herself understood  in Korean. Yu's Chinese husband became an agent for a SK  businessman, a result of her being Korean.    Ethnic Korean students crowding into "Korean schools" is a  similar phenomenon. It is said that up until several years ago,  many ethnic students attended Chinese schools beginning with  elementary school, believing that if they were going to live in  China, they would have to learn Chinese. Things have changed.  Parents now teach their children Korean beginning in the home  when they are young.    In the Dandong area, there are 12 elementary schools and  five  middle schools. In the city of Dandong, there is only one Korean  school. In the Dandong Municipal Korean School, preschool,  elementary, and middle school classes are all in one building.  There are 290 students, including 120 in high school. The  reason there are so many high school students is that this is  the only Korean high school and all the students crowd into it.    "Only two years ago, there weren't even half the students  there are now. But the number of students rapidly increased  after SK and China established diplomatic relations," said  school principle Ho Hyong-haeng (56). "In two to three years,  the total number of students will increase to 700 or 800." Even  now, however, they are so short of classrooms that they have to  use a double-shift school system, and extremely insufficient  finances are worrisome, he said.    The Korean preschool groundbreaking ceremony held April 27th  on an open lot at an apartment complex on the bank of the Yalu  River was a festive occasion for Dandong Koreans. Preschool  students in rainbow-stripped clothes sang children's songs in  rhythm and acted cute. Elderly women dressed in traditional  clothing sang folk songs, merrily dancing the shoulder dance.  Many officials of the municipal government as well as leading  figures in the Korean community participated. Dandong television  and newspapers also covered and reported the day's event.    The construction of this preschool was originally pursued by  leading figures in the Korean community to resolve the Dandong  Municipal Korean School's classroom shortage. Last year they  were provided by the municipal authorities with a 240-pyong  [approximately 948.96 sq. yds.] plot as a building site. They  were unable to begin construction, however, because they could  not provide for construction expenses. Hearing of their  difficult circumstances, the Hanguk Sonmyonghoe gave them $50  thousand in support as part of its "Bread of Love" project.  Thus, they came to hold this day's groundbreaking ceremony.    "It is frustrating that even though we give the "bread of  love" to hungry children in distant Africa, we are unable to  give it to hungry children in nearby NK. Hearing that they were  trying to build a Korean preschool in Dandong, which is adjacent  to NK, we gave them construction-cost support, hoping the arms  of love could be extended to the children of NK as well,"  explained Songmyonghoe president Yi Yun-ku.    After completing the groundbreaking ceremony, Yi and Kim  Hye-ja, a television personality accompanying him, visited the  Dandong Municipal Korean School. Only NK cartoon books were  on the preschool bookshelves. When they asked the reason the  preschoolers wore red neckties, the [teachers] readily replied,  "To carry on the spirit of their revolutionary elders." The  influence of NK was felt everywhere.    It was the same with the older, high school juniors. When  told, "If you are curious about something concerning SK, just  ask," one student asked, "Is there freedom in SK?" However, when  Yi's party left the school, this student ran out to them.  "Actually, I've been to SK with my father, " he revealed,  excusing his previous behavior, "I was just confused a while  ago."    "Korean youth are experiencing inner conflict. Even though  they know they have nothing more for which to hope from NK,  emotionally they are still uncomfortable with SK. Given these  emotional considerations, investment in their education is  needed. Korean youth could become an important medium in the  unification of the Fatherland," said a Korean who had been their  guide.</p>

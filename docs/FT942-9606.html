			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Ericsson leads Stockholm An upsurge in Ericsson stocks and an appetite for commodity-based cyclicals featured in Nordic bourses yesterday. In Stockholm, the telecommunications major rose SKr30, or 9 per cent, to SKr366. Mr Michael Thompson of James Capel said that the broker had put out a buy recommendation on Ericsson at the end of last week, after the stock had underperformed the market by 35 per cent since last October. Ericsson was the main influence yesterday as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 30.10, or 2 per cent, to 1,535.20, although Volvo B rose SKr16 to a new record close of SKr748, and Trelleborg put on SKr5 at SKr120 on the climb in metal prices. Stockholm's turnover was a strong SKr3.3bn. Other bourses were entertaining, but less active. Firmer North Sea oil prices helped Oslo rise 1.6 per cent, the all-share index closing 10.17 firmer at 649.69. Norsk Hydro, which plans to invest about NKr8bn a year from 1994 to 1996, closed NKr5.5 better at NKr253.5. Helsinki rose 1.5 per cent with forestry and metals stocks in the van.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / After the accident: Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of Matra Hachette, talks to David Buchan and David White On the face of it, Jean-Luc Lagardere has shown amazing powers of recovery. In the 1980s he managed to steer a bumpy path as chairman of two French groups with illustrious names but very little else in common: Matra, thrusting missile, electronics and transport equipment manufacturer, and Hachette, venerable and far-flung publishing empire. Mr Lagardere stayed in the driving seat as Matra was part nationalised and then denationalised. His enthusiasm for adventurous new business always raised eyebrows. Some of his initiatives, such as a foray into watchmaking, misfired. But those flops were nothing compared with what was in store in the early 1990s, 'the big accident', as Mr Lagardere calls it - Hachette's investment in the La Cinq television station, which folded last year, leaving the publishing group with an exposure of FFr3.5bn (Pounds 440m). He has since succeeded in recapitalising Hachette, merging the two groups, still under his chairmanship, into Matra Hachette, and recasting the holding company, which is the combined group's main shareholder, in a way that makes his own position virtually unassailable. Mr Lagardere is still the dashing entrepreneur with the permanent tan, starry-eyed about new technology. He is an outsider to France's mainstream political and business establishment, drawn from more elitist grandes ecoles than the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite where he graduated as an engineer. Matra, a postwar creation, has always been a parvenu on the French industrial scene. But Mr Lagardere is now 64. It is 30 years since he joined Matra as managing director. He talks of younger generations of managers, of the 'apres moi'. Above all, he is chastened by the past year's experience. He has promised no more long-shot ventures. 'I am not going to make 20-year investments. You have to have your return sooner.' He confesses that for the first time in his life he is giving top priority to profit. Flanked by a high-powered 'group executive and strategic committee', he is trying to rebuild his credibility in a financial world of which he is deeply suspicious. He confidently predicts a tripling of Matra Hachette's net profit by 1996, from last year's FFr350m to FFr1bn - although that would still be less than 2 per cent of sales. By then, he says, if it makes no more big acquisitions, it will wipe out its debts of FFr3bn. The merger will bring 'big reductions' in administrative staff in the group, which employs around 50,000. But, Mr Lagardere adds: 'That is not something one boasts about.' To argue the logic of an industrial grouping ranging from airborne missiles to Elle magazine is something of an intellectual challenge. Defensively, Mr Lagardere cites the example of General Electric of the US, with its NBC television network. The activities of Matra and Hachette converge in the field of electronic media, a target for future investment. Both sides of the group serve a wide range of overseas markets. And people will take a company more seriously when it can show, as Matra Hachette does, annual sales of Dollars 10bn. For Mr Lagardere's critics this is sophistry, an attempt to portray the merger as something other than a rescue, a way of drawing on Matra's cashflow to ease Hachette's debt burden. The merger prevented the need for a fire sale; it enabled Mr Lagardere, as the French say, to save the furniture. Despite the television fiasco, he says he would have been in a position last year to sell control of Hachette for seven or eight times the price he paid when he took it over in 1980. But Mr Lagardere is far too attached to his role as media mogul for that. What the two sides of the group have in common are famous names. Its media interests range from Woman's Day magazine in the US to the Europe 1 radio station. Matra has always had prestige products, ranging from the Mistral, France's answer to the US Stinger portable missile, to automated metro systems. For a time Matra also had a football club, Matra Racing de Paris, and in the 1960s and 1970s played a prominent part in Formula 1 racing, which Mr Lagardere says brought it 'a fantastic image'. It was in television that Mr Lagardere finally overreached himself. In 1987 he lost to the Bouygues group in bidding to take over the TF1 station. The new channel, auctioned in 1990, was his last chance. 'La Cinq was an absolute booby-trap for us. The snare closed on me completely,' Mr Lagardere says. He has no plans to return to television. 'In my life I have made every kind of mistake. I never made the same mistake twice.' He wants to build on current activities where the group already holds a leadership position - including the Espace family vehicle which Matra makes for Renault. It has pooled its space activities with GEC-Marconi's and is looking for a European partnership in missiles. Arms, Matra's original business, may in a couple of years be overtaken in importance by urban rail systems, Mr Lagardere says. His attachment to the idea of Matra Hachette's 'nine professions' - missiles, space, cars, urban transport, telecommunications, books, newspapers, distribution and broadcasting - typifies what Anglo-Saxons often find a mystifyingly Latin approach. He bridles at the word conglomerate. He speaks of 'the culture of the enterprise', of 'development' rather than 'growth'. The man who 'more or less created' Matra has stamped his name on the holding company, now called Lagardere Groupe. His own shareholding in this company is only about 15 per cent. About another 30 per cent belongs to personal and business associates. But under the unusual structure of a limited equity partnership - societe en commandite par actions - other shareholders delegate powers to him as general partner, appointed for six years. In return, Mr Lagardere assumes unlimited liability if things go wrong. He has put his money where his mouth is. Mr Lagardere talks of making the business 'unsinkable'. He does not want it to die with him. 'I would like my group to stay around for a long time.' Something he shares with his friend Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, apart from their joint space venture and their personal interest in racehorses, is having a son in his senior management team. What function the 31-year-old Mr Arnaud Lagardere will assume is still open, the chairman says, but 'his role will be to guarantee the continuity of control of the group'. Mr Lagardere pere envisages stepping down. But not, he says, quite yet.</p>

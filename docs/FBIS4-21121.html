Soldiers of the Kotiv Border Control Squad  prevented an attempted contraband of 10 tonnes of diesel fuel to  Moldova, and at [words indistinct] Border Troops soldiers  detained a truck with 20 tonnes of coal which Moldovan citizens  attempted to transport to Moldova. Attempts to smuggle firearms  and drugs through our borders also continue. For example, a  Nagan gun and ammunition for it were found with a Kazakhstani  citizen, and in Sumy Oblast, while searching the Kiev-Moscow  train, Border Troops soldiers uncovered almost 3 kg of heroin.  All the cases are currently under investigation.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL REPORTEDLY TO SEEK 35% RAISE, END TO HONORARIUMS  </P> <P> A bipartisan House task force has decided to recommend a pay increase of up to  35% over the next two years, coupled with a phase-out of speech honorariums,  and it will present the tentative plan to Democratic and Republican leaders  this week, informed sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The pay plan, which would contain a new provision for continuing cost-of-living  increases in the years ahead, would be coupled with a tightening of some House  rules regarding financial disclosure, gifts and travel as well as a reduction  in the amount of outside earned income that members may keep.  </P> <P> Most of the recommendations call for adjustments rather than wholesale changes  of House policies that have drawn fire from many self-styled reformers. But the  task force is expected to recommend basic and possibly far-reaching changes in  the House Ethics Committee, splitting the committee into two separate panels,  one that would function as a grand jury to bring charges and the other to judge  the charges.  </P> <P> Any final plan would be up to House leaders of both parties, who are described  as pessimistic that any plan can be sold to the public.  </P> <P> The task force was formed earlier this year after a presidential panel  recommended that House and Senate members be given a 51% increase in their  $89,500 annual pay. Groups around the country, led by radio talk shows, many  newspapers and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, protested and forced defeat of  the proposal.  </P> <P> Sources said the task force has decided to recommend a 10% increase in 1990 to  make up for several years in which Congress has not allowed itself to take a  cost-of-living increase. Then, in 1991, after the next congressional elections,  Congress would be given a 25% increase, followed by regular cost-of-living  raises.  </P> <P> Speech honorariums would be phased out over two years. But under a new formula,  members would be able to keep up to 15% of outside income other than  honorariums.  </P></p>

The Palestinian delegation includes Ahmad Quray', alias  Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO Economic Department; Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser; Sa'id Kamal, the  Palestinian ambassador in Cairo; and Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Fatah's  representative in Cairo.    The Israeli delegation includes Yuri Savir, director general  of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser  at the Foreign Ministry.    Palestinian sources close to the meeting have stated that  the  talks, which have just started, might postpone the work of the  Security and Civilian Affairs Committees due to be held in Taba;  they could even replace them.    The Israeli delegation is carrying Yitzhaq Rabin's reply to  the Palestinian paper that Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa carried to  Israel on resolving differences regarding the implementation of  the self-government agreement in Gaza and Jericho.    The talks are likely to continue tomorrow, probably until  Thursday [27 January]. Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is  following the talks, which are being held in a hotel in the  Heliopolis suburb, a few meters from his residence at the  al-Andalus Palace.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Iran scraps visas for free zones Iran has scrapped visa requirements for foreigners visiting its free-trade zones, according to a senior official, Reuter reports from Tehran. Mr Morteza Alviri, head of the high council of free zones, said that under newly-approved regulations foreigners could stay in the three zones without visas for up to two weeks. They would need police permission to stay longer or to travel to the rest of the country, Mr Alviri added. His comments were reported by Hamshahri newspaper. The zones - Kish island in the Gulf, Qeshm island in the Hormuz Strait and Chahbahar on the Gulf of Oman - were set up in 1989 to promote foreign investment, export-oriented industries and trade. Critics in parliament opposed easing of entry regulations for the zones, saying it would create security problems along the country's main sea routes.</p>

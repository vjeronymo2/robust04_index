			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GE to Quit Nuclear Trigger Plant: General Electric Co. confirmed that it plans  to give up its $6.9-million-a-year management contract at a Florida plant that  makes triggers for nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> GE said it found unacceptable Department of Energy changes in an agreement that  call for contractors that run government plants to assume responsibility for  environmental liability at the facilities. In the past, the government has  borne such responsibilities. The DOE, which oversees the contract at the  Pinellas plant in Largo, said the estimated 1,600 employees at the plant likely  will continue to work there for the new operator. GE will quit the facility by  May 31, 1992.  </P></p>

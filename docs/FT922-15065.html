			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Appointments: Moves at Volvo in UK The new head of Volvo's import concession in the UK is Charles Hunter-Pease, currently deputy chief executive of Volvo Concessionaires, part of motor distributor Lex Service. Lex heard last month that Volvo Car Corporation was terminating its contract to distribute cars in the UK, the Swedes' largest market after the home base, four years early to set up its own distribution operation. Hunter-Pease, who is 45 and has been at the company for more than 18 years, takes himself and the 490 staff of Volvo Concessionaires to Volvo. The Swedish head office has yet to disclose what the new UK entity will be called as the current transfer of the business is not yet completed. Stephen Dixon, chief executive of the concession enterprise for the past two years and a Lex employee since 1972, will retire early at the beginning of next year at the age of 54. After helping to effect the transfer of the business to Volvo, he will serve out the rest of his time in a position, yet to be announced, at Lex. ***** Robert Lawson is appointed group chief executive of ELECTROCOMPONENTS following the transfer to him of executive responsibility which allows the chairman, Sir Keith Bright, to become part-time. ***** BICC Cables has appointed Enrico Bertagna, md of Ceat Cavi Industrie, and Angel Rodriguez Garcia, president of Grupo Espanol General Cable, as directors. ***** Graham Anderson, previously group finance director of International Colour Management, is appointed group finance director of BLUEBIRD TOYS.

He is to be succeeded as chairman by Don Ford, chairman of TWIL. Gordon Sambrook, a past director of British Steel, has retired from UES, and is succeeded by Philip Hampton, md finance of British Steel. ***** Daniel Reilly is appointed finance director and company secretary of CAMDEN MOTORS, a Barclays Bank subsidiary. Having spent nearly 12 years with Vauxhall, Reilly is returning to the motor industry from being finance director of Alexon and Eastex brands. ***** Norman Becker is promoted to divisional director of HITACHI domestic appliances on the resignation of Ian Radley. ***** Eddie Cran is promoted to chief executive of CATTLE'S HOLDINGS; Roy Waudby relinquishes that role but remains chairman. ***** Richard Baker is appointed company secretary of REED INTERNATIONAL on the resignation of Michael Bridge.</p>

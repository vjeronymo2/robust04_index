			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Chess: Short's last-ditch stand NIGEL SHORT'S stubborn resistance against Gary Kasparov at London's Savoy Theatre is approaching its long since inevitable end. Short has improved his score from a derisory 2-7 after nine games to a very respectable 6-11 after 17 but, with only seven games left, Kasparov is likely to claim The Times's winner's purse of Pounds 1.06m some time next week. In its wider aspects, the match leaves a mixed impression, confounding both optimists and pessimists. Short lost three of the first four games and sacked his coach, while Savoy seat prices plummeted from an average of Pounds 80 to Pounds 20. But then, theatre audiences stabilised at 400-700 daily, Channel 4 and BBC2 reported impressive viewing figures, and sales of chess books, sets and computers doubled. The match has sparked a far greater interest among the uncommitted, non-chess playing public than any previous event in the UK. The Times, with overall costs estimated at Pounds 3m-Pounds 5m, paid too much for an event which failed in terms of sporting tension. But, for a future sponsor - perhaps considering a more realistic prize fund for a 1998 challenge by Britain's No 2, Michael Adams, who has just reached the world top 10 at the age of 21 - there is every encouragement. The action will now switch to the rival world championship in Jakarta where Anatoly Karpov of Russia, leading 7-5, resumes tomorrow against Jan Timman of the Netherlands after an adjournment caused by the sudden withdrawal of Oman and a Pounds 900,000 prize fund, followed by a frantic search for a new sponsor. The Indonesian match is organised by the long-established International Chess Federation (FIDE), the 149 affiliated federations of which are confronted by the Kasparov-Short breakaway Professional Chess Association (PCA). The war is still in its early stages, and promises to be bitter. FIDE is committed to a SFr1m (Pounds 400,000) minimum prize fund. If that is not forthcoming, Karpov and Timman will sue. If it is provided from capital reserves, FIDE will be stretched financially - particularly since its funds include a SFr500,000 deposit from Intermark, a Californian group which attempted to raise funds for a 1993 title match but failed because of the Los Angeles riots. Intermark is now asking for its money back, alleging that its contract was only for a match involving Kasparov. FIDE hopes that Bob Hassan, the Indonesian CF president and a lumber millionaire who is close politically to Indonesia's President Suharto, will sponsor the Jakarta prize fund. If so, the FIDE-PCA war is likely to continue with two separate world champions, until at least 1995 when both organisations stage their next title matches. Meanwhile, the grandmasters, TV pundits, organisers and writers at the Savoy are planning their post-match moves. The immediate aftermath will include two instant books of the games, one by Raymond Keene of The Times (for Batsford) and the other by Daniel King of Channel 4 and Donald Trelford for Cadogan, both announced at Pounds 7.99. But the best revelations are likely to come from Dominic Lawson's Macmillan book, planned for December, aimed at the general reader and written by an insider in the Short camp.

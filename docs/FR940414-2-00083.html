NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Clinton Power Station Technical Specifications utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening Criteria Application and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting, renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed mitigation of accident or transient events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria to the Clinton Power Station TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively controlled documents. Changes made to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are also subject to 10 CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS. These proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

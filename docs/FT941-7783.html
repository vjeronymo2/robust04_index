			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Wall of liquidity drains into a statistical maze Strong growth in the supply of money quickly drives up asset prices and eventually fuels economic expansion. This is a basic cyclical theory and explains why the stock market tends to be a lead indicator of the underlying economy. But real life is rarely that simple. Even the Bundesbank is wavering in its interpretation of monetary growth. The annual German M3 growth rate of 8.1 per cent, it says, has been temporarily boosted by factors such as the tax-based repatriation of funds from Luxembourg. So D-Mark interest rates are coming down even though monetary growth is well above the 6.5 per cent ceiling of the target range. But excessive monetary growth is at present almost uniquely a German problem. Around the world the monetary aggregates are not at all buoyant. Broad money growth for the G10 countries, for instance, was running at about 3 per cent last year. There is a clash here with all those loosely-worded stories about the 'wall of liquidity' which has been driving up bond and equity markets. Why doesn't it show up in the statistics? One obvious problem is that the monetarists juggle with a whole row of Ms, some narrowly defined so that they reflect only the level of everyday transactions in the shops, others wide enough to include assets which can count in some circumstances as long-term savings. In the mid-1980s the British government struggled to restrain double-digit growth in broad money but discovered that raising interest rates only served to fuel the problem. Moderately high interest rates tend to encourage the growth of the banking system. In the end the British Treasury got bored and frustrated and decided to focus on other monetary targets instead, like the exchange rate, with equal lack of success. More recently the US Federal Reserve embarked on a radical policy of very low interest rates, from which it has only just begun to retreat (with a further interest rate warning from the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan yesterday). Far from boosting monetary growth, the 3 per cent interest caused a deceleration of the broader aggregates as investors fled deposits. Low interest rates can cause the banking system to shrink, as activity shifts to the securities markets. However, the narrowest definitions of money have been growing quite fast, sometimes at more than 10 per cent year-on-year - although growth has slowed recently. One of Britain's leading monetarists, Tim Congdon, continues to believe that steady growth of broad money - defined as 'assets that can be used to make payments' - is essential to economic stability. In his latest Gerrard &amp; National Monthly Economic Review he says this can be done if sales of government debt are actively juggled to supplement the impact of short-term interest rate changes. Last year, for instance, the British government should have underfunded its deficit in order to increase the growth rate of broad money. Yet he is pleased by the very recent acceleration of M4 and thinks that the impact of easier money will overwhelm the negative effect of imminent tax increases. Internationally, however, such an analysis does not seem very helpful. The US economy is growing quite strongly even though broad money has contracted in real terms over several years, while the German economy is in deep recession even though M3 is overshooting there. The trouble is, money can move across borders and change its form; central bankers may set a money target, but the public can have a different idea of the money it wants to hold. If the Federal Reserve pumps liquidity into the money market and holds interest rates down to 3 per cent, the impact may not be primarily seen in the US. It may cause disappointment amongst international dollar bulls. It may be felt in faraway countries where locals are eagerly selling assets to bargain-hunting US mutual funds. Last year the stock market rose by 7 per cent in the US but by 121 per cent in Hong Kong. Incidentally, inflation is just under 3 per cent in the US but 24 per cent in China. Of course, if these alternative assets, whether US Treasury bonds or emerging market equities, suddenly look dangerous, ordinary money might not seem so unattractive after all.</p>

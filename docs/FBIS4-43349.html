Official sources said later that Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi voiced "very deep concern" over the threat,  urging a greater European commitment to the search for a  negotiated solution.    Both Muslim countries, Turkey and Albania are concerned for  the future of the Bosnian Muslims. Sources said Turkey, at  least, looks kindly on proposals now emerging for a Bosnian  truce next month, new proposals for the geographical division of  the disputed ex-Yugoslav territory, and heavier sanctions  against those who reject them.    The talks with Serreqi covered the whole arc of southern  Balkan Europe in which the Bosnian war has come to be seen as a  decisive threat.    One issue is Kossovo, the Serbian enclave where the ethnic  majority is Albanian; another, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia], whose recognition Greece is loth to  grant because of its fears of future territorial claims; and a  third, the Greek and Albanian ethnic minorities whose presence  in the two countries has led to a sharp rise in tensions  recently.    Speaking for one of a number of states on the edge of the  Balkans, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec urged that the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] of which  Italy holds the duty presidency should be given a peacekeeping  capability.    Zieleniec asked Martino to move in that direction before the  CSCE summit planned in Prague in December. Martino said he  agrees to giving the organisation more agile and effective  mechanisms.    The talks also covered bilateral ties.    Turkey's Ciller urged moves to right the trade balance, and  Serreqi described Albania's moves towards a market economy,  Martino offering words of encouragement.</p>

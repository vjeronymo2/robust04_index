			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as concern about economy grows Wall Street INVESTORS continued to sell US stocks yesterday as concern about the outlook for the economy deepened and share prices fell for the fifth consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.40 at 3,398.37, the first time the index has been below 3,400 in two weeks. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 3.50 lower at 433.53, while the Nasdaq composite fell 12.54, or almost 2 per cent, to 645.87 after a heavy loss in Intel. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 283m shares. Weakness in overseas stock markets, and early declines in US bond prices (which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30- year government bond back up through 6.8 per cent) set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading. Sentiment was already depressed by the previous week's losses, which have raised the spectre of a possible substantial correction in share prices. The day's economic news was also on the gloomy side, with the National Association of Realtors reporting that existing home sales fell 2.9 per cent last month. Although the data were undoubtedly affected by the severe winter storms during March, the recent string of weaker economic figures has begun to disturb investors. In spite of the unpromising background, prices opened higher, with the Dow posting a double-digit gain in the first hour of trading. The markets were unable to hold on to those gains and the afternoon was spent firmly entrenched in negative territory. Bank shares took a beating as more investors decided to switch out of the sector, which has had an extremely good run this year. Some analysts have warned recently that bank stocks may have reached their near-term highs. Citicorp slipped Dollars 2 to Dollars 25 3/4 , Chemical Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 7/8 , BankAmerica Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 , Banc One Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 30 1/8 . Although IBM performed well, improving Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 , other leading technology issues encountered heavy selling pressure. Compaq receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 , Motorola shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 1/8 and Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 70 3/4 . Norsk Hydro was one of the market's busiest stocks, advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 in volume of 12m shares after the company announced a 133 per cent jump in first-quarter net profits. On the Nasdaq market, Intel dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 87 3/8 in volume of 11m shares on concern that Motorola will undercut Intel's prices with a new computer chip it is developing. Canada TORONTO share prices ended flat in heavy turnover as Canadian markets awaited the federal government's budget, introduced in the House of Commons shortly after the stock exchange close. The TSE 300 index was off just 1.6 at 3,683.8, while rises narrowly outscored declines by 376 to 351 after volume of 81.7m shares valued at CDollars 756.6m. The gold shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, up 2.1 per cent, as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 6.20 an ounce.</p>

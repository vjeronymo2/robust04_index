			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURNING THE VOLUME DOWN;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD NERVOUS OVER POSSIBLE EUROPEAN TV QUOTAS  </P> <P> When Italian television entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi was scouring Hollywood  in the late 1970s in search of programs, he was neither free-spending nor  discriminating. Had he been either, he certainly wouldn't have purchased that  legendary piece of Reaganalia, "Death Valley Days," for $500 a half-hour.  </P> <P> But Berlusconi's shopping spree laid the groundwork for a generation of  broadcasters struggling to fill the huge demand for programs created by the  introduction of commercial television in Europe. By the mid-1980s, one of  Berlusconi's competitors was reportedly paying $70,000 an episode for the  Italian rights to "Dynasty."  </P> <P> Today, sales of movies and television programs to European TV channels are  worth more than $800 million annually, according to market researchers Frost  &amp; Sullivan, a fivefold increase since 1980. In an era of network cost  cutting, these sales represent a key source of revenue for the major Hollywood  studios and independent producers alike.  </P> <P> But some fear that this bonanza is about to end. As part of an effort to  achieve full economic unity by 1992, the 12-nation European Community is  considering a law that would impose quotas on American programming. And even if  the proposal is ultimately defeated, U.S. companies will have to move  aggressively to maintain their position in a rapidly changing market. The  challenge of competing overseas was repeatedly cited as a key factor driving  Time's acquisition of Warner Communications.  </P> <P> Limits on U.S. programming in Europe are nothing new, but the prospect of  European-wide quotas has jolted Hollywood lobbyists into action. "A blanket  restriction that lies across 12 countries, that's a frightening prospect," said  Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Assn. of America and leader of the  anti-quota fight. "And with the single market, we don't know if this is just  the floor. We're in uncharted territory."  </P> <P> The studios, striking at a time of hypersensitivity on trade issues, have  received a sympathetic hearing from U.S. government officials. U.S. Trade  Representative Carla A. Hills told Congress in June that the United States has  registered "very sharp and strong objections to local content in broadcasting"  and that it was prepared to retaliate if the quota proposal were passed. The  House telecommunications and finance subcommittee will look at the issue in  hearings scheduled for this week.  </P> <P> Television industry lobbyists have also been stalking Europe, buttonholing  friendly broadcasters and hostile politicians. Although their efforts have not  always been appreciated -- they apparently raised some hackles at the European  Parliament in June with a high-pressure presence that was resented as too loud  and too late -- they may have had some impact. The European Community's Council  of Ministers failed to agree last month on even a watered-down version of the  so-called "Television Without Borders" program, which seeks to establish  European standards on a variety of broadcasting issues.  </P> <P> The defeated draft demanded that broadcasters show a "majority" of Community  programming "where practical." A new vote on the matter, or possibly a decision  to split the program into several components for separate votes, is expected in  September.  </P> <P> Most U.S. television executives assert that France is behind the quota drive,  and they conjure dark images of a socialist conspiracy. "The people making  these decisions are essentially bureaucrats and politicians influenced by  left-leaning journalists and film makers," declared Michael Jay Solomon,  president of Warner Bros. International Television. "The French government is  anti-commercial television, and they're trying to inflict their opinions on the  rest of Europe."  </P> <P> In fact, Spain -- which fears an influx of Latin American programs -- Italy,  and several smaller states also favor restrictions. They claim that because  Hollywood benefits from such huge economies of scale, the only way to support  home-grown production -- and by extension, European culture -- is to impose  restrictions. And that case is given further weight when new commercial  channels roll out lineups featuring daily doses of "Kojak," "Get Smart," "Green  Acres" and "Mr. Ed."  </P> <P> Even without an EC quota, Hollywood's battle to maintain its European market  share won't be over. That's because national quotas will remain in place,  European audiences will continue to become more discriminating and local  producers will become stronger. And much of the easy money in recent years has  been generated by bidding wars that won't be repeated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> French Revenues Down  </P> <P> "When competition comes to a particular market, the tendency is to overbuy,"  noted Solomon. "Everyone is trying to make deals and paying high prices, but  after a while they've had enough."  </P> <P> Revenues from the French market, he said, are down 50% this year following last  year's frenzied auctions. Solomon attributes a significant chunk of that  drop-off to local programming requirements contained in the licenses of French  broadcasters.  </P> <P> While quotas may not ultimately affect the amount of American television on  European screens, they depress prices by dividing the market into local and  imported segments. Colin Davis, president of MCA Television International,  noted that "if a show is made in Germany, it will be worth more than a U.S.  show, because it will qualify as (local) production."  </P> <P> For that reason, one of the key Hollywood responses to the quota threat will be  to produce more programs overseas, a strategy that fits neatly with a desire to  tap lower-cost locations. "In preparation for the 1990s, we need to be global  producers," said Mel Harris, president of Paramount Television Group. "We need  to have more than one primary market. We are going to attempt to do a  television series in the United Kingdom and on the Continent, and we will be  attempting this within the next year."  </P> <P> David Evans, head of Qintex America and president-designate of United Artists,  said the company plans to set up at least one production base in Europe, and  possibly two -- one for television and one for movies. "Series production, by  and large, will still be in the U.S., but long-form programming (TV movies and  miniseries) will be finding their way to locations outside the U.S.," Evans  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effects on Small Firms  </P> <P> Still, the major studios have not been as aggressive as some expected in  establishing a European presence. "It's a surprise that you don't see more  American production companies investing in Europe," said Alastair Tempest,  secretary general of the European Advertising Tripartite, a Brussels trade  group. He cited the example of Studio Roma, a prestigious Madrid production  house that was purchased by Berlusconi rather than by an American company.  </P> <P> Frank Agrama, president of independent producer and distributor Harmony Gold  (and Berlusconi's buyer in Hollywood), is deeply pessimistic about how current  trends in Europe will affect smaller production companies. "If there are  quotas, who gets in? The majors -- and it's killing the small producers," said  Agrama. The large studios, he added, can use big-time films as the "locomotive"  for television sales by packaging them with serials.  </P> <P> Harmony Gold has been active as international co-producers, but Agrama said  this was out of necessity, not choice. He cited the example of a current  miniseries co-production called "The Confessional," in which Harmony gave up  artistic control to British co-producer Grenada and retained only distribution  rights because the show had to qualify under British quotas.  </P> <P> "The more they need the quota rights, the more you have to give up," Agrama  said, adding that his company would have produced the movie alone if possible.  </P> <P> European producers, meanwhile, are benefiting from an infusion of government  funds and are likely to be more formidable competitors in the future. But with  the soaring number of channels, there should be room for all. Spain and West  Germany are thought to be the next boom markets, and pay television may play an  important role.  </P> <P> Programs with at least the imprimatur of Hollywood, in short, will continue to  sell in huge volumes in Europe. But the good old "Death Valley Days" are likely  gone forever.  </P> <P> PROGRAM EXPORTS  </P> <P> Estimated exports of U.S. TV programs in millions of dollars.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1992*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> W.

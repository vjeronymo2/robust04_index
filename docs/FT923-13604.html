			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Rabin names Peres as foreign minister: 'Dove' to seek Mideast talks breakthrough MR YITZHAK RABIN yesterday appointed Mr Shimon Peres, a former premier and long-time political 'dove', as foreign minister in the new Israeli Labour-led coalition, which seeks an early breakthrough in Middle East peace negotiations. The new government, with Mr Rabin as premier, is due to be officially endorsed at a session of the Knesset this afternoon, following Labour's June 23 general election victory. Labour, with its commitment to territorial compromise, replaces the hardline Likud party, which has been in government for 15 years. Years of often bitter personal rivalry did not prevent Mr Rabin from offering the post of foreign minister to the highly experienced Mr Peres, whom he ousted as Labour leader earlier this year. Mr Peres's approach to the peace talks is much less cautious than that of Mr Rabin. But the new prime minister, who will also be defence minister, is to keep direct control over pivotal negotiations with the Palestinians on an interim agreement on self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Peres will have responsibility for the parallel multilateral talks with Arab countries. Mr Rabin appointed as finance minister Mr Avraham Shochat, a Labour stalwart and former chairman of the Knesset finance committee, who in recent weeks stressed Labour's switch from traditional socialist economic policies to market reforms. Labour gave three lower-scale ministries to Meretz, the alliance of pro-peace parties that is its main coalition partner, and one to Shas, the ultra-orthodox religious party which is the third partner. Together with support from two Arab parties, the coalition is assured of a comfortable majority. But Mr Rabin is still hoping to bring in a second religious party and Tsomet, a right-wing group. Mr Rabin's immediate priorities are to mend relations with the US, to accelerate the peace talks, and to stimulate economic growth to combat record unemployment, bloated by mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. He says he hopes to travel to the US by early August to see President George Bush. Peace talks, which Mr Rabin wants to move into continuous session, are likely to resume in Rome by early September. Mr Rabin is anxious to secure Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees to aid immigrant absorption, withheld by Washington because Likud refused to freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr William Harrop, US ambassador in Israel, said on Friday he hoped the new government's policies would make the release of at least some guarantees possible. But the issue is by no means resolved. Mr Rabin has so far been careful not to promise a complete settlement freeze, though he favours a freeze over what he calls 'political' settlements. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, yesterday warned the US not to ease the conditions it originally attached to the guarantees. Mr Rabin regards the guarantees as a vital to revitalising the economy. But Mr Harrop cautioned the new government not to regard them as a panacea, saying it must push ahead urgently with liberalisation of the still state-dominated economy.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / India to probe car bombs A SPECIAL team has been set up by the Indian government, involving the Home Office and official investigative agencies, to investigate the car bombs outside the Youth Congress (I) office in Delhi's high security zone which killed eight people and injured at least 40 others on Saturday. The police said yesterday that initial investigations have revealed the involvement of Punjab terrorist groups. Mr Maninderjit Singh Bitta, the Youth Congress (I) president, whom police suspect was the target of the attack, escaped with minor injuries. Mr Bitta's car was leaving the gate of his office when two powerful bombs went off. Meanwhile, the four main leaders of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party are campaigning nationally against government plans to legislate a separation of religion and politics ahead of elections in four states. Bharom Singh Shekhawat, sacked former chief minister of Rajasthan, is pictured waving during a rally in Jammu over the weekend.</p>

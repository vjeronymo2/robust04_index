			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World markets fall sharply: Fears of further rise in US rates - FT-SE 100 closes below 3,000 World bond and stock markets took a hammering yesterday as concern about inflation and the direction of interest rates in the US and Germany continued to upset investors. Sentiment in Europe and Asia was depressed by falls in the US bond and stock markets on Friday, which were prompted by a rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index and in gold and oil prices. Those signs of inflationary pressure, allied to a weak dollar, increased fears that the US Federal Reserve might be forced to induce a further increase in interest rates. The dollar turned in a weak performance overall again yesterday, finishing lower over the day in New York at DM1.5995, more than 2 pfennigs off its US close on Friday. In London, it had lost more than a pfennig on yesterday's opening to finish at DM1.5986, bringing to more than 3 pfennigs its fall since the Friday close in London. It moved similarly against the Japanese currency, finishing at Y101.85 in New York, after losing Y1.5 to Y101.97 in London. Analysts said that no single factor was responsible for yesterday's bond and equity declines. 'It's like Chinese water torture,' said Mr Edmond Warner, head of strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson. 'A drip, drip of poor sentiment has accumulated to wear down the markets.' Asian stock markets set the tone for the day with the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo falling 351.27 points to 21,152.03, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 115.78 points to 8,998.18. In Europe, the German stock market suffered most with the DAX index plunging 81.9 points, or nearly 4 per cent, to close at 1,968.82. In Milan, shares fell by 3.9 per cent. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, postponed its L1,500bn (Pounds 620m) rights issue after its share price fell by nearly 5 per cent. The pan-European Eurotrack 100 index closed 41.97 points lower at 1,308.37, a fall of 3.1 per cent. In London, the FT-SE 100 fell 85.3 points to 2,937.6 at the day's low but partially recovered to close at 2,971.1, down 51.8. Wall Street also opened lower and by the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.88 at 3,741.90. Despite a rally in the afternoon, European bond markets also suffered with UK, German and French bonds all falling by more than three-quarters of a point. Yesterday's declines in stock and bond markets come towards the end of a half-year which has seen little but bad news for holders of paper assets. US economic strength, allied to signs of recovery in Europe, have turned investors' attention towards physical assets such as copper. With commodity prices on the rise recently, bond markets have been hit by inflation fears and by worries about the supply of bond issues from governments and the private sector. Equity markets, which had risen alongside bonds in 1993, have fallen with them in 1994. Yesterday, US commodity prices showed a sharp decline, but Treasury bonds failed to rally amid the dollar's continued weakness. Many investors entered 1994 in optimistic mood about the prospect for lower interest rates around the world. But first the Federal Reserve prompted a rise in US interest rates in February and then the mood changed about the likely direction of German rates. Signs of economic recovery and still high money supply growth means that many analysts now think German interest rates have reached a low, causing investors to favour the D-Mark over the dollar.

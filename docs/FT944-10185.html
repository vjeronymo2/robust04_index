			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: SIA moves ticket data unit to China Singapore Airlines (SIA) is to move part of its accounting operation to China to cut costs and circumvent labour shortages in Singapore. SIA said the state owned accounting centre of China aviation would process SIA ticket data, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. 'Given the shortage of labour in Singapore, this will lessen the problem of recruitment and also result in cost savings for SIA,' the airline said. SIA is in the process of moving other back room operations to India and other low-cost centres. It has also taken a stake in an aircraft maintenance facility being built in China. SIA is concerned that growing labour and associated costs at home plus the continuing strength of the Singapore dollar are threatening the airline's competitiveness. Last month SIA reported a 20 per cent rise in group operating profits of SDollars 478m (Dollars 322m) for the half year to September.</p>

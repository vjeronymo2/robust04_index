			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Japan's trade negotiators face a tough new year: Tokyo is braced for more US market pressure The office buildings in Tokyo's central business district have lowered their shutters for the new year holidays, but Japan's trade negotiators are unlikely to be in festive mood as they welcome the advent of 1994. They face a series of sessions with US trade officials throughout January in the run-up to a summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa scheduled for February 11. But as the summit approaches, Japan's relationship with the US, its most important trading partner, is showing signs of renewed strain. Earlier this week, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, voiced unhappiness over market figures which showed that foreign semiconductor makers' share of the Japanese market had declined this year. The numbers raised 'serious concerns regarding Japan's commitment to fully implement the Semiconductor Arrangement', Mr Kantor said, calling for an emergency bilateral meeting in January to discuss the issue. The semiconductor accord calls for Japan to improve its market share of foreign semiconductors to an average of 20 per cent over the four quarters of 1993, at a minimum, Mr Kantor said. Mr Kantor's remarks were echoed by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, who expressed concern over the fall in foreign market share and further blamed Japan for the lack of progress in the bilateral framework trade and economic negotiations. 'There are, perhaps, a number of internal reasons in Japan relating to their own political situation, but that does not in any way diminish the need from the standpoint of the US for us to see solid progress' in reducing the bilateral trade imbalance, Mr Christopher said. The sharp US statements follow a letter Mr Kantor sent in mid-December to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese financial daily, saying that Japan's trade barriers and its current account surplus reduced opportunities for jobs and manufacturing not only in the US but in Japan and the rest of the world as well. Such pressure on Japan suggests growing impatience in the US over the lack of progress in bilateral trade negotiations agreed between the two governments this summer. When President Clinton and Mr Hosokawa meet in February, the two sides are scheduled to report what has been achieved so far in the agreed areas of negotiation, particularly in efforts to increase market access and sales of foreign goods and services in Japan. However, as both US and Japanese officials admit, there is still a considerable gap between the kinds of measures the US wants Japan to adopt to increase foreign market access, and those which Tokyo is willing to accept. In particular, Japanese trade officials have steadfastly refused to accept any quantitative targets which could be construed as a commitment by the government to ensure a certain level of sales or market share by foreign companies. As the two sides remain deadlocked, US officials may be hoping that by increasing the heat on Japan, they will be able to pressure Japanese officials into a last-minute compromise. While accepting Mr Kantor's request for an emergency meeting on semiconductors, Japanese officials express dismay at the aggressive approach being adopted by the US. 'The more the US dwells on the 20 per cent market share figure, the more there is the feeling in Japan that no matter what they call it, numerical targets take on a life of their own,' one official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. Under the agreement, Japan recognised the US expectation that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market would reach 20 per cent by the end of 1992. The US has, however, come to consider the 20 per cent figure a commitment by the Japanese government. While a successful outcome of the framework talks is clearly high on the US agenda, the Japanese government remains consumed by difficulties it has encountered in getting political reform approved and with stimulating the domestic economy. Furthermore, there is no guarantee Mr Hosokawa will still be leading the government by the time he is scheduled to meet Mr Clinton.</p>

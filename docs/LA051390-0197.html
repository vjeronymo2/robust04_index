			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A ROLL-CALL OF GANG VICTIMS: 1990'S DEADLY NIGHTS OF WARFARE  </P> <P> At least seventeen young men have died at the hands of Orange County gang  members this year. The oldest was 31, the youngest 15.  </P> <P> Some were gang members slain by rivals. Others were bystanders when gangs ran  amok. Police say gang members tend to travel armed, don't always aim well and  are profligate with their bullets.  </P> <P> Among the innocent slain this spring was a convenience store customer who  accused two gang members of shoplifting. They shot him point blank in the face.  A dishwasher was slain when the restaurant where he worked was held up by  suspected gang members.  </P> <P> Some of the homicides sparked community outrage and Page 1 stories; these  tended to be about young victims who had family and friends to mourn and bury  them. But it took only three paragraphs to note the passing of Jesus Perez, a  21-year-old illegal immigrant gunned down in Santa Ana on a Friday night in  what has by now become just an ordinary drive-by shooting.  </P> <P> Together, the murders point to a rising level of gang violence in Orange  County. Though no exact statistics exist, the district attorney's office  believes there were roughly 16 gang-related homicides during all of 1989, and  an average of roughly a dozen each year for the preceding three years.  </P> <P> "More and more, you say, 'Who are you with?' and they identify themselves as  gang members," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry.  </P> <P> Homicide statistics are an imperfect measure of gang activity. Dozens of people  have also been shot or stabbed by suspected gang members this year. One of them  was 8-year-old Carlos Alvarez, pierced by a stray bullet while watching  television in his own living room. The bullet went through Carlos and the wall  and injured an aunt who was sleeping in the next room. But because both victims  survived, that case will never be classified as a gang-related crime.  </P> <P> Similarly, gang members crashed a party in Anaheim last month and three people  were severly stabbed in the resulting melee. One is still in critical  condition, Barry said. But those three people, whose names have not been  released by police, will be classified simply as assault victims.  </P> <P> As the violence mounts, police and the public quickly lose sight of the  humanity of the 17 young men slain in gang-related conflicts this year.  </P> <P> "It's really easy to get hardened and say these (victims) are just gang members  . . . or criminals," Garden Grove Police Capt. David Abrecht said. "We lose  sight of the fact that this is a bigger problem for our society than we'd like  to admit."  </P> <P> These are the deaths so far in 1990, according to police, prosecutors, public  records and witnesses:  </P> <P> JAN. 2 10:29 P.M.: A Witness Is Shot  </P> <P> Pedro Perez, 30, is shot in the head by an unknown assailant on Myrtle Street  in Santa Ana. Information about the case is sketchy, to say the least. Police  say a suspect, dressed like a gang member, tried to rob a man. The man ran, and  the suspect fired three shots after him but missed. Then, for reasons  unexplained, the suspect turned and fired two shots at a group of people  standing nearby. One of the bullets hit Perez in the head. He died the next  afternoon.  </P> <P> Authorities know almost nothing about Perez, except that his fingerprints were  on file, and he was possibly an illegal immigrant. He was not carrying a  wallet. No one seems to know where he came from, where he lived or worked, who  killed him or why. The coroner has not be able to find any relatives. Perez's  body lies unclaimed in the morgue.  </P> <P> JAN. 5 11:59 P.M.: 2 Stabbed in a Fight  </P> <P> Hector De La Torre, 24, of Santa Ana, said to be a member of the F-Troop gang,  and Oscar "Tiny" Jiminez, 18, of Garden Grove, allegedly part of the Anaheim  Westside gang, are stabbed to death outside a home on 8th Street in Garden  Grove. Friends said their attackers were members of a third gang, the Hoodlum  Crips of Garden Grove.  </P> <P> De La Torre died an hour later in an emergency room of chest and groin wounds.  He lived with his mother, hadn't finished high school and listed his occupation  as a shipping clerk at Western Digital.  </P> <P> Jiminez, who was stabbed in the neck, bled to death at 2:45 a.m. Like De La  Torre, he was born in Mexico, and come to Orange County at age 6. He had six  years of education. His body was turned over to his mother.  </P> <P> Taula Poe, 20, of Westminster, and Arnold Mendoza, 19, of Garden Grove, will be  tried on murder charges fon June 21.  </P> <P> JAN. 20 9:56 P.M.: 'It's Such a Waste'  </P> <P> Javier P. Avila, 22, of Santa Ana, is shot in the head during a melee involving  at least 15 gang members armed with belts, bottles and knives. He dies in the  emergency room at 4:28 the next morning. Police say Avila and three friends got  into a fight with 10 members of the Middleside gang.  </P> <P> Born in Mexico, Avila came to the U.S. at age 12. For the last six months of  his life he had been working in the warehouse and driving a delivery truck for  Leah's Fabric in Anaheim. A co-worker said she does not believe he was a gang  member. She learned of his death when relatives came in to ask about insurance.  </P> <P> "He was always happy, real pleasant, real nice," she said. "We're stunned. We  just think it's such a waste, because he was nice, and he was so young."  </P> <P> A teen-aged boy was arrested and charged with the murder. The case is still  pending.  </P> <P> FEB. 5 12:08 A.M.: Shot in the Back  </P> <P> Aurelio Navarette, 20, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack on Artesia  Boulevard in Buena Park. He was pronounced dead on arrival at La Palma  Intercommunity Hospital 40 minutes later. His brother, Otoniel, is wounded in  the arm.  </P> <P> Navarette's death certificate lists him as a Buena Park High School student,  but school officials say he had left several years ago.  </P> <P> Police say the brothers belonged to the Buena Park "Eastsiders." Two alleged  members of the rival "One Way" gang in Norwalk, aged 15 and 17, have been  charged. That homicide case, too, is still pending.  </P> <P> FEB. 23 10:33 P.M.: 5 Shots From a Pickup  </P> <P> Jesus Perez, a 21-year-old janitor, is a passenger in a car driving south on  Rene Drive in Santa Ana when a pickup truck carrying several people passes them  going in the other direction and fires at least five shots. Perez is struck in  the head. Brain surgery fails to save him and he dies four hours later.  </P> <P> Perez had come to the United States four years ago from Mexico, and his body  was sent back to Zacatepec for burial. Police do not have a suspect.  </P> <P> FEB. 24 7:51 P.M.: Bullets Spray a Family  </P> <P> Salvador Villa Arias, 18, is standing with several family members outside his  home on West 5th Street in Santa Ana when a red pickup truck drives by. A  gunman in the back sprays the group with at least six bullets, and one hits  Arias in the back of the head.  </P> <P> Police believe Arias was a gang member, but his mother, Teresa Villa, said her  son didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't wear gang colors and did not have  friends in a gang. But family members noted that the notorious 5th Street gang  controls an area on the other side of Euclid Street, away from their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Arias had recently left Los Amigos High School to work as a gardener. His body  was returned to Michoacan, Mexico, for burial.  </P> <P> The day after the shooting, police arrested Steven Joseph Salazar, 23, of Santa  Ana. Though investigators identified him as a gang member, they declined to  specify which gang. One investigator said he has found gang members who save  their press clippings in photo albums and view them as a status symbol.  </P> <P> MARCH 4 8:10 P.M.: Argument at a Dance Studio  </P> <P> Ha Huu Dang, 21, is shot in the head in the restroom of Jimmy's Ballroom Dance  Studio in Garden Grove. Police said Dang was not a gang member but had argued  with three young men who were.  </P> <P> Born in Vietnam, Dang had graduated from high school and moved to Orange County  two years ago. For the past six months, he had been working on an assembly line  at Starkey California in Anaheim, making hearing aids. His former boss, Keith  Stifter, described Dang as "easy-going, willing to help, kind of a  happy-go-lucky guy. Never really seemed like anything bothered him."  </P> <P> A woman who worked at the dance studio said Dang had come there every week or  two with a group of friends. "After the shooting, his friends never came back,"  she said.  </P> <P> Police say they have a suspect but have not made an arrest.  </P> <P> MARCH 15 11:21 P.M.: A Bystander Panics  </P> <P> Margarito Alvarado-Robledo, 25, a dishwasher in the Mi Ho Restaurant in Garden  Grove, is in the kitchen putting away leftovers when a gunman demands money.  According to the owner, Alvarado-Robledo panics and tries to run, and the  robber shoots him in the neck. Police believe the robber is a gang member, but  have not made an arrest. Details are sketchy, and Garden Grove Police Capt.  David Abrecht said the case may not ultimately be classified as a "gang-related  homicide."  </P> <P> Alvarado-Robledo fought for life for seven days before he died. According to  his death certificate, he had completed elementary school, had been in Orange  County for two years, was married and lived in Stanton. His body was sent to La  Esperanza, Mexico for burial.  </P> <P> Speaking through a Korean interpreter, the owner, Chung W. Choi described  Alvarado-Robledo as a "very good employee, very honest and hard-working." Choi  said he had immigrated four years ago from Seoul, and the killing so frightened  him that for a time he contemplated returning to South Korea.  </P> <P> MARCH 19 12:11 A.M.: Confrontation in a Store  </P> <P> David Eugene Davenport, 31, walks into a Circle K convenience store in Garden  Grove to buy cigarettes. Davenport, who had lost his job and apartment and was  trying to find work, befriended the night clerk. He accuses two young men of  shoplifting. According to Garden Grove Police Det. Mike Handfield, the three  men argued briefly and stepped out of the store together. Then the younger of  the two shot Davenport in the face. He died instantly.  </P> <P> The two men and a juvenile girl in their car were later arrested. The  17-year-old's name has not been released, but prosecutors have asked for a  hearing May 25 in a bid to prosecute him as an adult. His companion, Cesar Nava  Sustaita, 19, has been charged with being an accessory to murder. Handfield  said both men belonged to the "Hard Times" gang based in the Buena Clinton  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Davenport grew up in Garden Grove, attended Rancho Alamitos High School and had  been working as a landscaper, said his mother, Ann Gehrig, who now lives in  Coulterville, Calif.  </P> <P> "He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time," Gehrig said.  </P> <P> There are no gangs in Coulterville, she said. "That's one of the reasons we're  here."  </P> <P> MARCH 24 1:42 A.M.: 'Rolling Gun Battle'  </P> <P> Nabor Eustolio Roman, 16, died after being shot several times in the back  during what authorities called "a rolling gun battle." Santa Ana police  described Roman as a well-known member of the Highland Street gang who  allegedly had shot and wounded a pedestrian earlier that night after an  argument over drugs.  </P> <P> An hour later, police said, members of a rival gang found Roman on Townsend  Street and shot him dead. Police said two separate guns were used in the  slaying. No one has been arrested.  </P> <P> APRIL 3 6:40 P.M.: 6 Shots From a Passing Car  </P> <P> Martin Lopez Rosiles Jr., 19, of Santa Ana, who had been working as a film  developer, is shot in the back in a drive-by attack in El Modena, an  unincorporated area near Orange. Another 17-year-old is wounded. Rosiles dies  45 minutes later in Chapman General Hospital.  </P> <P> The shooting is a typical gang attack. Vine Street residents said five or six  shots were fired from a gray Honda at random into a group of people standing in  front of a home. Police say gang members sometimes fire at people or a house  without even knowing their intended victim. The Rosiles case has not been  solved.  </P> <P> APRIL 10 6:20 P.M.: Holding a Child's Hand  </P> <P> Martin Julian Gonzalez, 21, is walking along Myrtle Street in Santa Ana headed  to the store, holding the hand of his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter, when a  man jumps out of a passing car at shoots him in the neck and chest. The girl is  unharmed. Gonzalez dies less than an hour later, despite emergency surgery at  UCI Medical Center in Orange. Friends said Gonzalez had been trying to  extricate himself from street life. Police believe the shooting is gang-related  but have made no arrests.  </P> <P> APRIL 20 10:30 P.M.: 'Puro Southside!' 'Highland!'  </P> <P> Rojelio M. (Roger) Ochoa, 17, is shot four times in the back after an argument  with suspected gang members at a birthday party for a friend on East 3rd Street  in Santa Ana. According to Santa Ana Police Lt. David Salazar, witnesses heard  Ochoa yell, "Puro (Pure) Southside," then saw his attacker fire four shots and  shout, "Highland!" Ochoa was described as a gentle boy from a tough  neighborhood who had left school for a job learning to repair personal  computers.  </P> <P> Eight days later, Eleazar Gonzales, 20, was arrested on suspicion of the  murder. Two months earlier, Gonzales, identified as a longtime Highland gang  member, had been acquitted of the 1988 murder of a fellow gang member. Gonzales  has said he is innocent of both killings.  </P> <P> APRIL 22 12:52 A.M.: 'He Wasn't a Criminal'  </P> <P>  Cesar Torres Salgado, 15, is shot three times in the side from a passing van  as he is leaving a Santa Ana party at a South Hickory Street home. By 3 a.m. he  is dead. Salgado's friend, Javier Torres, 18, is shot in the back but survives.  </P> <P> Police and neighbors say the house is a longtime "Lopers" hang-out and is  pockmarked with bullets. Neighbors say the Lopers have been feuding for some  time with the nearby "Eastsiders." But friends said Salgado, a Horizon High  School student, belonged to a third gang named "Middleside." His street name  was "Night Owl" because he liked to stay up late. But they said he was just a  guest at the party, an innocent teen-ager who did not deserve to die.  </P> <P> "He was a home boy, but he wasn't a criminal," one said.  </P> <P> APRIL 30 11:15 P.M.: He Dies in a Cousin's Arms  </P> <P> Rosendo Ibarra, 17, of Anaheim, is gunned down while talking to his girlfriend  at a pay telephone in a Garden Grove shopping center parking lot. He is shot  twice, once in the head, and dies in the arms of his cousin, Mona Marquez,  before help arrives.  </P> <P> Garden Grove police say Ibarra, a construction worker who had been out of work  since breaking his leg in February, was a member of the Colonia gang in  Stanton. Relatives reported seeing a dark Cadillac circling their neighborhood  the night before, and believe the shooting was planned.  </P> <P> David Alan Davis, 22, and Joe David Kehler, 23, both of Anaheim, have been  arrested on suspicion of the murder. Both men have been separately charged in  drug cases but it is not known whether Ibarra's killing was drug-related.  Police are still seeking several other suspects in the murder.  </P> <P> Ibarra was the father of a year-old daughter named Casandra.  </P> <P> Mona Marquez cried last week as she tried to explain how it felt to hold her  cousin as he died. "I don't know who to hate, but I want something done," she  said.  </P> <P> MAY 11 1:30 A.M.: An 'Ordinary' Drive-By  </P> <P> Jesus Gutierrez, 21, of Garden Grove, is killed by gunfire from a passing car  as he and a friend stand in front of a house on West Henderson Place in Santa  Ana. Witnesses said Gutierrez, who died at the scene, hung around with gang  members. Also wounded was Juan Manuel Alcantar, a 25-year-old Santa Ana man who  described himself as a former member of the Middleside gang.  </P> <P> A RECORD GANG DEATH TOLL  </P> <P> With at least 17 deaths in the first five months of this year, law enforcement  authorities say gang violence is surpassing 1989, when roughly 16 gang-related  murders were committed.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.00IN:2.11IN:4.20IN:2.77IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> DATE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PLACE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> VICTIM/AGE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> CIRCUMSTANCE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> GANG TIES  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Ana  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pedro Perez, 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Shot; bystander  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> None  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> G.

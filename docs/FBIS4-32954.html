			<p>BFN     [Text] After some technical difficulties, the Antonio  Guiteras Power Plant in Matanzas has incorporated its 330  megawatt unit into the national electric system. Specialists at  that plant report that the average output exceeds 270 megawatts  and that the recent repairs did away with other problems that  obstructed the continuous generation of power. A one-month  maintenance outage is projected for September, which will allow  regulating 50 percent of the turbine valves, clean the boiler,  and repair auxiliary equipment.    The Antonio Guiteras Electric Plant is the most efficient of  its kind in Cuba and has achieved more than 40 percent of its  electric production goals for 1994.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Croatia Serbs seek link to Bosnia AN ATTEMPT by Serbs living in Croatia to unite their self-styled republic with its Bosnian counterpart is likely to add to the difficulties of implementing the new United Nations resolution on Bosnia. The Krajina Serb assembly decided at the weekend to hold a referendum on June 19-20 on linking with the Bosnian Serbs. The assembly appeared already so confident of a 'yes' vote that it announced that the capital of the new state would be the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. The decision appeared to mark a victory for hardliners over a more moderate faction which has been holding talks with international mediators on autonomy for Krajina within Croatia. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has encouraged closer co-operation between what he calls 'the western Serbs' in reaction to international pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to distance himself from the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Karazdic also said that the United Nations resolution 'will not be harmful to the Serbs'. He promised to co-operate with the UN on setting up safe areas for Moslems in Bosnia. A member of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, Mr Ejub Ganic, condemned the resolution at the weekend, saying its adoption showed that the international community had become 'a second aggressor' against Bosnia, together with Serbia. A diplomatic source in Belgrade said the resolution would not help to achieve a long-term solution in Bosnia. 'Without a political framework for a solution, the safe havens for Moslems will become expanded refugee camps, with a danger of becoming permanent,' the source said.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Canadian group buys Confed's UK arm Sun Life of Canada has bought the UK operation of Confederation Life Insurance, Canada's fourth largest insurer, in the first disposal of Confed's businesses since it was seized by financial regulators last week. Before Confed went into liquidation, analysts had speculated that its UK arm would fetch about CDollars 400m (Pounds 190m), but the price is thought to have fallen. Sun Life, Canada's second-largest insurer, said the Canadian court had ruled it could not disclose the price at this stage, but it might be able to do so in one to two months' time once the deal had been concluded. The Canadian financial regulators have made it clear that they want to move quickly to sell assets before their value is eroded. Confed's liquidator said yesterday that a buyer for the collapsed insurer's group health and life insurance business may be unveiled in a few weeks. Liquidators took control of Confed last Thursday to prevent a run on policies and deposits. Other insurers which have expressed a public interest in acquiring parts of Confed include Great-West Life Assurance, North American Life Assurance and Aetna Canada. The acquisition of Confed's British operation is a significant expansion for Sun Life of Canada in the UK. It means a 70 per cent increase in its direct sales force, to 1,700, and the addition of 250,000 policyholders to its 612,000. Confed's UK arm had Pounds 5.8bn assets under management at the start of the year, while Sun Life in the UK had Pounds 3.9bn. The purchase will also give it a presence in the pooled pension business, where Confed is the second largest in the market, and a retail bank. Sun Life of Canada said it aimed to increase the size and scope of Confederation Bank, which offers residential mortgages and deposit accounts. It already has a home loans subsidiary and the two operations are likely to be integrated. The company said it had been looking for potential acquisitions in the UK for some time. It now had the 'critical mass' necessary to do well in the overcrowded UK life insurance market. The two organisations will continue to be run separately until regulatory and other approvals for the deal have been obtained.</p>

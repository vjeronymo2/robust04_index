			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Clinton to renew China's favoured trade status: US drops insistence on link to Beijing's human rights record President Bill Clinton, promising a 'larger and more productive ' relationship with China, last night dropped his insistence that US trade preferences should be linked to improvements in China's human rights record. 'I believe we are far more likely to have human rights advances when it is not under the cloud of the annual renewal of MFN,' the president said, referring to the most favoured nation trading status, which allows Chinese goods into the US at low tariffs. Mr Clinton offered some consolation to those in Congress and elsewhere who have demanded sustained pressure on Chinese human rights. He announced a ban on imports of Chinese guns and ammunition, mainly the SKS rifle popular in the US, as well as committing himself to 'aggressive' efforts on the human rights front. But he freely conceded that his executive order of last summer linking trade and human rights, setting a deadline of June 3 for MFN renewal, had not produced the desired dividends, in spite of improvements in areas such as emigration from China, prison labour and a better accounting of dissidents in Tibet and throughout China. The president thought that even his critics had come round to the view that a different approach was necessary. That may not stop some in Congress from introducing legislation either maintaining the human rights linkage or demanding tougher sanctions than implied by the guns and ammunition ban, which affects only an estimated Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m (Pounds 10m-Pounds 13.3m) in Chinese sales out of total Chinese exports last year of more than Dollars 31bn. Mr Clinton placed his decision in the context of overall US policies in Asia, as well as its 'significant interests' with China itself. He cited this week's progress in trade negotiations with Japan and the 'possible progress' in resolving the impasse over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. His decision was one of the most difficult of his presidency. In the 1992 campaign he had accused President George Bush of 'coddling' the Chinese dictatorship and had seemed to live up to that promise last summer with the order linking MFN and human rights. That action was commended at the time as politically astute, but it depended on the co-operation of China. That was never seriously forthcoming.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nestle chief sees slower profit growth PROFIT growth at Nestle, the world's largest foods group, is slowing in the second half, Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, said yesterday. Mr Maucher said the group could not maintain the 16.5 per cent level of profit growth achieved in the first half as recession deepened in many of its markets, but the result would still be 'satisfactory'. Sales would probably grow 9 per cent to SFr55m (Dollars 38.22m) this year. In the first 10 months, sales were up 8.3 per cent to SFr44.3bn, but volume growth, which was running at 3 per cent in the first half, slumped to 2.3 per cent in the 10 months, mainly due to a steep decline in sales in Brazil. The Swiss franc's rise against most other currencies eliminated foreign exchange gains. Source Perrier, consolidated since July 1, contributed SFr800m in the four months to October 31.</p>

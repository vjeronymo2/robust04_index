			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Nikolay Vasilev, chairman of the </F> Alternative Social Liberal Party, ASP, by Lyubimka Naydenova of  the Balkan Agency; place and date not given: "ASP Will Withdraw  From Government Unless Privatization Starts"]    [Text] [Naydenova] Professor Vasilev, at the last meeting  of the ASP [Alternative Social Liberal Party] Executive Council,  did you discuss possible cabinet changes? Did anyone propose  that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev should replace  Prof. Berov?    [Vasilev] The ASP Executive Council discussed actions that  the government in its present form should undertake to speed up  privatization -- which is the sole condition for the cabinet's  survival. We give the cabinet one last chance to sign the new  agreement with the international financial institutions. This  can happen before the beginning of June, but only if the process  of privatization is really started. The measures we are  recommending to the ministerial team will enable it to save its  own skin. Unfortunately, the people in Bulgaria who know how to  govern receive no support to do just this. We do not envisage a  cabinet reshuffle, and have not proposed anyone for prime  minister. At the very least, it is improper to do this before  Prof. Berov has completely restored his state of health.  However, we set the present cabinet team one emphatic  condition: Either it should elucidate what powers the ministers  have for launching the privatization, or we will bear no  responsibility for the failure of the government's program.  They must untie Valentin Karabashev's hands to permit him to  act within his delegated sphere of responsibility, or else we  will withdraw our representatives from this cabinet.    [Naydenova] Why do the ASP experts think that the  privatization process has failed to move from its stalemate  position, given that parliament recently passed the  Privatization Act and that, at the very outset when it was  formed, the government stated its firm intention to apply this  law.    [Vasilev] The law is a matter with which our own party team  has been concerned, and it is not a bad basis for real actions.  It needs to be amended, but can operate even in its present  form. The launch of privatization is being postponed because  real economic groupings (not the ones that occupy the front  pages of the newspapers) are not yet ready to take part in it,  so they are delaying the process by all possible means. To this  one must add the lack of readiness on the part of the labor  collectives in the enterprises that are likely to be privatized,  as well as the vast bureaucratic administration that is being  deliberately maintained and makes the process much more  difficult. The ASP believes that the mass and market  privatizations should be launched simultaneously, but one cannot  expect any quick results from the former during the next few  months, or even the next few years.    [Naydenova] Do you think that the cabinet can work as a team  in its present form?    [Vasilev] Unfortunately, the formula according to which the  government was formed was incorrect from the very outset. At  the beginning of its term in office, there were perhaps some  faint signs of team action, but since the middle of last year  the confrontation between the different tendencies within the  cabinet have become quite evident. The cabinet's work has  stalled. The ASP cannot be responsible for the fact that its  representatives in the cabinet are prevented from doing their  jobs. We cannot assume responsibility for the actions and  inaction of Matinchev, for example. The country needs a  government of political responsibility.</p>

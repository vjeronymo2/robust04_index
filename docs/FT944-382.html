			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / The FT Interview: Credit where it is due - The new president of the EBRD has brought prudence rather than vision to the bank / Jacques de Larosiere Mr Jacques de Larosiere is in confident mood. His style is discreet, even understated. Yet the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is anxious to make his point. Since he took over the running of the public sector bank set up in 1991 to aid economic transformation in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, the institution has regained credibility. The EBRD's first president, Mr Jacques Attali, resigned in the summer of 1993 after a crisis caused by revelations of mismanagement and over-spending. The very future of the bank was in doubt. Not all the questions about the EBRD's long-term future have since been resolved. It has yet to prove that it can be more effective than private sector banks in those central and eastern European countries that have progressed furthest with economic reform. But Mr de Larosiere says those who doubt the need for the EBRD 'are less and less numerous'. He cites evidence that the bank is an increasingly attractive partner for the international investment banking community. 'After little more than a year here, I see the EBRD as a valuable and innovative institution. It is more and more respected and called upon by other partners to work with them.' He takes care to give credit for the turnround to his colleagues rather than to himself, and he delivers his judgment from a position of experience. A former director of the French Treasury, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and governor of the Bank of France, he is Europe's most seasoned figure on the international monetary circuit. He appears totally in control - of himself and of his institution. A master of fastidiously-controlled diction, the EBRD chief - in contrast to his flamboyant predecessor - eschews hyperbole. This approach adds force to his description of the EBRD at the time of Mr Attali's departure: 'I don't want to use pompous words. But I think the life of the bank was at stake.' In the past year, the EBRD has strengthened its commitment to private sector initiatives in its 25 countries of operation (the number has trebled since it was set up, largely because of the break-up of the Soviet Union). It has stepped up geographic diversification, shifting the focus away from the pro-reform states of eastern Europe towards what Mr de Larosiere calls the 'outer countries, the more difficult ones' in the former Soviet Union. Deals with five countries - Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania - accounted for 57 per cent of the EBRD's signed commitments for loans and equity investments in 1993, but only 44 per cent in 1994. The EBRD has reorganised its 750-strong staff, merging departments and moving employees out of administration into front-line banking. The number of EBRD employees - both London-hired and locally-recruited - in resident offices in former communist states will roughly quadruple next year to 81, compared with 23 in October 1993. Offices outside London, which previously had largely representational functions, have been integrated into the EBRD's banking department. Asked to provide examples of recent projects, Mr de Larosiere reels off 10 that range from Russian small business credits and support for privatised companies in Poland and Slovenia to loans for the Prague-Berlin rail network and for improvement of wine-making in Moldova. With an uncharacteristic burst of enthusiasm, he says he is 'elated' by such evidence of the bank's diversity. He cites statistics to show how the EBRD's operations are growing. Signed loan and equity commitments for 1994 will be just over Ecu1.8bn, in line with target, compared with a cumulative Ecu2.7bn during the EBRD's first three years of operations. Seventy per cent of 1994 deals were for the private sector - higher than the 60 per cent private sector content laid down by the banks's charter. Disbursements during 1994 totalled something like Ecu700m, compared with a cumulative Ecu557m up to the end of 1993. The bank always acts with partners, such as banks, multinationals and local companies, in its projects and on average it only puts up a third of the capital required. Investments totalling Ecu5.7bn have so far been approved by the board during the bank's life, supporting projects with an overall value of Ecu17.1bn. 'This means that the EBRD is actually the most important agent in terms of private financing in that part of the world,' Mr de Larosiere says proudly - adding hastily that he does not say this to exaggerate the importance of the bank, merely that he wishes to put the figures into perspective. At the same time, the bank's famously accommodative budget has been brought under strict control. Its administrative spending was frozen in 1994, and the figure will rise by just 3.5 per cent in nominal terms in 1995 despite the rising number of transactions. 'We have been moderating the expansion of our budgetary outlays, and this has been extremely important to restore credibility. We are at the service of our member countries, and we are very careful about the manner in which we utilise the money devoted to the bank, since this is taxpayers' money,' observes the president thoughtfully. One possible source of future friction with shareholders concerns the EBRD's cumbersome board, the cost of which (12 per cent of EBRD administrative spending) has been criticised by some governments. Mr de Larosiere says it is 'widely accepted' that the board's structure is 'a problem', adding, 'I am confident the membership will look into it and take the proper measures.' Problems concerning the EBRD's structure are not directly his responsibility, Mr de Larosiere says, because he is the governments' servant, not their master. Such self-deprecation, however, is not the whole story. In his dealings with the board, Mr de Larosiere is said to use a mixture of assertiveness and subtlety to push decisions through. One EBRD insider says Mr de Larosiere displays a single-mindedness that is similar to Mr Attali. The difference is that Mr de Larosiere has 'infinitely more finesse'. Another top EBRD official points to Mr de Larosiere's success in talking directly to top contacts in shareholder governments. 'He commands total respect.' Mr de Larosiere takes care never to criticise his predecessor; indeed, he does not mention his name during the interview. But his opinion of Mr Attali's free-spending is not difficult to discern. The entire 12th floor, the site of Mr Attali's former office, is being sub-let to save costs, as is the bank's 2nd floor, bringing in Pounds 1.3m in annual rental income, 1 per cent of the total budget outlays. He has closed the executive dining room and prefers to lunch in the canteen. 'You can eat very decently.' He adds: 'It has a big advantage for me since it allows me to speak to people whom I would not normally see in my office. I sit at the table, and start a conversation. That is very good for me and for the integration of the bank.' Restructuring operations and restoring morale represented the most urgent of Mr de Larosiere's tasks. But the bank's customers' needs are changing too. For all the macroeconomic difficulties in the east, he says, 'the pace of economic reform in most countries is encouraging . . . All this will create a climate that will undoubtedly have profound consequences on the countries' ability to generate business. Our job is to help the authorities in these countries with the execution of these programmes, particularly in the post-privatisation phase.' Like most of its clients, the EBRD itself is operating under constraints. First, it lends on commercial terms, at higher interest rates than, for instance, the European Investment Bank - one of the reasons why the EBRD has been criticised as excessively cautious. Second, the need to carry out a large number of time-consuming smaller deals in a large array of countries adds to both costs and risks. Third, though commitments and disbursements are building up, the bank's overall activities - and thus its income - are much lower than envisaged under Mr Attali. Mr de Larosiere intends to tackle these problems in two ways. 'We have to continue to increase productivity, and this is why I am continuing to press for structural reforms, simplifying networks and streamlining procedures.' He also wants to increase the bank's leverage by extending partnerships with other institutions in the financial and industrial fields. The EBRD has stepped up 'wholesale' activities in the financial area, taking equity stakes in and forming associations with banks, financial institutions and investment firms in its countries of operation. Such activities now form 20 per cent of its business. Mr de Larosiere wants to extend this into the industrial sector, building 'global partnership relationships' with corporations from west and east. 'This would mean we would do less detailed work on individual projects, accompanying important corporations in programmes (in the EBRD's target countries).' By agreeing such 'package deals', the bank could save costs and lend support to more modest projects that would otherwise 'be too small productivity-wise', Mr de Larosiere says. These plans make sense, but do they add up to a vision? Mr de Larosiere bridles at the suggestion that he is interested solely in good housekeeping. 'Of course there is a vision. It would be inept not to have a vision. It is one of the most important challenges for the west to help that part of the world transform its basic habits and integrate into the world trade system.' There is an important caveat: 'We are a bank and we have to behave as a bank. We have a profit and loss account. We are judged by the markets. We have to borrow on the markets. We had negative reserves in the first year, and now we have to create positive reserves. We also have to look at the years where we will have to put up provisions for risks. So the bank has to be run like a bank.' Mr de Larosiere neither looks nor sounds like a visionary. That is probably the best guarantee that his agenda for the EBRD, mixing the prudence of the public sector with the flexibility of the marketplace, can be made to work.</p>

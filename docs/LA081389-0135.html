			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In the third major Free World rocket launch in five days, the 126-foot,  $30-million Delta 2, equipped with nine strap-on solid-fuel boosters, was  scheduled for takeoff from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida  early today. Atop the slender blue-and-white rocket inside a protective nose  cone was the third of 21 new $65-million Global Positioning System navigation  satellites designed to tell military units their locations to within 53 feet  anywhere in the world. Heavy thunderstorms rolled through the cape and an Air  Force spokeswoman said there was a 20% chance of the weather delaying the  launch.  </P></p>

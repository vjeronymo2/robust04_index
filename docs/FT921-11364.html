			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GWR to reduce debt with Dollars 7.3m disposals Great Western Resources, the troubled US oil and gas concern which is quoted on the USM, aims to raise Dollars 7.3m (Pounds 4.03m) with the sale of oil and gas assets, a drilling and pipeline company, and a petroleum investment to an unnamed party. The deal, which is subject to certain unspecified conditions, forms part of GWR's revised loan facility from its bankers. About half of the proceeds will be used to cut the company's Pounds 75m debt. The rest will be used for 'general corporate purposes'.</p>

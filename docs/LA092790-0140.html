			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: HOW TO GET A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK WILL  </P> <P> Do they really work? How do I get my hands on one?  </P> <P> Those were some of the many questions readers asked after last week's column on  the California Statutory Will, the fill-in-the-blanks form that you can use  without hiring a lawyer.  </P> <P> The second question is easily answered. Stores that sell stationery, office  supplies and legal forms (such as leases or promissory notes) usually stock two  versions of the statutory will. If you can't find one in a local store,  Wolcott's, in downtown Los Angeles, has them.  </P> <P> Or, even easier, you can buy one through the mail from the State Bar of  California. Send $1, plus a self-addressed, business-size envelope with 39  cents of postage, to: State Bar of California, Wills, P.O. Box 411, San  Francisco, 94101  </P> <P> The answer to the first question -- do they work? -- is more complicated. They  work; that is, they are accepted by the probate court, if they are filled in  properly. But even with all the i's dotted and the t's crossed, the form may  not be the best option for those who, under the advice of a lawyer, need more  choices than the form offers.  </P> <P> It is also difficult to determine if the forms actually work as intended. There  are no statistics on how many are rejected in probate court, or how many have  actually been completed.  </P> <P> But there seems to be a great deal of consumer interest in the forms. In 1983,  the first year they were available, the State Bar sold 175,000 copies. And  after an earlier Legal View column that explained how to order the form, the  State Bar received 2,000 requests in one week. (California was the first state  to create a statutory will; they were introduced in 1925 in England, where they  have not been especially popular.)  </P> <P> Some lawyers and probate experts raise concerns that the forms are too  difficult to complete.  </P> <P> Barbara J. Miller, an Alameda County Court commissioner, last year told  California Lawyer magazine that most statutory wills in her jurisdiction were  not completed correctly.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Gerry W. Beyer, a law professor at St. Mary's University of  San Antonio, Tex., and author of a comprehensive law review article on the  subject, could not find any appellate decisions in California involving the  statutory will. That could indicate that rejected wills are not a serious  problem and that family members are not taking their fight beyond trial court  in the event of a rejection. Or it could simply mean that the forms have not  been around long enough to wind through the court system.  </P> <P> A group of lawyers have been working with the State Bar to amend the statutory  will. The additions would give consumers more choices and improve the  instructions.  </P> <P> The current form, for example, provides for the selection of a guardian for  "the person" and "the property" of minor children. Some people might not  understand the difference. One version of the proposed revision includes this  explanation:  </P> <P> "If you have children under age 18, you should designate a guardian of their  persons to raise them. You may also want to designate a guardian of their  estate to manage their assets for them until they reach age 18. At age 18, they  receive their assets outright. Some people may prefer to designate a custodian  to manage assets until as late as age 25."  </P> <P> Other proposed amendments include provisions for more than the one cash gift,  the exclusion of family members, and the unequal division of the estate among  children.  </P> <P> Another option would establish an administrative procedure to certify the  validity of the will upon completion. Imagine a "statutory will deputy"  authorized to review the form during the will maker's lifetime and correct any  technical mistakes.  </P></p>

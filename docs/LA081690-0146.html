			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED ON RAPE CHARGES  </P> <P> A former nurse's aide at a Glendale nursing home was ordered to stand trial  Tuesday on charges that he raped and sodomized an elderly patient while working  at the facility.  </P> <P> Glendale Municipal Judge Charles E. Horan found that there was sufficient  evidence to try Roy Alton Seaton, 45, of Burbank, on charges of sodomy, rape  with a foreign object and sexual battery.  </P> <P> Seaton, who is in County Jail, will be arraigned Aug. 29 in Pasadena Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Seaton was arrested June 28 after a nursing supervisor at Autumn Hills  Convalescent Home allegedly caught him sexually assaulting an 82-year-old woman  who had Alzheimer's disease. He was later fired.  </P> <P> Investigators told Autumn Hills officials that Seaton was convicted in 1983 of  lewd conduct with a child.  </P> <P> In July, Los Angeles County officials levied an $11,000 fine against the home  because the victim allegedly suffered physical and sexual abuse and because  administrators allegedly failed to check the employee's background.  </P></p>

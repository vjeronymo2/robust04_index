NGT explains that it now proposes to install one 2,200 h.p.

Transwestern states that the Amendment incorporates the corrected and revised attachments to the original application for abandonment, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that in the process of analyzing Transwestern's system in response to the May 27, 1994, series of gathering orders issued by the Commission and while preparing for further proceedings in Transwestern's refunctionalization proceeding in Docket No. CP94&hyph;254&hyph;000, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including compressors, plants, meters, dehydrators and miscellaneous associated facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. Therefore, Transwestern states that it filed the original abandonment application on August 30, 1994. Transwestern determined that it would be most practical and efficient to promptly lay the groundwork for the abandonment of said facilities and withdraw them from Transwestern's refunctionalization proceeding where they had been previously included. Transwestern states that it felt that this sequencing would avoid the necessity of needlessly determining the facilities primary function when they were, except for the uneconomical Halley Plant, unused and unuseful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After filing the abandonment application, Transwestern states that it was discovered that there were several discrepancies in the attachments to the application. Transwestern states that the discrepancies have now been corrected and are the subject of its Amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transwestern states that the following is a summary description of the changes made to the application's attachments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Text. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Only one page of text has been amended by the addition of the word ``approximately'' in the fourth line of the second full paragraph of Section VII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compression Facilities_Appendix 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 1, which includes the detail on all of the compressors has been amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Summary Sheet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Appendix 1 summary sheet has been amended in that the asterisks which had indicated which of the compressors had also been included in the refunctionalization filing in Docket No. CP94&hyph;254&hyph;000 have been removed. The asterisks have been removed because Transwestern states that it has determined that, in fact, knowing which of the facilities in the abandonment filing are included in the refunctionalization filing is a meaningless exercise; the original refunctionalization filing made on February 25, 1994 only included those facilities for which Transwestern requested a changed functionalization. Therefore, multiple facilities which Transwestern included in the abandonment proceeding were not included in the refunctionalization proceeding because no change in functionalization was requested. Transwestern states that realistically, the primary function that a facility had when it was active is irrelevant to a determination of whether it is in fact now used and useful. Transwestern states that it has concluded that the asterisks have created more confusion than necessary and that the application for abandonment would be more meaningful without them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The system numbers for the Reger Stuart No. 726, the A.R. King No. 721, the Kemnitz Nos. 864 and 884 have been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The line segment numbers have been corrected for the Hoeppner No. 854, Meier Cruise No. 813, A.R. King No. 721, W. Waha No. 749 and the Pecos River No. 839 compressors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, it is stated that the original cost has been corrected for all of the compressors but the Reger Stuart No. 726, the Meier Cruise No. 813, the W. Waha No. 749 and the Monument No. 811 compressors. These corrections have been made due to the fact that the database from which the data was originally retrieved has been scrubbed in order to formulate Appendixes A and B of the refunctionalization data response, a process that had not been performed when this abandonment was originally filed. Finally, a cost total has been added to the table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Individual Compressor Data Sheets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the compressor data sheets behind the summary sheet have been amended by the removal of line 4 which indicated whether the compressor had been included in the refunctionalization proceeding. Additionally, the original cost figures have been changed for all of the compressors except the Reger Stuart No. 726, the Meier Cruise No. 813, the W. Waha No. 749 and the Monument No. 811 compressors. Finally, Page 14, line 7 has been amended so that on in service date of 1969 is reflected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Plants_Appendix 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Summary Sheet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The summary sheet in Appendix 2 has been amended to remove the asterisks for those plants included in the refunctionalization filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original cost for all of the plants except the Huber Plant has been adjusted to reflect the refinement of the facilities database as described above. In addition, the cost for the Bell Lake Plant has been revised because two compressors and an extraneous piece of pipeline were included in the original number in error. Finally, a cost total for the plants has been added to the summary sheet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Individual Plant Data Sheets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Line 3 has been deleted on all of the individual plant data sheets to eliminate the cross reference to the refunctionalization proceeding. The original cost figures have been corrected for each plant except the Huber plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Transwestern states that its field personnel have compiled more detailed information for each of the plants included in the abandonment proceeding with regard to estimates of salvage value, removal costs and reclamation costs. Thus, the entries on lines 12, 13 and 14 on the individual plant data sheets have been amended to reflect a more individualized estimate. Finally, the entries on the Walton, Keystone and Bell Lake Plants on line 14 have been amended to reflect that more facilities than originally indicated are excepted from the abandonment filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

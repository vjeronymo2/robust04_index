			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Japanese rail flotation comes under pressure PLANS to float East Japan Railway (JR East), part of the former state-run Japan National Railways (JNR), have triggered concern in the Tokyo stock market. The Japanese transport ministry and JNR Settlement Corporation, which took over the debts of JNR, plan to offer a tranche of the 400m government-held shares during the year to March 1993. However, the decision comes as steep falls in Japanese stock prices have dented investor confidence. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, Tokyo stock exchange chairman, expressed his worries yesterday, following an announcement by an advisory committee to JNR Settlement, recommending at least one of its six railway companies be listed this year. 'Japan's stock market sentiment is not sufficient enough to absorb the heavyweight Japan railway stocks,' he said. Adverse market conditions have held up the flotation plans, originally slated for the last fiscal year. In 1987, the railway operations of JNR were split into six regional passenger railway companies, while most of the assets and debts were passed on to JNR Settlements. Investor confidence has been hit by the sharp declines in the shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the former government-owned telecommunications company, listed in 1986. The number of shares and offer price are yet to be decided. The advisory council proposed the proportion of JNR shares auctioned in order to fix the public sale price should be higher than that of the first public sale of NTT shares. Japanese brokers believe JR East's shares, with a face value of Y50,000 (Dollars 207) are worth about Y200,000. However, Mr Keiwa Okuda, transport minister, expressed dissatisfaction of such estimates, and added the shares should be sold for the highest price possible. The advisory council has recommended that the shares be made available to foreign investors.</p>

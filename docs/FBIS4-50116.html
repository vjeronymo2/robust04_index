			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China's leading  industrial center will make fresh efforts to vigorously develop  its rural industry this year.    Officials at the Administration of Industry in suburban  Shanghai said they have worked out a plan to foster the leading  enterprises among rural industrial businesses.    A rural enterprise must meet at least one of the following  three requirements if it wants to be called a "dragon head  enterprise": output value surpassing 500 million yuan and  profits amounting to 20 million yuan; delivery of commodities  for export totalling 10 million U.S. dollars a year; or  experiencing a net increase of 100 million yuan in the output  value of products for 1994.    The municipality now has 15,000 rural and township  industrial  enterprises. Last year these enterprises generated 78.8 billion  yuan in output value, accounting for a quarter of Shanghai's  total industrial output value.    Experts believe that such a program will bring about  fundamental changes in the development of Shanghai's rural  industry. The structure of technological products will be  gradually adapted to the operation of the city's new economy,  and a modern enterprise system is being introduced into rural  industrial enterprises by way of takeover, share participation  and joint operation.</p>

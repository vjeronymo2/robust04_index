			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELL TV TIMES: WHICH ANCHOR PEOPLE DO YOU WATCH REGULARLY AND WHY?  </P> <P> For this week's cover story, TV Times asked Los Angeles anchors, including  KCOP's Warren Olney, below, what qualities they believe makes a good anchor.  Now it's your turn. Which anchor people do you watch regularly and what  qualities do you look for? Send responses to Tell TV Times, TV Times, Times  Mirror Square, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053. Or fax them to (213) 237-7630.  Letters must be signed with full name and address.  </P> <P> Here are the responses to the July 15 question: Which TV family most closely  resembles your family?  </P> <P> My answer has to be the Steadmans of "thirtysomething." Our family is like the  Steadmans because we -- unlike the Bundys of "Married . . . With Children" --  have compassionate and genuine concern for one another. Each member in our  family helps each other through any hardship, tribulation and sadness that  comes through in our life, just like the Steadmans.  </P> <P> The Steadmans have the qualitative family life, which reflects love, honesty  and warmth. Our family also has all that plus family loyalty and unity. We all  do our part to make other members' lives better, such as helping in family  business and housework, and we share our thoughts, concerns and complaints in  orderly fashion to avoid hurting each other's feelings.  </P> <P> April Shin, Santa Ana  </P> <P> We're the Bundys of "Married . . . With Children." Life isn't a bowl of  cherries for us or the Bundys. We have an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old so life  can be crazy, strange and sometimes gets out of hand.  </P> <P> A lot of people we know can relate to the Bundys, even though they wouldn't  admit it.  </P> <P> Kathi Mathews, Cypress  </P> <P> My family is closest to the Seavers on "Growing Pains." My mom looks so much  like Maggie Seaver; she's even had people tell her about the resemblance many  times. My dad has the same sort of humor as father Jason. My older brother is  exactly like Mike Seaver because neither of them get good grades and they are  always sneaking around. My little brother resembles Ben Seaver in the way that  they are both so funny. I'm kind of like Carol Seaver because I get better  grades than my brothers, and we get along with each other in a similar way.  </P> <P> Alison Pritchard, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

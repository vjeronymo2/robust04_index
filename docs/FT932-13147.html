			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie mauled in global market slide A CONCERTED attack on European bond and equity markets, following hard on the heels of the late slide on Wall Street on Thursday, triggered a sharp sell off in leading UK shares and led to a turbulent session in gilts. The sustained weakness in the FT-SE 100 Index, plus the pressure on gilts, was all the more surprising following additional evidence that the UK's economic recovery is gathering speed. But the day's heaviest losses in London equities were concentrated in the top 100 shares following substantial pressure from activity in the Footsie future. The Footsie 100 ended a hectic session 37.3 down at 2,843.8, wiping out most of the strong gains recorded earlier in the week. London's second-line stocks, on the other hand, encountered very little selling and the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which outperformed the 100 index for much of the week, settled a net 0.5 higher at 3,136.2. Strong rumours circulating in London shortly before the close that a bid for United Biscuits will be revealed on Monday failed to produce much of a rally in leading stocks. However Biscuits shares surged in the final half-hour's trading. Wall Street's weakness late on Thursday was said to have been caused by a flurry of selling in US futures. London's 100 index opened almost 10 points off, as the future quickly retreated to a discount to fair value and remained under pressure all day, in company with other European markets. Dealers said the London market absorbed much of the selling in the future and the cash market but backed off when Wall Street opened yesterday under renewed pressure following disappointing durable goods figures for March. The general pressure was said to have been applied by one of the top US broking houses. There were also worries in the US and Europe about the possibility of Russia's President Yeltsin being defeated in the Russian referendum on Sunday; 'If Yeltsin loses, the feeling is that there will be a lot more downside than upside in European markets,' said a leading trader at one of the UK integrated securities houses. Gilts traded erratically, and generally closed around the day's lowest levels, despite renewed strength in sterling. The latter gained ground after the latest encouraging economic news, which included the well-received sales figures for March. Over the week, the Footsie 100 rose 29.4, or 0.7 per cent, while the FT-SE Mid 250 was up 53.4, or 1.7 per cent. Equity turnover was 701.2m shares, although this was boosted by some 88m Millwall 'new' shares.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Deflating the growth stocks FT-SE Index: 2,456.6 (-11.0) This week's gentle reminder from Guinness that its profits cannot be expected to grow as fast as before in a non-inflationary environment raises questions for growth stocks generally. If inflation makes it easier for companies to post higher profits, then the multiples on which growth stocks trade might be expected to come down as price rises abate. The question is how the effect will bite. Consumer prices have risen by 36 per cent since 1987. Over the same period profits at Bodyshop grew by 234 per cent, at Rentokil by 151 per cent, at Guinness by 115 per cent, at Glaxo by 72 per cent and at Tomkins by 273 per cent. Inflation played only a minor part in growth for these companies, at least. Presumably operating margins can still be widened even when prices are static. The scope for growth by acquisition may diminish, though, as the real cost of debt becomes more expensive. Even companies with surplus cash might find it more attractive to invest in high-yielding gilt-edged stock. Low inflation thus presents a challenge which will weed out remorselessly companies trading bogus promises of growth. That suggests the market will look at quality of earnings in reassessing ratings. Historically it does not like paying a premium for rising nominal earnings which are mostly inflation-induced, but durable real earnings growth of 3 per cent is worth more when inflation is also 3 per cent than when it is in double figures.</p>

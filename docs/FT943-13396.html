			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Jordan eager for quick fix with Israel: A desire for joint business projects ahead of the signing of a formal treaty will cause deep concern in Damascus and Beirut Jordan yesterday sent strong signals to Syria and Lebanon that it was prepared to carry out joint projects with Israel ahead of signing a formal peace treaty. This will ignite further concern in Damascus and Beirut that Jordan has abandoned any pretence at Arab co-operation in peace talks with Israel and intends to press ahead with its own political, regional and economic interests. At the close of two days of Israeli-Jordanian talks, Mr Fayez al-Tarawneh, head of the Jordanian delegation, said Jordan was willing to implement joint projects with Israel, like tourism or environmental protection before a peace treaty. Mr Tarawneh said Jordan and Israel felt if 'there are certain things which are beneficial to both sides' they they could be implemented. The Jordanian statement also revealed Amman's strategy of moving swiftly towards normalisation of relations with Israel by taking joint measures like opening borders to tourists before and outside of a formal treaty. Both sides said they had made solid progress on the three key issues which will make up the peace treaty - water, border demarcation and security. However, Israel refused a Jordanian demand it immediately recognise Jordanian rights to water from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers which Amman claims Israel has diverted since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr Gideon Zur, chairman of the working group on water, said Jordan has asked for Israel to recognise their rightful allocation of water before the two sides negotiated actual quantities, but Israel refused. Both sides agreed to continue bilateral negotiations next month meeting alternately on the Israeli and Jordanian sides of the Dead Sea. Israel, Jordan and the US are due to meet today at a resort hotel on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea to discuss economic projects to cement Arab-Israeli peace. On the agenda are projects ranging from the visionary and idealistic - like the creation of a common market or a Cairo-to-Istanbul railway - to the more simple and practical like the integration of electricity grids. Both countries know their economies will benefit considerably from co-operation and that fact is increasingly driving the broader peace process. Joint development of tourism is widely seen as the starting point. It is difficult for tourists visiting Israel to cross into Jordan. Opening the border would increase tourism through the development of multi-destination packages and joint international promotion. It could offer a visitor, for example, seven nights in the Holy Land combined with five nights in Jordan, visiting ancient Petra, the Roman ruins at Jerash, the Dead Sea and the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. Another possibility is developing Aqaba, Eilat and theEgyptian resort of Taba as a tourism triangle sharing airports. Opening the borders would also boost trade between Jordan and Israel and between Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas. Businessmen would be able to drive from Tel Aviv to Amman in three hours. Joint projects in water are also under consideration, including a possible joint desalination plant in the Gulf of Aqaba. According to Israeli officials, such a project could supply Israel, Jordan and Palestinians with 800m cubic metres of drinking water over the next 30 years. In energy, Mr Moshe Shahal, Israeli energy minister, said Israel had presented the Jordanians 10 projects, including shale oil technology transfer and linking national electricity grids to allow the two countries to share energy at peak hours. Israel is already preparing detailed plans to link its grid with Egypt's and Jordan could be included in a three nation link-up. Another project under consideration is a canal between the Dead, Red and Mediterranean Seas which would produce hydro-electric power. The two sides will also discuss oil and gas pipelines and the Jordanian use of Israeli ports as an exit to the Mediterranean. The role of the US in financing some of these projects is critical and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will attend today's talks. The US army corps of engineers, for example, is considering paving a road between Israel and Jordan. The US is also encouraging private sector investment. Israel recently announced that a Middle East economic conference would take place in October in Morocco under President Bill Clinton. Israel expects more than 2,000 international companies to attend.</p>

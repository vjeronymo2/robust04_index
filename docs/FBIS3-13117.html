He had arrived in  Jeddah at midday in his first visit to the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia since the Gulf crisis erupted in the summer of 1990.  King Husayn used to visit holy Mecca to perform minor  pilgrimage on al-Qadr night, 27 Ramadan, every year, and to  visit the tomb of the great prophet. But he could not do that  for over three and a half years because of the Gulf crisis.    King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz received the Jordanian monarch  late last night in holy Mecca, where the custodian of the two  holy mosques is spending the last 10 days of Ramadan close to  the Kaaba.    The meeting between the Saudi and Jordanian monarchs is the  first between the two leaders, who were separated by their  positions during the crisis of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Riyadh considered Jordan's position substantially supportive of  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. What further aggravated the  crisis in relations between the countries -- which is happening  for the first time -- was the position of the Jordanian media  and press toward Saudi Arabia during and after the crisis.    Arab diplomatic circles hope that the expected meeting  [al-liqa' al-mutawaqqa'] between the custodian of the two holy  mosques and the Jordanian monarch will lead to opening a new  page in inter-Arab relations based on sound and clear  foundations. The circles said that there is a positive  atmosphere with the king vis-a-vis the gradual restoration to  health [of relations] with the Arab states which adopted  positions that disappointed the Saudis during the Gulf crisis.  In this connection the circles cited the custodian of the two  holy mosques' meeting over a month ago with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat, who visited Saudi Arabia to perform  minor pilgrimage. He was received by King Fahd in Riyadh. The  sources also cited the continued normalization of Saudi-Yemeni  relations, which culminated last month in the Saudi monarch's  reception of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Yemeni  Presidential Council.    It was noted that King Husayn and the delegation  accompanying  him -- which included al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, head of the  Royal Court, and some members of the ruling Jordanian family --  were accorded a reception usually accorded to Arab and Islamic  leaders who arrive in the Kingdom to perform minor pilgrimage.  The king and the delegation were received at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  Airport in Jeddah by Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the amir of  the holy Mecca region. And King Husayn stayed at al-Hamra'  Palace.</p>

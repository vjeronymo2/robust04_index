			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Eye on China" column, by China Editor Cary Huang: </F> "Rearrests Showcase China's Strength and Weakness"]    [Text] China's rearrest of leading dissidents Wei  Jingsheng and Xu Wenli and its threat to pin new charges on the  two best-known dissidents are a sign of strength and of  weakness. With it, the Beijing regime sharply defies American  pressure to improve its human rights record. It also  graphically demonstrates its lack of confidence about its  control in China.    The rearrest of China's most prominent political dissidents  appears to set the United States and China on a collision course  over human rights. But more obviously, the Communist Party  leaders are hoping that the U.S. will pursue its economic  interests in maintaining trade with China rather than press its  human rights concerns.    The commonly held belief among Chinese officials is that the  U.S., fearful of being shut out of the world's biggest emerging  market, will find a way to renew China's most-favoured-nation  (MFN) trading status. Beijing has every reason to support this  assumption as it has gained more and more sympathy inside and  outside America towards unconditional renewal of the trade  privilege. The Clinton administration has been under  increasingly heavy pressure from the most influential business  community to promote closer trade ties with China.    Japan, Germany, Italy and France have defied the U.S. stance  on human rights with leaders flooding into the middle kingdom to  scramble for a bigger slice of the world's most lucrative and  last untapped market. Last weekend, the visiting French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur even gave China clear assurances his  government would not "interfere" in China's human rights issue.  Earlier, other Western leaders including German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and resigned Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa made similar pledges to China in their recent visits.    Meanwhile, Beijing has strengthened its bargaining position  in dealing with the Americans. The rift between the U.S. and  Japan and other Southeast Asian nations over trade issues has  weakened the U.S.'s status in pressing China for more  compromises both in trade and politics. China's role in  maintaining regional order has been measurably enhanced  following the North Korea nuclear crisis, in which Beijing's  attitude has been crucial. The communist leadership has  obviously became more confident than ever in obtaining  unconditional MFN this June.    In many ways, however, Wei's fate and the course of the  Sino-American struggle over the profitable trade status now seem  inextricably bound. He may end up hostage to the dispute. The  high risk Beijing is taking by threatening to jail Wei again and  rearresting a few other dissidents gives a strong indication how  much it fears just one man or a few. But the larger background  to this singular fear is the high level of public discontent in  China in recent months over its runaway economy, price hikes,  rampant corruption and other economic imbalances -- much the  same sort of mass discontent that set the stage for the  nationwide pro-democracy protests five years ago.    For the Chinese government, a free and outspoken Wei and a  handful of other dissidents pose a major threat. More than  anyone else, Wei has become the focal point for many  pro-democracy activists. The Chinese government is especially  worried about the potential for turmoil this spring, the fifth  anniversary of the 1989 democracy movement. Given widespread  discontent among masses, maintaining social stability has become  a catchword of Chinese politics these days and has been given  top priority in recent speeches by senior leaders. China's  season of silence is in full swing. Every spring, Beijing's  security apparatus, its relatively few dissidents and its  foreign press corps gear up for the anniversary of the 4 June  event. The fragility of the Communist Party's grip on power is  shown by the silence it tries to enforce on many matters. This  year, the crackdown on dissidents and foreign reporters has come  earlier than usual and tensions are greater than any time since  1989.    It thus may seem unfathomable that China would make the  mistake of handing a few dissidents out of 1.2 billion people so  much power by repeatedly harassing them under the spotlight of  the international news media. The explanation to this is  largely due to an increasingly fragile constitution for  89-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping.    Party leaders appear to agree with their critics that  conditions now are ripe for a huge social explosion. The  contradiction here is that while China is doing better than  ever, at the same time it appears set for another huge spasm.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho fills vacant posts Mr Robin Whitten, a chartered accountant who joined Lonrho in 1978, was named yesterday as Lonrho's new finance director at the same time as Mr Nicholas Morrell, another Lonrho stalwart, was appointed deputy managing director. The appointments were announced following the group's December board meeting, the first since Mr Dieter Boch, the German financier, won his year-long battle to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland to quit the Lonrho board. Lonrho has not had a finance director since Mr Terry Robinson left to become Union International's chief executive at the start of 1992. Since then Mr Whitten and Mr Morrell have been acting as the Lonrho board's finance committee. Mr Whitten has given recent City present- ations, so institutional investors are familiar with him. Their appointment to the two new roles is understood to reflect Mr Boch's desire to restructure executive responsibilities without bringing in new directors. He is chief executive and managing director. Mr Whitten was appointed a Lonrho director in 1981 and has been responsible for the group's Treasury functions, and for various operations in the UK and Africa. Mr Morrell joined Lonrho in 1981 and became managing director of The Observer in 1988. He was appointed an associate director in 1990 and a director in 1992 and is currently responsible for certain UK operations and for Lonrho's operations in Malawi, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.</p>

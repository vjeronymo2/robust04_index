			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] An almost hotly disputed region in the elections was  KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC accused the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  of all sorts of trickery, including stuffing ballot boxes and  setting up pirate polling stations. Inkatha counter-accused the  ANC of electoral skullduggery. In spite of that it looks as  though the IFP will be declared the winners in the region. The  ANC's president, Nelson Mandela, says the elections were free  and fair and that the KwaZulu problem should not be allowed to  overshadow that. My colleague Jeremy Skeet talked to the ANC  Chief in Natal Harry Gwala, and asked him what he would do if  Inkatha was declared the winner.    [Begin recording] [Gwala] If they are declared winners, and  with our protest -- we are making a fresh start. First time we  go for democratic elections in this country. We will protest,  but we won't seek to upset the apple cart. I am speaking for  the leadership now, but the leadership will have a problem here,  and then there is a serious problem. It may not be able to  contain the masses on the ground.    [Skeet] But what is your message to the comrades going to  be?    [Gwala] My message is not to my comrades. My message is to  those who have been conducting the elections, that think of the  consequences of an announcement you may make, because it may set  things ablaze. We don't want that sort of thing to happen. My  message is that you can even exclude Natal for the time being.  Hold celebrations of whatever you can, get the thing properly  sorted out before you make any announcements.    [Skeet] Don't you think the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] is in a difficult position? You have said stop the  announcement, but the Inkatha would say if we don't win this  there is also going to be trouble.    [Gwala] No, they don't have to announce. They have got to  take the matter to the government and wait for a political  decision.    [Skeet] So, you think that South Africa's first elections  should be decided on a political level?    [Gwala] If they could not be decided on the ballot boxes,  then we could have done something else, but here we are  satisfied that there were irregularities here and there -- I am  talking about other provinces now -- but you are not talking of  irregularities in Natal. We talking of downright corruption.  [end recording]</p>

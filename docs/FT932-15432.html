			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / A timid deficit reduction plan: America When President Bill Clinton unveiled his economic plan in February, my response was sceptical, bordering on hostile. Release of the full budget last week did nothing to dispel my reservations, although it is heartening that Congress is baulking at the least defensible elements of the plan, such as the short-term fiscal stimulus and the temporary business tax credit: an economy growing at 3 per cent does not need an artificial boost. However, I remain puzzled that the weak deficit-reduction proposals are so universally applauded. The planned Dollars 514bn of budget 'cuts' over five years are hailed as a monumental triumph - the biggest deficit reduction package in US history. But look more closely. The structural budget deficit (the deficit adjusted to reflect cyclical changes in economic activity) falls moderately in fiscal 1994 - to Dollars 205bn against an estimated Dollars 252bn this year. But thereafter Mr Clinton makes absolutely no progress. The structural deficit steadily rises to Dollars 242bn in fiscal 1998, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Seven years into an economic upturn, the underlying deficit is higher relative to national income than in the late 1980s. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which Mr Clinton once promised to reduce, is projected to rise steadily - from 51 per cent last year to 58 per cent in fiscal 1998. Congress can approve so many cuts and still fail to reduce the structural deficit because the US is a decade or more behind other countries in its handling of budgets. It still lives in the era of 'funny money': cuts are measured relative to the so-called 'current services' baseline, which assumes that cash spending is passively increased to reflect increases in the cost of public services and the number of recipients. When Mr Clinton talks about cutting Medicare, the health programme for the elderly, he is proposing to increase spending by 62 per cent in cash terms over five years, rather than the 75 per cent assumed in the current services baseline. This is the kind of austerity that a Democratic-controlled Congress can readily endorse. Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, says the likely decline in the deficit is understated because the budget uses especially conservative assumptions on growth and interest rates. Her own more optimistic forecasts indicate the federal deficit could fall as low as Dollars 160bn in fiscal 1997 (rather than the Dollars 214bn in the budget documents) compared with Dollars 322bn this year, thus fulfilling Mr Clinton's campaign pledge to 'halve the deficit' in four years. A strong recovery might indeed cut the deficit quickly. But if structural problems are not addressed, it would provide only a temporary reprieve - akin to the miraculous British surpluses of the late 1980s. My scepticism centres on the credibility of the spending projections. President George Bush wanted a smaller federal government but ended up presiding over an increase in expenditure of nearly 30 per cent in four years - in spite of curbs in defence spending. Mr Clinton is an enthusiastic proponent of bigger government and is launching a range of expensive - and largely unfunded - programmes, from big infrastructure projects to the National Service plan to subsidise college education. Yet he wants us to believe that the total increase in spending can be held to only 15 per cent over four years, half the rate of increase under President Bush. This hardly seems plausible, especially if you allow for the restructuring of healthcare, a sector that accounts for nearly a seventh of the economy. While intended to curb costs in the longer run, the reforms planned by the White House threaten a steep increase in spending over the next few years. Extending coverage to the 15 per cent of the population now uninsured and guaranteeing everybody a generous package of benefits that includes items such as mental health care and long-term nursing home care (which are not included in most existing private insurance schemes) could cause an explosive increase in demand for medical services. And in the approach to the 1994 mid-term congressional elections, it is doubtful that Mr Clinton will offset these pressures with draconian controls on doctors and hospitals. The revenue side of the equation is no more robust. To fund an extension of government services, Mr Clinton needs either an across-the-board increase in income taxes or a broad-based consumption levy, such as the European value added tax. He is instead relying on sharp increases in marginal rates on the top 1 per cent and a narrow energy tax. The rich will dodge higher taxes either by simply reporting less income or by converting it into capital gains, which will be taxed at the old lower rate. Congress, meanwhile, is likely to scale back the already modest energy tax. The White House claims that more aggressive attempts to curb the deficit would only imperil the economic recovery. Yet if it is safe to cut the structural deficit by more than Dollars 40bn next year why are similar cuts not possible in later years when the recovery, presumably, will be more mature? The truth is that the Clinton administration, contrary to its rhetoric, has yet to start making hard decisions on either spending or taxes.</p>

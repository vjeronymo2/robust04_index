			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Yoweri Museveni by correspondent </F> Judy Aslett in Kampala on 7 June; from the "Channel Four  Newscast" -- recorded]    [Text] [Aslett] Do you accept any responsibility for the  activities of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]?    [Museveni] The only possible role Uganda played was one of  example, because we also had our own problems here. We managed  to fight the dictatorship and overthrow it, and those young  people who were living here, they saw what we were doing, and as  people with problems they said OK, maybe we can do the same in  our own country -- you know the infectiousness, the contagion of  ideas, how ideas spread.    [Aslett] Yesterday a senior Rwandan Government official  accused you of supplying arms to the RPF, are you?    [Museveni] We are not supplying the RPF, that used to be the  old accusation. We invited the United Nations to come and  station themselves on the border -- right now they are there so  this is all rubbish.    [Aslett] What has been your advice to the RPF, do you think  this war is winnable?    [Museveni] It is possible they can take power, it is  possible  but they will have to do it slowly because they don't have the  equipment. This is also another contradiction because if we  were backing them as some people say, they would have very  modern equipment -- more modern, they would fight a fast war,  but the equipment they have from my intelligence is that it is a  type that cannot fight a quick war. They may be good fighters,  they may win in the end, but it will have to be slow, and the  slower it is the bigger the humanitarian problems will become,  displacement and so on and so forth. Since the (Arusha)  agreement provided for power sharing, and since the recent  resolution about the genocide provided for a international  commission of inquiry, and also for an international tribunal to  try the criminals, I think this would be a good moment to  accept a cease-fire, and then utilize those two documents.    [Aslett] Do you think the United Nations has been slow to  react to the war in Rwanda?    [Museveni] My answer is yes it has been too slow; that is A.  But B: I don't know whether it could act faster, I am not so  very sure that it could.    [Aslett] What do you see as the solution, how will the war  be  resolved?    [Museveni] Collective influence by all of us to keep on  advising, talking.    [Aslett] Do you think it is possible in Rwanda?    [Museveni] I think so, because they have to either continue  fighting or to have peace, that is the only alternative they  have.</p>

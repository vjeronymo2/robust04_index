			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS MISSION STOPPED BY HARBOR  </P> <P> Mission College, the vagabond of junior college baseball, is still searching  for a home to call its own.  </P> <P> The Free Spirit, which has no campus and, therefore, no campus facility,  utilizes Valley College for home games -- unless, of course, Valley has a home  contest scheduled for the same day.  </P> <P> That was the case Tuesday when Mission was forced to entertain top-ranked  Harbor at Pierce College while Valley played host to Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Mission lost, 12-5, in a Southern California Athletic Conference game that  wasn't really decided until Ryan Karp blasted a three-run home run in the  eighth inning.  </P> <P> Harbor improved to 23-6 and 6-0 in conference play. Mission is 13-7-1 and 5-2.  </P> <P> Mission entered the game battling for first place and while the Free Spirit may  not have a home under second-year Coach John Klitsner, it has established  residence among the competitive teams in the junior college ranks.  </P> <P> "I think they're the most improved team in the state from last season," Harbor  Coach Jim O'Brien said of the Free Spirit.  </P> <P> Indeed, Mission was 10-23 overall and 8-12 in conference play last season.  </P> <P> Klitsner, a successful coach at Sylmar High, has turned around Mission's  program by recruiting successfully, teaching fundamentals and forcing his  players to take pride in their effort.  </P> <P> The difference in Mission is evident. Billy Picketts, a former standout at  College of the Canyons who now plays at Cal State Los Angeles, was in the  bleachers Tuesday and flatly stated what everybody already knew: "Mission used  to be an automatic win."  </P> <P> Note the past tense.  </P> <P> The Free Spirit, which launched successful comebacks against East Los Angeles,  Valley and Pierce, once again had victory within its grasp against Harbor.  </P> <P> Trailing, 6-3, Mission rallied for two runs in the seventh on consecutive  singles by Chris Romo and Shawn Fontenot and a run-scoring single by Rich  Ortiz.  </P> <P> Mission reliever Jose Garcia issued consecutive walks to open the eighth before  he was chased by Karp, who crushed a pitch over the right-field fence. Harbor  added another run in the eighth and two more in the ninth for its final margin  of victory.  </P> <P> "We have an experienced team with a lot of sophomores," O'Brien said. "These  guys don't fold if the game is close or we get behind."  </P> <P> In defeat, Mission still demonstrated several of the elements that have made  the Free Spirit a contender for the playoffs -- and possibly a conference  title.  </P> <P> Sophomore left-hander Nick Lymberopoulos, who transferred from Canyons, held  Harbor hitless for 4 2/3 innings before surrendering a double to Matt Nuez.  </P> <P> Ortiz had three hits and Fontenot had two hits and drove in a run.  </P> <P> Had it been any school except Harbor, probably the deepest team in the state,  Mission might have scraped out another victory. But the Free Spirit will get a  chance to avenge the defeat when Mission travels to Harbor on Thursday.  </P> <P> Klitsner is confident that his team will continue to improve and that the Free  Spirit is no longer a prisoner to its past.  </P> <P> "People are saying Mission isn't going to quit and you hope that your kids buy  into that," Klitsner said. "I'm not surprised at where we're at."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE COUNTY 1990-1991 RESOLUTIONS  </P> <P> " I resolve to fight to keep a regional airport out of southern Orange County  and offshore oil drilling rigs off our coastline. I resolve to successfully  push the adoption of an ordinance limiting terms on the Dana Point City Council  to two consecutive terms and the adoption of an ordinance limiting campaign  contributions for Dana Point City Council races. I will try to figure out a way  we can finish our City Council meetings by 11 p.m. and, finally, to enjoy  public service while not taking the title honorable too seriously.  </P></p>

This is an important legal  basis for our country's legal administration of finance, as well  as a vital step in strengthening the construction of a socialist  legal system.    Budgeting is one of the key means for a country to manage  its  social and economic affairs and implement macroscopic regulation  and has a very important position in the whole country's  political and economic life. As early as the initial period of  our country's founding, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The  state budget is a big issue which reflects the whole country's  policies because it prescribes the scope and direction of  government activities." Over the past 40 years or so, our  country's budget administrative work has constantly improved and  strengthened, whereas all the people strived to earn more and  spend less, ensure the supply of funds for key construction  projects, and promote the rapid development of the undertaking  of building socialism. The achievement has been remarkable.    However, we should also see that over a long period of time,  we have not drawn up a basic law in budget administration, and  there are a lot of problems in working out, examining and  approving, implementing, revising, finally accounting, and  supervising a budget. For example, the procedure for working  out a budget is unclear, the rights and duties of budget  administration are not defined, the procedure for examining and  approving the budget are not strict, we are not conscientious in  implementing the budget, and we are slack in budget supervision.  As a result, budgets do not have the necessary legal solemnity,  thus leading to the emergence of such phenomena as overspending  and capital waste. The implementation of the "Budget Law" will  definitely help overcome the above-mentioned problems, heighten  the legal effect of budgets at all levels, and give full play to  the various functions of a budget. Meanwhile, the "Budget Law"  has an important bearing on ensuring the smooth implementation  of financial and taxation reform, strengthening the State's  macroscopic regulation, and promoting the healthy development of  the socialist market economy.    The "Budget Law" unequivocally prescribes the duties and  competence of the budget administrations of people's congresses,  governments, departments, and units at all levels. Thus, organs  of power and executive organs at all levels are requested to  handle their work in strict accordance with legal provisions to  ensure the true implementation of the "Budget Law." People's  congresses and their standing committees at all levels must, in  light of the provisions of the "Budget Law," conscientiously  exercise the power of examining and approving budgets and final  accounts, the power of examining and approving budget revisions,  the power of supervising budgets and final accounts, and other  functions, thus making their budgets genuine indexes.  Governments at all levels must work in strict accordance with  the provisions of the "Budget Law" to conscientiously draft  their budgets and final accounts and organize well budget  implementation. On discovering any violation of the provisions  of the "Budget Law," they should seriously handle it,  conscientiously correct it, and thoroughly stop practices  transgressing budget provisions to safeguard the legal solemnity  of budgets. Financial departments at all levels and various  departments and units must also exercise their functions and  perform various duties undertaken by them in accordance with the  law.    With the implementation of the "Budget Law," the work of  budget administration will advance to a new stage on a  legalized, standardized, and scientific path, thus enabling the  work of budgeting to make new contributions to the establishment  and development of the socialist market economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/63: "Commission Backs Customs </F> Corridor as Part of Transit Package for Balkans"]    [Text] The European Commission has decided to back the  creation of a Balkan customs corridor as part of a wider  initiative and could commit over ECU100 million through its  PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]  program in 1994 to help improve transit to and from Balkan  states most affected by the UN sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro. The Commission's initiative is to be formally  unveiled at the CSCE conference taking place in Vienna today and  tomorrow.    The Commission's Balkans initiative falls into four  parts:     -  Support for the Balkans customs corridor;    -  A series  of short-term actions to address the most serious bottlenecks in  the Balkans;    -  A medium-term plan to focus European Union  investment on a number of "multi-modal" corridors identified by  Balkan states themselves as alternatives to the trans-Yugoslav  route;    -  Channeling further funds from the PHARE program into the  construction of roads, ferry connections, customs posts and  other needs identified by those Balkan states suffering most  from the sanctions.  <H5>  Balkan Customs Corridor </H5>   Civil war in the former Yugoslavia has caused severe delays  and loss of trade resulting from the closure of road, rail and  other traffic routes.    The Commission believes that the establishment of a corridor  passing through adjacent countries will greatly alleviate  congestion if customs procedures are streamlined sufficiently.  Furthermore, suitable technical assistance should enable such a  corridor to be in place by this summer.    The Commission will therefore urge the Vienna conference,  due  to discuss ways of helping those countries suffering from the  sanctions, to consider the following proposals. The Commission  believes that if followed, these proposals would ensure that  trucks are delayed at borders for no more than one hour:  Certain border posts should be reserved only for transit  traffic carrying valid clearance documents (the TIR  [international road transportation] carnet), enabling them to  avoid normal traffic queues at customs. At other posts, where  sufficient space is available, special "fast lanes" should then  be created for those holding the TIR documents. Furthermore,  two corridors should be assigned -- between Austria and  Greece/Turkey, and between Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and  Ukraine -- and priority border posts will be nominated by the  countries concerned. Valid TIR carnets could only be obtained,  and the transit operation ended, at inland customs houses.  <H5>  Tackling the Most Serious Bottlenecks - Short Term </H5>   Through the PHARE program, which channels over ECU1 billion  of assistance every year to promote market economies in Central  and East Europe, the Commission will identify the main transit  bottlenecks and short-term projects for possible financing by  PHARE. A plan for dealing with them will be submitted to the  G-24 transport group for discussion in mid-April.  <H5>  Planning for the Medium and Long Term </H5>   The Commission is participating in the "pan-European  indicative plan for transport infrastructure development,"  through which the Balkan states have identified a series of  multi-modal corridors toreplace the trans-Yugoslav route. This  will be presented to European transport ministers in Crete on  March 14. The plan is intended to guide governments and  international financial institutions in the way they invest in  infrastructure in East Europe, helping them to avoid overlap  between such investments.    PHARE is also preparing a study on the best site for a new  bridge across the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania, although  disagreements persist between those countries. In addition,  PHARE will ensure that short-term transport projects tie in with  longer- term priorities.  <H5>  Channeling Further Funds from PHARE </H5>   Over the next four months, the Commission, through the PHARE  program, will discuss with the countries worst affected by the  UN sanctions additional ways of alleviating their most pressing  transport problems.    The following are examples of projects which will either  move  into action this year or will be budgeted in 1994 for action  later:     -  Development of a ferry terminal in Calafat,  Romania;    -  Upgrading customs procedures between Romania and  Hungary at Nagylak/Nadlac;    -  Cofinancing with the EIB [European  Investment Bank], the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development] and the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction  and Development] of the rehabilitation of roads in Romania;    -  The  upgrading of the road from Vidin to Sofia; and the upgrading of  the road from Tirana to Dures and Rogozhine.  <H5>  Overall Funding </H5>   Around ECU100 million could be made available through the  PHARE budget to improve transit to and from the Balkans,  provided the beneficiary countries give transport the urgency it  requires when they draw up their own priorities for PHARE  spending. Much of this funding is part of long-term programs  which fit into a coherent overall framework and will provide  long-term benefits to the countries concerned as well as  alleviating the current bottlenecks.</p>

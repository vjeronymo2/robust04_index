			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1993 Order authorized HEC to provide energy management and DSM services without limitation to customers within the Region and, to a limited extent, to customers outside the Region subject to the requirement that the revenues from the former not exceed the revenues from the latter (``Fifty-Percent Standard''). The 1993 Order imposed no restriction on revenues from consulting services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEC Canada and HECI would provide energy management and DSM services outside the Region. The application-declaration proposes, however, that the Fifty-Percent Standard be applicable to the revenues, from energy management and DSM services, of HEC combined with those of HEC Canada and one-half of those of HECI. HEC proposes that there be no restriction on revenues of HEC Canada and HECI from consulting services. The definitions of energy management services, DSM services, and consulting services used in the application-declaration are consistent with the definitions of energy management services, DSM services, and consulting services used in the 1993 Order. Pursuant to terms and conditions discussed in the 1993 Order, HEC Canada and HECI also would design and market Intellectual Property, the definition of which is consistent with that used in the 1993 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to HEC Canada, HEC would advance monies needed by HEC Canada to operate through June 30, 1996. The investments by HEC in HEC Canada, which would not exceed $1.5 million would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances and/or subordinated loans. The source of those investments would include internal funds and loans through the Money Pool. The interest rate on open account advances and subordinated loans to HEC Canada would equal the interest rate in effect on HEC's loans through the Money Pool. The maximum term of such loans would not exceed five years and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. However, to the extent that the advances and/or loans are HEC loans through the Money Pool, the term and maturity date of such advances and/or loans would equal those of the loans through the Money Pool. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to HECI, HEC would advance monies needed by HEC International for its one-half share of HECI costs. The investments by HEC in HEC International would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances and/or subordinated loans. The sources of those investments would include internal funds and loans through the Money Pool. The interest rate on open account advances and subordinated loans to HEC International would equal the interest rate on HEC's loans through the Money Pool. The maximum term of such loans would not exceed five years and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. However, to the extent that the advances and/or loans are HEC loans through the Money Pool, the term and maturity date of such advances and/or loans would equal those of the loans through the Money Pool. The investments by HEC in HEC International and other financial, performance or contractual guarantees by HEC to HECI will not exceed either $2.5 million or one-half of its total costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 10, 1993, HEC and BCI, which is based in Oakland, California and which provides economic and management consulting services to utilities and energy companies, signed a letter of intent for the formation, upon Commission approval, of HECI under the laws of California. BCI and HEC International would each fund one-half of the expenses for HECI in the form of open account advances through June 30, 1996. The interest on these advances would equal the interest rate on loans or advances to HEC International from HEC. The maximum term of advances to HECI would not exceed five years and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. Advances and direct payments by HEC International to HECI and other costs associated with HECI would not exceed $2.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HECI proposes to enter into an agreement with HEC and BCI to subcontract for services at cost. This agreement would prohibit HEC and BCI competition with HECI. Except for some retained earnings in HECI, all of its profits, after repayment to HEC International and BCI for their respective contributions, advances and loans, would be split on a fifty-fifty basis between HEC International and BCI. The management committee of HECI will consist of a representative of BCI, a representative of HEC International and the HECI manager. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HECI activities might result in projects that require investments by one or both of the participants in the form of additional loans to HECI. In that event, the participant will be paid an interest rate and fees that reflect the risk of the investment. Such loans will be project-specific and depend on revenues generated by the project for payment of interest and principal. The interest rate on such loans would not exceed 17%. The term for these loans would not exceed three years, and the maturity date for such loans would be no later than June 30, 1999. Profits after the return of capital and interest and fees will accrue to HECI. Such loans by HEC International and/or BCI to HECI each would be subject to the overall aggregate limitation of $2.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HECI might also subcontract with HEC for construction and engineering services, financing, performance and other contractual guarantees. The maximum commitment and/or exposure of HEC in this regard would be considered a contribution from HEC to HECI and would be subject to the overall aggregate limitation on such contributions of $2.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Central and South West Corporation, et al.

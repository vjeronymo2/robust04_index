			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on joint news conference by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F> leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and Gerhard  Frey, leader of the German People's Union by correspondent R.  Safronov; place and date not given; from the "Vesti" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Safronov] Today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his  German friend, Gerhard Frey, leader of the German People's Union  [Deutsche Volksunion], held a joint news conference.    Both talked of their attachment to German-Russian  friendship.  Frey reproved a number of German journalists who write  disrespectfully about the future Russian president.  Zhirinovskiy predicted the emergence of a Moscow-Berlin axis  and added Delhi -- evidently in connection with [his book]: "The  Last Push South."    In his words, the present government would fall in the  autumn  without having solved a single problem and then the president  himself would invite him to Zavidovo and would entrust him with  the mandate to form a government. At the very worst, he was  ready to head one of the power ministries or the Foreign  Ministry.    In three months, according to him, the government of the  single unblemished party -- the Liberal Democratic Party --  would root out 5,000 armed gangs, put an end to military  conversion, and completely cut off neighboring republics.  Zhirinovskiy denied that criminal proceedings had been  instigated against him, accusing him of propagating war in  connection with his book "The Last Push South." He stressed  that everything would occur without a single shot being fired.  First, Russia would withdraw its troops from the south and then  the peoples there, beset by conflict, would ask to be put under  Russian dominion.    As for his coming visit to Europe, Zhirinovskiy said that he  was interested in the present and that was why he did not plan  to visit Auschwitz and Dachau.    [Zhirinovskiy] I am only in the capital for a few hours --  Ljubljana, Belgrade, Warsaw -- and millions of people are  standing there shouting: Russia, Russians, we are behind you.  They kiss my hand, throw flowers at my feet, and I have  difficulty escaping back to Moscow.    [Safronov] In characteristic form, Zhirinovskiy promised a  permanent tundra residence permit for journalists who slandered  him.</p>

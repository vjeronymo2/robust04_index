			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Picasso put in perspective - This week saw the opening of one of the most memorable exhibitions ever mounted by the Tate Gallery There have been many exhibitions of the work of Picasso the sculptor - most notably the pioneering study undertaken for the Arts Council by Roland Penrose in 1967, with the active co-operation of Picasso himself, then 86. That, too, was shown at the Tate. But between that and this present exercise there lies a profound difference. Picasso: Painter/Sculptor is the first exhibition of such scale and definitive ambition to take as its subject not either aspect as a distinct, if complementary, practice, but rather each as necessary to the other, each feeding off the other and integral to the one, constant, creative activity. Picasso turned to sculpture for the first time, so far as is known, around 1906, a moment of transition that saw him moving from the sweeter symbolism of his early career, blue and rose, to something much more raw and radical. Now, in these gently modelled heads of his mistress and companion of those early years, Fernande Olivier, we see him quietly looking sideways at his contemporaries, Rodin, Maillol, Brancusi and Matisse. We also clearly see in the paintings and drawings around us that he is looking back to the radical pictorial devices of Cezanne, and to the formal simplicity and energy of primitive Iberian and tribal sculpture. And yet he remains entirely himself. Already, with the Demoiselles d'Avignon, that savage precursor of cubism, in gestation and the simple monumental heads and figures spread all about us, his own formal resolution of his several interests begins to declare itself in all its revolutionary confidence and authority. The work of this first room and period alone makes the point for the entire exhibition, as we move from the early sculptural nudes and heads to the first extraordinary essays into cubism. And for the first time the point is made, and made forcibly, that cubism was not simply an exercise in reforming and reworking the idea of rendering space and form on a plane surface. Rather it is the essential, albeit mutually contradictory, interdependence of the flat and the round, the real and the proposed, that is being explored and celebrated. By 1909 and the Head of a Woman (Fernande), with its faceted, disrupted, almost pictorial surfaces that would yet flatten and deny its own undeniable mass and physical presence, we have what is still one of the most remarkable and truly revolutionary works of the century. To confront it is to be thrown straight back to the cubist drawings and paintings to which it relates. And they again, by the very mass and weight, space and light that they conjure up on the flat surface, throw us back directly to the sculpture. Picasso was not always engaged with sculpture through that long career, but it is now clear that there was a sculptural potential or possibility in whatever he did. Whenever he was directly so engaged, the sculpture he produced was always keyed closely in to whatever else was in hand, used directly to clarify the painterly preoccupation. But to use the distinction 'painterly' at all is almost to mistake the point, for it is rather the artist's preoccupation that was ever to be clarified, indifferently in terms of paint or clay, ink or paper, pot or plaster as appropriate. Here are two late cubist still-lifes of 1914, a glass on a shelf, a knife, a scrap of newsprint, a piece of cheese, a decorative border - only one is cobbled together of wood and fabric all painted up, and its glass a flat piece of wood, its wine a neat pictorial trick. Again, in 1919, a still-life, guitar and mirror, is set up at an open window at Saint-Raphael, and a maquette of folded paper devised as its actual subject. So the game goes on down the years - inside and outside, the modelled form, the flat illusion, the painted surface that bespeaks the form, the form that confounds itself. Still-life is perhaps the key to it, if we take the term in the broadest sense: the model, the cat, the pots and flowers, all the paraphernalia and detritus of studio practice, the accumulation of work against the wall, half-finished, half-forgotten. And constantly the work itself is fed back into the work, the work of art as its own still life, as familiar in paint as in the round - the woman's head, goat's skull, bottle, guitar. How various the man is. Picasso was born in 1881. He embarked upon his cubist adventure before he was 30 and he continued active into the 1970s. And yet there are still those who would deny the worth of his achievement, who consider him no more than a skilful and mischievous fraud. No one would deny Picasso the mischief, but fraud, never. Given such full retrospective scope as now, the quality of his transforming imagination and his technical mastery alike are manifest in everything he did, as clear in every touch of paint on a surface as in every twist or fold of paper, or pinch of clay or plaster. A natural painter, an instinctive sculptor, his standing as the commanding artist of our century is obvious and inescapable. This exhibition has been selected and introduced by Elizabeth Cowling and John Golding, and beautifully judged and installed. They have produced one of those rare shows, sure to live on long in the memory. Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until May 8: sponsored by Ernst &amp; Young.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a recent issue of Interfax-Exclusive you met the  Vice-Premier of Tatarstan Ravil Muratov who thinks that his  republic has not fully used the possibilities offered to it by  the treaty with Moscow on the separation of powers. This time  FARID MUKHAMETSHIN, the chairman of the Tatar parliament,  expresses his opinion.    IF: Do you think the leadership of Tatarstan has properly  used the situation of the past two years for conducting economic  reforms?    MUKHAMETSHIN: The cabinet managed to offer social security  to the population which is important. However, not burdened by  big payments to the federal budget last year and having  advantageous conditions for oil experts the government should  have used the situation more actively and launched economic  reforms creating favorable conditions for small and medium-sized  business. Unfortunately, the government was more concerned about  the optimal distribution of the shrinking means it had than  about finding new sources of increasing the budget.    During the latest session of parliament the Tatar budget  came  under justified criticism. An analysis of the revenue and  spending indicates that the government approach to the economy  is conservative.    IF: In the absence of its own economic program can Tatarstan  collect the planned revenue by increasing the tax burden of  unprofitable companies and impoverished population?    MUKHAMETSHIN: The parliament approved the budget on  condition that the government works out an anti-crisis program  within a month's time. If the government has collected merely  400 million rubles in the first four months, one can hardly  expect it to collect three trillion by the end of the year.  Therefore the main task of the cabinet now is to define  priority industries and companies that will be given tax  benefits, to work out an effective policy of credits and agree  with the federal government on a program of reducing mutual  debts that now total two trillion.    IF: If this was not done in two years, why do you think the  cabinet is going to find a way out of the crisis in one month?    MUKHAMETSHIN: I think a month is enough. The anti-crisis  program will rely on the resources of Tatarstan as well as  outside resources. Today many companies have their own programs  and some have even partly carried them out. They should only be  helped and by the end of the year they can stabilize their  finances.    The bankruptcy law should be used and the anti-monopoly  committee should be forced to work. Being a part of the  economic space of the Russian Federation Tatarstan naturally  attaches great significance to coordinating its economic policy  with the federal government. This implies the opening of  centralized credit lines for agriculture and related industries,  investments in federal programs etc.    The agreement signed with the Russian government allows the  Tatar National Bank to vary lending rates and this should also  be used. But it must not be forgotten that Russia has the same  problems as we do. We intend to take most active part in  working out federal programs. The Tatar government might invite  outside economists to work on our economic strategy. Talks are  under way, but it is too early to name anyone personally.    IF: The parliament did not raise the question of a separate  economic policy. Moreover, the prime-minister has declared that  Tatarstan will follow the political line of Russia.    MUKHAMETSHIN: An absolutely independent economic policy is  hardly possible today. However, one should not say that  Tatarstan intends to drift along with Russian reforms. Local  conditions will be taken into account and appropriate amendments  made.    IF: Do you think there is a cabinet crisis in Tatarstan?  Some political forces believe that the prime-minister must  resign giving his place to a reformer.    MUKHAMETSHIN: I think it is too early to speak of the  resignation of the cabinet. Everything is going to depend on  the implementation of the anti-crisis program.    IF: Was the budget debate during the latest session natural  or was it a manifestation of the conflict between the parliament  and government?    MUKHAMETSHIN: The budget is always lobbied by certain  groups: industrialists, farmers, bankers, that is why its  adoption is always a compromise. During the debate I did not  notice any wish of MPs to call of the replacement of some  cabinet members or the cabinet as a whole even though its  capacity to carry out radical reforms was questioned by some  speakers.    IF: Some observers believe that during the past two years  the Tatar leadership has been more concerned about political,  domestic and foreign problems than an economic strategy. Do you  agree with that? After all social security, support for  agriculture are largely a survival program. Do they have a  future or will they have to be curtailed?    MUKHAMETSHIN: It is true that much money was spent to keep  up stability. The leadership felt that this is necessary  otherwise the public would have turned its back on reforms. Now  a new stage has begun and we must protect the rights we received  from the federal government to prove the vitality of sovereign  Tatarstan. After signing the treaty with Moscow on the  separation of powers the entire responsibility for reforms lies  on local leaders.</p>

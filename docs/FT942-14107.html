			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Market turmoil hits trading profits at Bankers Trust The turmoil in international financial markets in February and March all but wiped out reported trading profits at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank which has been one of the pioneers of the derivatives markets in recent years. The bank said trading income was Dollars 14m in the first quarter, down from a record Dollars 449m in the previous three months and Dollars 346m in the first quarter of 1993. It said this did not represent a complete picture of overall trading results. Some Dollars 177m, reported as net interest income, had been earned on holdings of bonds. If this is added in, overall trading income was Dollars 191m, compared with Dollars 463m last year. The bank blamed the decline on 'sharply lower revenue from proprietary trading and positioning activities'. Trading in foreign exchange, government bonds and emerging market debt and equity securities suffered the most, it said. The fall in trading income was offset in part by higher income from selling derivatives and other risk-management instruments, it added. These activities are under a cloud following threatened legal action last week by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, which incurred after-tax losses of Dollars 102m on two interest rate swaps contracts it bought from Bankers Trust. Mr Charles Sanford, Bankers Trust chairman and chief executive, told the annual meeting: 'We will win if they (Procter &amp; Gamble) want to sue us.' He declined to comment on the specifics of the case, other than to say Bankers Trust has no legal liability. Despite the deteriorating trading results, the bank limited the fall in its after-tax profits to Dollars 164m, or Dollars 1.90 a share, from Dollars 230m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, a year ago (before accounting changes). Bonuses paid to staff tumbled by Dollars 109m, to Dollars 162m. Other sources of income, such as fund management fees and other fees and commissions, rose by around Dollars 100m.</p>

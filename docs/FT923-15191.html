			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ferranti head gets 21% rise MR EUGENE Anderson, chairman and chief executive of Ferranti International, received a 20.8 per cent pay rise last year despite having described the electronics and defence group's performance in the year to March 31 1992 as 'unsatisfactory'. Mr Anderson, who joined from Johnson Matthey in 1990 following the discovery of huge fraud in a Ferranti subsidiary, received total emoluments of Pounds 464,000 compared to Pounds 384,000 a year earlier. The rise, however, followed a pay cut from Pounds 619,000 in 1990. Last week Ferranti reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 39.6m (Pounds 98.1m) for the year to March 31.</p>

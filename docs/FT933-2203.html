			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian Industries in flotation move AUSTRIAN Industries, the troubled state-owned metals and engineering group, has proposed hiving off several subsidiaries and then floating at least half of its equity in international capital markets early next year. SG Warburg, which advised AI on the scheme, said the slimmed-down group, consisting only of its steel and related engineering businesses, would have a market value of about Sch15bn (Dollars 1.33bn). Both AI and the Austrian government have long wanted to proceed with a flotation, not least because of the existence of a Sch3bn 'going public' AI bond issue which is convertible into shares until 1995. But they have been frustratedby spectacular losses at the group's Austria Metal (AMAG) aluminium subsidiary. These are likely to reach Sch13bn in the three years to 1994, swamping the profitability of the group's core businesses. AI's main proposals are to sell all its non-core subsidiaries, including AMAG, back to its parent company, Oesterreichische Industriebeteiligungs (OIAG). On 1992 figures, this would leave a group with sales of Sch59.6bn, operating profits of Sch991m and net debt of Sch3.2bn, 23 per cent of shareholders'funds. A few of the subsidiaries to be hived off, such as the Bohler Uddeholm special steels business and the VA Bergtechnik mining equipment unit, are successful and could be floated at a later time. Siemens has agreed to buy the SGP Verkehrstechnik railway equipment subsidiary. Mr Michael Sekyra, AI chief executive, said the government had broadly accepted the plan and a final decision was expected next month. The key to its success was for the government to underwrite the losses of AMAG until OIAG was able to sell off other holdings. The government's problem is that it has promised not to commit any more taxpayers' money to the accident-prone nationalised industries. AI has proposed that it provide a temporary guarantee for OIAG borrowing, and it appears that this has been accepted.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Price for BTG sale is agreed THE government has been unable to agree the completion accounts for the sale last year of the British Technology Group to a management-led consortium, but has split the difference with the purchasers so that the initial proceeds of the sale remain unchanged at Pounds 27.75m. The decision is likely to lead to criticism that the government did not maximise its profits from the privatisation of the agency for backing inventors. Mr Edward Leigh, the junior trade and industry minister, told MPs yesterday that although the two sides had been unable to agree the accounts they had agreed that no payment should be made either way. The government insists that the arrangement represents the best deal available, because there was a strong case on both sides of the argument, and by agreeing to differ, both parties have saved the cost of taking the disagreement to an independent arbitrator. The arrangement does not affect the further payments - that could reach several millions of pounds - that will be made for the technology-transfer organisation over the five years after the sale if BTG's net income from patent royalties exceeds a base level agreed with the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

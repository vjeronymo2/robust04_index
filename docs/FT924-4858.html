			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Europe's flexible friend: Martin Bangemann, European Commission vice-president, talks to Andrew Hill Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the European Commission and former German economics minister, is used to being misrepresented in the press. He says it does not bother him: 'If people start with a horrible vision of you, they can only be pleasantly surprised.' Many people in Europe have built up a horrible vision of Mr Bangemann since 1989, when he became Germany's senior commissioner, responsible for the internal market and industrial policy. According to the extensive Bangemann mythology, this is the man who tried to ban the UK prawn-cocktail crisp, to outlaw dozens of traditional unpasteurised cheeses, and to eradicate the Spanish tilde - the squiggle over the 'n' of Espana - in the interests of EC harmonisation. In fact, Mr Bangemann perpetrated none of these alleged crimes against national sovereignty but as internal market commissioner he was held responsible. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the bulky commissioner has frequently trodden on people's toes. Earlier this year, for example, he attacked officials in the Commission's competition directorate, describing them as 'ayatollahs' and 'gurus', for their over-legalistic approach to anti-trust policy. And this month, Mr Bangemann infuriated a nervous UK government with - in the words of Prime Minister John Major - a 'very silly and ill-informed' speech linking the Maastricht treaty to federalism on the eve of the British parliament's vote on ratification. Today, Mr Bangemann may upset the British again. He is attending a meeting of EC immigration ministers in London, armed with a Commission legal opinion that says Britain must lift its border controls on travellers within the EC on January 1 1993. But Mr Bangemann, 58, will not be demanding satisfaction from Britain - or from the 11 other EC members, which are also beginning to express doubts about the wisdom of lifting controls so soon. He says he will look for a practical solution to the problem. Mr Bangemann has a doctorate in law, but he claims to be, above all, a pragmatist and a politician. 'People who stick to a theory are always better off, (than pragmatists) because they appear completely pure and consistent.' Mr Bangemann believes his pragmatism is one reason why he has been criticised as inconsistent. This is one element of the principal charge against the commissioner - that he is a political lightweight. Another is his apparent reluctance to bury himself in complex dossiers. Although he is eloquent, affable and erudite, national and Commission officials say he lacks the taste for detail which is the strongpoint of commissioners such as Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for competition and financial services. His political flexibility has come under fire before. When Mr Bangemann was German economics minister, between 1984 and 1988, he disappointed his own party - the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - by championing the controversial takeover of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB), the aerospace company, by Daimler-Benz, the German motor group. His party colleagues and the German cartel office believed the merger would distort competition and reinforce Daimler's dominance. Mr Bangemann still dismisses these complaints. A merger was essential to give the German company the strength to take part in civil aircraft programmes, he argues. In Brussels, he has continued to eschew the narrow, legal approach and favour the flexible political solution. In framing an industrial policy, for example, Mr Bangemann and his officials have tried not to be hamstrung either by free-trade or protectionist prescriptions for industry. According to the Commission's 1990 paper on industrial policy, political authorities should aim to put in place a suitable environment in which business can flourish, for example by encouraging the development of the single market and global free trade. 'Protectionists must be persuaded to cease subsidising industrial policy and orthodox economists have to admit that ideal societies do not exist,' says Mr Bangemann in a recent book on industrial policy. 'A European industrial policy must find a reasonable compromise between the two extremes.' The central example of Mr Bangemann's practical approach was last year's voluntary agreement with Tokyo to restrain the import of Japanese cars, while gradually removing national quotas within the EC. That deal, he says, found a middle line between leaving protectionist restrictions in place, and opening the market suddenly - an option which might have destroyed an unprepared EC industry. At the time, however, the accord was also attacked for being non-binding - hallmarks of a delicate compromise. The real debate over industrial policy in the past four years has been fought over competition cases, specifically on mergers, where Brussels has substantial autonomous powers to affect the structure of European industry. Mr Bangemann argues that industry policy is not at odds with competition policy - a view shared by Sir Leon Brittan, and outlined in the November 1990 paper. 'We have said that the first aim of our industrial policy is to contribute as far as possible to the competitiveness of European industry,' says Mr Bangemann. But he adds: 'The main question in that context is how to define competition and what measures are necessary to improve competitiveness.' This is where Mr Bangemann and Sir Leon have found themselves at loggerheads. Mr Bangemann says his target is not Sir Leon himself, but the 'backward-looking, theoretical approach' of some of the Commission's competition officials. 'They always tend to define competition in legal terms, in abstract terms, and that is not right because competition is changing day by day,' he says. Mr Bangemann maintains, for example, that the Commission should have waved through last year's controversial takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. A favourable decision would have created a European force in the world market for commuter aircraft, Mr Bangemann claimed at the time. Sir Leon won the day. But Mr Bangemann has continued to claim that he got the De Havilland recommendation wrong. He maintains that the competition commissiner defined the market too narrowly, exaggerating the deal's impact. This is one issue on which Mr Bangemann, for all his pragmatism, appears unshakeable. Another is federalism, the theme of his speech in Berlin earlier this month which so incensed Mr Major. In the speech, Mr Bangemann reiterated his view that the Maastricht treaty points towards a federal European state. This was the sort of comment he had made 'a hundred times in the past', Mr Bangemann says. But, given that the British government was about to risk defeat from the opposition and some of its own back-benchers on Maastricht, were the timing and tone of the speech rather insensitive? 'If I'd said something different when (integration) was the subject of the conference, people would have been really astonished,' he replies. In spite of the EC's trials, the commissioner is relaxed about the Community's prospects, even if the result is a two-speed Europe. 'If Maastricht fails then there will be a new impetus, because out of any crisis (Europe) has experienced, something new and better has emerged.' Mr Bangemann is adamant that internal-market changes which come into force on January 1 will create opportunities for European business to prosper, even if important areas of liberalisation - in energy and telecommunications, for example - have been deferred. As for the issue of border controls, Mr Bangemann will try to nudge immigration ministers at today's London meeting towards one of his pragmatic solutions, so that the EC can be declared open at midnight on December 31. The British have already suggested one way of easing controls on people without having to give up border checks altogether. EC visitors should be allowed simply to show the cover of their passports to immigration officials at UK borders. As a classic political compromise, it is appropriate that it should already have been dubbed 'the Bangemann wave'.

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Leading Article: Public sector union harmony THE TREND towards merger and concentration among the UK's trades unions continues apace. This week, three large public sector unions announced details of their plans to form a new super-union with 1.4m members, to be named Unison. The AEU engineers union and the EETPU electricians are to merge next month. And there are rumours of a courtship between the two largest general unions, the TGWU and GMB. Most Unison members work in local government and the health service, giving the merger a sensible industrial logic. The existence of a single union should reduce restrictive practices and demarcation disputes and simplify collective bargaining. But while fewer unions may help personnel managers improve flexibility in the workplace, the process of concentration also strengthens the hands of the unions in negotiations with their employers. A single union spanning manual and white-collar employees enjoys greater power than several unions with sectional interests. If it is the only or main union in the industry, it can adopt a divide and rule approach to winning its objectives - picking off the weakest employers piecemeal. This strategy has been used to devastating effect in the past by Nalgo, the local government union representing white collar staff which is one of the three unions forming Unison. Selective action For example, selective action by Nalgo members in recent years has forced several London boroughs - all Labour-led and less inclined to resist union pressure - to pay additional allowances to town-hall staff. The most recent example is Ealing, west London, where the newly-elected Labour council found its schools closed and town hall departments disrupted by a month-long strike in 1987 as Nalgo members demanded allowances paid in harder-pressed inner London boroughs. The same approach has been used to resist attempts to improve the efficiency of local services. Plans by the London borough of Lewisham to re-organise offices to improve service to the public were disrupted by Nalgo strikes in 1986. And in 1991, the moderate leadership of Liverpool city council found itself unable to collect the poll tax or administer its finances for seven months because militant Nalgo members were on strike in protest against plans to cut jobs. The Nalgo strikers were on full pay from the national union at a cost of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m a month, costing the union up to Pounds 5m in strike pay. At one stage, the strikers attempted to force Liverpool into default on capital and interest payments to banks and other lenders. Public interest Such tactics suggest that there could be a public interest case for regulating union mergers in the same way as industrial mergers, to curb the abuse of monopoly power. Yet it would be perverse to argue against the creation of industrial unions such as Unison when it has been common wisdom for decades that such unions were desirable. Since the 1960s, many UK industrialists and trades unionists have cast envious eyes over the system bequeathed on Germany by the victorious allies after the last war, where a handful of large unions represent and bargain on behalf of all employees in an industry. In practice, the ability of unions to hold individual councils to ransom has been considerably weakened by compulsory competitive tendering. Council or health authority manual workers must now work to targets they agree in contracts with the employer. If they take industrial action and fail to hit those targets, they may lose the contracts to the private sector. In the 1991 Liverpool strike, the council's manual workers abandoned their action before the white-collar staff, after losing some contracts to outside companies. It is unlikely that council white collar staff will be able to hold out for as long as they did in Liverpool with the imminent extension of compulsory competitive tendering to their jobs. The formation of Unison, increasing as it does the potential for abuse of union power, makes it essential that compulsory competitive tendering should continue in public services. The Conservatives are committed to continuing and extending it: a government of any other complexion will abandon the principle at its peril.</p>

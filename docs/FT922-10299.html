			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Labour warns local authorities facing budget disruptions LOCAL authorities face having their budgets disrupted by new government-imposed curbs on spending in the current financial year, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. Liberal Democrat leaders also sought to make the financial straitjacket imposed on councils a central issue in next Thursday's elections. Mr Gould stressed that Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was more committed to 'capping' the expenditure of local authorities than any of his predecessors. He said some councils would be subjected to 50 per cent cuts if they had to rein back their expenditure to the standard spending assessment invented by Mr Howard in his earlier period of office at the department of environment. Underlining the disruptive effect of cuts imposed at the current stage of the financial year, Mr Gould said some councils would have to resort to 'drastic surgery'. He suggested that Basildon, where Labour's failure to win the parliamentary seat signalled its general election defeat, would have to cut expenditure by a half. Mr Simon Hughes, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, called on the government to include a clear commitment to the principle of independent local democracy 'able to raise taxation' in the Queen's Speech opening the first session of the new parliament on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Metin Gokce </F> in Ankara on 10 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Gokce] Mr. Minister, what is the situation in  Gorazde according to the information you have received?    [Cetin] The Gorazde problem is not a new one. Gorazde is one  of the six cities included in the secure areas determined by the  United Nations. There have been sieges of Gorazde from time to  time. There have also been times when this city could not  receive any bread. I discussed these issues with officials in  Sarajevo. Since 29 March, the sieges there have been intensified  and attacks have been continuing. Turkey continued to undertake  initiatives with regard to this matter during this time. For  example, we held talks with Foreign Ministry officials from  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia at the beginning of last week.  This was one of the topics discussed at the talks. An appeal  was issued to the United Nations, asking them to put an end to  the siege in Gorazde as soon as possible and make the city  genuinely secure. This matter was brought to the attention of  the [word indistinct] foreign minister in a letter. In my  contacts, I discussed these issued with Ejup Ganic and the  Bosnian foreign minister, who were in Turkey two days ago.    It is clear that there is neglect or foot-dragging on the  part of the United Nations with regard to this subject.  Although the city is under siege and NATO is ready to conduct  an air operation if the United Nations demands, for some reason  the United Nations is acting slowly on the matter. According to  reports we received recently, the siege has been further  intensified, the city is predominantly Muslim, most probably  they want the city to be evacuated, and people have started  arriving in the city from surrounding villages, making the city  more populated. At this point, in order to prevent further  suffering to the people there.... [pauses] Their suffering is  also ours. I was in Sarajevo three times. As always, the  Foreign Ministry has dedicated all its work force and all its  time to this issue. We want to prevent the death of even one  person. We want the United Nations to end this siege  immediately and if necessary, apply to NATO for air  intervention. We are continuing the necessary efforts to this  end.    [Gokce] There are reports that chemical weapons were used  against Gorazde last night and that there were mass deaths.  Have you been in contact with Bosnia-Herzegovina officials?    [Cetin] Since last night, Foreign Ministry officials as well  as myself have been trying to investigate this report, which  stemmed from a single source. We contacted our permanent  representative to the United Nations in New York. We contacted  NATO in Brussels. We also contacted Zagreb, where the UN  headquarters is located, and Sarajevo. It is true that there is  a tense atmosphere, artillery is being fired, and people are  being killed. As of this morning, however, the reports on the  use of chemical warfare or mass deaths were not confirmed  through our contacts. This morning as well as this afternoon, I  had two conversations with Muslim Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic. He is the prime minister of the country and is  currently in Sarajevo. He is not in Ankara, Istanbul, or New  York, like us. He is in his office in Sarajevo. I discussed  this matter with him and told him that there are such reports in  Turkey. I tried to understand the situation. As you know,  Gorazde is 60-65 km from Sarajevo. It is very close to  Sarajevo. According to what he told me at 1500 this afternoon,  the siege is continuing, the situation is tense, and measures  should be adopted in this regard. He reported to me, however,  that he has no information about the use of chemical weapons or  that there were mass deaths.    We are obliged to believe the prime minister of a country.  Therefore, I would like to call on my citizens especially.  Naturally, every drop of blood shed in Bosnia-Herzegovina hurts  us. Their suffering is also ours. Turkey was there before  anyone else. I respect my citizens' sensitivity on this subject.  There is, however, a government in that country and there are  officials. There is also a ministry which has devoted all its  efforts to this matter and which has a very good track record.  We will work on this issue until the end and we will continue  to do so, but I must act in line with the information conveyed  to me by the responsible prime minister of the country, who now  lives in Sarajevo. If he tells me that as of now he has no  information on the use of chemical warfare or mass massacres,  then we must all respect him.    Turkey will naturally do whatever is necessary and has done  so. Even if these events did not occur, I believe that if  necessary NATO should conduct an air operation in order to lift  the siege around Gorazde as soon as possible and we are working  to this end. If necessary, we will intensify our initiatives  even further in this regard. We want the United Nations to make  an ultimatum on this subject. Gorazde and the other cities must  be transformed into secure areas in the real sense of the word  as soon as possible. A United Nations, which cannot render  secure the areas which it decided to make secure, can no longer  be trusted. Naturally, the Turkish Government will do whatever  necessary. I sincerely hope that our citizens will be calm on  this issue.</p>

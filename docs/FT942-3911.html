			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Building material deficit declines Britain's trade deficit in building materials fell 16.7 per cent last year to Pounds 1.44bn - the lowest since 1986. The improvement was led by a 15 per cent rise in the value of exports, which increased from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 2.6bn, figures published by the Department of the Environment show. There is concern, however, that the deficit might rise again when material bottlenecks start to emerge as the construction industry recovers. The prices of a number of British-produced materials and components have risen sharply this year. Sales abroad by British companies have been boosted by the 1992 devaluation of sterling and by large productivity gains. Last year's improvement in exports is encouraging because continental Europe, the main overseas market for British building materials, was itself in deep recession. British steel suppliers and fabricators have been particularly successful in breaking into Continental markets. The trade surplus in structural steel, for example, rose last year from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 179.9m. The surplus in steel reinforcing bars for concrete doubled from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 80.9m, while the surplus on steel tubes and pipes increased 46 per cent to Pounds 65.78m. British manufacturers of other building products also saw substantial gains last year, with the trade surplus on wallpaper rising 43 per cent to Pounds 141.9m. Imports of building materials rose only 1.5 per cent to Pounds 4.1bn. Of this, more than Pounds 1bn was due to the importation of raw and semi-finished timber. Much of this is hardwood which Britain is unable to produce. Ministers have repeatedly criticised the construction industry for the high level of imports, which peaked at Pounds 4.7bn in 1989, causing a record deficit of Pounds 2.8bn. There will be continuing concern about the high level of imports of some manufactured products, even though the overall total has reduced substantially. Decorative glazed ceramic tiles, for example, incurred a trade deficit of Pounds 79.6m last year, although this was less than the previous year's Pounds 102.5m. Builders' ironmongery, such as doorknobs and other small items, had a trade deficit of Pounds 195.3m last year, only slightly down on the previous year's Pounds 197.87m.</p>

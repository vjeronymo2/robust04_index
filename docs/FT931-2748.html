			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Caterer tastes what Lamont has served up - Fleet expenses have soared for one company IN COMMON with businessmen across the country, Mr Jerry Brand was discussing the Budget with his finance director yesterday. Mr Brand, managing director and founder of Russell &amp; Brand, a five-year-old contract catering company, was driving to his company's Leicester office as he spoke on his car phone with Mr Simon Newth, the finance director. In Beckenham, south-east London, Mr Newth was working out the detailed implications. The most immediate impact of the chancellor's changes will be on the company's car policy. The company, which turned over nearly Pounds 15m last year, has a fleet of 65 cars, used mainly by its salesmen and contract managers for visiting the schools, hospitals and businesses which are it customers. Mr Newth calculates that the increase of 12p a gallon on unleaded petrol will cost the company just under Pounds 8,000 in 1993, while increased employer's national insurance contributions on car and fuel benefits will cost a further Pounds 4,000. A total increase of Pounds 12,000 represents a sizeable chunk of the company's 1992 operating profit of Pounds 220,000, he says. There will have to be changes in our car policy, says Mr Brand, though his options are limited. The company has considered the idea of giving employees a cash benefit and allowing them to choose their own cars, but is worried about the implications for the company image if they use unsuitable or unreliable vehicles. Staff could be given smaller cars, although many spend a great deal of time in them on company business. There are limits to the discomfort they could be expected to endure. The second most significant issue to emerge from the Budget was the announcement of plans to subsidise the return to work of up to 100,000 of the long-term unemployed. In a fast-growing industry with a shortage of skilled staff, Mr Brand wonders whether he might take on employees under this scheme. He has his reservations about the bureaucracy which might be involved, however, since a proposal put to British Coal at the end of last year to retrain redundant miners for catering work appears so far to have come to nothing. 'If the long-term unemployed fit in, then we are willing to have a look at them,' says Mr Newth. At present, the company has a total workforce of about 1,250 people, most of them working in its kitchens. It has plans for rapid expansion, however, and is projecting turnover this year of Pounds 21.5m. Growth at this speed would mean taking on between 300 and 400 new people a year. Mr Newth welcomes the chancellor's decision to limit increases in business rates to the rate of inflation. The company moved into a new head office in Beckenham last December, doubling the size of space in use. This is expected to lead to a sharp increase in its rate bill which will be about Pounds 31,000 this year. But it is not only the direct impact of the chancellor's moves which will affect the company. Mr Brand is also concerned about the impact of the changes on its customers. If they decide to spend less of their incomes on a hot midday meal, this may mean school and factory kitchens become less viable. Almost as important as the decisions taken by the chancellor in his Budget were the changes he did not make. Mr Brand was looking closely at what the chancellor would do to VAT. At present the Vatman regards catering companies as agents providing labour to their customers and labour costs are not therefore subject to VAT. The VAT authorities have, however, discussed removing this concession although lobbying by the contract catering industry has so far kept them at bay. 'If the VAT man taxed labour without letting schools reclaim VAT, this would add enormously to their catering costs,' says Mr Brand. As Russell &amp; Brand has grown, the company has had to take more seriously the implications of the annual Budget, says Mr Brand. The full implications of Mr Lamont's decisions will become more apparent in the coming weeks.</p>

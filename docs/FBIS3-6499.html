"Visits to these  countries are not only for security reasons but also to  strengthen economic cooperation to beat off the competition,"  Kim told top-grade graduates of 126 universities and their  parents whom he invited over for lunch. Government officials say  it is yet to be decided when Kim will visit Russia, but a likely  date is around June. A European tour timed with his visit to  Russia is also being considered, they say.</p>

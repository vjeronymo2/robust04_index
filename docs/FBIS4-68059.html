			<p>BFN     [Text] The delegation of ambassadors of Islamic and Latin  American countries, which concluded its four-day visit of Jammu  and Kashmir, blamed Islamabad for aiding and abetting terrorism  in Kashmir valley. Reports say that the ambassadors were  convinced that Pakistan is behind terrorism in the state. The  group has assessed that ordinary people in the state would like  to see the end of violence and the situation brought back to  normal. They were unhappy that the Hurriyyat Conference leaders  changed the venue of the meeting at the last moment and that  envoys could not meet them. However, the delegation was  satisfied it could meet a cross section of the people. The  delegation regretted that Amnesty International released its  report on human rights situation in Punjab without going there,  although it was permitted to send a team to the state.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday left for  Manila, confirming that he would seek the Philippine  government's view on Burma's attendance of an ASEAN meeting and  also ways of enhancing trade between Thailand and the  Philippines. Speaking to reporters shortly before his departure,  Squadron Leader Prasong expressed confidence that the  Philippines would have no objections to the idea of inviting  Burma to the meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in  July.    Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia have affirmed that they  would not object to Thailand extending an informal invitation in  its capacity as host of the meeting. Deputy Foreign Minister  Surin Phitsuwan is due to visit Brunei soon to sound out the  opinion of the remaining ASEAN member state. But ASEAN officials  have made clear that a formal invitation would require more  progress in Burma and more discussion among ASEAN members.    Foreign Minister Prasong said he would also seek Manila's  views on what will be the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional  Forum -- planned for the six ASEAN states, their seven dialogue  partners and five others, including China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos  and Papua New Guinea.    Bilaterally, Sqn Ldr Prasong said he would discuss ways of  enhancing economic relations during talks with Philippine  President Fidel Ramos. Sqn Ldr Prasong noted that the current  volume of trade was relatively small -- about 8,000 million  baht. He suggested that counter-trade might be one way of  stepping up this activity. Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday cochaired  the first meeting of the Joint Commission for bilateral  cooperation in trade, investment, agriculture, science and  technology and tourism. He is scheduled to return from Manila  tonight.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: The Mikado returns English National Opera's all-white Mikado is one of the company's hardiest productions. Wednesday's welcome performance marked the opening of its sixth run since it was new in 1986 - David Ritch once again reviving Jonathan Miller's original - and everything in the Grand Hotel setting came up shiny and slick. The cast, with one exception all returning to their roles, is now more more confident than ever, though this inevitably means some loss of spontaneity. Still, most of it remains very funny, not least Ko-Ko's amazingly topical Little List, which now includes references to the Hecklers, Jeffrey Archer, Mrs Bobbitt, and Mr and Mrs Michael Jackson. Indeed, Richard Suart's Pythonesque Ko-Ko, with his gallery of accents and twitches, remains the star of the show. Lesley Garrett's bubbly Yum-Yum - she sings a sensuous 'The sun whose rays' - and Bonaventura Bottone's coy Nanki-Poo (whose lyrical singing matches his twinkling characterisation) are not far behind in the show-stealing stakes. Anne Collins repeats her vengeful virago of a Katisha, Richard Angas his preening but absent-minded Mikado, Ian Caddy his Pooh-Bah, and Arwel Huw Morgan the plus-foured clergyman Pish-Tush. Completing the three little maids from St Trinians' are Ethna Robinson (Pitti-Sing) and - new to the cast - Mary Plazas (Peep-Bo). Sian Edwards, who has raised critical eyebrows for her seemingly arms-length musical directorship of the company, here maintained a firm grip on the score. She let the music sparkle, kept ensembles tight, and most importantly, since ENO's resolve on the language issue seems set to waver, allowed us to hear almost every word. There are only five further performances of The Mikado this season, not to be missed. Sponsored by Schroder Investment Management and SG Warburg plc.</p>

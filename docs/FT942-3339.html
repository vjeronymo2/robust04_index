			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Personal View: Dividends are only part of the story Remarks by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, to the Confederation of British Industry last month criticising UK companies' dividend policy have certainly set the cat among pigeons. Perhaps the conclusion the chancellor will draw is that Treasury ministers would do well to remain decently veiled throughout the year, not just at Budget time. If so, that would be a pity, because Mr Dorrell did ask some interesting questions, which deserve a serious response. Does the rise in dividend payouts matter? Has it affected companies' ability to invest profitably? Is the corporate tax and regulatory framework still appropriate? Business investment in the UK has indeed been too low. Fixed investment as a share of gross domestic product has been below the levels achieved by Britain's main competitors over the last 10 years. The UK average has been 17.5 per cent, compared with a European Union average of 19.7 per cent and an OECD average of 20.4 per cent. The main reason for companies' unwillingness to invest - certainly the one they give in response to our surveys - is that they are uncertain about future demand. Of course uncertainty is a fact of business life, but in the UK it appears to have been magnified by government policy errors. So the government's main response to the problems Mr Dorrell identifies should be to maintain a stable macroeconomic and financial environment. The behaviour of long-term interest rates in recent months suggests the market still lacks confidence in the authorities' ability to meet inflation targets in the upturn, perhaps because the government has only gone half way towards creating an independent and accountable Bank of England. Making an honest woman of Bank governor Mr Eddie George should be high on the Treasury's agenda. But the amounts and types of finance available are also relevant, however stable the inflationary environment. Our research shows that, over the medium term, there is a close link between the trends in business saving (retained profits) and investment. So it is reasonable to explore how retained profits might be increased. The best answer is increased profitability. UK companies' profitability has been lower than that of some competitors - the return on capital in the business sector in 1980-91 was, at 9.7 per cent a year, 3 points or more below rates in the US, Japan, Germany or France. Then there is the tax system. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued that the reform of the corporation tax system in the mid-1980s - which reduced both capital allowances and corporation tax - although intended to be fiscally neutral, increased the user cost of capital. That points to the need for either reduced rates of corporation tax, or increased capital allowances. Dividend payouts - which also, of course, reduce retained earnings - are very delicate territory, as Mr Dorrell has discovered. One false move could send actuarial deficits in pension schemes soaring, requiring increased company contributions, offsetting any cashflow benefit from lower payouts. The first point to note is that, while payout ratios have risen, so have amounts raised through rights issues and flotations. So - certainly for large companies - financial markets are performing as they should, requiring managements to justify calls for funds, and recycling money to companies which have attractive opportunities. But smaller companies wonder whether the market knows enough about their investment opportunities to add value to their decisions, and argue that the costs of raising equity are too large. The government has already produced part of the answer to that problem with its Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust proposal. Another constructive change might be to allow the costs of equity raising against tax. And the Treasury might also focus on the operation of the capital taxation regime. The capital gains tax rate is too high; it discriminates against direct equity investment and hinders the effective operation of the equity market. Among the many possible reforms the chancellor might consider is to taper the rate on realised gains in line with the length of time the amount was held. Over time that would reward relationship investors and encourage tax-paying institutions to take a long-term view. It is an idea the Labour party favours, which ought not to be allowed to rule it out. Rates of dividend payout are only part of the story. Mr Dorrell would therefore do well to downplay this and begin instead to develop a broader agenda of corporate tax reform. The author is director-general of the Confederation of British Industry</p>

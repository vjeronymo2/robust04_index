			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Philippine candidates agree pact The seven candidates in the May 11 Philippine presidential election yesterday signed a pact pledging not to use violence or fraud to disrupt or pre-empt the campaign, writes Jose Galang in Manila. The agreement, a first in the history of Philippine elections, was designed by the Commission on Elections in an attempt to reduce the political tension that has escalated since the start of the campaign in early February. Twenty-five deaths linked to the coming elections have been registered since the start of the campaign.</p>

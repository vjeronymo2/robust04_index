			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NIOSH recommended that OSHA require chain saws be equipped or retrofitted with mufflers meeting the chain-saw manufacturer's specifications (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH said mufflers would be effective for noise reduction. OSHA has not adopted NIOSH's recommendation. First, retrofit mufflers may cause operational difficulties. Second, retrofit mufflers may also contribute to an increase in back pressure for the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) through (e)(2)(xiv) specify various requirements for safe operation of chain saws. OSHA believes these work practices are essential in reducing the number of injuries that occur to chain-saw operators. According to the WIR survey, the vast majority of chain-saw injuries reported indicates that unsafe work practices were involved (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In contrast, only four percent of chain-saw injuries were the result of equipment failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be operated and adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be refueled at least 20 feet from any open flame or other source of ignition. This provision adopts the requirements contained in the proposed rule. This requirement was also contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard required only that chain saw operators be instructed to refuel the saw only in safe areas and not in areas conducive to fire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that a separation between a fueling area and any source of ignition, such as a cigarette, is necessary to prevent ignition of vapors from spills or from overfilled chain-saw tanks. The final rule clarifies what constitutes at least a minimal safe fueling area. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started at least 10 feet from any fueling area. This provision also adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one commenter opposed this provision, saying that in some instances it would be impossible to move 10 feet from a fueling area to start the chain saw (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, no substantive evidence was presented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that when a chain saw is started, there is a potential that spilled fuel in the area could also become ignited. For example, a faulty spark plug wire can cause an arc between the wire and metal casing, resulting in the igniting of spilled fuel. In addition, the record shows that the danger of fire is a major concern in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;20). OSHA believes that this provision will help to reduce the potential for fires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started on the ground or where otherwise firmly supported. The provision is the same as the requirement contained in the proposal and the pulpwood logging standard. Two commenters opposed the requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;35). One commenter stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In many instances, there is not any way to comply, i.e., when a cutter is felling while standing on springboard jacks, it would be a greater hazard for him to climb up carrying a running saw. This means that the chain saw must be started on the springboard with no place left to rest the saw. The same situation occurs when limbing and bucking large trees after they are on the ground. The cutter/bucker would have to climb up on the trunk while carrying a running saw. The proposed standard should be amended to read `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> whenever possible <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> '' chain saws should be started [on the ground] (Ex. 5&hyph;34).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The other commenter said starting the chain saw on the ground was not necessarily the safest way to start it, and, in any event, saws equipped with chain brakes could be drop started when the chain brake is engaged (5&hyph;35). Another commenter said that they had had no injuries resulting from starting chains saws when standing in an upright position (Ex. 5&hyph;45).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For several reasons, OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect chain saw operators. First, the record supports the need for chain saws to be firmly supported when they are started. The WIR survey indicates that a significant portion of chain saw injuries were related to the operator not having firm control or grip of the saw (e.g., didn't have tight grip on saw, hand slipped into chain, operator fell on saw). While the survey does not indicate whether these injuries occurred while the operator was starting the saw, the presence of these injuries does reinforce the need for appropriate work practices that require proper support for equipment so the operator is able to maintain a firm grip and control of the saw.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

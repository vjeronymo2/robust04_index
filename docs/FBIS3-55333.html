			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A two-day summit of NATO member-countries opened in  Brussels today. It discussed as its central issue the  Partnership for Peace plan proposed by U.S. President Bill  Clinton. This envisages the establishment of military links  between the North Atlantic Alliance and the countries of East  Europe and the former Soviet republics, including the Russian  Federation.    As is known, Russia does not object to these links, but is  opposed to NATO's expansion into countries in close proximity to  the Russian borders. Incidentally, experts of the Russian  Defense Ministry note that NATO itself lacks unity of views  regarding the next steps after the possible adoption of the U.S.  Partnership for Peace plan. Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian  defense minister, speaks about the stand of the Russian military  in greater detail:    [begin Grachev recording] We are advocates of a path that  leads to a truly pan-European system of security. This means  collective actions -- but not in accordance with the criteria of  membership in the bloc -- aimed at preventing and settling the  crises and conflicts now shaking Europe. I believe that  security and international stability should be indivisible and  should be based on common European structures. Russia is  proceeding from the fact that our relations with NATO should be  richer and should develop in broad-ranging cooperation. We  believe that rapprochement between Russia and NATO should be  going at an accelerated pace. [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons submitting comments on these issues or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific aspects of today's proposal should consider and discuss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the possible impact of their comments on other elements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control program, particularly when such comments propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative strategies that would achieve smaller or larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions from commercial aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Aviation Working Group Issues/Concerns To gather information used in preparing today's action, the Agency formed a working group composed principally of representatives from EPA, FAA, various State and local regulatory authorities, airport operators, and airlines. The mission of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working group was to acquire emission inventory data, assess inventory methodologies, and identify operational and technological issues regarding potential control strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed environmental performance target/fee control program represents a new and innovative strategy for aviation. EPA has attempted to address many of the issues and concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the working group members, but recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant issues and differences of opinion remain. In order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to facilitate public comment on these issues, EPA has requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on specific topics throughout the description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. Nonetheless, EPA is taking an additional step to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that concerns raised by the airline industry are fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aired as part of this rulemaking. The industry's concerns, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by the Airline Transport Association, <FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>  are summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For more detail see the letter from R. Kettler, ATA to R. Wilson, EPA, dated December 27, 1993, available in the rulemaking docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Further regulation of aircraft emissions under the FIP is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  unnecessary because VOC emissions from aircraft have already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  been reduced and will continue to decrease substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  through the next decade. Fleet modernization due to market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  forces and phase out of Stage II aircraft will substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  decrease VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any FIP requirements for aircraft emission reductions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  be illegal per section 110(a)(5)(C) of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  It would also run counter to the jurisdiction of DOT to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ensure a safe and efficient air transportation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Emission reductions required by the FIP would ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  require limiting the number of flights, which would have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  devastating effect on the region's economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Airlines will be subject to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  regulatory scheme being developed by the International Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Aviation Organization (ICAO). This international approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  is necessary to keep from placing U.S. airlines at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any FIP proposal that directly or indirectly affects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  aircraft operations would unwisely and unlawfully impinge on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the control of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  over the safety and efficiency of airport operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of the aircraft. Measures such as single engine taxiing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  derated takeoffs, and limiting use of reverse thrust on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  landing may pose safety hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA has no authority to prescribe a bubble to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  airport or airline emissions. Proposal of an airline or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  airport-wide emissions cap would require either operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  changes that raise serious safety and efficiency concerns or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  a reduction in the number of flights. These would violate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  either the Federal Aviation Act, FAA regulations or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Airport proprietors are preempted from exerting operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  controls with regard to aircraft and airlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use of a bubble would be unworkable, since neither EPA nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  airport proprietors have the expertise or the resources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  supervise and enforce restrictions on the hundreds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  businesses and operations that are potential emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  sources at an airport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Control of domestic aircraft emissions under the FIP would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  discriminate unfairly against U.S. air carriers. Foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  carriers, military and general aviation must be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the same controls as commercial domestic carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any emissions decreases from the closure or realignment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  military airfields must be credited to the aviation sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Although the Clean Air Act requires EPA to use a 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  baseline for determining overall emission reduction goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  for the FIP, EPA should allow the use of other years for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  particular sources. A 1987 baseline year for aircraft would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  be more equitable, because individual airlines have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  voluntarily reducing their VOC emissions since that date by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  phasing in quieter and cleaner engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;As an alternative to allowing an earlier baseline year, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  rule might provide that the benefit of percentage reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  by those industries that have made the least pre-1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  emission reductions be shared with industries that made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  most pre-1990 progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;ATA questions the authority of EPA to regulate airline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ground service equipment (GSE) emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The airline industry maintains that EPA has unfairly focused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  on airline GSE regulation, while ignoring similar off-road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  vehicles used by other industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The airline industry has provided evidence that GSE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  emissions amount to nearly 40 percent of airline-controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  emissions, in contrast to the substantially lower percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  estimated by EPA. Thus, there may be much greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  opportunity for emission reductions from GSE than EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  previously contemplated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To the extent that GSE emission regulation is permissible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  EPA should develop a reasonable phase-in schedule for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  regulations to allow for the development of appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  controls and to work through the associated technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests comments on the concerns and issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the airline industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

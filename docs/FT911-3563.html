			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Beazer plans debt cut by floating UK business BEAZER, the heavily-borrowed construction and building materials group, yesterday announced plans to float its UK businesses and then sell up to half the shares in the new company for up to Pounds 250m. Mr John Matthews, chief executive, said the plan would require the approval of shareholders, the stock exchange and the group's bankers. Funds from the share issue would be used to reduce Beazer's large US borrowings - most of which were raised to finance the Dollars 1.7bn acquisition of Koppers cement and aggregates business in March 1988. If the plan went ahead, the share sale would be likely to take place between June and September of this year. The new company, to be called Beazer Europe, would include all the group's UK housing, contracting and commercial property businesses. It has not been decided whether to offer shares in the new company solely to existing shareholders or to make them available also to new investors. The UK businesses, which have an estimated net asset value of about Pounds 400m, generated Pounds 72.7m out of total group operating profits of Pounds 189.8m in the 12 months to June 30, 1990. On the stock market, Beazer's shares closed 4p higher at a new high for the year of 185p after the announcement. This gave the group a total stock market value of just under Pounds 500m compared with an implied price tag under the flotation plans of about the same amount for the UK businesses alone. Mr Matthews said the group believed its current share price substantially undervalued the group's businesses. Shareholders were likely to achieve better value by splitting the company, he said.  The proposals would leave the group owning a large US cement, concrete and aggregate business and maintaining a controlling interest in its former UK operations. Beazer's last annual accounts, for the year to June 30, 1990, showed net debts of Pounds 880.5m mostly in the US. This compared with shareholders' funds of about Pounds 1bn. The group, which last month announced a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 43.2m during the six months to the end of December, has said that net debt should be reduced to about Pounds 750m by the end of June this year following a series of disposals and joint ventures in the US. Beazer said that, at the last count, about 40 per cent of its shares were held by US investors. Analysts believe the proportion of US investors is now nearer half. Mr Matthews said the group would have to think carefully about where it would be domiciled should it end up with its core assets and the majority of its shareholders in the US.

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEONARD LETS HIS BAT DO THE TALKING WITH TWO HOMERS FOR THE MARINERS  </P> <P> After hitting his second home run of the night, the eventual game-winner,  Seattle Mariners designated hitter Jeffrey Leonard, a creative dancer when it  comes to home run trots, made his way around the bases rather inconspicuously.  </P> <P> There was no flap -- arm straight by his side, hand out -- or sling -- arm bent  at his chest, fist closed. There was only Leonard trotting around the bases  like anyone else would -- dullsville.  </P> <P> That is until Leonard made his way around third. At that point, the trot  stopped and the strut began. Slowly. Very slowly.  </P> <P> Fans booed and Angel reliever Greg Minton, who gave up the homer and would give  up one to Darnell Coles four pitches later, looked something less than pleased.  </P> <P> Leonard's homers had far-reaching effects. The Angels' 6-4 loss to Seattle  dropped them in a first-place tie with Oakland, which beat Chicago, 3-2, in 10  innings.  </P> <P> For his part, the homers were something for Leonard to savor. He has been in a  home-run slump for more than a month.  </P> <P> Leonard, whose 18 home runs and 72 RBIs lead the Mariners, had hit only one  home run since June 27.  </P> <P> Things didn't seem ripe for change Tuesday as Leonard went against Bert  Blyleven. Leonard was batting just .091 against Blyleven, with one hit in 11  at-bats.  </P> <P> In the second inning, he struck out looking. In the fourth, he hit a lazy pop  fly to short.  </P> <P> But in the sixth, with two on and the Mariners trailing, 4-1, Leonard hit a  home run to left.  </P> <P> "That was a big hit for us," Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "Especially  after the third inning."  </P> <P> In the third, the Mariners got four hits and loaded the bases but came away  with only one run when the Angels turned the rare, pitcher-to-catcher-to-first  base double play.  </P> <P> "After that happened I said, 'Oh no, here we go with another one of those  nights,' " Lefebvre said. "Blyleven can be so tough on a ballclub. You need a  big hit against him for that shot in the arm, something that lets your team  know it can score runs off him."  </P> <P> By the time Leonard came up in the 10th, Blyleven had been replaced by Minton.  Leonard hit his first pitch over the right-field fence, giving the Mariners a  5-4 lead.  </P> <P> "It's nice to see Jeffrey Leonard's bat back," Lefebvre said. "He can be a  force, can't he?"  </P> <P> No doubt. But he can also be very quiet when it comes to questions. In the same  deliberate manner that he had made his way from third to home, Leonard walked  toward his locker.  </P> <P> "Nothing, nothing, nothing,"' he said at the sight of a reporter preparing to  ask a question, waving his hand as if to brush away a few gnats.  </P> <P> That's about all Jeffrey Leonard had to say about his two home runs. Some guys  can make it all look so easy.  </P></p>

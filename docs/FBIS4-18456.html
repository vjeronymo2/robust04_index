			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Sharrock report: "IRA Warns `You Will Be Glad To Get </F> Out'"]    [Text] Belfast -- Sinn Fein's appeals for direct talks  with the Government in return for a 72-hour ceasefire commencing  at midnight tonight suffered a setback yesterday when IRA  hard-liners warned that Britain would "be glad to get out of  Ireland when our work is done."    The message was delivered by two masked, armed members of  the  IRA's Tyrone Brigade at an evening celebrating the Easter  Rising, just hours after Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness  hinted that the republican movement would respond positively to  renewed direct contacts between the Government and Sinn Fein.    Security chiefs in Belfast have meanwhile warned police and  troops not to drop their guard before and immediately after the  ceasefire ends.    The statement from the Tyrone Brigade boasted of the  morale-boosting effects of the recent mortar attacks on Heathrow  and claimed that the republican movement had never been in a  better position to carry on its military campaign.    Hundreds listened as the statement was read in a hall near  Cookstown, Co [County] Tyrone. One of the IRA men assumed a  firing position holding a revolver above his head as another  read it out: "The Tyrone brigade of the IRA extends its  greetings to you, our loyal supporters and, most especially, to  the families of our fallen comrades. Make no mistake about it,  never before has the republican movement been stronger, more  united or more confident.    "A few recent and unscheduled landings at Heathrow worked  wonders for us all and it caused serious international  embarrassment to the British government. As an army which lives  and fights in the occupied zone, we state absolutely that the  British will be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is  done."    The mood of supporters at the event was buoyant, if almost  victorious. "Why should we give in to the Brits when we are  winning?" was a typical sentiment.    The display will be an embarrassment to the Sinn Fein  leadership, which has been at pains to cultivate an image of  flexibility and commitment to peace. While it could be  interpreted as no more than reassurance to stalwarts that the  leadership is not about to sell out, it may also appear to  confirm Dublin's fears that Mr Adams is not capable of  persuading sufficient numbers of the IRA to end violence and  take the constitutional path.    Irish government sources yesterday indicated they did not  expect a breakthrough by the weekend.    "There's not enough time in which anything could happen,"  said one source.    Mr Adams said yesterday that the Government could not just  criticise or dismiss the IRA ceasefire without proposing an  alternative. He was responding to a government statement which  said Sinn Fein and the IRA knew exactly what was required to  bring peace. They could deliver it if they chose.    Martin McGuinness, leading Sinn Fein executive member told a  meeting in Derry: "It is my firm conviction that the IRA  initiative is clearly an attempt to end the current stalemate  around the issue of clarification and to move the peace process  forward."    David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told  an  Apprentice Boys rally in Lurgan that the IRA ceasefire was an  attempt to lay the blame for the failure of the peace initiative  on Downing Street.    He said the ceasefire fooled nobody.    "This so called ceasefire is only a manoeuvre. If all that  Mr Adams could get from the hard men is three days then Mr Adams  isn't worth much consideration."    Andrew Rodgers, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church,  called for Mr Adams to explain through the media exactly what  clarification he needed, so that everyone could judge where the  problem lay.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Functional assessment instruments will be designed to measure, as objectively as possible, an individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands that includes the principal dimensions of work and task performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes. Examples of task performance include, but are not limited to: physical capabilities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling; mental capabilities, such as understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; using judgment; responding appropriately to supervisors and co-workers in usual work situations; and responding appropriately to changes in the routine work setting; and postural and environmental limitations. To the extent that current regulations already set forth guidelines for evaluating an individual's ability to perform certain of these tasks, they will be utilized in the new process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Functional assessment instruments will be designed to realistically assess an individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands. To the extent possible, objective measures of function will be developed. However, a realistic and individualized assessment of function may require, in addition to objective measures of function, a standardized means or standardized tools for collecting information regarding an individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s perceptions of his or her functioning, the effect of symptoms, including pain, and the individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s activities of daily living. Functional assessment instruments may also require impairment-specific measures to account for the episodic nature of certain impairments or to meet a more general need for longitudinal information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will be primarily responsible for documenting functional ability using the standardized functional assessments. In the near term, SSA will solicit information on which to base a functional assessment from treating medical sources, other nonmedical sources, and from claimants in a manner that is similar to the current process. In the future, the standardized functional assessments will be widely available and accepted so that functional assessments may be performed by a variety of medical sources, including treating sources. The SSA goal will be to develop functional assessment instruments that are standardized, that accurately measure an individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s functional abilities and that are universally accepted by the public, the advocacy community, and health care professionals. Ultimately, documenting functional ability will become the routine practice of physicians and other health care professionals, such that a functional assessment with history and descriptive medical findings will become an accepted component of a standard medical report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability insurance payers have incentives to participate in the research necessary to develop standardized functional assessments and some private insurers have already expressed interest in working with SSA in this effort. Standardized functional assessments will not only provide SSA with the functional information necessary to make disability decisions; functional measurements will also assist in developing provider reimbursement levels relating to rehabilitation and in assuring quality in rehabilitation programs by permitting assessment of the relationship between rehabilitative interventions and outcomes. Ultimately, the use of the same functional assessment measurements by both SSA and medical insurance payers will facilitate the cooperation and participation of the medical community in developing, refining, and implementing them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Baseline Occupational Demands <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA will use the results of the standardized functional assessment in conjunction with a new standard that SSA will develop to describe basic physical and mental demands of a baseline of work that represents substantial gainful activity and that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop the new approach, SSA will conduct research and will work in conjunction with outside experts and consumers to specifically identify the activities that comprise a baseline of occupational demands needed to perform substantial gainful activity. The baseline will describe a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. In establishing the work-related functions that comprise an appropriate baseline of occupational demands, SSA will ensure that: 1) the functional activities are a realistic reflection of the demands of occupations that exist in significant numbers in the national economy; and 2) the occupations are those that can be performed in the absence of prior skills or formal job training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Labor <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) has made recommendations for developing a new DOT by 1996 which will be a data base system that collects, produces, and maintains accurate, reliable, and valid information on all occupations in the national economy. This new system will provide comprehensive occupational data that includes, but is not limited to: physical demands of work; sensory/perceptual requirements; cognitive job demands; physical working conditions; and job characteristics such as pace or intensity of work, and the scope of interactions with others. The development of a national data base with detailed occupational information should assist SSA in conducting the initial research necessary to identify a baseline of occupational demands that represents work existing in significant numbers in the national economy. It should also provide a mechanism to ensure that the baseline of occupational demands remains current and reflects changes in the national economy over time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

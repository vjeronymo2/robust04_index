			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Recession leaves Bucknall Pounds 2m in red BUCKNALL GROUP, the only quoted firm of quantity surveyors, was hit hard by the effects of the recession in the construction industry and ran up a loss of Pounds 1.92m pre-tax for the year to end-April. That compared with profits of Pounds 1.23m in the previous 12 months. The dividend for the year is omitted - shareholders received a 4.8p total previously. Losses per share of 13p compared with earnings of 10p in 1990-91. Mr David Bucknall, chairman and chief executive, said the directors had taken an average pay cut of 22 per cent while salaries of subsidiary company directors and senior managers had been reduced by 10 per cent. This had helped generate savings of more than Pounds 1.7m a year. Group turnover fell by 17 per cent to Pounds 17.3m. Mr Bucknall said that UK turnover, down by 30 per cent, had fallen faster than the group could cut costs and this had led to losses. Overseas turnover, on the other hand, had risen by 98 per cent to Pounds 4.5m. The group had also been successful recently in winning other types of work away from the private office market which had borne the brunt of the recession in the UK. Pre-tax losses for 1991-92 were struck after taking account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 383,000, (Pounds 447,000) mostly due to redundancy costs. The group's UK staff during the latest 12 months had been reduced from 418 to 367. Year-end gearing of 75 per cent compared with 123 per cent 12 months earlier.</p>

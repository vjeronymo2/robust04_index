			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Chaebol select their core sectors: S Korean conglomerates cut the size of sprawling business groups Many of South Korea's 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, have disclosed the industries on which they plan to focus under a government policy to reduce the size of the sprawling business groups. The 10 biggest groups must by Tuesday select three core industrial sectors, and the next 20 must pick two sectors, as part of a government drive to improve efficiency and reduce their dominance of the Korean economy. At least 14 of the 30 have made their selections, including five of the top 10. Daewoo, the fourth-ranking chaebol, yesterday named motor vehicles, heavy industries including shipbuilding, and trading and distribution operations as its core business sectors. A related company, Daewoo Electronics, is entitled to almost the same benefits as those provided by the government under the specialisation programme, because it has a widely-diversified share ownership structure. Core businesses selected by the chaebol will be free of strict state controls on borrowing and will be supported by government subsidies for research and development. Chaebol which dispose of non-core subsidiaries by reducing their shareholding will be allowed to select an additional one or two core industries. Among others in the top 10, Hyundai has chosen motor vehicles and electronics, but remains undecided between chemicals and heavy industries, which includes its shipbuilding operations. Samsung has picked electronics and heavy industries, with chemicals or trading and distribution likely to be its third choice. Lucky-Goldstar has selected electronics and chemicals, but remains undecided between energy or distribution. Hanjin chose transportation (Korean Air), shipbuilding and heavy industries, and construction. Ssangyong picked motor vehicles, non-metal minerals and energy. Kia selected motor vehicles, machinery and steel. Hanhwa took energy, chemicals and trading and distribution services. Sunkyong has decided on energy and chemicals and will probably choose distribution over electronics, since SKC, its main subsidiary, is involved in both chemicals and electronics. Lotte will concentrate on food and beverage products and distribution and will select construction over chemicals as its third sector if Hyundai and Samsung specialise in the latter area. Other big chaebol are still considering their options.</p>

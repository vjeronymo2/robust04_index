			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Strong exports help EdF advance ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the power utility which is western Europe's largest energy exporter, yesterday reported a steep rise in profits. Net earnings at EdF rose from FFr100m (Dollars 17.8m) in 1990 to FFr1.9bn last year, before a FFr500m levy collected by its government owner, on turnover up by 9.6 per cent from FFr156.5bn to FFr171.4bn. Mr Pierre Delaporte, president, attributed the improvement to a strong rise in demand for EdF electricity from Britain and Germany, with a steady rise in French domestic sales. He expected FFr2bn of profits this year. There was also a fall in debt charges as EdF used its cash flow to reduce the huge borrowings accumulated during its ambitious nuclear power station programme of the past 20 years. Nuclear plant accounted for 77 per cent of EdF output last year, making France the world's most nuclear dependent country. Export sales rose by 18 per cent to FFr12bn, representing 53.4bn kilowatt hours (kWh) out of total output of 406.5 kWh. Within this, British demand rose by 42 per cent to 16.8bn kWh, seen as a mark of the disorganisation of its own electricity industry and making it by far EdF's largest export customer. EdF has been criticised for having surplus nuclear capacity. But, the continuing rise in sales should bring demand in line with capacity by 1996, said Mr Jean Bergougnoux, managing director. Debts fell by FFr12bn per cent over the year to FFr214bn and should fall below FFr200bn by the end of 1992, said Mr Delaporte.</p>

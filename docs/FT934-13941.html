			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as blue chips see demand Wall Street US SHARE prices ended a busy session mixed yesterday as blue chip issues decisively outperformed secondary stocks for the first time in several weeks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.58 at 3,642.31. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.08 to 468.42 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 4.51 to 782.91. NYSE volume was 329.5m shares. After last week's late gains, which were prompted by a sharp decline in bond yields and good news on inflation, stock markets opened with little firm direction yesterday. The absence of fresh economic data also contributed to the listless nature of early trading. Initially, the overnight gains recorded on foreign markets were regarded as a positive factor for sentiment; but that was subsequently more than offset by early losses on the US bond market, which quickly fed through into equities. Last week, all the secondary indices set record highs, and the Dow climbed to within almost 30 points of its all-time peak. Against that background, traders were not surprised when, at the opening, some investors chose to book some of the profits they had earned last week. Blue chip stocks, however, firmed steadily through the afternoon, aided by some good earnings news. Banks were in retreat, hit by profit-takers, rising bond yields and the news that JP Morgan's Morgan Guaranty unit had reduced its prime lending rate from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. JP Morgan fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 74 5/8 , Citicorp weakened Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 , Chemical gave up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 and BankAmerica declined Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 1/8 . Chase Manhattan retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 in spite of reporting third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.25 a share, up from 94 cents a year ago. NationsBank, which announced a small decline in earnings to Dollars 1.33 a share, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 49. Brokerage stocks lost ground in line with the banks. Merrill Lynch shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 95 7/8 and Salomon Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 47. Merck rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 in volume of 5.4m shares after the drug group unveiled quarterly profits slightly better than analysts had been expecting. Other big Dow stocks in demand were Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Dollars 2 1/2 stronger at Dollars 107 3/8 , Allied Signal, Dollars 2 1/8 up at Dollars 73 3/4 , and General Motors, Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 46 1/2 . Other auto issues were also higher. A strong third quarter lifted entertainment group Capital Cities ABC Dollars 11 to Dollars 626. Canada TORONTO ended slightly higher in moderate trading as the TSE 300 index managed to inch to another record level. The index gained 6.1 at 4,188.7, its third consecutive all-time closing peak. Advances led declines by 374 to 361 and volume totalled 54.9m shares. Nine of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by transportation, which jumped 5.0 per cent as Laidlaw 'B' added CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 8 1/8 . One analyst said the stock was run up ahead of an analysts' meeting that Laidlaw's new president and chief executive Mr James Bullock was holding later that day. The golds group advanced 2.1 per cent as the bullion price gained USDollars 3.40 to USDollars 368.25 an ounce in New York.</p>

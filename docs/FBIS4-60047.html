			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, today visited the al-Nasr Camp. He was received by the  brother camp commander, officers, NCO's, and soldiers. The  brother chairman, the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was  briefed on the progress of training and preparation at the camp.    Addressing the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers, the  brother chairman praised the valiant Armed Forces' heroic role  to support the people's will and defend the homeland and  democracy against all threats and challenges that have been  imposed by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the Yemeni  Socialist Party's [YSP] leadership which threw the homeland and  the Armed Forces into the furnace of war and imposed it on our  people in order to implement its secessionist plan and fragment  the homeland.    He stressed: Unity has existed to survive and to be  entrenched in the state of affairs and life of the homeland. It  is our people's destiny and fate, and they will never relinquish  it. He noted that our people and their Armed Forces, who  offered dear sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni revolutions  of 26 September and 14 October, and for their triumph, are today  making sacrifices for the sake of protecting and entrenching  unity. He stressed that Yemen will have no future or stability  without unity, and that secession and the attempts to go back to  the pre-22 May 1990 era are impossible. He said that the people  and their Armed Forces will not allow this and will confront the  secessionists resolutely and strongly.    The brother president pointed to what is being achieved by  our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity, legitimacy, and  democracy, in terms of success in accomplishing their tasks and  national duties to deter the rebelling, secessionist forces, to  abort their secessionist plan, and to force them to submit to  the will of the people and to recognize constitutional  legitimacy. He pointed out that this is taking place thanks to  God and to our Yemeni people's support, who are rallying around  their valiant Armed Forces throughout the Yemeni homeland in  Shabwah, Abyan, Aden, Ta'izz, Hadhramaut, al-Mahrah, Sa'dah,  Hajjah, al-Hudaydah, Sanaa, and Dhamar.    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council called on  the personnel who were misled by the rebelling, secessionist  gang in the YSP leadership to join the ranks of their brothers  and comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in order to prove their  patriotism and faithfulness to the homeland by standing in the  trench of unity, revolution, and democracy. He wondered whether  these misled people want to fight and die for the sake of a  handful of conspiratorial secessionists who led the homeland to  this abyss for the sake of achieving personal interests and  devastating selfish whims. He added: To those misled people we  say, you are now facing a test, either you join the ranks of  right or the ranks of falsehood. It is either you be with your  people, homeland, and unity, or with a handful of conspirators  who did not fear God in their actions against the homeland and  people, and involved the sons of the one homeland and the  comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in this bloody fighting  which they did not want. However, this criminal gang has  imposed it on our Yemeni people and the Armed Forces.    He noted that our Yemeni people are proud of their sons in  the Armed Forces, who are now waging the battle of honor and  martyrdom in defense of unity and democracy, and to eliminate  the threats and dangers posed by the rebelling, secessionist  gang.    The brother president urged the brother soldiers, NCO's, and  officers to be alert, disciplined, and ready to perform the  sacred national duty at all times and under all circumstances.    The brother president, the supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, was accompanied by brother Staff Colonel 'Ali Muhammad  Salah, deputy chief of staff for operations.</p>

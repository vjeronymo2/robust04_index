			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (12): Tiger economies win market share - Japan in Asia Japan's east-Asian neighbours have benefited from, and contributed to, the declining competitiveness of traditional sectors of Japanese manufacturing. The most successful tiger economies, Taiwan and South Korea, have used their low labour costs and cheap currencies to win market share from Japan, in selected sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, where price is a more important determinant of market success than technology. Later developing economies such as Malaysia and Thailand are rapidly catching up for the same reason. The tigers owe part of their economic success to Japanese industry's strategy of shifting production capacity for lower value-added goods to cheaper locations overseas, given fresh impetus recently by the yen's surge in value. East Asia has been the main beneficiary of this fresh industrial investment, concentrated in the most capital- and labour-intensive sectors such as cars and consumer electronics. In these sectors, Japan's Asian neighbours are assembly bases rather than strong competitors, but their economies have nevertheless benefited. Japanese direct investment in the region rose more than three-fold from Dollars 2.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 7.3bn in 1993, where it represents roughly one-fifth of Japanese investment worldwide. That proportion will nearly double, as a share of Japan's overall foreign investment, to 37.5 per cent this year, according to a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. At this rate, by the end of the decade east Asia will overtake the US as the largest recipient of Japanese industrial spending. Within east Asia, the focus of Japan's corporate investment planners has recently switched from Hong Kong and Thailand to China. Japanese investment in China grew by nearly 58 per cent in the first half of last year, faster than anywhere else in the world. Corporate Japan's Asian spending spree has stimulated a sharp rise in trade with its neighbours, as Japanese manufacturers export components and machines to their east Asian assembly plants. Helped by Japanese salaries, local economies' demand for foreign, often Japanese-made goods, has expanded. Accordingly, Asia overtook the US as Japan's largest export destination in 1991 and last year Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia; now the balance is reversed. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia will continue to rise, believes Mr Susumu Taketomi, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ). But Asian exports to Japan will grow fast enough to defuse serious political problems of the kind that bedevil Japan over its surplus with the US, he argues. 'This surplus is healthy for Asian countries. They will probably succeed in upgrading their industrial structure so that they will show a surplus at the end of the century,' he says. Most Japanese manufacturers began in east Asia with basic assembly plants, fed with components made in Japan. As local economies grow and the yen continues to rise, the Japanese are now looking to expand their use of locally made components. An added incentive to do this is the need to avoid heavy import duties on part-assembled products. Japan's industrial advance into east Asia has been led by sectors in which assembly forms a high share of costs, such as consumer electronics - as a result of which Japan last year became a net importer of colour televisions for the first time - and home appliances. Examples include electronics giants Matsushita and Sharp in Malaysia, which have become so deeply embedded in the local economy that their combined local sales account for 6 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. So far, Japanese companies have reaped rich rewards from their Asian onslaught, all the more welcome when their domestic market is stuck in a painfully slow recovery from the longest recession in post-war years. According to the IBJ, the operating profits of Asian offshoots, as a percentage of turnover, averaged 4.8 per cent in 1991, well above the 0.9 per cent average for overseas subsidiaries. However, the shift of Japanese manufacturing capacity into east Asia is limited by two things. It will only happen in sectors where Japan is least competitive, because companies wish to keep control of key technology. It is unlikely to be at the direct expense of jobs at home, because of the continuing taboo against making redundancies in Japan. Japanese companies still see an advantage in domestically producing those high technology products in which they lead world markets. Semiconductors are the obvious example, where manufacturing equipment for the newest and most powerful memories continues to be made in Japan, helping to ensure that east Asian chip-makers remain dependent on Japanese technology. The IBJ's Mr Taketomi believes the growth rate of Japan's Asian investments will slow down in the years ahead, constrained by companies' unwillingness to break the taboo against making redundancies at home. There will be instead, he predicts, a reorganisation of Japanese investments within the region, away from relatively high cost areas such as Hong Kong into cheap ones such as southern China. The Japanese government has played a cautious role in supporting Japanese industry's economic advance into Asia by gently pushing the cause of free trade in the region. Until recently, Japan's Asian diplomacy strategy was one-dimensional: aid for trade. The Tokyo government disburses 60 per cent of its annual overseas aid budget - the world's largest - to the region, partly a hang-over from post-war reparations. The new dimension is the shift in the government's attitude to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec) over the past year, from mildly negative to mildly positive. Indonesia's support for US-inspired efforts to use Apec to reduce barriers to trade and investment has helped Tokyo overcome some of its inhibitions over playing a part in Apec.  --------------------------------------------------------------                               Change on Trillion                       previous           Component   yen          Region       year (percent)     ratio (percent)  --------------------------------------------------------------  7.6           Others          -12.8                 19.0  1.9            China          +26.5                  4.8  3.6          Asean 4           +4.2                  9.0  8.9            NIEs*           -2.7                 22.3  6.3               EU          -20.2                 15.7 11.7               US           -3.2                 29.2  -------------------------------------------------------------- *S Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

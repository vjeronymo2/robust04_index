			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on yen THE FOCUS in currency markets will be on the Japanese yen this week, amid expectations that the authorities in Tokyo are on the verge of unveiling a package of measures to stimulate the economy, writes James Blitz. On Friday, the yen came under strong selling pressure against the dollar as dealers took the view that the authorities in Tokyo were about to implement their third successive fiscal boost to the economy, possibly cutting the official discount rate in the process. Last week, Mr Manae Kubota, the Economic Planning Agency Minister, said that the prime minister wanted a one trillion yen package to improve the social infrastructure. Another factor pushing the yen lower may have been reports that the Japanese foreign minister had said that Tokyo could set targets for the reduction of the trade surplus. Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan bank in London, says the yen is likely to come under strong pressure this week - and he expects it to fall as low as Y110 in the next few weeks. European dealers are likely to be preoccupied with developments in France and Germany. Following last week's Bundesbank rate cut, there are expectations that the French could take the opportunity to ease policy in their money market operations. However, many dealers expect the strength of the D-Mark to persist, and this may stay the Bank of France's hand for a while longer. In the US, the markets will focus on August consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. The CPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent, after Friday's 0.6 percent fall in producer prices. Retail sales are expected to rise 0.1 percent with industrial production up a modest 0.3 percent.</p>

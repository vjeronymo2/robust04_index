App. 2, EPA is giving notice of the establishment of an advisory committee to develop recommendations for improvements in the regulatory and statutory environmental protection framework that EPA administers. This advisory committee will be known as the ``Common Sense Initiative Council'' (CSI Council). EPA has determined that the establishment of this advisory committee is in the public interest and will assist the Agency in performing its duties under its various statutes. Copies of the Committee's charter will be filed with the appropriate committees of Congress and the Library of Congress in accordance with section 9(c) of FACA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The membership of the CSI Council has not yet been appointed by the Administrator. Consistent with the objectives of the Initiative and the requirements of FACA, the membership of both the CSI Council and its sector subcommittees will be balanced among the Agency's various outside stakeholder interests. The first meeting of the CSI Council will be announced separately in a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Anyone wanting information about substantive matters that will be considered by the CSIC, or information about the procedural aspects of CSIC operation, should contact: Steve Harper, Office of Air and Radiation, at 202&hyph;260&hyph;8953, or Vivian Daub, Office of Water, at 202&hyph;260&hyph;6790.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator announced the creation of the Common Sense Initiative (CSI) in November 1993. The Initiative reflects the Administration's commitment to setting strong environmental standards while encouraging common sense, innovation, and flexibility in how the standards are met. The goal is cleaner and cheaper environmental protection for entire industries. The Administrator's objective in establishing the CSI is to bring together federal, state, and local government representatives, environmental and environmental justice leaders, industry representatives, and other stakeholders to examine the full range of environmental requirements affecting industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The six industries the Agency has chosen to begin the pilot phase of this initiative are auto assembly, computers and electronics, iron and steel, metal finishing, petroleum refining, and printing. EPA will be convening multi-stakeholder teams for each of these industries. These teams will look for opportunities to change complicated and inconsistent environmental requirements into comprehensive strategies for environmental protection. Reflecting the importance of this effort, each of these teams will be chaired by an EPA Assistant Administrator and/or a Regional Administrator. The anticipated tangible results of this project will include recommendations for administrative, regulatory, and statutory changes that will permit us to achieve the cleaner, cheaper, smarter results we seek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The creation of the CSI Council will provide the necessary federal advisory committee framework for the Common Sense Initiative. The Council will be constituted largely from the membership of the six industry-specific teams, which in turn will be constituted as subcommittees of the Council. The Council and its sector subcommittees will each have approximately 25 members, all appointed by the Administrator. EPA will ensure that there is balanced membership among affected stakeholder groups.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen Harper,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Air and Radiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27311 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> EXPANDED DISASTER PLAN IN THE WORKS  </P> <P> Newport Beach is considering an expanded disaster plan that could add up to  three new employees to the payroll, city officials say.  </P> <P> The proposal, which is a supplement to the city's current disaster plan, is  being revised as it makes its way through each city department but should  solidify by the time budget hearings begin April 9, executive assistant Ken  Delino said. By July 1, an updated Emergency Operations Plan should be in  place, he said.  </P> <P> Last month, a residents' advisory panel gave recommendations on how to prepare  Newport Beach residents and government for a regional disaster, such as an  earthquake or major flood.  </P> <P> While the report calls Newport Beach "excellently prepared" to deal with local  emergencies, it says the city should improve plans for areawide catastrophes.  </P> <P> "If we have a singular disaster, we know we can count on aid from Costa Mesa,  Huntington Beach and the rest of Orange County, for that matter," Fire Capt.  Ray Pendleton said. "On the other hand, if we have a situation that's an  areawide disaster, then the boundaries between communities all of a sudden  become walls again. No longer can you expect someone who has problems to assist  you with your problems."  </P> <P> The committee suggested that the Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department  stockpile food, bedding and first aid for emergency shelters by July. The  department should designate the location of potential shelters and employees  should learn "shelter management" and advanced first aid, the report  recommends.  </P> <P> All departments should have an "emergency coordinator" and enough food and  water to supply city employees and volunteers for three days, the report says.  </P> <P> Budget constraints may dictate the level of preparedness, officials say. For  example, the first-year cost of adding three city employees, including the  recommended full-time emergency services coordinator, and related equipment  such as a car and computer, would cost $213,000, Pendleton said.  </P> <P> The committee also suggested that the city take steps to make residents more  self-sufficient by organizing neighborhood self-help groups and encouraging  communities to develop their own disaster plans.  </P> <P> In the case of a major disaster, Pendleton said, calling 911 is "no longer a  viable option."

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Renault sees profit despite downturn Renault, the French state-owned motor group, should report a profit for last year in spite of the sharp downturn in the European car market, Mr Patrick Faure, the company's assistant managing director said yesterday. Presenting sales figures for last year, Mr Faure said the decline in the European market, which contracted by about 2m vehicles, would have 'a major financial impact on Renault's results'. But he expected a small profit would still have been achieved. In 1992, Renault reported net profits of FFr5.7bn (Dollars 966m). Mr Faure said he expected slight growth in the French and European car markets but cautioned that predictions were difficult as car markets had become more volatile. Renault's total sales of cars and light commercial vehicles fell by about 12 per cent last year to 1.76m units, while its western European sales fell by 16.5 per cent to 1.4m units. Mr Faure said the decline was the equivalent to the output of one of its factories, while the contraction of the European market as a whole, to 12.6m units, was equivalent to the output of a large car producer. In spite of the depressed markets, the French group noted some bright spots. It said it had maintained its share of the European passenger car market at 10.6 per cent and had increased its share of the French market to 30.6 per cent from 29.5 per cent. Renault's position in the small car market was strengthened by the launch of the Twingo, which received 140,000 orders between its launch in April and the end of the year. Together with the Clio and the Superfive, the Twingo prompted an increase in Renault's share of France's small car sales to 40 per cent from 33 per cent. In Europe, the UK was the only market to show an overall improvement last year and Renault increased its sales there to 105,200 from 80,500. Italy, Spain and Portugal were the most difficult markets, with Renault suffering falls in sales and market share. Renault is on the list of 21-publicly owned groups slated for privatisation by the French government. The sale of the government's 79 per cent stake is scheduled for this year, in spite of the failure of Renault's planned merger with Volvo which was meant to take effect at the beginning of this month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031) and Qian Yonghong </F> (6929 0737 5725)]    [Text] Hohhot, 4 May (XINHUA) -- When State Council Premier  Li Peng inspected work in Inner Mongolia, he stressed that it is  necessary to conscientiously implement the central authorities'  policy on seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up  wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to  attach importance to integrating the growth rate with  efficiency; and to promote reform, opening up, and economic  construction more successfully.    After satisfactorily concluding his visit to four countries  in Central Asia and Mongolia, Premier Li Peng conducted a work  inspection of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region from 30  April to 3 May. Accompanied by Wang Qun, autonomous regional  party committee secretary, and Wuliji, autonomous regional  people's government chairman, Premier Li Peng zestfully  inspected factories, enterprises, microwave communications  equipment, and a large power plant under construction in the  vicinity of a coal pit; visited the mausoleum of Chengjisihan  [Genghis Khan] despite rains; and called on herdsmen at their  homes.    Li Peng inspected the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. He was very  pleased when he learned that the Western-style clothing produced  by the company had won a leading place in a contest between  China's top 10 famous brands of Western-style clothing held in  April 1994 and that it had been exported in large quantities.  He said: "The fact that the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. can  produce such good Western-style clothing shows that remote,  border areas, like those in the hinterland, are capable of  turning out first-rate products as long as they gear their  production to the needs of the market at home and abroad and as  long as they adopt advanced technology and management."    Li Peng also inspected the Hohhot Machine Tool Accessories  Plant. It is an old state-owned enterprise and is currently  China's largest chuck-producing plant and largest chuck research  and development center. The annual output of the Huanqiu-  [universal] brand chuck with three and four claws and various  power-driven chucks in the high- and medium-price r!nges  accounts for 60 percent of the total chuck output in China;  their products are sold to over 40 countries and regions of the  world and have won several awards at home and abroad. After  inspecting the plant's workshop, Li Peng said: "Why can the  plant always maintain very good economic efficiency? The key  lies in a good mechanism, specialized mass production, strict  management, paying attention to quality, and establishing a  business reputation on the market at home and abroad. It shows  we also can successfully run the large and medium old  enterprises owned by the state." He expressed the hope that the  Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region can successfully sum up the  experiences gained by the plant.    At a television conference room of the Inner Mongolia Radio  and Television Station, Premier Li Peng had a teleconference  meeting with leading comrades of 12 leagues and cities and  listened to the work reports made by some leagues and cities.  Li Peng affirmed the tremendous progress made by the Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region in all fields of endeavor and  conveyed his warm regards to the broad masses of servicemen and  people who had recently put out a forest fire. He praised the  teleconference, saying: Holding a teleconference not only saves  time and money but also improves work efficiency. It marks a  big step toward the modernization of office work.    On the morning of 3 May, Li Peng listened to work reports by  leading comrades of the autonomous regional party committee and  government. First of all, he affirmed the important successes  attained by the people of all nationalities in the Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region in promoting reform, opening up, and  economic construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Li Peng said: I have visited Inner Mongolia  six times and have witnessed the tremendous changes taking place  in the region since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee. Inner Mongolia faced grain shortage in the  past; now it is more than self-sufficient in its grain supply.  This represents a remarkable success. Its animal husbandry has  also enjoyed very great development. The Baotou Steel and Iron  Corporation steel works has increased its annual output of steel  from 1 million-plus tonnes in 1989 to 3 million tonnes now.  Taking advantage of its abundant coal resources to build large  power plants in the vicinity of coal pits, Inner Mongolia not  only solved the problem of an electricity shortage but also  supplied greater amounts of electricity to the power grid for  Beijing, Tianjin, and Tanggu. He pointed out: Changing coal  deliveries to electricity transmission is a strategic shift in  Inner Mongolia's economy. Li Peng said he was very pleased to  see that Inner Mongolia is enjoying political stability, unity  between nationalities, and economic development, and that these  have improved the people's living standards.    Touching on Inner Mongolia's economic work, Li Peng stressed  that it is necessary to further do a good job of promoting  agricultural and animal husbandry production. As China's  population grows, its demand for grain will further increase.  First, we must transform medium- and low-yield farmland to  increase the per mu yield; and, second, we must expand the area  of cultivated land in areas where conditions permit. Inner  Mongolia has potential in this field. It is hoped that Inner  Mongolia will become a base for the commercial production of  agriculture and animal husbandry. Because Inner Mongolia boasts  a relatively large proportion of state-owned heavy industries,  his speech required that vigorous efforts be made to  successfully run the large and medium enterprises owned by the  state, to conscientiously analyze their situations, and to find  concrete solutions to their existing problems. We must be  confident that we are capable of managing well medium and large  state-owned enterprises. In fact, many medium and large  state-owned enterprises in Inner Mongolia are functioning quite  well, and we need to summarize and popularize these enterprises'  experiences. However, for various reasons, quite a few  enterprises in Inner Mongolia are encountering difficulties in  their operations. The autonomous regional government is  responsible for helping them. Enterprises must depend on  themselves as well and make efforts to transform their operating  mechanisms to gradually extricate themselves from their  predicaments. Inner Mongolia is blessed with rich natural  resources. As Inner Mongolia's economy develops, its strong  point in natural resources is playing a more and more important  role in economic development. Under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and with  the concerted efforts of ethnic cadres and masses, there is a  great hope that Inner Mongolia will vigorously develop its  economy.    Li Peng stressed: People of various nationalities in Inner  Mongolia are united. China is a multinational country, and  unity between all nationalities is a very important prerequisite  for our efforts in all fields. I hope that the Inner Mongolian  Autonomous Region will further cultivate the favorable state of  unity between nationalities to make all peoples prosperous.    In accompanying Premier Li Peng in inspecting Inner  Mongolia,  Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the  State Nationalities Affairs Commission, said after hearing the  work reports: People of all nationalities in China are equal  and united. They cooperate with one another and make progress  together. In view of the protracted and complicated nature of  ethnic problems, we must always attach great importance to  maintaining unity between all nationalities to create favorable  social environment for China's reform, opening up, and economic  construction. He added emphatically: To strengthen national  unity, we must fully depend on cadres and masses of all  nationalities. People of all nationalities must consider  safeguarding the reunification of the motherland and national  unity as citizens' legal and moral duty. We must promptly and  efficiently resolve inner contradictions between people of all  nat)onalities accordi.g to the law. Cadres of all nationalities  at various levels must take the lead in safeguarding the  reunification of the motherland and unity between all  nationalities. We must vigorously develop the economy and  social undertakings in regions inhabited by minority peoples to  continuously strengthen the economic foundation for unity of all  nationalities.    While inspecting Inner Mongolia, Premier Li Peng was also  accompanied by Ye Qing, Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Mengkui,  and Jiang Yunbao, who are responsible persons from relevant  departments of the State Council.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rock falls to make way for chemicals - The change of direction by the world leader in china clay WHEN Mr Andrew Teare left Rugby cement group in 1990 to become chief executive of English China Clays it was assumed he had come to expand its building material interests. Three years later the former Rugby managing director is taking the company in a completely different direction - hiving off the construction operations and expanding into speciality chemicals. ECC will concentrate its activities around its mainstream business as the world's largest supplier of china clay, mainly for fillers and coatings for the paper industry. Mr Teare argues that the acquisition of Calgon, announced yesterday, will complement ECC's business which has become increasingly sophisticated in the use and development of speciality chemicals for paper-making and other processes. About 67 per cent of Calgon's sales of water-soluble polymers and biocides are for water treatment, a market in which it is the third largest supplier in the US behind Nalco Chemical and Betz Laboratories. Only 20 per cent of sales its sales are to the paper industry. Sales outside the US account for less than 20 per cent. By comparison ECC sells in more than 100 countries. It is a market leader in western Europe and the US following its acquisition of Georgia Kaolin in 1990. Mr Stephen Kirk, conglomerates analyst with Nikko Europe says: 'The acquisition of Calgon makes great sense. Calgon will have access to ECC's international marketing operations and should be able to increase its sales to the paper industry, particularly in the US where ECC is strong. 'ECC will be able to broaden its product mix in a complementary business. Water treatment is a particularly good market to be in, given environmental pressures.' The ability to increase Calgon's sales should help net margins which at 10 per cent compare unfavourably with the 16 per cent achieved by rivals Nalco and Betz, according to Mr Teare. He claims the acquisition will be earnings neutral in its first full year, despite the high purchase cost. He says that to maintain ECC's building materials business would involve the group in capital expenditure of between Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m a year just to keep its stone quarries, lorries, crushers and other equipment in good working order. This money could be better spent elsewhere. Mr Teare favours a demerger, similar to that which has just taken place at ICI, under which existing stockholders will be given shares in both companies. 'I believe shareholders get the best value this way,' he says. He also argues that demerger motivates managers better than the threat of sale. ECC, however, does not expect a demerger before annual results for 1993 are published next spring. It has not ruled out a sale of the business, although Mr Teare says this is unlikely. Analysts yesterday put the value of the business at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 180m. ECC produces about 4 per cent of all aggregates supplied to the UK construction industry and 4 per cent of coated stone used in road building. It vies with a handful of rivals for the position of the UK's fifth largest quarry operator, behind market leaders Tarmac, Hanson, RMC and Redland. Profits, however, have suffered as UK construction output has slumped. Last year the business, which includes a quarry operation in Denver in the US, made operating profits of Pounds 15.5m on sales of Pounds 352.4m. A few years ago profits were about Pounds 50m on roughly the same turnover, says ECC. Most of the company's quarries are in south west England. Its most attractive asset, however, is the Croft 'super quarry' one of a ring of very large granite quarries in Leicestershire. Croft has the capacity to produce 3m tonnes of stone a year, compared with group production of 13m tonnes last year. The business might prove attractive to a company like Wimpey which has a similar market share but has indicated that it wants to expand. Wimpey this week announced a Pounds 104m rights issue to buy housing land and to expand its minerals operations. RMC, the only one of the big four aggregate producers without a Leicestershire 'super quarry' might also be interested in making a purchase, say analysts. Another interested party might be Minorco the international mining business.</p>

Everett Koop's  harshest critics, applauded him as a hero at a walk attended by 18,000 people  seeking to raise money to fight AIDS.  </P> <P> The crowd on Boston Common roared its approval Sunday and chanted: "Koop, Koop,  Koop" as the 72-year-old public health chief, who will step down from his post  this year, approached the podium.  </P> <P> When the crowd refused to stop applauding, Koop quipped: "I could have used  that during my eight years in Washington."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister has had urgent talks on Bosnia  over the past 24 hours with both Defence Secretary Malcolm  Rifkind and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, as the West plans  its response to Saturday's [5 February] massacre of civilians in  Sarajevo.    Mr Rifkind -- who is in Sarajevo today for discussions with  the United Nations' new hard-line commander, Britain's Lt-Gen  Sir Michael Rose -- warned that use of airpower would send a  powerful message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor.    But Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC radio, was more cautious and  said that more was involved than the "one day of satisfaction"  that an air strike would create.    He warned such action could intensify the siege of Sarajevo  and halt aid convoys to the embattled Bosnian capital. However,  he said events appeared to be moving toward a meeting of NATO to  discuss the atrocities and decide how to react.    Today, as the grim death toll from the mortar attack on a  market place rose to 68, with hundreds wounded, Britain offered  hospital beds for casualties. The Foreign Office said up to 10  wounded could be brought to Britain for treatment.    In addition, a doctor and medical team are being sent to  Kosevo Hospital in the Bosnian capital to help staff overwhelmed  by the carnage there.    The offer, made via the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees, came as Mr Rifkind warned that "some response" to the  outrage would be seriously considered by allied governments.    Overseas Development Administration [ODA] surgeon Tony  Redmond of Stoke-on-Trent Hospital, was flying out to Bosnia  today with a team of paramedics. An ODA spokesman said Mr  Redmond's team would not be involved in the medical evacuation  but would be helping doctors at the hospital.    Mr Rifkind, who spoke while en route to Sarajevo aboard an  RAF Hercules, said the 16 NATO governments would discuss  specific action but refused to say what form that might take.    Any military response would have to involve punitive air  strikes and would require the full support of the UN Security  Council, where Russia is certain to put up strong objections.    Another problem for the allies is in identifying which  artillery unit was responsible for the slaughter. Failure to do  so inhibits any direct retaliatory strike.    In addition, the UN does not believe the marketplace was  deliberately targeted and stresses that any of the numerous  rounds fired at the city in recent weeks could have exacted an  equally horrific price in human life.    It has now emerged that the mortar round which caused the  carnage had landed on a roof before spraying the marketplace  with shrapnel. It has therefore proven difficult to calculate  the trajectory and point of origin of the shell, although there  is little doubt it came from a Bosnian Serb position.    Mr Rifkind said the use of airpower would send a powerful  message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor but he also  noted the possible impact on the UN's humanitarian efforts on  the ground.    Mr Hurd said mounting an air strike was not too difficult.  What was more difficult was to work out what happens next.    He said an air strike could actually prompt the Serbs to  tighten their grip on Sarajevo but added: "There may well be  ways in which force could be used in the area which would avoid  these dangers."    Mr Hurd said there were three British aims in Bosnia: to  stop  the war from spreading; to help the politicians negotiate a  peace; and to help Bosnians of all three communities to stay  alive by getting them food and fuel.    "If the use of force can help with these aims, we should  certainly be ready to consider it. I have been doing a lot of  telephoning in the last 24 hours. There has been a great deal  of discussion between the allies."    Mr Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission to Bosnia is part  of the Government's detailed review of the UN operation.    Britain and other countries contributing to the UN  Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) -- primarily France, Canada and Holland -- will  decide next month whether these efforts should continue.    While Washington has pressed hard for punitive air strikes,  the Clinton administration accepts that Britain and other allies  with troops on the ground must have a clear say in this.    Britain believes it is crucial any military move should not  obstruct the drive for peace by giving hope to any one of the  three warring factions, primarily the Muslims.    Elsewhere, Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, said that  politicians must now be prepared to accept an imperfect peace in  the former Yugoslavia. He told the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost  programme it would be quite wrong to take UN forces out while  winter continued.    And the Labour leader John Smith demanded the creation of  safe havens, backed by the implicit threat of force, as the only  way to stop the "wanton slaughter." Sarajevo should be the  first of these, he told Labour's Euro and local government  conference in Glasgow.</p>

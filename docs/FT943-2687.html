			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Get the best while paying less - There is more than one way to tap the expertise of top investment managers The myth that unit trusts are a boring, cloth cap investment may linger in the golf clubs of the land but it is not a view held by the largest investment management firms. Eight of the 10 investment managers profiled recently in the Weekend FT offer a degree of portfolio management based on collective investments. All insist that the investors who use these services benefit from their expertise just as surely as wealthy investors with bespoke equity portfolios. Peter Rees, marketing director of Rothschild Asset Management, says: 'The similarities between Libra (the RAM unit trust management service) and what we provide for high net worth individuals are remarkably close. The groups that decide our asset allocation for clients are the same, whether you are coming through Libra or through the private client service or as a large institution.' Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, makes the same point. 'The asset allocation of our unit and investment trust service will be determined to a large extent by the investment committee, and it will be a reflection of our views.' The largest fund management firms tend to offer three basic collective fund services. Some manage a specific unit trust, a core fund designed to replicate the portfolios of their wealthiest private clients, and a select few bolt on additional private client services. Others run portfolio services which provide clients with a managed basket of collective funds. Schroders is a passionate advocate of unit trusts, arguing that they provide a spread of risk which only the seriously wealthy can achieve from a direct exposure to equities; that they streamline administration; and that they offer considerable financial advantages. John Henderson, the managing director of Schroder Personal Investment Management, says: 'l could wax lyrical all day about the tax benefits of unit trusts.' He points out that they are exempt from capital gains tax and that, if the annual fee is taken from the fund's income, then investors effectively are getting income tax relief on it. Moreover, annual fees are not subject to value added tax, unlike the charges for managing directly-invested portfolios. The Schroder World fund is the one used for private clients whose main investment objective is long-term capital growth. 'Provided the clients' objectives match the objectives of the trust, the World fund is appropriate for all UK taxpayers,' says Henderson. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, but investors with Pounds 100,000-plus are offered many elements of the firm's private client service. They have two named investment managers and a stream of information throughout the year. Schroder also will liaise on bed and breakfasting units, so clients can mop up their CGT allowance, and will arrange for them to convert part of their holding each year into a personal equity plan. Mercury's answer is the Portfolio unit trust. Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury Fund Managers, describes it as 'a unit trust designed for the private clients we used to have to turn away. It simply follows the strategy that the private clients get. It is not a white-knuckle ride. It is a safe and sound approach that has done very well.' Mercury has now launched a complementary Income Portfolio fund. The firm's minimum investment is Pounds 10,000, but this sum opens the door to some private client services. Two portfolio advisers are available to investors and they get quarterly reports, with the fund's portfolio listed as if it were their own. Royds says: 'There are some great advantages with a unit trust because one of the problems you get with a private client portfolio is that you are constrained by tax from trading. We have a few people who have invested more than Pounds 1m in the Portfolio trust because they like the CGT structure so much.' The Cazenove Portfolio unit trust (minimum investment Pounds 5,000) does not offer extra private client services but it, too, provides a mirror image of a wealthy private client portfolio. Harry Henderson, managing director of Cazenove Unit Trust Management, says: 'The fund absolutely adopts the Cazenove asset allocation and sector allocation. If CGT is not a consideration, this is the way we think a private client portfolio would perform.' Similar claims are made on behalf of the Credit Suisse Investment Portfolio fund (minimum Pounds 5,000), and the Baring Portfolio fund (minimum Pounds 500). Baring also joins Rothschild, James Capel and Kleinwort Benson in offering a collective funds portfolio management service with trusts chosen from the whole marketplace. In contrast, the unit trust management service that Schroder offers to investors with more than Pounds 500,000 is confined to the firm's funds. The minimum investment for the Baring service is Pounds 20,000; at Capel, it is Pounds 25,000. Investors must have Pounds 50,000 for Rothschild's Libra service and Pounds 75,000 for Kleinwort's unit and investment trust portfolio management. Fees are 1 per cent at Baring and Rothschild, a minimum Pounds 200 a year at Capel and a minimum Pounds 250 at Kleinwort. Clearly, the message is: do not be intimidated by the investment figure required by leading private client fund managers before they will provide a bespoke portfolio. There is more than one way to secure their asset allocation and stock-picking skills.  ------------------------------------------------------------- BUDGET SERVICES FROM BIG-NAME MANAGERS  ------------------------------------------------------------- Manager                Service                    Min (Pounds)  ------------------------------------------------------------- Schroder               World fund u/t                    1,000 Mercury                Portfolio u/t                    10,000 Kleinwort Benson       Unit &amp; invst. trust services     75,000 Cazenove               Portfolio u/t                     5,000 Baring                 Portfolio u/t                       500                        Managed funds service            20,000 James Capel            Managed funds portfolio          25,000 Rothschild             Libra unit trust portfolio       50,000 Credit Suisse          Investment portfolio u/t          5,000                        High income portfolio u/t         5,000  ------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows the minimum sum needed to access the private client expertise of some of the leading investment managers. This minimum figure secures entry to a unit trust that mirrors the portfolio of a wealthy private client, or to a unit trust that does this and adds additional private client services. Alternatively, it buys a managed fund portfolio service.  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

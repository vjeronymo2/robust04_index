			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Sweden reopens two N-reactors SWEDEN'S nuclear inspection authority, SKI, yesterday allowed operations to resume at two of the five nuclear reactors it closed last September for emergency repairs, Reuter reports from Stockholm. The two reactors at Barseback can operate until the middle of this year, when service work and refuelling will be carried out. SKI in September said an accident at one plant in July had revealed shortcomings in the equipment and procedures at the five plants. The remaining three - one at Ringhals in western Sweden and two at Oskarshamn in the south - will probably be back up later this month, a spokesman said.</p>

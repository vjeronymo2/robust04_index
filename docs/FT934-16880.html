			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke injunction against Mail on Sunday LADBROKE, the hotels, betting, property and DIY group, has obtained an injunction against the Mail on Sunday preventing it from publishing specific allegations which the company says are untrue and highly damaging. The injunction was obtained on September 25. Last Friday, after hearing from contacts in the City that other Sunday newspapers were investigating these allegations, Ladbroke instructed its lawyers to send them a letter informing them of the injunction. The letter said: 'It has been brought to our attention that certain scurrilous rumours are circulating regarding both Ladbroke's relationship with its bankers and the circumstances of its chairman's recently-announced decision to retire at the end of this year. These rumours, as well as being entirely false, are highly damaging.' 'Our client has already obtained an injunction against a national newspaper preventing their publication, and no application has been made to discharge it', the letter continued. However, the Mail on Sunday reported yesterday that it was preparing an application to have the injunction lifted. Ladbroke said that it had no alternative but to take the legal route when these 'off-the-wall' allegations were brought to its attention. One month ago, Mr Cyril Stein announced his intention to retire at the end of the year after 37 years at the head of Ladbroke. However, he will be a non-executive director for a further three years. Turnover in Ladbroke's shares almost doubled last week, from 3.5m shares on Monday to 6.6m shares on Friday.</p>

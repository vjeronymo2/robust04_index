			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Daewoo's chairman may run for election MR Kim Woo-choong, the chairman of the Daewoo business group, yesterday indicated that he would accept a possible presidential nomination by South Korea's newest political party. But officials of the New Korea party (NPK) remained divided over whether to offer him the candidancy. Opponents to Mr Kim's nomination argue that the NPK's chances in the December election would be hurt if he is the candidate. There is strong public distrust of Korea's main conglomerates, of which Daewoo is the fourth largest, because of their close ties with the country's former military rulers. However, the NPK, which was formed only a week ago by a conservative splinter group from the ruling Democratic Liberal party, may have no alternative but to accept Mr Kim. Several other potential candidates, including Mr Park Tae-joon, the former chairman of Pohang Iron and Steel, have refused to become the NPK candidate. Mr Kim would become the fourth main candidate in the presidential election if he receives the NPK nomination. The NPK could play a pivotal role in the forthcoming campaign by helping to split the conservative vote and possibly delivering the election to Mr Kim Dae-jung, the leading opposition leader.</p>

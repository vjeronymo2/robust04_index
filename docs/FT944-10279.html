			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Magnesium served up on a plate A UK electroplating company believes it has found a method of plating magnesium which will allow the metal to be used more widely in precision engineering. The lightness and strength of the metal makes it an attractive material for equipment such as portable telephones but its susceptibility to corrosion has been a serious drawback. Magnesium's high reactivity has hampered previous efforts to plate the metal. But Ingram &amp; Glass, a Godalming plating company in conjunction with PMD (UK), a Coventry chemicals company, has developed a process which combines electroless nickel technology with magnesium chemistry that permits the mass production of plated magnesium die-castings.

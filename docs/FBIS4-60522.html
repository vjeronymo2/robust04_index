			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 25 May (MENA) -- Sudanese security  authorities tonight seized the residential quarters of the  Egyptian Community School teachers along with the administrative  headquarters of the Egyptian education mission in Khartoum. The  Sudanese authorities expelled the teachers from their quarters  and assembled them in one location.    It is not clear how many facilities the Sudanese authorities  seized. The move is part of a campaign launched recently by the  Sudanese authorities to confiscate Egyptian facilities in Sudan.  Earlier tonight, the same authorities confiscated a house  belonging to the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry.</p>

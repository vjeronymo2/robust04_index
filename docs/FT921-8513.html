			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Further reductions in corporate tax pledged GERMAN industrialists have been promised a second round of corporate tax cuts before the end of the year, after criticising last week's government tax reforms as inadequate to improve competitiveness, writes Quentin Peel. At the same time they stepped up at the weekend their campaign calling for further substantial tax cuts, and warning of the dangers of big increases in the current round of wage negotiations. Both the federation of German industry (BDI) and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, agreed in separate statements that top marginal rates of both corporate and income tax should be cut to 46 per cent, from 50 and 53 per cent respectively. However, while Mr Mollemann promised a second round of tax reforms this year, the industrialists voiced doubts that it would be possible, given the strain on the state budget. The BDI issued a sharp critique of the tax package approved on Friday in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, in spite of government jubilation at having split the Social Democrat opposition when forcing the bill through a months-long negotiating procedure. By offering German states, especially the five in former East Germany, a significant transfer of tax revenues, including the entire benefit of an increase in value added tax from 14 to 15 per cent next year, the central government had left itself no further room for tax reform manoeuvre, the BDI said. The package - which would originally have given the business sector overall cuts of about DM7.4bn (Pounds 2.57bn) through increased thresholds for business property tax and tax on trade earnings, and the abolition of trading capital tax - was watered down to a net gain of only DM4.4bn in negotiations. The trading capital tax will now be retained. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, sees no compelling motivations at the moment to either raise or lower German interest rates, according to an interview published in Der Spiegel, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. He also admits in the German magazine article that the Bundesbank's middle-range goal of a 2 per cent inflation rate will not be reached this year. However it was possible that the rate could show a '3 before the decimal point' if certain conditions were met.</p>

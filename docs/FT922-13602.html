			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Nigerians roll out the red carpet for old enemies 'STRANGE visitor]' proclaimed the editorial in yesterday's Daily Champion newspaper in Nigeria, capturing the sense of unreality which attends the state visit of Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, to the country which has long been Pretoria's bitterest enemy. Last night Mr De Klerk steeped off his presidential jet to hear a Nigerian army band play 'Bie Stem', the anthem of Afrikaaner nationalism and the apartheid policy inspired by it. South African flags hung alongside Nigerian banners on the road from the airport to the capital, Abuja. South African officials, many in the shiny grey suits and grey shoes which are the uniform of the Afrikaner bureaucrat, stand out strangely from the crowd of resplendently robed Nigerian officials in the ultra-modern lobby of the Hilton Hotel. In the restaurants, white South Africans eagerly serve themselves Nigerian specialities from the buffet, traditional dishes like pounded yam and egusi stew, and fiery pepper soup. Nigerians are referred to officially as 'our African brothers', and even in private the goodwill is obvious. Indeed, the Nigerian foreign minister, Mr Ike Nwachukwu, praised Mr de Klerk's courage yesterday and welcomed the Boers as 'one of the several tribes that make up Africa'. In an emotional statement after a meeting with South African foreign minister Pik Botha, he said Nigeria was 'delighted' with the progress South Africa had made in 'closing the book on apartheid'. Normal Nigerians, for their part, have gone out of their way to make the South Africans welcome. At the Paradise restaurant - a shed in the Gariki Motor Park market, where dishes are ladled into plastic bowls and eaten with the hand - patrons are enthusiastic about the South Africans, so recently condemned as racists. They believe business with Pretoria will bring economic development. Few normal Nigerians are in evidence: Abuja, the new capital, is a large building-site with few completed buildings - a hotel, some government ministries, and an impressive gold-domed mosque. But the government plans a grand reception even so: a 21-gun salute, a guard of honour, and red carpets everywhere. Several newspapers urged the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), the ultra-radical black South African group, to enter talks on a post-apartheid constitution, which it has so far boycotted. A PAC delegation was due in Abuja today to meet Mr Botha, for the highest-ever official contact between the two sides. The South Africans hope this will pave the way to membership of the Organisation of African Unity, of which Nigeria's President Ibrahim Babangida is chairman. African Development Bank (ADB) president Babacar N'diaye said yesterday the bank would consider financing South African development as soon as a multi-party interim government was in place, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'Once South Africa reaches a point of no return by installing an interim government, the ADB will do all it can to help finance development programmes,' Mr N'diaye told reporters at the end of an 11-day fact-finding visit.</p>

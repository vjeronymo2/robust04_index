In order to maintain a state of readiness to combat any  emergency, training courses and regular exercises were conducted  for plant site as well as off-site areas, he said.    The feed-back of such exercises was recorded and the  emergency preparedness plans were reviewed to make improvements,  if any, for enhancing their effectiveness.

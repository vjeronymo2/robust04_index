			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (5): Distrust remains - Public perceptions The rapid advances that have been made in the biotechnology industry over the past 20 years have caused much public debate. This debate has been focused on applications in health care, but equally controversial have been biotechnology developments in agriculture and food processing. Some experts say that the lack of public support in Europe, in particular, is a stumbling block to industry progress. Studies conducted on the public perception of biotechnology over the past 10 years largely have concluded that the key to positive public support is education. Part of the problem is the lack of understanding of exactly what biotechnology is. 'People in general have very little idea of what biotechnology is,' says Eirlys Roberts, CBE, author of The Public and Biotechnology, a study on public attitudes in Europe towards biotechnology. 'They have a clearer idea of the genetic engineering part of biotech, but even that knowledge mostly comes from press coverage.' In the study, Public Attitudes to Genetic Engineering: Some European Perspectives, the author Louis Lemkow argues that if the industry cannot properly define itself, challenges lie ahead. 'The term biotechnology itself is problematic. Even today, many scientific meetings held on biotechnology are prefaced by lengthy discussions on the provision of adequate definition of the subject,' Mr Lemkow says. He adds that with 41 definitions of biotechnology in EU documents alone, 'the number of definitions of the work has become a matter of embarrassment'. Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive officer of British Bio-technology Group and chairman of the UK BioIndustry Association, says: 'You can't use biotechnology as a generic term, it is not a useful description, it does not tell people anything.' He believes that people are interested not in the biotechnology process but in the benefit of the end result. 'If you tell people you have a possible treatment for cancer, the reception will be positive.' The European Commission-funded EU-wide survey conducted by Eurobarometer Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering - What Europeans Think about it in 1993 - an update on the 1991 survey also highlights the public's distrust of the industry. In ranking order, the most reliable sources of information on biotechnology and genetic engineering are considered to be environmental organisations, consumer organisations and schools and universities, according to Eurobarometer. Eurobarometer's study finds that less than one respondent in five believes public authorities provide a reliable source of information on biotechnology. In Denmark, however, this is nearer one in two. The survey indicated that Germans were more trusting of information from the government authorities than other European countries. Regardless of the nationality and the applications of biotechnology in question, demand for governmental control of the various applications is great. Whereas the perception of risk is particularly high in Denmark the support recorded is about the European average. Although weaker than registered in Denmark the perception of risk is also high in west Germany - the second highest in the EU. To counter this, the Trade Ministry of the German state of North Rhine Westphalia recently launched an initiative to support investment in biotechnology research in the state. Trade minister Gunter Einert told a conference in early May, that 'while the revised federal law governing genetic and biotechnology research now gives German companies competitive parity with foreign rivals it is important to change the public's negative perceptions of biotechnology.' Mr Einert said he intended to highlight 'positive examples' of genetic and biotechnology research and foster international co-operation. In the UK, a department of trade and industry-sponsored survey revealed that the industry's efforts are failing to win support from sections of the public which are relatively well informed about biotechnology. The study found that 80 per cent of those questioned considered the industry to be an unreliable source of information. Some 68 per cent said they thought it took short cuts with safety. Dr McCullagh said he did not think the full picture had yet emerged. 'I am confident that once biotechnology products hit the market and people see what great value it has to offer Britain, public perception will be much more receptive,' he said. Quite a different situation exists in the US. Daniel Eramian, vice-president of corporate communications for the US Biotechnology Industry Organisation said US public perception was favourable, partially as a result of the Clinton healthcare proposals. 'The healthcare debate for whatever reason, decided to make the large pharmaceutical companies as the bad guys and the biotech companies came out looking like the good guys.' He also attributes US success to what he terms a 'freer enterprise system', where investors are willing to invest a large amounts of money in small companies. 'It is part of the American dream, the small company striving to become bigger and better. There are about 1,300 US biotech companies and about 75 per cent of them are small businesses.' Mr Eramian said he found the US media supportive of the US industry. 'The industry provides a lot of information as products hit the market. We explain what it is all about, including the risks. It is not done in a vacuum, it is not dishonest and we certainly do not give the impression that we want to put our heads in the sand. People need to know what we are doing, if the industry is to be successful.' However Mr Eramian concedes that 'no matter what you do, there will always be concern over something new, particularly if you are not told about it.'

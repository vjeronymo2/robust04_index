			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, coupist  Haitian officers intensified their actions to defend against a  possible military intervention to reestablish democracy in this  Caribbean nation. Today, the de facto government ordered  barricades of sand bags be erected in the area surrounding the  National Palace and General Headquarters.    Meanwhile, Emmanuel Constant, leader of the paramilitary  group Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH), announced  that on Friday they will begin a strike to protest the possible  U.S. intervention. He said the group, which changed its name to  the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front, will stage the  measure against U.S. President William Clinton, William Gray,  his adviser for the Haitian crisis, and deposed Haitian  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    FRAPH patrolled the streets of the capital last October to  prevent any activity after declaring a strike to protest the  return of Aristide, which was scheduled for 30 October in  compliance with the Governor's Island Agreement. Followers of  the military protested the U.S. Government's intention to  disseminate antimilitary propaganda from planes in a two-week  period, like they did in Panama and Iraq.    Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies and  confidant of the coupist officers, said "that is immoral... they  want to cause a civil war... the military High Command is not  responsible for the coup... it was organized by soldiers."    Meanwhile, sources at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti said that  more than half of the diplomatic mission's personnel and their  dependents have left the country, four days before the  suspension of commercial flights to Haiti goes into effect.  This measure is part of the nearly total embargo decreed since  22 May to pressure military officers into relinquishing power  and allowing the return of Aristide.</p>

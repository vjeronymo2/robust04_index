			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH CAMPS  </P> <P> I have been reading about the anticipated closing of the county probation youth  camps. As a physician, I have treated many young men who have been in these  camps. Most have received quite a good education.  </P> <P> May I note that in your editorial "A Modest Proposal" (May 3) you state that  about 40% of the current state government revenue surplus must go to education  due to Proposition 98.  </P> <P> Why do the youth camps not qualify for education -- why can't Proposition 98  money be applied to them?  </P> <P> STEVEN D. KAMAJIAN, D.O.  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIECE OF MISSOURI'S SEN. DANFORTH ARRESTED ON NARCOTICS CHARGE  </P> <P> A niece of U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) has been arrested and charged  with possessing narcotics following the interception of cocaine in a Federal  Express package being sent to her Missouri residence from Los Angeles  International Airport.  </P> <P> The woman, Elizabeth G. Danforth, 26, was arrested at her St. Louis, Mo., home  by an undercover St. Louis County detective on May 11 when she accepted the  package, a Los Angeles law enforcement source said Friday.  </P> <P> Danforth is the daughter of William H. Danforth, chancellor of Washington  University of St. Louis. Her family founded Ralston Purina, the world's largest  producer of commercial feeds for livestock and poultry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dog Detects Narcotics  </P> <P> The assistant chief trial attorney for the St. Louis County prosecutor's  office, James Baker, said the woman was charged with two felony counts of  possession of cocaine and one misdemeanor count of possession of marijuana. He  said she posted $15,000 bail and that no arraignment date has been set.  </P> <P> The Federal Express package was stopped at LAX on May 10 by a member of a  local-federal drug task force, who believed that the woman mailing it fit a  drug profile, said the source, who declined to be identified.  </P> <P> A specially trained dog then sniffed the package, addressed to an "Emily  Daniels," and indicated that it contained narcotics. Approximately 14 grams of  cocaine was found in the package, the source said.  </P> <P> Additional cocaine and marijuana was found in her residence, the St. Louis  County prosecutor said.  </P> <P> The wealthy and socially well-connected Danforth family established in 1927 the  Danforth Foundation, a national educational philanthropic group.  </P> <P> The suspect's uncle, Sen. Danforth, is the ranking Republican on the Senate  Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and one of the wealthiest  members of the Senate. He has been a sponsor of legislation to combat drug and  alcohol abuse among transportation employees.  </P></p>

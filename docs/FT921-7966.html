			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Indians fear Tiger hit squad Indian commandos took over security at the Indian High Commission and India house in Colombo yesterday and put guards outside the homes of Indian diplomats following intelligence reports that a hit squad of the Tamil tigers had slipped into the city, Mervyn de Silva writes from Colombo. The Tiger radio based in the island's northern jungles has been broadcasting defiant speeches from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)after the Indian government placed large notices in the local press naming Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, head of the LTTE and his intelligence chief Pottu Amman as suspects in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination.</p>

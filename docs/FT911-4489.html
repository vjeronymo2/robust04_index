			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Government 2-1 defeat over murder sentences - Criminal justice THE POLICY of mandatory life sentences for murder was shattered by the Lords yesterday as peers rejected government advice and decided to give judges discretion to impose whatever sentences they thought fit. Senior judges led the cross-bench revolt which defeated the government by more than two-to-one in the committee discussion of the Criminal Justice Bill. Peers voted by 177 to 79, a majority of 98 against the government, to follow the advice of a Lords select committee on murder, and give judges the option of sentencing murderers to set prison terms. They then defeated the government again - by 120 votes to 68 - in deciding that where life imprisonment was imposed, the judge would be required to give his reasons and indicate how many years should be served. The government intends to overturn the Lords' decisions when the bill returns to the Commons, but the scale of the defeats must raise doubts about whether it will be able to insist on returning to the previous position. Lord Lane, the lord chief justice, said judges could set the appropriate sentence for murder as for other serious crimes, and that the trial judge was in the best position to determine the right penalty. Lord Nathan, who had chaired the select committee, said the sentence should be a decision in open court, rather than taken in secrecy by the home secretary as it is under the present system. The range of crimes within the definition of murder, he said, was so wide that imposing a life sentence in all of them diluted its gravity and credibility. Lord Waddington, the leader of the Lords and a former home secretary, said the government had concluded that the proposed change would damage public confidence in the criminal justice system and in the judiciary.</p>

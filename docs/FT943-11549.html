			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Two life companies buck UK sector trend Two life companies have announced increases in UK new business for the first half of this year, in contrast to the trend for the sector as a whole. Equitable Life said that its total new premium income for the six months to end-June was Pounds 746.9m - an increase of 12 per cent on the same period last year. There was only a slight increase in new annual premiums, from Pounds 186.4m to Pounds 186.7m, but new single premiums rose more sharply, to Pounds 560.2m (Pounds 478.3m). Within new annual premium business, the greatest percentage increase in annual premium income was in individual pensions for directors and executives which rose to Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 22.8m). New single premium business saw a steep increase in individual pensions, from Pounds 116.1m in the first half of 1993 to Pounds 164.1m. AXA Equity &amp; Law said yesterday that its UK new business increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 295m for the first half of 1994, while total new business amounted to Pounds 421m - an increase of 10 per cent on the first six months of last year. Overseas business rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 126m. The UK new business increase comes in spite of a 24 per cent drop in single premium pensions business, which fell to Pounds 55m.</p>

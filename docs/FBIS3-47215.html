The ruling coalition parties are working hard to iron out  their difference on whether to hike the consumption tax to  finance an income tax cut, EPA Director General Manae Kubota  told a regular press conference.    When a consensus is reached on this "thorny issue," Kubota  said, the ruling coalition parties will coordinate their view  with the government at a joint economic forum.    The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest in the  seven-party coalition, has been strongly opposed to hiking the  consumption tax.</p>

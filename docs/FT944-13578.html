			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: The implausible guardian of morals Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Egyptian-born businessman who runs the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, is an implausible guardian of British public morals. Yet it cannot be denied that he has shown a remarkable and consistent knack of exposing double standards in the City, government and the press. Before the mid-1980s, when he and his brothers came to public attention because of their bid for the House of Fraser stores group, Mr Fayed had sat on the board of Mr Tiny Rowland's controversial international conglomerate, Lonrho, and acted as a middleman for British contractors in the Gulf. How he progressed from there to acquiring sufficient funds to launch a cash bid that valued House of Fraser at Pounds 615m has never been satisfactorily explained. Leading merchant bankers in the City were nonetheless prepared to take this potentially lucrative client at his own valuation. Chief among them were Kleinwort Benson, one of whose then directors, Mr John MacArthur, declared on television at the time that he personally knew the net worth of the Fayeds to be several billion dollars. In the light of subsequent events the inquiries that supported this assertion appear to have been less than rigorous. Nor did the Department of Trade or the Office of Fair Trading look far into the Fayeds' background. The secretary of state, Mr Norman (now Lord) Tebbit, waved through the bid within 10 days, relying heavily on the names of the professional advisers, who included City lawyers Herbert Smith alongside Kleinworts. The press was equally uncritical, giving credence to stories circulated by City public relations man Mr Brian Basham. The Fayeds' fortune, according to Mr Basham, derived from a cotton empire founded by their great grandfather in the 19th century, which then expanded into shipping as they exported their wares to the mills of Lancashire. The first indication that these stories were questionable emerged when Mr Rowland, who believed that the Fayeds had deceived him over their intention to buy Harrods, started a public campaign to discredit the brothers, dubbing them 'the phoney pharoahs'. Subsequent independent inquiries by the Financial Times and a Channel Four television documentary did indeed discover that the Fayed brothers' origins and funds were not what they claimed. The findings were later confirmed by a Department of Trade inspectors report. The inspectors concluded that the Fayeds 'dishonestly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the secretary of state, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of Fraser board and House of Fraser shareholders, and their own advisers'. Among other things, it emerged that Mr Mohamed Fayed's colourful past included an adventure in the 1960s in which he absconded with Dollars 100,000 belonging to the Haitian government of 'Papa Doc' Duvalier. He was known in this impoverished Caribbean country as a Kuwaiti sheikh. The Arab equivalent of the particule nobiliaire - Mohamed 'Al' Fayed - was adopted in the early 1970s. By the 1980s Mr Fayed had become an adviser to the Sultan of Brunei. Through a power of attorney he also had access to the Sultan's bank account. While the DTI inspectors were unable to prove that the Sultan's money paid for the bid, they concluded that this was the most likely explanation for the Fayed brothers' sudden ability to finance a huge takeover bid. The connection with the Sultan also opened important doors, notably that of No 10 Downing Street before the bid. Mr Fayed has claimed in the press that he was instrumental in persuading the Sultan not to withdraw Brunei's funds from sterling. He also claims to have persuaded the Sultan not to take defence contracts elsewhere. Despite the fact that the Fayed brothers clearly deceived the government, no action was taken by ministers to disqualify them as directors of a public company. This inertia has never been satisfactorily explained, although the late Nicholas Ridley, when trade and industry secretary, justified the decision not to pursue the brothers by saying that no shareholder had suffered and that the matter was trivial. What was not made public at the time was that Mr Fayed had privately donated Pounds 250,000 to Tory party funds. Whether the new independent commission of inquiry under Lord Nolan will take such a relaxed view remains to be seen. The grant of money to Tory party funds was confirmed to the Financial Times by a spokesman for Mr Fayed last week. It appears to cast the government's weak response to the DTI inspectors' findings in a new and dramatic light. Nor have the inspectors' findings loosened all ties with the Fayeds' professional and establishment friends. Herbert Smith continued to act for Mr Mohamed Fayed's business interests after the publication of the inspectors' report - this despite the report's revelation that a Herbert Smith partner had been systematically deceived on a trip to Egypt to inquire into the Fayeds' origins and wealth. While Kleinwort Benson parted company with House of Fraser, Mr MacArthur continued to act as a consultant to the Fayeds. Nor was former minister Mr Neil Hamilton alone in having enjoyed hospitality at the Fayeds' Paris Ritz. Several establishment and showbusiness personalities went there when Mr Fayed completed the restoration of the late Duke of Windsor's Paris home. So, too, did leading journalists. There is a striking correlation between a number of the beneficiaries of this largesse and uncritical press comment, including the designation of Mr Fayed as Mohamed 'Al' Fayed. The Queen, meanwhile, continues to meet Mr Fayed at the Windsor Horse Show, which derives support from Harrods. Although the Fayed brothers have spent large sums in an attempt to rehabilitate their reputation, they have never sued those in the media who revealed their deceptions before publication of the DTI inspectors' report, which enjoys qualified privilege in terms of libel. Nor did their case against the DTI inspectors in the European Court of Human Rights meet with success - in spite of the court's known reservations about the department's investigation process. Mr Fayed has frequently claimed that he wants British justice. Given that he has never refuted the claims produced by his critics, the question Lord Nolan might be tempted to ask is why British justice has not been visited upon him.</p>

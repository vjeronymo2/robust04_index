			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified JANA editor] </F>   [Text] In a statement, the Rwandan National Front  criticized France's interference in Rwanda. The Front stressed  that France had been involved in this conflict for three years  through giving weapons to some parties in the conflict and this  added to the massacres among the ranks of the Rwandan people.  The UN secretary general called for preparing a huge UN military  force to send to Rwanda, which is witnessing a party and tribal  conflict.    The JANA African affairs editor commented on this by saying:  Western states are the ones that fabricate incidents and  problems in many parts of the world with the aim of achieving a  military intervention in those regions.    The editor wondered why international forces did not stop  the  racial and religious conflict in Bosnia and said that the  dubious role of these forces in Somalia was known to all.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE WEEK OF NOV. 27.  </P> <P> SEC Wins Judgment Against Burbank Company: The Securities and Exchange  Commission won a judgment against Richard "R. G." Reynolds Enterprises Inc., a  former Burbank investment advisory firm, accused of violating securities laws  by taking $4 million from 400 investors. All or nearly all the proceeds from  Reynolds investment programs went into one bank account controlled by Reynolds  and was not invested. Acting on a motion by the SEC, U.S. District Judge A.  Andrew Hauk ruled in Los Angeles that Reynolds had violated securities laws and  ordered an accounting of the money Reynolds took in. Reynolds' attorney, Jenny  Scovis, predicted that the decision would be overturned on appeal. (Filed April  12, 1988., Case No. CV-88-01978 AAH)  </P></p>

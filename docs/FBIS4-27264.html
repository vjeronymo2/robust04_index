			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [1 June] supported Japan's possession of a spy  satellite in the future, saying the nation would deal positively  with upgrading its information-gathering ability.    Hata told a session of the House of Representative Budget  Committee that currently Japan has no plan to own a spy  satellite. "But it is important to have correct (military)  information to ensure our self-defense," the premier said. "We  must study concrete issues."    Hata, asked about relations between a Diet resolution  prohibiting military use of outer space and spy satellites, said  the fact that the Defense Agency receives information from a  U.S. spy satellite on a commercial basis does not contravene the  resolution. "I understand that the Self-Defense Forces have  been allowed to make use of satellites that are generally used,"  Hata said.    Atsushi Kanda, director general of the Defense Agency, told  the same committee session that Japan should have the ability  "to repulse ballistic missiles in the future." In that context,  however, Kanda showed a cautious stance on the issue, saying,  "there are various difficult problems such as the Diet  resolution."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 16 (XINHUA) -- The largest exhibition  of radio and television facilities opened here today in the  city's China export commodity fair center.    The five-day display, organized jointly by the Broadcasting  and Television Department of Guangdong Province and Hong Kong  industrial and Commercial Exhibition Co. Ltd, has drawn  manufacturers and dealers from the United States, Japan, Italy,  France, Britain, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium.    On display are the world's most up-to-date specialized  broadcasting facilities and technology, including audio-video  machines, testing and satellite broadcasting facilities.    The organizers pointed out that broadcasting and TV have  boomed in the southern Chinese provinces in recent years with  the fast- expanding economy, and there are over 30 TV stations  in the economically developed Guangdong Province alone.    They said that this would lead to greater demand for  production technology and modern facilities. The show is  expected to attract over 30,000 visitors, including TV stations  and performing troupes from across the country.</p>

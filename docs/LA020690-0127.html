			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP TREASURER CANDIDATE HITS RIVALS' ETHICS  </P> <P> Republican state treasurer candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan criticized  Democratic rival Kathleen Brown on Monday for a "clear ethics violation" in  soliciting contributions from the investment banking community.  </P> <P> Since the bankers manage the state's investment portfolio, Buchanan said, it is  "blatantly unethical" for candidates running for treasurer to accept  contributions from Wall Street officials.  </P> <P> Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer from Irvine, said Brown is scheduled to hold  a fund-raiser tonight that will include some investment banking officials.  </P> <P> Brown's campaign office said the candidate was planning a fund-raiser in New  York City, but they could not confirm whether it included investment bankers.  Brown was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Buchanan has also complained about her Republican opponent, incumbent Treasurer  Thomas Hayes, for raising money from Wall Street companies in New York.  </P> <P> In officially declaring her candidacy at a press conference here Monday,  Buchanan again vowed that she will not accept any contributions from the  investment banking community.  </P> <P> "I am the only candidate that can assure all Californians that, as treasurer, I  will have no other agenda than to obtain the best possible deal for  Californians," Buchanan said.  </P> <P> "This is the day of political scandals, investigations, indictments and  convictions," she said. "Californians should not be asked to tolerate any more  special interest influence in positions of public trust."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- A projection of current  account surplus included in Japan's trade package is not a  numerical target, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday  [29 March]. "It is not a numerical target, and I believe  foreign nations will recognize this," Fujii told reporters at  the Diet after emerging from a morning cabinet meeting.    Japan unveiled earlier the package of market-opening and  fiscal measures designed to seek a breakthrough in the stalled  trade talks with the United States.    Although it offers neither specific targets in reducing  trade  surplus nor measuring market access, the package spells out that  an official government economic forecast indicates the ratio of  current account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will  fall from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal  1993 that ends on Thursday and to 2.8 percent in coming fiscal  1994.    Fujii indicated his opposition in using construction bonds  to  finance an increase suggested in the package for the  government's public works spending plan from fiscal 1991 through  2001. Construction bonds are "debt and leave principal and  interest payments to future generations," Fujii stressed.    But he declined to comment on tax hikes that are apparently  the only alternative.    In the trade program, Japan reconfirms that it will decide  by  the end of June a proposed boosting of the public works spending  plan on a condition that financing is secured to avoid leaving  burdens to future generations.    On tax cuts, Fujii said the trade package reaffirmed as he  has been stressing that the ruling coalition parties are slated  to decide in June on a full-fledged tax reform, including a  continuation of income tax cuts that are limited to a  single-year scheme for fiscal 1994. He noted that the package  shows Japan's further commitment by stating that the Diet's  House of Representatives attached a provision for permanent  income tax cuts in the single-year bills passed last week.    The bills are now under deliberation at the House of  Councillors.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other officials  have said that Japan's single-year tax cuts are insufficient to  boost domestic demand and curb trade surplus, and have also  called for further fiscal measures.    Fujii would not make any predictions over the U.S. reaction  on the trade measures Japan has vowed to compile by the end of  March.    With the package launched in time, Japan now awaits U.S.  judgment as officials have repeated that the U.S. would assess  the possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after  reviewing the March measures.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Richemont defies gloom on brand names Richemont, the Swiss group combining the Rothmans tobacco and the Cartier and Dunhill luxury goods businesses, has defied the prevailing pessimism over branded products. It reported a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Pounds 310.9m (Dollars 460.1m), for the six months to September 30. Mr Anton Rupert, managing director, said although times were tough, his faith in brands was unshaken. 'I would rather keep on supporting our brands in a recession than show a big increase in earnings,' he said. Group sales were up 13.2 per cent, to Pounds 1.7bn, but almost all of the growth came from currency gains. Net income rose by only 2.2 per cent to Pounds 96.6m, because the strong performance of Rothmans' 50 per cent-quoted companies in Malaysia and Australia led to a 29 per cent jump in deductions for minority interests. Rothmans' worldwide cigarette volumes were 9 per cent lower, with the drop particularly pronounced in France, the UK and the former Yugoslavia. Vendome, the new holding company combining Dunhill and Cartier, the group's luxury goods interests, saw sales rise 15.4 per cent to Pounds 524.4m in the half year, helped substantially by favourable currency changes. Similarly, exchange rates, combined with the impact of cost-cutting, enabled Vendome to increase operating profits by 23.9 per cent, to Pounds 90.1m from Pounds 72.7m. However, the increase in operating profits was restricted to just 8 per cent in Swiss francs. The strongest area of Vendome's activity was the jewellery and pens division, which includes Cartier and Mont Blanc. The watch division suffered a 3 per cent fall in sales, and the leather goods business, which is heavily dependent on the volatile Japanese market, slipped by 11 per cent. Operating losses on other activities rose to Pounds 8.7m from Pounds 8m. Larger losses at the satellite television network, FilmNet, in which the group has a 45 per cent stake, overwhelmed the lower profits of the US direct retailing interests. Mr Rupert said Vendome's sales in October were slightly below those of a year earlier. However, he forecast that both it and Rothmans would turn in satisfactory full-year results. There would be further significant costs at FilmNet.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / US envoy to step up pressure on Haiti leaders PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is increasing the pressure on Haiti by sending an envoy to tell the army leaders, who took power in a coup 18 months ago, that his patience with them is running out. The president fears a flood of Haitians seeking asylum unless the political crisis in Haiti is resolved and Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who was overthrown and sent into exile by the army, returns to office. Mr Clinton's decision was announced after a meeting on Tuesday with Mr Aristide. But the US president refused to announce a deadline for his return to office. Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, yesterday said the military leaders, and the small but affluent elite which backs them, were unlikely to be moved either by a message from Mr Clinton or by Mr Aristide's moderation of his conditions for a return to office. The intervention by Mr Clinton is the strongest statement yet by a US president in support of efforts to end the political crisis in the Caribbean state of 7m people. Earlier efforts to reinstall Mr Aristide, including an economic blockade of Haiti, have failed, and Mr Aristide has questioned the willingness of the US and other countries to press the coup leaders out of office. Envoys in Port-au-Prince say, however, that the country's rulers have established sufficient economic supply lines to allow them to continue defying efforts to have Mr Aristide returned. They expect little change after the visit by Mr Clinton's envoy. But Mr Clinton is backing his initiative with support for a proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m) development fund for Haiti from international financial institutions, to be spread over five years after the elected government is restored. This promise of significant aid for the economically distressed country could bring increased popular pressure on the military rulers, who have traditionally reacted ruthlessly and violently to dissent. The renewed pressure against the army leaders also coincides with the return to the country this week of Mr Dante Caputo, a former foreign minister of Argentina and now a special UN envoy who has been trying to broker a resolution of the political crisis.</p>

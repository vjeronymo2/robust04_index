			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Local grocers set out new stall - Independent retailers, under pressure from supermarkets for the last decade, are banding together to fight back.  Their plans to be a cohesive second force There are few more striking measures of Britain's changing shopping habits than the retreat of small neighbourhood grocers in the face of ever larger supermarkets operated by powerful national chains such as J. Sainsbury and Tesco. Once the main purveyors of household provisions, the number of independent retail outlets shrank by a third during the 1980s while their share of total food and drink sales fell from a quarter to a seventh. In the past year, widespread Sunday opening by food superstores has added to the pressure. Richard Hyman of Verdict, a retailing research company, puts the independent grocers' market share today at barely 12 per cent, the lowest in western Europe. Now, the independents aim to stand and fight. This week, Nisa Today's, the largest association of supermarkets and wholesalers, announced plans to turn its members into a cohesive second force by co-ordinating more closely their operations, from product specification to the point of sale. Formed 15 years ago, Nisa Today's negotiates annual bonuses and discounts with suppliers and organises promotion campaigns on behalf of its 718 members, which have combined sales of Pounds 9bn. It also helps with the development of own-label products and distribution. These activities are set to move into higher gear with the formation of a central buying consortium which aims to present a common front to suppliers by combining the purchasing power of its members. Initially, the consortium will be backed by Nisa Today's seven biggest members, including Booths, Budgens, Circle K, Grandways, Londis and Walter Willson. They will be joined later by a further 28 organisations. Together, this group serves 10m customers a week and has annual sales of Pounds 3bn. Though only a third of Sainsbury's or Tesco's turnover, that is more than the revenues of Morrisons, the north of England supermarket chain. As well as aiming to secure keener discounts by buying in bulk, the consortium expects to double the total number of lines available to its members to 13,000, almost as many as are stocked by Sainsbury's. The consortium also hopes to cut the cost of own-label procurement by getting its members to agree on standardised product specifications and packaging. In the next few weeks, the consortium plans to negotiate with about 70 leading manufacturers. However, it is coy about the price reductions it expects to achieve. Nor will it say how much of any savings will be passed on to consumers, arguing that this will depend on the costs and volumes of individual retailers. On most price comparisons, the independents fare poorly, charging as much as 20 per cent more than Sainsbury's or Tesco for a typical shopping basket. For some items, such as fish fingers and tomato ketchup, the difference averages well over 30 per cent. However, John von Spreckelsen, appointed last year as chief executive of the ailing Budgens supermarket chain and a prime mover behind the formation of the consortium, believes the gains will be appreciable. He argues that buying consortia have already proved their worth in continental Europe. He says a German retail chain he previously managed achieved savings equal to 1.25 per cent of turnover after it joined a consortium. But why should food and drink manufacturers want to play ball at a time when many of them view the growing concentration of retailer power across northern Europe as the single biggest competitive threat to their future? Nisa Today's has two answers. First, it says, bulk purchasing will provide large, regular orders for suppliers, enabling them to schedule production more efficiently. Second, the organisation argues that it offers manufacturers the opportunity of a more constructive partnership than do the big supermarket chains, with their heavy emphasis on own-label lines which compete directly with branded products. Terry Blackman, trading director of Circle K which operates 230 convenience stores, claims that though his customers' weekly purchase averages only Pounds 45 - against Pounds 75 at Tesco - more of what they buy is manufacturer branded goods. Among the incentives the consortium will offer suppliers is a joint commitment by its members to support their marketing effort by, for example, devoting a specified amount of shelf space to their products. Will the initiative succeed in stemming the tide of decline, which has relegated many small grocery outlets to a precarious existence as a source of occasional 'top-up' purchases or as suppliers to remote rural communities? David Shriver, retailing analyst with County NatWest, calls it a belated step in the right direction, but cautions: 'It will require a lot of co-ordination and communications and a big commitment of management time.' Hyman thinks joint buying could help independent grocers improve margins and check their loss of business to the big multiples. However, he thinks they have left it too late to regain market share. 'Anyone who expects people in Britain to turn the clock back and start buying most of their food in neighbourhood shops again isn't living in the real world,' he says.</p>

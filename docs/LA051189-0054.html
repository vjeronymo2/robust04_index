			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> GERMAN TIED TO LIBYA HELD  </P> <P> The former chairman of a West German firm alleged to have helped Libya make a  suspected chemical weapons plant has been arrested, the Mannheim prosecutor's  office said. A spokesman said Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen of the Imhausen  chemical company was seized in the town of Bochum on suspicion of offenses  against export laws. Imhausen-Chemie and several other West German firms are  under investigation on suspicion of evading export laws to help Libya build a  factory at Rabta. Libya has said the plant will make only medicines, but the  United States and other Western governments believe it was designed to make  poison gas. Hippenstiel-Imhausen resigned in March, saying he hoped this would  help to clear up the affair.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(has)": "An Opposition Deputy Has Become Head </F> of the Parliamentary Commission for the Security and Information  Service"]    [Text] Prague--The reason Tomas Svoboda (Christian  Democratic Party), chairman of the parliamentary commission for  supervising the Security and Information Service (BIS), has  resigned is apparently that he does not have enough time to  execute his post. Svoboda has told LIDOVE NOVINY that "nothing  more serious happened" and that he will carry on as deputy  chairman of the commission. In connection with the anticipated  discussion on the recall of T. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party),  deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, Svoboda  categorically rejected the possibility that he could take up  this post. He described as speculation the CTK report that he  aspires to the post of committee deputy chairman. The new  chairman of the commission is current Deputy Chairman V.  Doubrava (Czech Social Democratic Party) [CSSD]. In reply to a  question on what he thinks of the fact that an opposition deputy  chairs the commission for supervising the secret service,  Svoboda said that "Doubrava is very objective."</p>

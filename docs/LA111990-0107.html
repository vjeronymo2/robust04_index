			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION PROGRAM TURNS LIVES AROUND  </P> <P> Four years ago, while working as a waitress at a local Denny's, 26-year-old  Maureen McKennon had a baby. With the arrival of her son, Cody, she decided to  make a few changes in her life.  </P> <P> "My last year of school had been eighth grade," McKennon explained. "But when I  had a baby, I decided that I should take things more seriously. . . . I'd been  a waitress since 15, and I don't really want to do it forever."  </P> <P> So McKennon approached Coastline Community College. She enrolled in her first  class three years ago and was simultaneously accepted into the Extended  Opportunity Program and Service project. EOPS is a statewide program that  provides counseling, tutoring and career placement for economically and  educationally disadvantaged students.  </P> <P> Since then, McKennon's confidence has grown to the point that this fall she was  selected -- along with 19-year-old Coastline student Brandy Ostrom -- to attend  a statewide student leadership conference.  </P> <P> "I don't think I would have been as successful if I hadn't been in EOPS,"  McKennon said, explaining that her counselor, program coordinator Ruth Dills,  was supportive from the beginning. "I was really afraid to go back to school .  . . but she was my cheerleader all the way."  </P> <P> Dills said that the participation of two Coastline EOPS students in the state  conference next week in San Diego is a real boon for the Coastline program, one  of the smallest in the state. Golden West College serves 400 students through  its EOPS program, while Orange Coast College has more than 600 participants,  she said.  </P> <P> "This is the first year that I've been able to send students to the  conference," Dills said. "And they are participating in the very first class  that (Coastline) has ever had in college leadership skills."  </P> <P> Both McKennon and Ostrom are enrolled in the leadership skills class taught by  Jim Garmon, dean of student services. Among the topics covered in the class are  public speaking, parliamentary process and the responsibilities of leaders.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to work the rest of my life at Taco Bell or something,"  said Ostrom, who, like McKennon, is a single mother without a high school  degree. "As far as the leadership class goes, I think it's wonderful.  </P> <P> "I have a real problem with public speaking, but if I want to be a lawyer, I  better get used to it."  </P> <P> Ostrom plans to attend law school after earning her degree next fall.  </P> <P> According to Dills, the two days of workshops at the state conference should  round out some of the skills that McKennon and Ostrom have learned in the  classroom situation.  </P> <P> McKennon said that some of what she has learned is already applicable to her  life. She has taken an active role in activities at her son's preschool.  </P> <P> "I have been getting skills in the student leadership class, so I don't feel so  stupid anymore," she said. "Now I have to interact with people that have their  master's program or Ph.D.s.  </P> <P> "Before, I never would have gotten involved. I would have been one of those  parents who just throws birthday parties." LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

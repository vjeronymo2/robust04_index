			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: VW-Skoda venture group in CP launch CREDITANSTALT, Austria's biggest bank, is broadening its involvement in Czechoslovakia with the launch of a commercial paper market in Skoda-Volkswagen debt. The discount paper, worth Kcs320m (Dollars 12m), was issued by Skoda Automobila, the joint venture forged between Volkswagen of Germany and Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer, earlier last year. They were issued for a period of six months with an annualised yield of 14.3 per cent. Mr Peter Schupp, risk manager at Volkswagen, said that the issue was a pilot launch and could lead to further local financing. Creditanstalt-SP Securities, a 60 per cent-owned subsidiary of Creditanstalt, placed the securities privately. The largest buyers were domestic institutions and banks, said Mr Nigel Williams, the manager of the Prague-based company. 'Local investors have been happy to buy the paper because they offer greater liquidity and certainty of payment. In a country where a bank transfer can take up to three weeks, surety of payment is worth a lot,' he said. 'This form of borrowing will especially be available for the 20 or so internationally-known names which have invested or are intending to invest in Czechoslovakia,' he added. The company successfully placed a first tranche of Kcs200m-worth of six-month paper for Pilsner Breweries of northern Bohemia last year.</p>

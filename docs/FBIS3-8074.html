			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bosniak-Croat agreement represents a victory  for those Bosniaks who remained faithful to the program paved by  the Party of Democratic Action [SDA]. This was stated today,  among other things, at a news conference by the SDA. On behalf  of the SDA, correspondents were addressed by Edhem Becakcic, a  member of the SDA Main Committee; Dr. Fahet Halilovic, president  of the Sarajevo Municipal Committee; and Muhamed Kupusovic, a  member of the municipal committee. Edin Muhic has more details:    [Begin recording] [Muhic] The main topics of today's SDA  news conference were the Bosniak-Croat agreement and the UN  administration of the wretched Sarajevo. Edhem Becakcic spoke  on the SDA's stance on the international community initiatives  for resolving the Sarajevo issue:    [Becakcic] The SDA accepts administrative assistance to the  legal authorities of Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina in  restoration and reconstruction of [word indistinct] of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina capital. Demilitarization is a victory of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, which was defending and managed to  defend all of Sarajevo's residents and which agreed to the  lifting of the artillery blockade of Sarajevo after it has  successfully endured attacks of enormous artillery [words  indistinct] aggressor.    [Muhic] The Bosniak-Croat agreement is a better solution  than all previous draft agreements on Bosnia-Herzegovina's  internal organization, president of the SDA municipal committee  Fahet Halilovic stated. At the beginning, he emphasized the  positive segments of this agreement:    [Halilovic] These are: coalition, the right to veto,  proportional representation, and the autonomy of cantons. This  is actually a model that [word indistinct] so far the most  perfect solution for these mixed, complex societies.    [Muhic] It is also positive in that the Bosnia-Herzegovina  crisis is trying to be resolved by political means in this way.  One of the negative implications of this agreement is that the  independence of administrative units could be used by some [word  indistinct] forces as the basis for further ethnic cleansing.  Asked by a correspondent whether the agreement makes allowances  for such occurrences, Dr. Halilovic replied that there is a  possibility that in the ethnically cleansed environments the  fascist elements would try to [word indistinct] the actual  situation. This agreement limits the possibilities for such  occurrences; however, the actual situation unfortunately often  deviates from a normative agreement.    Regarding the problem of a UN administration of Sarajevo,  Dr.  Halilovic says:    [Halilovic] What must be emphasized is that the duration of  the UN administration is strictly limited, as we must insist on  this -- namely two years. What the administrator must do is  secure the integrity of the town of nine communes, with the  exception of Pale, which was treated differently even in the  Vance-Owen plan. No solution can be vested in this way if a  plebiscite of the residents is not carried out throughout the  entire territory of Sarajevo, in all communes.    [Muhic] The plan that envisaged a union of republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina from last August has been surpassed, Muhamed  Kupusovic, a member of the municipal committee and president of  the Sarajevo Executive Council, emphasized:    [Kukusovic] I would like to emphasize one point, and that is  that certain factors of this plan have nevertheless remained --  namely, in the coming talks and combinations to resolve the  problem of Sarajevo, Pale has been excluded as the town's  commune.    [Muhic] Edhem Becakcic was asked whether the Bosniak-Croat  agreement represents the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in  two parts. He replied that such a partitioning is out of the  question, and that time will show how the problem of the  territories controlled by Karadzic's Serbs will be resolved.  [end recording]</p>

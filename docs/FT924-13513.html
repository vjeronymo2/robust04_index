			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Diminishing When the first results of the 1991 census came out last year Scots were aghast to find that the population north of the border had slipped below the psychologically important 5m. At 4,957,289 it was the lowest since 1931, and well below the official estimate of 5.1m. Trying to reassure an anxious populace, Charles Glennie, the registrar general (of Scotland), urged people to wait for the final results. Sadly, however, though the final figure released yesterday is 41,000 heads better than the first one, it is still 1,433 short of the magic 5m mark. Glennie has certainly pulled out all the stops to round up the stragglers. Glennie recommends that for most purposes people should use his estimates rather than the census; he still estimates that the mid-1991 population was 5.1m. But will hostile English MPs, let alone the Treasury, both anxious to find excuses for reducing Scotland's share of public expenditure, believe him?</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE LEAVES BENCH IN 'RESCUE' TRIAL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Municipal Court judge banished the jury and stormed off the bench  on Tuesday after an anti-abortion crusader persisted in asking an abortion  clinic official on the witness stand about killing children and whether he  believed in God.  </P> <P> When Randall Terry, leader of Operation Rescue, asked Michael Monji, associate  director of the Family Planning Associates clinic, whether he believed in God,  Judge Richard Paez said the question was irrelevant, told the jury to disregard  it and ordered Terry not to ask such questions.  </P> <P> Terry then asked Monji if he knew of any other business "that engages in the  killing of children" and the judge repeated his instructions.  </P> <P> Finally, after Terry asked Monji if he expected to be "held accountable before  God" for his actions, Paez ordered Terry to sit down, temporarily dismissed the  jury and left the bench.  </P> <P> After a five-minute recess, Paez returned, screened Terry's questions and  disallowed all of them.  </P> <P> Terry is one of five defendants charged with trespassing and resisting arrest  at a March 25 protest outside the clinic.  </P></p>

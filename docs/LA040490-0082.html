			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU'S WAGNER SIGNS WITH ARGONAUTS  </P> <P> Former San Diego State running back Darrin Wagner has signed a two-year  contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, putting an  official end to Wagner's stormy college career.  </P> <P> A source said the two-year deal is for a little more than the league average,  which is $43,000 a year in American money.  </P> <P> Wagner, 19, will report to training camp June 12. If he makes the team, he will  be the youngest player in the CFL.  </P> <P> "I'm reaching on the kid now, but he was real productive when he got the ball,"  said Mike McCarthy, Argonaut vice president/general manager. "He was in  no-man's land in school. There was nothing there for him. Sometimes you see  something in a kid, and you try to help."  </P> <P> After redshirting in 1988, Wagner rushed for 720 yards and scored 11 touchdowns  in seven games at SDSU last season but was suspended on Nov. 5 after missing  several practices without permission. At that time, he led the Aztecs in  rushing and led the nation's freshmen in rushing and all-purpose yards. SCOTT  MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Hitachi Central Manufacturing Laboratories has  developed four product types of the ``H8/3877'', which is in the  8-bit, single chip microcomputer ``H8/300L Series'', and which  has such peripheral functions as a 26 column LCD display  controller/driver and a multi-tone generator built in. Shipping  of each kind of sample will begin in succession from May. In  particular, it will be marketed for wireless devices,  multi-function cordless phones and portable audio.    The new products will be based on the low voltage, low power  consumption characteristics of the H8/300L Series. They will be  the largest 8-bit microcomputers in the industry that have a  built in LCD controller/driver for a 26 column display, and it  will be the first time in the industry that a multi-tone  generator, which conventionally is external, is built into one  chip. By doing this, it becomes possible to have a maximum 208  segment display in 52 segments by four common. Furthermore, by  adding an independent DTMF oscillator, a multi-tone generator  circuit that can form optional wave form patterns in optional  frequencies between 40 Hz-4 kHz is built in, and all of the  kinds of tone generation functions which are used in wireless  devices and phones can be easily configured. Also, the ROM  capacity built in is 60 KB with the ZTAT board, or 60 KB, 48 KB,  or 40 KB with the mask ROM boards. They are offering a large RAM  capacity of 2 KB.    In addition, the processing speed can also be finely program  controlled by providing a high speed active mode at a minimum  command execution time of 0.4 microseconds when operating at 10  MHz, a middle speed mode (1 MHz) as a low power consumption  active mode, and sub-active mode, sub-sleep mode, and standby  mode which rely on an independent sub-clock (32 kHz).    The power source voltage is 2.7 to 5.5 V. The package is a  100 pin QFP (pin pitch 0.5mm). The price of samples of the ZTAT  board will be &yen;2,900. The prices for the mask ROM boards  will be from &yen;970 to &yen;1,120 (when purchasing 50,000  units). Hitachi plans to have a monthly production of 10,000  units in April 1994, and a monthly production of 100,000 units  in October.</p>

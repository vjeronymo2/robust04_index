By agreeing to  this decision, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer  (Alliance 90/Greens) gave in in the dispute with Federal  Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union).    The ministry in Wiesbaden stated that the decree issued 11  days ago after a fire in the reactor can be lifted. According  to the decree, preparations for a renewed operation of the  reactor had to be stopped after the regular revision.    It was also announced that the evaluation of the expert  reports commissioned by Fischer and Toepfer, which came to  different conclusions, did not reveal any findings that would  have required a closure of the plant.</p>

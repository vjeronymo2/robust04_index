This was  the two men's second telephone conversation in two days.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the talk  was held following a consultation held at the prime minister's  office, in which an effort was made to draft answers to the  PLO's queries, which had been presented as a precondition for  renewing the negotiations.    Our correspondent adds that the appropriate conditions for  resuming the negotiations have not been created as yet, but  there is satisfaction in Jerusalem about the renewal of a direct  link with the PLO.

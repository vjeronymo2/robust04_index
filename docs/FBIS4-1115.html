			<p>BFN     [Text] Somali National Alliance [SNA] officials recently  met Ambassador (Atwal Karim), the UN Operation in Somalia  [UNOSOM] political director. The UNOSOM's responsibilities in  Somalia and the UNOSOM forces' violation of the Somali people's  rights were discussed. Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, the United Somali  Congress secretary general made it clear during the meeting that  UNOSOM illegally disarms Somali people. He said [words  indistinct] such acts. SNA proposed to UNOSOM that:    1. Given that UNOSOM's duty is confined to safeguarding  humanitarian aid and maintaining the security of relief  agencies, it should order its forces to refrain from acts that  are beyond its jurisdiction.    2. It should remove the checkpoints in the city and its  outskirts where UNOSOM forces disarm people:    3. It should increase the meetings between the SNA and  UNOSOM so to enable the discussion of security issues.    For his part, Ambassador (Atwal Karim) promised that the  issues discussed by the two sides will be conveyed to UNOSOM  officials. The SNA side was represented by Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali  and Professor Ise Mohamed Siad, the foreign affairs secretary.</p>

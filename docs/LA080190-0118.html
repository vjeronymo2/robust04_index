			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HECKLERS, DUKES GET BEST OF KRONEMANN;  </P> <P> TEAM TENNIS: UC IRVINE GRADUATE LOSES TWO OF HIS THREE SETS, AND NEWPORT BEACH  DEFEATS CHARLOTTE HEAT, 29-17.  </P> <P> Before the Charlotte Heat's Team Tennis match with the Newport Beach Dukes,  Trevor Kronemann was excited about returning to Orange County.  </P> <P> But after the Dukes defeated the Heat, 29-17, and Kronemann, a four-time  All-American at UC Irvine, lost two of his three sets, he was upset with more  than just his performance.  </P> <P> Kronemann had vocal supporters among the 578 people who watched the match at  John Wayne Tennis Club Tuesday night, but he was upset that hecklers hounded  him during his singles match.  </P> <P> "Little kids down here were saying, 'choke, choke, choke,' " Kronemann said. "I  come here and that's the greeting I get? It's unbelievable. It's just not  right.  </P> <P> "(But) it's partly my fault because I let them get to me and that's the first  time that's happened all year."  </P> <P> The victory put the Dukes (7-4) into a tie for last place in the West Division  with the Sacramento Capitals, who lost to the Los Angeles Strings Tuesday. The  San Antonio Racquets, who play the Dukes Thursday in Newport Beach, are a  half-match ahead.  </P> <P> Kronemann, who graduated from UC Irvine this spring, is in his first summer of  professional tennis. He was in Kansas playing in a month-long USTA event when  the Heat asked him to replace injured Mark Dickson before the season began.  </P> <P> He accepted and has become the Heat's top men's player, competing in singles,  mixed and men's doubles.  </P> <P> In mixed doubles, teaming with Ronni Reis, Kronemann showed the power of his  fiery demeanor.  </P> <P> "You don't make Trevor mad, because all of a sudden you start unleasing that  nuclear power plant in him," said Dukes Coach Greg Patton, who coached  Kronemann at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Sophie Amiach didn't anger Kronemann in the mixed doubles set Tuesday but she  bore the brunt of his reaction to a line call.  </P> <P> During the seventh game of the set, which was tied, 3-3, Kronemann disputed a  line call that gave the Dukes a 40-30 lead. Amiach went to the net on the next  point and paid for it. Kronemann hit two big forehands at her. The first she  managed to return to Kronemann; the second knocked the racket from her hand.  </P> <P> Although the Dukes won the next point to take the game, Kronemann and Reis won  the set, 6-5, when Kronemann won the final two points of the tie breaker -- one  with an ace; the other with a service winner.  </P> <P> In men's singles, the Dukes' Roger Smith cooled off Kronemann, 6-3, as  Kronemann lost his final two serves.  </P> <P> In the final set of the match, Marty Davis and Smith defeated Kronemann and  Paul Koscielski, 6-4.  </P> <P> The Dukes' women opened the match with two victories, which gave Newport Beach  a 12-4 lead.  </P> <P> Frazier and Amiach took a 3-0 lead against Reis and Donna Faber, but the Heat  closed the deficit to 4-3 when Frazier lost her serve. The Dukes then broke  Faber's serve and Amiach won her serve and the set, 6-3.  </P> <P> Frazier then extended the Dukes' lead with a 6-1 victory in women's singles.  </P></p>

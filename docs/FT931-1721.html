			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros floats services arm HAMBROS, the merchant bank, yesterday floated its Hambros Insurance Services subsidiary at a price which values the new company at Pounds 86.7m. The issue will raise Pounds 35m, of which some Pounds 13.9m has been earmarked for HIS. Hambro Group, which will retain a 50.1 per cent stake in the new group, will receive between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m. Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman, said the bank's investment in the HIS companies has amounted to under Pounds 10m. Some Pounds 13.5m of the proceeds - Pounds 9m in cash - will be paid to Hambro Countrywide, another insurance subsidiary, in return for its 51 per cent stake in Hambro Legal Protection. HLP offers legal expenses insurance and telephone advice services. Various existing shareholders, including the management of Beale Dobie, a company which specialises in the sales of second hand endowment policies, will receive a further Pounds 6m in return for their shares. Mr Nicholas Page, managing director, said that the group identified 'run-off', the business of handling claims of insurance companies which are no longer actively trading, as one possible new market. In addition Cunningham Hart, which has recently expanded into the Netherlands and already has other overseas operations, hopes to increase its profile elsewhere in Europe and in the US. Further expansion at HLP is also likely. Since 1988 when HLP launched its legal advice service, new telephone help lines have been launched to provide medical advice and help on travel, tax and various other areas. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to March 31 1993 are expected to amount to Pounds 9.4m, with earnings per share of 10.39p and a notional dividend of 5.19p. The dividend would be covered twice. Of the 25.36m new shares, 12.68m will be placed with institutional and other investors and 12.68m shares, conditionally placed by Panmure Gordon, will be offered to intermediaries. The placing price is 138p per share. Applications for the intermediaries offer close at midday on Friday. COMMENT Although investors might be concerned that less than half the new money raised by the issue is to be directed into expansion, HIS's prospects appear attractive. Recent growth, especially of the loss adjustment business, has been impressive and trends in the insurance industry mean that the outlook for the group's range of telephone-based advice services are reasonably good. Overall, at a price of 138p and prospective multiple of 13.3, the share seems reasonable value.</p>

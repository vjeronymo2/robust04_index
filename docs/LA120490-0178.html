			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TEXANS ATTEND BENEFIT TO HELP WILLIE NELSON WITH BACK TAXES  </P> <P> Residents pulled out their wallets -- and their best dance steps -- at a lively  fund-raiser to help country singer Willie Nelson pay some of his back income  taxes.  </P> <P> About 300 people attended the benefit Sunday night at the Broken Spoke  nightclub, where Nelson began his climb to international stardom in the late  1960s and early '70s.  </P> <P> Nelson was not present at the hall.  </P> <P> "He's done a lot of things for a lot of people. I think it's great that people  want to help him," said Will Light, a Nelson fan.  </P> <P> But while the event was expected to raise a tidy sum, with those attending  paying $10 apiece for admission, it will not cut too deeply into Nelson's  enormous tax bill. Internal Revenue Service officials say Nelson owes them  $16.7 million.  </P> <P> The IRS has seized properties Nelson owns in Colorado, Washington, Hawaii,  Tennessee, Alabama and Texas, including his ranch and recording studio outside  Austin, to satisfy two liens against him.  </P></p>

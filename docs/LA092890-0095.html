			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. ADOPTS TOUGH CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS STANDARD FOR AUTOS  </P> <P> Promising New Yorkers cleaner air, state officials Thursday adopted the tough  California motor vehicle emissions standard for cars sold in New York after  1993.  </P> <P> In doing so, New York became the second state in the nation to adopt standards  higher than those imposed by the federal government.  </P> <P> New Jersey and Massachusetts are expected to follow suit.  </P> <P> California is considering even tougher regulations that would require cleaner  fuels.  </P> <P> The New York emission standards are identical to California standards that have  been in effect for several years. Today, California officials are expected to  adopt stricter standards that will require at least 10% of cars sold in  California in the year 2003 to emit no pollutants.  </P> <P> The auto industry opposed the stricter New York standards as too expensive and  not relevant to the Northeast, where they say a colder climate does not produce  the same levels of ozone as in California.  </P> <P> But state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling said the cost  of the new emissions standards should be no more than $100.  </P></p>

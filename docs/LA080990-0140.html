			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> REEL NEWS;  </P> <P> A NEW CINEMA OPENS IN AGOURA HILLS, 'THE TWO JAKES' OPENS IN VENTURA AND A REAL  THEATER REVIEW.  </P> <P> If four Mann theaters aren't quite enough, don't panic. The company will be  opening another complex just south of the county line. An eight-plex cinema in  Agoura Hills is expected to begin operation by the end of the month. It will be  located on Kanan Road.  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson's movie "The Two Jakes" opens Friday, and if any Ventura City  Hall employees go to see it, they'll be seeing it for the first time. Although  the film was partially shot at City Hall, apparently no one working there was  invited to preview it.  </P> <P> This follows the controversial filming itself -- which included Nicholson  initially refusing a key to the city and then-mayor James Monahan having second  thoughts about allowing another film crew to take over City Hall because of the  disruption it caused.  </P> <P> Carol Green, assistant to the city manager, said no filming is planned for the  future, but there have been several inquiries.  </P> <P> Reviews of movies are everywhere. Reviews of movie theaters are not.  </P> <P> But think about it: Is a great film still great when seen over a box of popcorn  drowning in sludge? When you watch an Al Pacino performance from a seat with  springs popping out, are you being moved in the way you'd want to be? These  issues become all the more important when you consider that a movie such as  "Die Hard 2" is playing in three theaters in the same county. Where exactly  would you rather go see it, proximity notwithstanding?  </P> <P> So, here it is, the first in a series of consumer guides to the theaters of  Ventura County. First up by luck of the draw -- the Carriage Square Theatre on  West Gonzales Road in Oxnard. The movie: "Die Hard 2," of course.  </P> <P> Food: All the usual candy, plus hot dogs, ice cream (Haagen-Dazs and Bon Bons),  cookies, soft drinks and popcorn. The hot dog was a tad on the salty side, but  it was big enough to curb a mild hunger. The popcorn was no better than fair.  Warning: We went to the first show on a weekday and asked for buttered popcorn  and a hot dog. The butter wasn't ready before the first show and, though some  could be seen rotating on the grill, neither were the dogs. We grabbed one on  the way out.  </P> <P> Restroom: So clean that during a bad movie we'd be tempted to just hang out in  it. The whole room is painted in bright yellow, a little too bright, maybe, but  it'll sure force the eyes to adjust quickly after the film. Only one little bit  of graffiti. Plenty of soap in the liquid soap dispensers, but that's probably  because it takes a load of patience to get any out.  </P> <P> Pre-movie Muzak: On this day, strictly the '70s, highlighted by "The Hustle"  and "Killing me Softly."  </P> <P> Pre-movie ads: One  </P> <P> Previews: Two  </P> <P> Seats: Quite comfortable and firm. None of that mushy stuff that keeps  chiropractors in business. Best feature -- the wide, plastic arm rests with  built-in cup holders. LEO SMITH  </P></p>

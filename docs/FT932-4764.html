			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Buy-out bid for Midlands airport MANAGEMENT and empl-oyees yesterday submitted a bid to buy East Midlands International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire. There are now four bidders for the airport, whose future ownership has been in doubt since Derbyshire County Council signalled in 1991 it would dispose of its 44 per cent stake. KPMG Peat Marwick, accountants, whose Nottingham office is handling the sale, refused to namethe other bidders. But Regional Airports has publicly disclosed its interest and it is thought that Lockheed, the US group, and National Express, the UK coach company, may have made bids. Once Derbyshire had decided to sell, a series of reports was commissioned by the owners, leading to a decision to place the airport on the market. The deadline for bids was yesterday, and the successful bidder should be known by the end of the month.</p>

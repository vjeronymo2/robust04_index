			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWERS, GROCERS, STATE PLEDGE FOOD SAFETY PLAN  </P> <P> In what was called a first-ever alliance, representatives of California  grocers, growers and government vowed Tuesday to develop a food safety program  to assure shoppers that the produce they buy is safe.  </P> <P> Details of the program remain to be developed by a task force, which will meet  for the first time Friday in Sacramento. But Don C. Beaver, president of the  California Grocers Assn., said the goal is to provide consumers with "an  implied warranty from the growers" that the fresh fruits and vegetables they  bring to market are free of harmful chemical residues.  </P> <P> "We are the purchasers for the consumers, and we want safe produce in our  stores," Beaver said in Los Angeles, repeating a message delivered earlier  Tuesday in Sacramento and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Jack C. Parnell, director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture,  which tests fresh produce for harmful residues, insisted that the state's food  supply is "safe and always has been safe." But, he conceded, "there is a  confidence crisis."  </P> <P> Parnell, who has been nominated to the No. 2 post in the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, said the new program represents the first time "the three Gs --  grocers, growers and government -- have stood up together in attempting to  warrant to consumers in California that we believe our food supply to be safe."  </P> <P> However, one consumer organization that has been waging a campaign against  pesticide use, citing harm to the farm workers who apply the chemicals,  immediately dismissed the program as "empty rhetoric." The California Public  Interest Research Group, or CalPIRG, called it "a major public relations  strategy to regain consumer confidence."  </P> <P> Beaver said the program would include financial support from the 7,000 retail  outlets represented by the California Grocers Assn. Those funds would be used  to increase inspection of produce "at the farm gate," he said.  </P> <P> Supported by the farm groups, including Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., the  program also urges government to require farmers to report use of all chemicals  used on their crops. Growers and grocers also urged that violators of pesticide  regulations be penalized "to the limits of the law."  </P> <P> Barbara Buck, representing Western Growers, said the marketing group's  farmer-packer members in California and Arizona are already reducing their use  of chemicals. She cited statistics compiled by the Western Agricultural  Chemical Assn. showing that use of farm chemicals dropped from 904.2 million  pounds in 1977 to 634.4 million pounds in 1987.  </P> <P> Buck said growers are urged to adopt an "integrated pest-management" approach  to protect their crops from insects, diseases, molds and weeds. Such an  approach reduces use of chemicals in favor of introducing natural predators and  the recently introduced technique of vacuuming bugs from such crops as  strawberries and lettuce.  </P></p>

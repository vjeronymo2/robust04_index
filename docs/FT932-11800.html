			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (15): Tax changes could help - Alternatives / Sports Cars The UK's small but enthusiastic specialist car industry, and larger sports car makers such as Porsche, could be beneficiaries of changes to company car taxation in the UK. This could happen in two ways: Firstly, as a result of the 8 per cent increase this year in the tax scale charges of the current system. This has led some analysts of the company car sector to conclude that many more employees will want to hand back their company cars in exchange for a cash alternative. If they do, the chances are that - freed from the shackles of their companies' lists of 'approved' cars - they will choose a greater variety of cars. Some with no interest in cars and modest private mileage are likely to buy second-hand vehicles and use any cash saved for other purposes. Others, even if only a small minority, are likely to indulge perhaps a long-nurtured desire for a more off-beat car which no company finance director would ever have contemplated purchasing. Secondly, the new system of company car taxation scheduled for introduction next year, and based on a simple percentage of new cars' retail list prices, will make more attractive those sports cars - such as those of Blackpool-based TVR and lower-priced Porsches - which have tended to fall foul of either of the current system's two price thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 above which the personal tax assessed rises sharply. For TVR and other carmakers whose prices do not stray above about Pounds 40,000, the new system is unalloyed benefit. The problem is that the tax liability continues to rise in proportion to list price, with no ceiling set by the Inland Revenue. On that basis, the tax bill on the more expensive Porsches, such as a Pounds 60,000-plus 911 or 928, for someone covering fewer than 2,500 business miles, becomes burdensome, as tax is levied on 35 per cent of the list price. Even if the extra boost to demand is modest, it can have a big impact on UK specialist sports car manufacturers, which typically measure their output in hundreds rather than thousands of cars annually. In the case of Malvern-based Morgan Motor Company, any rise in demand would be reflected in a lengthened waiting list - still several years' long - rather than a rise in output. Morgan, which makes about 450, Thirties-style two seaters a year, is still quietly congratulating itself for having ignored 1989's on-camera advice of Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI chairman and TV 'company doctor', to expand production. Sir John wanted Morgan to make another 300 cars a year, halve the then 10-year waiting list and raise prices. Three years and a collapsed UK car market later, profits are up and the cars seemingly remain as desirable as ever. It is TVR, however, which has had the most dramatic change of fortunes, sending sales and production sharply upwards during a period when UK new car sales overall have slumped by about one quarter. The company will celebrate its 40th birthday - although it has had several owners - next year as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars which have won respect from a much wider audience than long-term TVR afficionados. The change of fortune is all down to the Griffith, named after a 1960s TVR two-seater, which caused a sensation when first unveiled at the Birmingham motor show two years ago and which entered production last year. Compared favourably in styling terms with manufacturers such as Ferrari, it has recently been joined by an equally well-acclaimed model, the Chimaera. Last year, TVR's 200 employees produced a record 824 cars, up from 719 in 1991 and 300-400 annually through much of the 1980s. Mr Peter Wheeler, who bought the company about 11 years ago, thinks annual output of 1,500 might eventually be feasible by a slow expansion of the workforce. But he makes clear that he intends TVR to proceed cautiously as it will not willingly contemplate any risk of later contraction and redundancies. Rivals continue bemused by TVR's relatively cheap prices. The 160mph Griffith at launch was Pounds 26,000 and the new Chimaera also lists at less than Pounds 30,000. 'We're not paying any money for marketing machinery', says Mr Wheeler. 'With others, you're paying for the Le Mans reputation, not the car itself.' In the next few months, TVR is expected to bemuse rivals even more. The Griffith is to be re-launched using the first engine to be designed and manufactured by TVR 'in-house', a V8 unit with a claimed 300-plus horsepower. According to motor industry convention, it has become wildly uneconomic for any carmaker to design, develop and manufacture its own engines unless it can spread the cost of several hundred units a year. Mr Wheeler merely shrugs, points to TVR's expected Pounds 1m profit and suggests that the industry should wait and see. There is new life, too, in one of the industry's proudest names, Aston Martin Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in 1987. It caused a big stir at this year's Geneva motor show when it unveiled an all - new model, the DB7, intended to quadruple production to 800 cars a year in 1995. At an expected UK price of 'less than Pounds 80,000', it will still attract a hefty tax bill as a company car - but a lot less than the Pounds 135,000-Pounds 175,000 Virage and other models on which the existing Aston Martin range is based. The DB7 is to be built not at the headquarters in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, but a factory at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where the last of Jaguar's super-fast, Pounds 415,000 Jaguar (also owned by Ford) XJ220 coupes are being assembled. The main design and development work on the DB7 has been contracted out to TWR (Design), part of the TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw based in Oxford. It develops and manufactures Jaguar's high-performance sports and racing cars. A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the Bloxham facility in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The car's bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based components group. It is Motor Panels, now part of Mayflower Corporation, which holds the key to potentially one of the most significant developments in the UK sports car industry for more than a decade. Mayflower is planning to invest up to Pounds 24.2m in a collaborative venture with Rover to develop and produce a new range of MG sports cars. Neither Rover, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, nor Mayflower will officially confirm the project's existence. However, Mayflower acknowledges that it is in an advanced stage of negotiation for a contract to design, develop and supply the bodyshell for 'a new specialist vehicle for European markets'. Rover, while denying that any final decision has been made on a new MG, admits it has been exploring 'possible relationships which might be relevant'. It is understood that a final decision will be taken shortly on the project, code-named PR3, with bodyshell production likely to start in early 1995 and output of the new MG reaching 15,000 to 20,000 a year. The car is expected to be mid-engined and powered at the top end of the range by Rover's K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version which is presently under development. Meanwhile, interest in the MG marque is being rekindled by the launch this month of the MG RV8, a Pounds 26,000 roadster based on the MGB, which ceased production when the Abingdon MG factory closed in 1980.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>   [Text] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] faction last  night dashed the hopes of its traditional opponent, the  Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], for having an amnesty bill  for political offenses pass the Legislative Assembly. The bill  was defeated in a third debate by a 28-to-11 vote, while 11  abstained.    The bill, which was passed in a second debate on Monday, was  defeated by an overwhelming majority after the PDC faction  requested a recess so its members could agree on what to do in  view of the imminent approval of the bill.    The legislators who abstained include Guillermo Cochez,  Alfredo Ehlers, Alcibiades Alvarado, Jose Hill, Gloria Moreno de  Lopez, Luis Narvaez, Elba Aizpurua, Benito Vega, Julio Velarde,  and Enrique Degracia.    Those who opposed the bill said it was the PRD legislators  themselves who secured its defeat by insisting on including in  Article 1 a clause exempting from culpability all those who  perpetrate offenses "through actions for political purposes."  PDC Representative Raul Ossa said that the PRD criticized the  very nature of the proposed amnesty by attempting to leave "a  loophole" to legalize the ill-gotten fortunes and the homicides  perpetrated by Manuel Antonio Noriega and his followers, who  undoubtedly were engaged in political activities.    Ossa said that, in view of the failure of the PRD trick,  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares as of 1 September will  have to go ahead and declare an amnesty that will benefit  everyone. "They will have to face the consequences of such a  move," he said.    Alonso Fernandez, of Molirena [Nationalist Republican  Liberal  Movement] who, together with fellow party member Arturo  Vallarino, proposed the bill, said this rejection is an assembly  "blunder" and that it represents a new frustration for the  families of political prisoners who had set their hopes on an  amnesty law. In addition, PRD Representative Alberto Aleman  Boyd said that the Legislative Assembly last night went from  "the sublime to the ridiculous" and that it is not interested in  reconciliation but revenge.    PRD President Gerardo Gonzalez said that the rejection has  opened a "Pandora's box," which will bring to light the whole  gamut of offenses committed by the current government which,  "with the support of the U.S. personnel carriers," has  perpetrated all types of injustices against those who deserve to  be pardoned.    Gloria Moreno de Lopez, former PDC leader, said that,  although she had earlier backed an amnesty law that specified  the names of those who would benefit from it, she will never  support a proposal in favor of those who perpetrated all kinds  of abuses and who could be released by invoking the phrase  "acting for political purposes."    Furthermore, PRD's Franklyn Rivera said that it never  crossed  the minds of those who rejected the amnesty bill last night that  in the assembly there are legislators involved in crimes, who  receive salaries from several institutions, have profited from  reverted properties, are involved in attempted rapes, and in the  future will have to account for these crimes.    Alberto Cigarruista, of the Authentic Liberal Party,  dismissed the PRD threats and reaffirmed his position that  everyone guilty of common crimes, including members of the  Guillermo Endara administration, should end up behind bars.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Croatian Government delegation led by Croatian  Prime Minister Nikica Valentic visited Slovenia today. It  discussed acute mutual problems with our government  representatives. After the talks both prime ministers ---  Valentic and Drnovsek -- held a news conference in the presence  of foreign ministers Granic and Peterle. Tomaz Gerden reports:    [Begin recording] [Gerden] The first talks following a long  freeze in relations have not, as it was also expected, brought  any significant changes and progress. Despite this, today's  meeting was according to Mr. Valentic nevertheless important.  The Croatian Government will strive for the best possible,  friendly relations. The trade is particularly important as the  economies of both countries complement each other and poor  relations harm Slovenia as well as Croatia. Prime Minister  Valentic also mentioned the problem of the Krsko nuclear power  plant. Croatia does not disavow the debt, he said. It hopes to  pay one-third of it in the coming days and the rest gradually,  and through compensations in kind if this proves suitable to  both sides, until 1 August, when property relations are also  supposed to be resolved.    Croatia considers the Ljubljanska Banka's debt to several  hundreds of thousands of Croatian savers particularly pressing.  Our neighbors will respect Slovene property in Croatia.  Regarding holiday resorts, especially issues concerning land,  they will negotiate in commissions. Dr. Drnovsek assessed  today's talks as follows:    [Drnovsek] The talks were very intense and very concrete.  We discussed all open issues between the two countries and  singled out the most important ones. We started with the issue  of the Krsko nuclear power plant; we discussed economic  relations between the countries and efforts to sign an economic  agreement that will also regulate the methods of payment in the  shortest possible time. Both sides are interested in switching  over to free trade in the next phase as quickly as possible, in  much the same way that Slovenia has already agreed with some  other countries.    [Gerden] They did not discuss drawing of borders separately.  Minister Peterle particularly stressed that joint ownership over  Piran Bay is not acceptable for Slovenia. A mixed commission  will discuss borders on 15 February. On 7 February the  governments are expected to meet again. The last date for the  regulation of trade and legal-property issues is 1 August. The  ministries of both sides will prepare their proposals in a month.    Today's meeting of both prime ministers, therefore,  reanimated the stalled talks between the two countries.

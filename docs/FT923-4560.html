			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Missiles contract awarded THE US Defence Department yesterday awarded a Dollars 689m (Pounds 346m) contract to a team of aerospace companies, headed by Lockheed Corporation, to develop an anti-missile system to replace the Patriot, Reuter reports from Washington. The rockets in the new system - Theatre High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) - would be smaller and faster than those of the Patriot and are intended to counter ballistic missiles with ranges from about 50 to 1,800 miles. During the Gulf war, the Patriot felled Iraqi Scud missiles in Saudia Arabia and Israel, but it was noted that the Scuds were relatively unsophisticated and one of them evaded the Patriot, killing 28 US personnel in a barracks in Saudi Arabia. The THAAD would be a component of the Strategic Defence Initiative against ballistic missiles that the US still wants to develop. The 48-month contract will fund design, fabrication and tests of a demonstration weapon system, 20 missiles for tests and components of a prototype system including command and control units and mobile missile-launchers. Other companies to work on the contract include divisions of Honeywell, Rockwell International, Westinghouse Electric, and United Technologies.</p>

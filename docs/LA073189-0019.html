			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN, 4 OTHERS TO HEAD SOVIET OPPOSITION BLOC  </P> <P> Soviet lawmakers intent on accelerating the pace of reform elected Kremlin  maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov and three  other prominent activists Sunday to collectively head the first formal  opposition group within this country's national political system in nearly 70  years.  </P> <P> Voting at the conclusion of their two-day founding conference, members of the  self-styled Inter-Regional Deputies' Group also chose a 25-member coordinating  committee and agreed in principle on a far-reaching platform that would give  workers the right to buy their factories, end the state's monopoly on  television broadcasting and provide direct election of the country's president  by popular ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Coming of Age  </P> <P> "What we have seen here is a demonstration of how the democratic consciousness  of our people has come of age," former Moscow Communist Party chief Yeltsin  told a news conference Sunday night.  </P> <P> Formation of the rebel parliamentary group is "a very serious change in the  political-social life of our country," added Yeltsin, who was ousted from both  the Moscow job and the ruling Politburo almost two years ago after criticizing  what he called the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika  reform program.  </P> <P> The rebel lawmakers stressed repeatedly that they intend to work within the  Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament,  as a loyal but critical counterbalance to the ruling Communist Party.  </P> <P> The group's members insisted that they are not forming an opposition political  group in the Western sense, but a draft copy of their program circulated at the  weekend convention calls for repeal of Article 6 of the Soviet constitution,  which establishes the "leading role" of the Communist Party in all phases of  national life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ultimate Power  </P> <P> According to the draft, which won preliminary approval Sunday, the group sees  the Congress of People's Deputies as the ultimate source of state power.  </P> <P> By simply convening their meeting, members of the new group broke a tradition  of nearly seven decades of organizational unity behind the policies of the top  party leadership. Political "factionalism," as virtually any group criticism of  official policy is termed, has not been tolerated within the Soviet Communist  Party since its 10th Congress in March, 1921, and the last rival party here,  the Socialist Revolutionaries, was suppressed in 1922.  </P> <P> More than 300 of the Congress of People's Deputies' 2,250 members were on hand  for the weekend conference, and supporters said as many as 250 others who back  their efforts were unable to attend.  </P> <P> Even with more than 500 supporters in the Congress, the faction would fall well  short of a majority needed to push through its ideas. However, the group could  prove to be a magnet to attract swing deputies toward more aggressive change.  </P> <P> In addition to Yeltsin and Sakharov, the new group selected as co-chairmen  reformist historian Yuri N. Afanasyev, prominent economist Gavriil Popov and  Estonian academician Viktor Palm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Collective Responsibility  </P> <P> While the five theoretically share collective responsibility as co-chairmen,  radical populist Yeltsin attracted the most votes among the 13 candidates for  the senior leadership, and he has been the group's primary spokesman.  Afanasyev, who is director of the Moscow Historical Archive Institute and a  leading force behind efforts to fill in the so-called "blank spots" of the  Soviet Union's Stalinist past, finished second in Sunday's balloting.  </P> <P> All the co-chairmen except Sakharov appeared later at a news conference, during  which they indicated that their top priority will be to reform the election law  and bring forward elections for local and regional officials now scheduled for  early next year.  </P> <P> They called for an extraordinary session of the Congress of People's Deputies  in September to consider constitutional amendments related to elections. The  next regular session of the Congress is not due until the end of the year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Half-Hearted Reforms  </P> <P> The rebel deputies hold that Gorbachev's reforms have so far been half-hearted  and have therefore failed to lead the nation out of what they see as a  deepening political and economic crisis. Widespread strikes by the country's  coal miners in mid-July proved the growing level of social tension, they  argued.  </P> <P> Other reforms advocated in the Inter-Regional Deputies' Group's draft platform  would mandate:  </P> <P>  -- Public referendums on any proposed laws affecting the rights and freedoms  of citizens and on any proposed constitutional amendment.  </P> <P>  -- An annual government report on its activities followed by a parliamentary  vote of confidence.  </P> <P>  -- A two-term maximum for the chairman of people's councils at all levels of  government, including the Supreme Soviet now headed by Gorbachev.  </P> <P>  -- Preliminary work to end the system of internal Soviet passports and allow  free entry and exit to the country's citizens.  </P> <P>  -- And legalization of independent trade unions.  </P></p>

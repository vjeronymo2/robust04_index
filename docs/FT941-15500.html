			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Attractive business with large potential - Magnet's new direction after its acquisition by Berisford Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford International, believes that in Magnet he has found a business with substantial potential. He will take up as many of the rights on his 1.5 per cent shareholding as he can by selling some shares. He has convinced holders of another 24 per cent to take up their rights. Analysts were suggesting yesterday that Berisford's shares could be about 150p when trading resumes, compared to yesterday's 128p suspension price, if the deal is approved by shareholders. Mr Bowkett believes the joinery products maker and distributor retains a strong brand name in spite of the problems it has suffered since its ill-fated management buy-out of 1989. The business was well known among small builders when it traded as Magnet &amp; Southerns. However, in the 1980s Magnet changed direction and tried to appeal direct to retail customers by opening high street shops. When Mr John Foulkes joined Magnet a month after the mbo in July 1989, he initially approved the strategy. But he quickly realised that the new shops had simply added costs without a commensurate increase in sales. As recession bit and people stopped moving house sales fell, leaving Magnet's factories under-used. Sales were Pounds 376m in the year to March 1988 but are now running at a little less than half that level. About half the fall, Mr Bowkett says, was a result of the falling market, a quarter was lost market share, and the rest low margin business which Magnet got out of. Mr Foulkes attacked excess capacity by closing shops and factories, until today Magnet has 230 outlets, and four factories. The factories are currently working at only 60 per cent of capacity, supplying 75 per cent of Magnet's stock. He concedes that despite his efforts, which have returned the business to break-even, there is still more for Berisford to do. Mr Bowkett says after six months of negotiations with Magnet's former owners, his team has had a good look at the business and already formulated a long list of actions to be taken. First there is to be more cost-cutting, for instance by eliminating unnecessary product ranges and integrating distribution. However, in the medium to longer term there should be growth as well with the housemoving market considered by some to be on the turn. Mr Bowkett expects to increase market share as well. He wants to rebuild Magnet's reputation among jobbing builders, and to attack the new housebuilding and public sector repair and maintenance market that Magnet had avoided. Further, he has identified 50 places where new outlets could be opened, and reckons they could be turning over Pounds 500,000 each within two or three years and earn a return on the Pounds 150,000 each will cost to open. If Berisford fails to revitalise Magnet, it will not be for a lack of ideas or enthusiasm.</p>

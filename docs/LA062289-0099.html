			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> BREAKFASTS FOR HOMELESS  </P> <P> Free breakfasts will be provided at the temporary homeless shelter in West  Hollywood Park Auditorium for six months beginning July 1.  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote, the City Council approved $5,000 for the breakfast program,  which will provide the homeless with fresh fruit and protein snack bars.  </P> <P> Council members Abbe Land and John Heilman voted against the proposal, asking  the council to delay a decision until after discussions on the 1989-90 budget  begin this week.  </P> <P> During budget talks, city officials are expected to discuss the possibility of  discontinuing the temporary facility and putting funds into the development of  a permanent shelter, Land said.  </P> <P> "My concern was that we would approve this, and two weeks later we would  eliminate the whole program," Land said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For example, among the risks identified in section 7(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are those attributable to ``different categories and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1)(C)(i)(II). One area of risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken into account in the existing assessment base is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving deposit liabilities. Potentially, the assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base could be modified to take into account other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``categories'' of liabilities, such as non-deposit, secured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities. This example is discussed more fully in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph C of section IV, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Assessment Avoidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Whatever assessment base is applied, the FDIC believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in order to avoid imposing any additional regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on insured institutions, it is desirable to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to collect assessment data from institutions in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly Reports of Condition. If the assessment-base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition is changed, the information collected for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment purposes by the Reports of Condition might also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present, the data collected in these reports reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts ``as of'' the report date. This has caused some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions purposefully to reduce their assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses by temporarily reducing the amount of the deposits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held on the report date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been suggested that defining the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in terms of a daily average over the quarter (that is, total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars for the quarter divided by the number of days in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter), rather than actual ``as of'' report-date data, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate this assessment-avoidance problem. An averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would also help to smooth out the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unusual occurrences such as misdirected wire transfers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the receipt, on or just before the report date, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abnormally large deposits to be held only briefly by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> C. Failure-Resolution Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In past years, governmental policies for resolving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed or failing depository institutions frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided protection for liabilities not specifically covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by federal deposit insurance. First, through the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all-deposit purchase-and-assumption (P&amp;A) transactions, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depositors_insured and uninsured alike_often received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full protection for their deposit balances. Unlike a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit payoff or an insured-deposit transfer, in which only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insured deposits were covered (and which were used only when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there was no acceptable bid for an all-deposit P&amp;A), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all-deposit P&amp;A allowed for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  100-percent insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. The protection of all depositors in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution of several large bank failures contributed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perception that some banks were ``too big to fail'' and thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  100-percent insurance protection for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all deposits, both domestic and foreign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the use of all-deposit P&amp;As and application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the so-called ``too big to fail'' doctrine often resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection for liabilities beyond the statutory limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit insurance coverage, in all such cases it did so in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfaction of a cost test or for clear policy objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as maintaining the stability of, and public confidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in, the banking system. Specifically, the FDI Act required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, subject to an ``essentiality'' exception, the resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution be no more costly to the FDIC than its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquidation. Hence, the FDIC could normally effect an all-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit P&amp;A only if the purchase premium paid by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquirer for the transaction offset the additional cost to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FDIC of protecting uninsured liabilities, in comparison  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the cost of a liquidation. In the handful of ``too big  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fail'' cases where this cost test was not met, the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acted under a statutory exception to the cost test based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``essentiality'' of the failing institution to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace. That exception was used only in a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minority of the total number of resolutions the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

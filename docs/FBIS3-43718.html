This  follows the postponement of a date for legislation to be  introduced by the Transitional Executive Council on establishing  the Independent Broadcasting Authority, to allow for the  submission of more nominations to the body. Mr. Schutte said  earlier that the broadcasting authority would have to decide on  a license for Radio Pretoria. Eleanor Momberg reports:    The chairman of Radio Pretoria's management committee,  Reverend Mossie van den Bergh, says that an urgent application  was lodged against the minister of home affairs and the  postmaster general in the Pretoria Supreme Court, in which they  requested that the radio station be allowed to continue its  broadcasts. Late yesterday an opposing application was lodged  in court by the minister and the Postmaster General to prevent  Radio Pretoria from continuing its broadcasts. The minister of  home affairs, Mr. Danie Schutte, said yesterday that the radio  station is contravening the Broadcast Act of 1964 by continuing  its broadcasts. Reverend van den Bergh says that an agreement  was reached with government legal representatives, that no  action would be taken against the station until the court case  had been completed. He said he regards the legal procedure as  an application for a temporary broadcast license and added that  the station would continue broadcasting.</p>

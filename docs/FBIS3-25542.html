That is to say, today and Wednesday they will demonstrate  peacefully while Thursday will be the day of the burial. The  demonstrations will end each day at 1700.    PSD officials in Butare promised the security council of the  prefecture that they would safeguard the security of people and  goods. However, this was not the case this morning, when some  people had their vehicles taken away by the demonstrators, who  used them to block the roads. In Butare town, shops and markets  are closed. Some services are not functioning normally.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Christian group announced plans for scores of anti-abortion protests in the  United States and Canada this weekend, and said its targets for the first time  would include Planned Parenthood offices. The Christian Action Council -- whose  founders in 1975 included C. Everett Koop, who later served as surgeon general  -- said unlike recent protests by Operation Rescue that have led to hundreds of  arrests, its fifth annual Pastors' Protest Against Abortion would not include  civil disobedience. "These are lawful and peaceful protests," said Thomas  Glessner, executive director of the Protestant group based in Fairfax, Va. "We  support the goals of Operation Rescue to end abortion in America. We differ on  strategy."  </P></p>

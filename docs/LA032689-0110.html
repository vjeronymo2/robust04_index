			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> BEEF UP TO TANGO: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE AT NORAH'S PLACE, INCLUDING NEW HEALTH  FOOD  </P> <P> The yellow sign, its flashing lights and the words "EAT IN . . . OUT" do not  really prepare you for Norah's Place.  </P> <P> It's an Argentine restaurant. It's an Italian restaurant. It's a Bolivian  restaurant. It's a dress-up, live-music nightclub, with a cover charge after 9  p.m. On Monday and Thursday nights, it's a dance studio -- specializing in the  tango.  </P> <P> Finally, Norah's Place is probably the quinoa capital of Southern California.  Quinoa (KEEN-wah), in case you haven't heard, is the latest magic grain on the  health food circuit, promising to be everything amaranth wasn't. (You missed  the amaranth era? Sorry.)  </P> <P> Quinoa is the seed of a variety of the common weed, goosefoot, which was one of  the mainstays of the ancient Inca diet. So many nutrients are apparently packed  into each little seed that they could, well, practically explode.  </P> <P> However, Norah's Place is nothing like a health food restaurant. The Argentine  component alone means that the menu is heavily laden with meat -- particularly  beef. A dish like parillada might give a quinoa enthusiast the karmic jitters  for a week: big grilled pieces of either beef or chicken plus a semi-aged pork  sausage, a great big blood sausage, some grilled sweetbreads and a braided  length of milk tripe. And all quite good, though the pleasantly chewy texture  of the grilled tripe may not be enough to persuade people who don't like tripe.  </P> <P> There are two very good table sauces for meat: llaqua, a hot yellow chili  sauce, and chimichurri, a thick paste of ground thyme and vinegar, flavored  with garlic and red pepper. The third sauce that appears on the table, though,  is not for meat. It's a mixture of tomato, onion and hearts of palm for putting  on your salad after the oil and vinegar.  </P> <P> As a self-respecting Argentine restaurant, Norah's naturally serves a number of  Italian dishes. There's a list of pastas, nothing very exotic to look at it but  in the Argentine-Italian tradition positively loaded with garlic. A huge plate  of rigatoni con broccoli in cream sauce will protect the average person from  vampires for at least two days.  </P> <P> The Italian influence goes further than that, though. Even the breaded steaks  known as milanesas, found in most Latin restaurants, have a particularly  Italian coloring here. The one called napolitana is a paper-thin sheet of  breaded ham, topped with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella.  </P> <P> As at most Argentine-Italian restaurants in Los Angeles, the Argentine dish  matambre, a mixture of vegetables rolled up in a steak and roasted, is quite  Italianized. It's made with veal breast instead of flank steak, and in fact  it's virtually the Genoese dish cima. That it's served as an appetizer shows  how much it has been altered; the real Argentine matambre is a far from  delicate dish, as its name, "hunger-killer," indicates.  </P> <P> The Bolivian dishes occupy a short section of the menu, but include the best of  Norah's appetizers: a little flat pie (empanada) with a spicy filling like  Mexican chorizo, and an egg-shaped pie called saltena, filled with stewed beef  and onions. Some of the Bolivian entrees might be hard to distinguish from the  Argentine grilled meats, and others, such as lomo saltado, could pass for the  Creole cooking of just about any Latin American country. It's beef sauteed with  onions and tomatoes (well, some cheese is melted on top of it).  </P> <P> The steak called lapping is another matter. On one level it's just a steak,  although a marinated one. But to encourage the marinade, and possibly to speed  up cooking as well, the meat is deeply scored in a crisscross pattern. It comes  to the table looking like hedgehog, or perhaps a sort of lumpy waffle-iron made  of meat. It's very good, and of course part of the cutting has already been  done for you.  </P> <P> And now it's quinoa time. I can't tell whether the primary motivation for  featuring quinoa on this menu is nutrition-consciousness or pride in heritage  (the wine list is certainly heritage-proud, listing dozens of Argentine wines).  In any case, a serious attempt is being made to star quinoa in some dishes.  </P> <P> This is an uphill battle because grains can rarely sustain a starring role, and  the rich filling and the molasses sauce are barely enough to make the quinoa  cake a decent dessert, interesting though its texture is. For dessert I'd  prefer the panqueques, simple crepes with a caramel filling, unless I was  really in the mood for megavitamins and mega-proteins.  </P> <P>  Recommended dishes: empanada, $1.50; sopa de quinoa, $2; napolitana, $8.95;  lapping, $8.50; panqueques, $2.  </P> <P>  Norah's Place, 5667 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, (818) 980-6900. Open 5  to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and  11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday. Full bar. Parking lot. American Express, Carte  Blanche and Diners Club accepted.

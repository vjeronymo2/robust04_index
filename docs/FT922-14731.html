			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Women's night - Video THE ENTIRE video industry must have been reading this monthly column. In February I pointed out how male-dominated the new releases were. What should March bring but an Amazonian army of screen heroines? Here they are flexing their acting muscles in such films as Meeting Venus (Warners) and Alice (RCA/Columbia), Blue Steel and The Whales Of August (both 1st Independent), Broken Blossoms (Thames Silents) and Stepping Out (CIC). The cinema is often accused of failing to provide women with good roles and then paying them pittances when they do. Guilty as charged in the second instance. Less and less so in the first. When do men ever get roles as succulently emotional as Anjelica Huston's in The Dead (1st Independent) and Glenn Close's in Meeting Venus? Huston keens and croons through her father John's adaptation of James Joyce's tale of family life and frail mortality. And as an impassioned, capricious opera singer Miss Close coolly vaults or bestrides every fault-line in Istvan Szabo's comedy-parable about disunited cultures in a 'united' Europe. Just as sopranos sing the true tearaway stuff in opera, and ballerinas soar in dance while men act as hydraulic cranes, so women get the free-flying emotional franchise in movies. Newly issued is perhaps the greatest screen performance by an actress, that of Lillian Gish in DW Griffith's 1918 Broken Blossoms (Thames Silents). We are in London's East End and frightful things are happening in pubs, opium dens and the like. Miss G plays a neo-Dickensian waif with the largest eyes you ever saw: they show more human drama than the whole of the rest of the screen. Miss G, still alive today at ninetysomething, floats majestically through a reissued The Whales Of August. Bette Davis, who owns the second largest pair of eyes in showbiz, partners her in a film demonstrating what women can do and men cannot. They can create a comprehensive human comedy from seeming to do absolutely nothing (something which society has condemned them to do for centuries). The drama is all in tiny gestures of lips or eyes, in words that cunningly, ambivalently conceal or reveal. Of course when women are allowed to do something, they do it with the un-dammed energy of frustrated aeons. Liza Minnelli is preposterous and irresistible in Stepping Out, as a dancing teacher shepherding a group of amateur hoofers through rehearsals for a charity concert. Miss M behaves like a sack of fireworks that has been left near a fire. Whenever you think she is dormant, another sparkler or Roman candle goes up. She struts, smiles, flounces, sings, dances, giggles and blazes her pixie eyes. If a man did all this in an acting performance he would be escorted from the studio by men in white coats. In the feminist late 20th century, women are also allowed to play hardened professionals. Jamie Lee Curtis in Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Blue Steel is a cop who never lets a visible emotion pass across her face, even when reading the Miranda act to her own handcuffed wife-beater of a father. And in Dying Young (CBS/Fox) Julia Roberts is permitted several scenes of no-nonsense nurse-like behaviour before turning on the faucets in this girl-meets-Aids-patient weepie. At its worst, the new interest in women's social and emotional identity can produce embarrassing agitprop from male directors trying to swim with the tide. Woody Allen's Alice (RCA/Columbia) is the fey, confected tale of a yuppie's wife (Mia Farrow) who 'finds herself.' This means she falls in love with a block of Italian-American machismo (Joe Mantegna) and drifts around New York pretending she has become a writer, a woman and a whole person. You would never believe from this film that Allen had cracked a joke in his life. But a few artistic aberrations are a small price to pay for the cinematic enfranchisement - it is slowly happening - of an entire sex.</p>

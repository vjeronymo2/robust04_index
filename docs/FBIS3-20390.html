			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham] </F>   [Excerpt] The United States is in a hurry for a solution to  the issue of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]  and agreed to separate the name issue from the initial phase of  dialogue. Therefore, during his meeting with EU Commissioner  Hans van den Broek yesterday, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  found it easier to reject the European Union's [EU] unilateral  mediation effort.    Reliable information and the recent talks between Deputy  Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou and his U.S. counterpart in  the United States indicate that the U.S. Government is in a  hurry to resolve the issue of FYROM, claiming that [FYROM  President Kiro] Gligorov's state may collapse.  <H5>  Name Separation </H5>   According to the same information, the Americans made it  clear to the Greek side that they want very much to see the  issue of FYROM resolved as soon as possible so that they can  jointly (Greece and the United States) "discuss regional  cooperation in the Balkans."    The United States also seemed to have accepted the Greek  position to separate FYROM's name from the initial phase of the  dialogue, because maintaining stability in the region is more  important.    The same sources said that Washington did not put pressure  on  Athens to lift the Greek measures, but expressed the "wish" that  "something would be done" in this direction.    Diplomatic sources mentioned that Ambassador Matthew Nimetz,  President Clinton's special envoy to Skopje, (who will meet the  prime minister and the foreign minister today and will later go  to FYROM), will undertake a very important mediation role and  will have an "open line" to UN mediator Cyrus Vance.    According to the same information, Vance--as he had  said--intends to deal with the "substance of the issue," that  is, bring the two sides back to the negotiating table. Nimetz  will undertake the "details" (conditions, requirements, etc.).    On the eve of the United States' active involvement in the  issue of FYROM, the government essentially "stopped" the EU  unilateral mediation effort. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Daimler plunges to loss of Pounds 380m DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, plunged to a net loss of DM949m (Pounds 380m) in the first half of 1993, a swing of nearly DM2bn from a net profit of DM965m in the same period last year. The automotive, aerospace and electronics group warned that its financial performance had deteriorated still further in the third quarter this year. The scale of the underlying losses were disclosed for the first time, as Daimler-Benz was forced to present its financial results according to US accounting conventions ahead of its imminent listing on the New York Stock Exchange on October 5. It will become the first German corporation to be listed on the NYSE, the world's largest equity market. The US-style figures reveal a much clearer picture of the underlying losses of what has traditionally been Germany's most successful industrial company. The results expose the full consequences of the German recession on the group, which said it had also suffered an 'enormous fall in revenue' as a result of the appreciation of the D-Mark over the last year. The full impact of this is disguised under German accounting, which allows the release of provisions from so-called hidden reserves to camouflage the operating losses. Under German rules the group made a profit of DM168m for the first six months, down from a profit of DM1.02bn in the same period of last year. Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz's largest shareholder, said it would probably reduce its 28 per cent stake in the company to 25 per cent early next year by offering some of its shares to US investors. The disposal would raise just under DM1bn for the bank, leaving it with a holding worth some DM8bn. Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chief executive, said the group was planning further steps to reduce its cost-base, by accelerating and extending job cuts and by establishing more manufacturing outside Germany. Faced by plunging car and commercial vehicle sales across Europe, including a 34 per cent fall in its commercial vehicle sales in Germany alone in the first half of the year, Daimler-Benz is now planning to cut a total of 43,900 jobs worldwide in 1993 and 1994. Of this, 35,000 jobs are to be eliminated in Germany and would include some compulsory redundancies, warned Mr Reuter. Group turnover fell to DM41.64bn from DM48.09bn in the same period a year ago. Daimler-Benz said it was still on course to achieve turnover approaching DM100bn for the full year, however, after DM98.5bn last year. Financial analysts forecast yesterday that the group would lose DM2bn on a US basis for the whole of 1993. Despite this gloomy prognosis, the group's share price rose strongly yesterday to close up DM19 at DM721. VW's Skoda strategy; Deutsche Bank's role, Page 10 Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> FAMILY OF SLAIN MAN WINS $150,000 COUNTY SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors has approved a $150,000 settlement for the  family of a 57-year-old South Gate man who died in 1984 after his skull was  shattered by blows struck by a sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> The supervisors approved the settlement without comment for the family of  William Sisoyev. The county counsel's office had recommended that the  supervisors approve the settlement rather than go to trial.  </P> <P> Sisoyev died of blows to the head suffered in an altercation with Deputy Thomas  Kirk, who had visited Sisoyev's home concerning an outstanding speeding  citation. Sisoyev was hit with a sap, a metal night stick covered with leather.  </P> <P> Sisoyev's children, Katherine and George Sisoyev, asked the district attorney's  office to prosecute the officer on a number of claims, including one that  Sisoyev's civil rights had been violated. After a six-month investigation, the  district attorney's office declined to file charges, citing insufficient  evidence.  </P> <P> The South Gate City Council also asked the Justice Department to investigate  the death.  </P> <P> Katherine Sisoyev said in an interview that the family found little comfort in  the settlement. "We said we would settle, but we wanted them to admit they did  wrong," she said.  </P></p>

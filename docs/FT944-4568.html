			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Olympic rescue goes to vote The Greek parliament was expected late last night to approve a plan to restructure Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. The legislation paves the way for a cut of 1,900 jobs, a management overhaul in the next six months and measures to improve productivity. The three-year plan, agreed earlier this year with the European Commission, is designed to return the airline to profit by 1997. The Greek government will provide a final injection of Dr54bn (Pounds 142m) into Olympic and write off accumulated debts of Dr491bn. Among Olympic's unions only the cabin crews have refused to accept the plan, which is due to take effect on January 10. They object to a two-year freeze on the pay of all employees and increased working hours. However, a strike threat was brushed aside by a senior Olympic official. 'We expect the flight attendants to fall into line in the next few days,' he said. 'They have few grounds for argument because their productivity is the lowest in the company.' Cabin crews fly an average of only 30 hours monthly. The restructuring plan aims to turn last year's Dr135bn losses into a Dr14bn profit next year. Up to Dollars 378m in government-guaranteed financing is to be provided for buying new aircraft, the funds to come from a ticket surcharge originally intended to help finance a new Athens airport. Under the new legislation, Olympic is to be operated as a private company, a change that should add flexibility in setting ticket prices and changing management practices. The airline has already appointed two international consultants to oversee changes in organisation and management, due to take effect next spring. However, Olympic will find it difficult to claw back market share lost to charter operators that carry two-thirds of the 10m tourists who visit Greece each summer, and to small Greek private airlines flying on the main domestic routes. Olympic's share of air traffic to and from Greece has dropped to 12 per cent, while its passenger load factor has fallen from 68 to 60 per cent of seats in the past five years. The state carrier is obliged to fly to remote Greek islands year-round to keep communications open, although these routes make heavy losses in winter.</p>

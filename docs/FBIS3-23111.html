This was revealed during the interrogation of the three  drivers of Ijoo Sheikh alias Irralu Abdul Hamid Sheikh, on  Friday.    Ijoo had supervised the landing of 100 consignments at Fansa  village near Umbergaon in Bulsar district last year.    With this the total number of consignments of explosives,  arms and ammunition that had landed on the south Gujarat  seacoast has risen to 400. As many as 120 consignments had  landed at Porbandar seacoast. Four more persons, who had carried  out the loading and unloading of the consignments at the  instance of Ijoo were nabbed from Kanaria village in Bulsar  taluka on Friday evening. Bhikha Bhimji, one of the three  drivers of Ijoo, is reported to have confessed to the police  during the interrogation that besides the landing of 100  consignments near Fansa village at Umbergaon, between January 17  to 21, as many as 300 consignments of different sizes had landed  between February 1 to 7 at Jaibordi and Kanaria villages in  Umbergaon. Later all 300 consignments were sent to Bombay by the  two landing agents of Dawood Ibrahim and distributed.    The evidence given by Bhikha Bhimji, in connection with the  landings of more consignments was further corroborated by Bhima  Vansa and Manilal Patel. The three drivers also revealed that  Dawood Ibrahim was constantly in touch with Ijoo in connection  with the transportation of the consignments.    This revelation has provided a clue to the police to believe  that the highest number of consignments containing explosives  and arms had landed on the south Gujarat seacoast. The police  also suspects that some of these consignments might contain  silver, gold and even contraband goods.    Further interrogation of the culprits revealed that Ijoo had  accompanied Bhikha, Bhima and Manilal, right up to Bombay city.  However, the identity of the places where these consignments  were unloaded in Bombay were not disclosed to the three drivers  by Ijoo. A team of experts from Bombay city, who had examined  the gunny bags, seized by the police from Tatawadi area in Fansa  village, in the laboratory confirmed that the RDX was packed in  these gunny bags. Examination of the elements of explosives  present in the gunny bags also indicated that the RDX must have  been in cake form at the time of unloading of the consignments.    In a related development the Bulsar customs department has  found that Ijoo, who is wanted by the police in the RDX  smuggling, has smuggled silver worth Rs117 crores into Gujarat  since 1987. Acting on a tip-off customs officials arrested four  of Ijoo's drivers on Thursday. They were taken to a place that  has been kept a closely-guarded secret for interrogation. It  was during the course of the interrogation that the accused's  involvement in smuggling of silver came to light.    The assistant customs collector, Mr Ajay Dikshi said an  offence had been registered on Thursday against Ijoo under the  provisions of the Customs Act as well as Foreign Exchange  Regulation Act (FERA). Mr Dikshit said that Ijoo had so far  carried out 62 landings of silver and used more than 15 trucks  for the purpose.    The Bulsar police will seek the help of its counterpart in  Bombay in finding out the links of the culprits with the other  accused involved in the smuggling activities.    Meanwhile, it is learned that Ijoo was let off by the police  last May. Ijoo, who was not traceable for some time after the  dastardly Bombay blasts was kept in a police station,  questioned, but was allowed to leave after 24 hours on May 15,  1993.    According to the assistant collector of customs at Bulsar,  Mr  Ajay Dixit, Ijoo had given an undertaking to make himself  available for inquiries but has been at large.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Use of foetus to treat infertility 'abhorrent' Sir, I read with disgust your leader, 'Using the foetus to treat infertility' (January 14). The idea of using aborted babies to fulfil the desires of childless couples is abhorrent. Is it not bad enough consciously to discard a baby without extracting a la carte organs to boot? Then there is the point of the child eventually needing to know who its parents were. There, no doubt, would be incredible problems trying to explain how its parent was killed and the child was a product of ovaries removed before disposal of the foetus. The psychological impact would be devastating. Surely the option of adoption would be preferable to the above. At least, for the child, there is something tangible to seek, should the occasion arise. Apart from the parental issue, it is immoral to dissect an unborn child to satisfy the wishes of others. This issue is not something that should become tolerable or bearable in time. We, as human beings, are creatures on this earth and as with all the other species, nature has its own method of population control. Why can we not accept whatever lot we are given and live as nature intended? Denise Gething 12 Churchlands, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland</p>

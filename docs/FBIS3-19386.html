"Important measures which had been agreed were refused at  the  radio-chemical laboratory in Yongbyon," the IAEA said in a  statement issued after a March 3-15 trip to North Korea by IAEA  inspectors.    "As a result of this rejection...the Agency was not in a  position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear  material at the facility where the relevant measures were  rejected," it added.    IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said earlier that the matter could  possibly be referred to the UN Security Council.    Yongbyon, called a "radio-chemical laboratory" by North  Korea, is one of seven sites that Pyongyang agreed could be  inspected by the IAEA after months of stalling. The IAEA  suspects it is used to produce weapons-grade plutonium.    The statement was issued after nuclear inspectors briefed  IAEA chief Hans Blix on their less than successful trip.    The briefing was followed by a meeting of IAEA ambassadors  who considered the findings of the seven-man team, prevented by  North Korean officials from fully carrying out inspections at  seven nuclear sites.    Meyer earlier also confirmed reports that North Korea  blocked  the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but refused to  name them. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / New sexual fantasies between the covers: Out go chaste matinee idols. In come liberated heroines, jet-setting heroes and steamy sex scenes. What is going on at Mills and Boon 'She reached up to clip her hair at the back, her body tall and slender in a dusky pink bikini, her legs long and shapely. The water wrapped round her like a warm blanket, unbelievably soft and caressing' Who, on a dull day at the office, has not had a similar dream: the beach, the sun, the beautiful girl, a frisson of romance? Between soft covers, such dreams are worth Pounds 70m a year in the UK. More romantic novels are sold than any other paperback fiction. More than half come from the romantic fiction publisher Mills and Boon, which has 4m regular readers in Britain and sells one book every two seconds. Mills and Boon has been busy transforming its image as it launches a series of new, updated romances for the 1990s. The matinee idol look and the stolen, chaste kisses are out. In come snazzy covers, racy photographs and a sophisticated logo reflecting contemporary sweet dreams: liberated heroines, jet-setting heroes, plenty of steamy sex scenes. Heroines used to be 'mills and swoon' Cinderellas who sat and waited for their prince. Today, they are independent, professional, sexually aware women who travel the world. In the spring, a star Mills and Boon heroine will be Atlanta reporter TJ Harris, who accepts a marriage proposal to live with her lover at his island resort on condition she has 'satellite television hook-ups, a computer modem and a fax machine. Think that can be arranged?' Another will be Hollywood agent Molly Hill, who plays sex games with her blindfold, naked hero and then seduces him while conducting a business negotiation on the telephone: ''Yes . . . I'm . . . I'm a little out of breath from working out'. Mitch's hand slid beneath her buttocks . . .' The change in Mills and Boon's image this autumn is the first for nine years and reflects readers' tastes for sexier stories and dynamic female characters. 'Heroines have definitely got more guts about them, they are much more confident and assertive in their attitude to men - like women are today,' says Heather Walton, Mills and Boon's marketing director. The stories, she claims, 'mirror the lives of contemporary women' and market research is extensively used to keep them up to date. It shows, for example, that readers enjoy sexual realism - hence this autumn's launch of new format 'temptation romances', with snapshots of pouting cover girls within black borders, the word 'temptation' blazed across the top, and scenes such as reporter TJ Harris's seduction: 'Rafe interrupted their lovemaking only long enough to don a condom from the nightstand drawer.' Social realism, on the other hand, is unwelcome - readers do not, for instance, want stories involving child abuse. This distinguishes Mills and Boon's brand of escapism from that of television soap operas - Eastenders, Neighbours - which are driven by topical social issues. 'But we're not here to moralise,' says Walton. Mills and Boon is now 85 years old, and its romances are an extraordinary cultural phenomenon: one of the most successful and long-lasting examples this century of fantasy sold as a commodity. Early authors included PG Wodehouse and Georgette Heyer; the company became famous in the 1930s when the Depression created a huge market for escapist fiction. Its books have thrived on a standard mix - 192 pages of passion between a handsome, rich, hero and a beautiful young girl, with glamorous background and happy ending guaranteed - ever since. Within this fixed mould, changing sexual and social mores make the stories fascinating cultural barometers. Injured war heroes were popular in the 1940s. Then hospitals, with dashing surgeons and blushing sisters and self-sacrificing deeds, were common settings, and the Doctor, Nurse series was Mills and Boon's great export success in the 1950s. By the 1980s, the Caribbean had become a key backcloth, with a diver or cruise-line owner as hero: a glitzy playground fantasy for the 'me' generation. The new-look Mills and Boon favours romanticised work settings - a Hollywood studio, the office of Brides magazine - to match the career-girl heroines. Are Mills and Boon romances escapist junk, tame pornography, or a brilliant commercial packaging of fantasies that go to the heart of our collective psyche? They are as familiar as brand names of chocolate bars - eight out of 10 women have heard of Mills and Boon. The books are competently written, the style sophisticated and upbeat, but they lack intellectual depth, they are sentimental and predictable and have no artistic originality. In the literary hierarchy, they sit above the simple fictions of Barbara Cartland but below the novels of serious authors such as Fay Weldon or Anita Brookner - writers whose audiences are also primarily female. Why does popular romantic fiction continue to exert a pull over modern, liberated women? Feminist critic Alison Hennegan, editor of Open Letters, the feminist book club, suggests the appeal for some readers lies in 'giving yourself permission not to be bright, to read something that technically someone like you shouldn't want to read, while thinking 'Of course I'd never admit to finding anything attractive here, I'm only too happy to be vice-president of my bank on my way to New York'.' Readers can also, she says, self-consciously enjoy the 'female camp' - 'It's such fun, my dear, it's such a wicked pleasure to suspend belief in political correctness.' Romantic fiction is never politically correct because it is rooted in traditional sexual stereotypes. At its heart lie classic female fantasies which never change. In identifying with a beautiful, beloved, lucky Mills and Boon heroine, women readers fall in love with an idealised self-image. Both heroine and reader see life through sensual-tinted spectacles: themselves in that dusky, pink bikini, waiting for their lover on a beach, writhing with desire. Freud observed that while male daydreams are about ambition, female dreams are erotic, women figuring themselves as objects of desire. That readers identify with a sexually-desired woman is the key to the books' appeal - this is why heroines must be up-to-the-minute social types. Today's reader, for example, could not identify with a simpering, innocent war-time heroine. But on a deeper, fantasy level, the substance of Mills and Boon has barely changed since the 1940s. Female sexual longing, the wish to be powerless, ravished, by a passionate dominant man, courses through every page of romantic fiction. 'One of his conquering hands took command of her burning face. Nothing could ever be the same again,' reads A Perfect Little Fool, a Mills and Boon romance from 1923. 'His display of masterful jealousy excited and pleased her. He was the lover she needed, a man who could sweep her off her feet,' concludes Passionate Choice in 1986. These are universal fantasies; perhaps instinctive, more likely resulting from centuries of repression of female sexuality, so that only in images of coercion, which do not admit their own desires, can most women really let go. They also suggest regressive longings for unconditional love and acceptance, Oedipal wishes for a father-protector figure. Romantic fiction allows the female imagination, with its emphasis on feelings, to triumph as it never does in life - the strong, worldly hero at last admits the supremacy of the private, emotional sphere, and is brought to his feet by love. Beneath the slick and streetwise gloss, the new Mills and Boon novels rework these fantasies, and that is why they will sell. Heroes remain powerful and macho. Career girl-heroines are pretty, feminine and secretly want to be dominated. Spiky ambitious reporter TJ Harris wears an emerald silk nightdress and, when her lover removes it, the reader is told: 'Rafe would take care of everything, she decided confidently, willingly surrendering control.' The books end in marriage, sex is always perfect, careers are often sacrificed, and love means you can stop thinking. In contrast, a recent novel by the feminist writer Fay Weldon concludes 'no amount of fucking can stop you thinking'. Weldon thinks that women should fight the desire to be dominated rather than 'lapse into the belief that you don't have to work and struggle because somebody will always be there to look after you'. Her best-known novel, The Life and Loves of A She-Devil, subverts romantic fantasy with a fat ugly heroine, Ruth, whose husband leaves her for a beautiful romantic fiction novelist. Another cult 1980s novel, Anita Brookner's Hotel du Lac, also features a romantic writer whose life falls short of her rosy hued imaginings. It is writers such as Weldon or Brookner, serious novelists with a large popular following, whose fictions mirror the lives of contemporary women. Mills and Boon stories record the escapist dreams. But if these dreams do not mirror everyday lives of late 20th century woman, they do reflect her cultural expectations. For behind them stands the ideal of romantic love which is age-old in western civilisation. It is there in ancient mythology - epitomised in the figure of Helen of Troy, the face that launched a thousand ships; in medieval courtly poetry such as The Romance of the Rose, and in the oldest folk tales, such as that of Sleeping Beauty, awakened by a kiss from an unknown prince. Modern romantic novels often retell such tales, while in literary terms, the Mills and Boon formula goes back at least two centuries. Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1739) is the story of an innocent servant girl whose master wants to rape her but ends up marrying her. Jane Eyre, where the governess marries her boss, the overbearing Mr Rochester, and Pride and Prejudice, where impoverished Elizabeth Bennett marries wealthy landowner Mr Darcy, are prototypes for popular romantic fiction. All are sexual fantasies about older dominant men; all the heroes are tamed by the power of love. But fairy tales and novels by Jane Austen or Charlotte Bronte have an archetypal, literary, timeless quality which makes us return to them. Popular romantic fiction by contrast, deals in the same myths, but does not last. There are many reasons. Popular fiction dilutes and trivialises the great archetypes. It gives primordial fantasies a contemporary but too-topical veneer which soon seems dated. It excludes the element of fear and tragedy, essential to any myth and to any mature vision of life, in favour of sentimentality and cheap glamour. The mythical content gives such fiction a certain power. Its roots in our deepest sexual fantasies and longings ensure its popularity. Alison Hennegan says of traditional romantic fiction: 'It is much less explicitly erotic - no naughty bits get named - than lesbian or radical feminist literature, where the sky is the limit for explicit sex.' But for this very reason Mills and Boon novels attract those who may feel guilty about sexual fantasies, because the erotic elements are always within the safe context of love and marriage. No one ever reads a Mills and Boon novel twice, or recalls a single character or situation. Here, paradoxically, lies the commercial success: unsatisfied, asking no more than fleeting interest, we return instead for more, new, different, contemporary titles - Mills and Boon publish almost 30 a month. And so the market for escapist fiction will always hold: a Mills and Boon advertisement from the 1940s, 'There's always a new Mills and Boon', encapsulates both its strength and its weakness.</p>

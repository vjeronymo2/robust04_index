			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aleksandr Nazarchuk, head of the Agrarian Committee  of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament,  said on Wednesday that the draft government resolution "The  Economic Conditions for the Functioning of the Agroindustrial  Complex of the Russian Federation in 1994" was signed late on  Tuesday night. The document caused disagreements at a February  3 government presidium meeting.    Nazarchuk said at a news briefing that Russia's agrarian  sector had this year received a credit of only 270 Bn rubles at  213 percent interest. Altogether the sector is to receive under  the government resolution "five trillion rubles instead of the  six trillion necessary to carry through the spring sowing and  end the wintering of the livestock," he said.    The agroindustrial complex demanded a credit of 14 to 15 Tn  rubles for this year, and those were the figures indicated in  the original version of the resolution, Nazarchuk said. But in  the version signed on Tuesday all the figures are much lower, he  said.    Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy  Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of the  legislature, in this connection expressed skepticism about "the  hopes of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food to produce 85 Mn  tonnes of grain this year" (Russia produced 100 Mn tonnes last  year and 106 Mn tonnes in 1992). He does not expect this year's  harvest to top 60 or 70 Mn tonnes, "which would last Russia 180  to 200 days, and then it will be living on doles."    Zvolinskiy said Federation Council deputies might propose a  vote of confidence in the government if it did not change its  agricultural policy.</p>

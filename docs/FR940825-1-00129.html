			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To submit electronic comments, persons can either ``subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application or ``post'' comments to the EPA Bulletin Board. To ``Subscribe'' to the Internet ListServe application for this proposed rule, send an e-mail message to: listserver@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov that says `` Subscribe RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95 &lt;first name> &lt;last name>.'' Once you are subscribed to the ListServe, comments should be sent to: RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95@unixmail.rtpnc.epa.gov.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For online viewing of submissions and posting of comments, the public access EPA Bulletin Board is also available by dialing 202&hyph;488&hyph;3671, enter selection ``DMAIL,'' user name ``BB <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USER'' or 919&hyph;541&hyph;4642, enter selection ``MAIL,'' user name ``BB <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USER.'' When dialing the EPA Bulletin Board type &lt;Return> at the opening message. When the ``Notes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=3 --> : <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ]'' prompt appears, type ``open RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95'' to access the posted messages for this document. To get a listing of all files, type ``dir/all'' at the prompt line. Electronic comments can also be sent directly to EPA at: Docket-OPPTS@epamail.epa.gov.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To obtain further information on the electronic comment process, or on submitting comments on this proposed rule electronically through the EPA Bulletin Board or the Internet ListServe, please contact John A. Richards (Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;2253; FAX: 202&hyph;260&hyph;3884; Internet: richards.john@epamail.epa.gov).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons who comment on this proposed rule, and those who view comments electronically, should be aware that this experimental electronic commenting is administered on a completely public system. Therefore, any personal information included in comments and the electronic mail addresses of those who make comments electronically are automatically available to anyone else who views the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters and others outside EPA may chose to comment on the comments submitted by others using the RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board. If they do so, those comments as well will become part of EPA's record and included in the public docket for this rulemaking. Persons outside EPA wishing to discuss comments with commenters or otherwise communicate with commenters but not have those discussions or communications sent to EPA and included in the EPA rulemaking record and public docket should conduct those discussions and communications outside the RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will transfer all comments received electronically in the RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board, in accordance with the instructions for electronic submission, into printed, paper form as they are received and will place the paper copies in the official rulemaking docket which will also include all comments submitted directly in writing. All the electronic comments will be available to everyone who obtains access to the RIN&hyph;2060&hyph;AE95 ListServe or the EPA Bulletin Board; however, the official rulemaking docket is the paper docket maintained at the address in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at the beginning of this document. (Comments submitted only in written form will not be transferred into electronic form and thus may be accessed only by reviewing them in the EPA Docket as described above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the electronic comment process is still experimental, EPA cannot guarantee that all electronic comments will be accurately converted to printed, paper form. If EPA becomes aware, in transferring an electronic comment to printed, paper form, of a problem or error that results in an obviously garbled comment, EPA will attempt to contact the comment submitter and advise the submitter to resubmit the comment either in electronic or written form. Some commenters may choose to submit identical comments in both electronic and written form to ensure accuracy. In that case, EPA requests that commenters clearly note in both the electronic and written submissions that the comments are duplicated in the other medium. This will assist EPA in processing and filing the comments in the rulemaking docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with ordinary written comments, EPA will not attempt to verify the identities of electronic commenters nor to review the accuracy of electronic comments. EPA will take such commenters and comments at face value. Electronic and written comments will be placed in the rulemaking docket without any editing or change by EPA except to the extent changes occur in the process of converting electronic comments to printed, paper form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will address significant electronic comments either in a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or in a response to comments document placed in the rulemaking docket for this proposed rule. EPA will not respond to commenters electronically other than to seek clarification of electronic comments that may be garbled in transmission or conversion to printed, paper form as discussed above. Any communications from EPA employees to electronic commenters, other than those described in this paragraph, either through Internet or otherwise are not official responses from EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 35  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Grant programs_environmental protection, Grant programs_Indians, Indians, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air pollution control, Environmental protection, Air pollution control_Tribal authority, Air pollution control_Tribal eligibility criteria, Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Environmental protection, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, and Sulfur oxides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 81  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air pollution control, Environmental protection, National parks, Wilderness areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

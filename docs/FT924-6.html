			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Confidence checked in higher volume THE LONDON stock market yesterday displayed a mirror image of its previous session, sliding lower in modest trading as the outlook on both the domestic and US economies appeared less dramatic. Trading volume increased as the equity market gave ground, while stock index futures played a less aggressive role in the underlying stock market. The UK market was disappointed by Wall Street's fall overnight, as the rise in US consumer confidence and an initial dip in London stocks found no succour this time from stock index futures. Share prices were soon on the drift and the FT-SE was 18.5 off at the day's low. Although there was little encouragement either from stock index futures or from Wall Street, a mere 6 Dow points up in London hours, following less decisive pointers from the November index of leading US economic indicators, the Footsie staged a modest rally. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,832.5, a fall of 15.3 on the day. Similar fortunes were suffered by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 4.9 at 2,856.4, and the FT-SE-A 350, which was 6.4 off at 1,382.5. The immediate reasons behind yesterday's fall were not difficult to identify. Weakness in the New York market was one, but a significant factor was the disclosure of further tensions in Britain's high streets, after J. Sainsbury, a leading food supermarket group, said it was slashing prices by 25-50 per cent. The news threw a cloud over this week's reports of increased spending in post-Christmas store sales, but most analysts maintained that Sainsbury's move should be seen merely in terms of competition in the domestic market. But some analysts pointed to the downturn in food retailers and to the rise in Seaq-reported volume to 494.9m shares from the 287.1m of the previous session; equity business on Tuesday was worth only Pounds 636.1m, around half of recent daily average totals. The fall in the UK equity market yesterday increased nervousness ahead of the return to full trading at the beginning of next week. Many analysts fear that the present run in share prices could be severely tested by rights issues in the new year.</p>

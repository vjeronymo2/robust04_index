			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESS FOR WORKERS' COMP  </P> <P> The issues in the 1989 debate over workers' compensation reform were similar to  the legislative tangle in recent years over the high cost of insurance. The  Legislature's inability to negotiate a middle ground between the insurance  companies and lawyers resulted in deadlock that led to competing ballot  initiatives in the 1988 election. Even with the passage of Proposition 103, the  insurance dilemma remains unresolved. But in the case of workers' compensation,  the lawmakers refused to give up, even after it became apparent that all the  goals of a sound, long-range reform program could not be achieved this year.  </P> <P> Largely due to the tireless efforts of Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los  Angeles), California no longer will be burdened with what many consider one of  the nation's worst programs for compensating employees who suffer work-related  injury or disability. The legislation, recently signed into law by Gov. George  Deukmejian, falls short of making the $8-billion California system the best,  but Margolin said the two-bill package at least will put a crumbling,  disrespected program back on its feet. Efforts to complete the job must  continue in future legislative sessions.  </P> <P> California has had an extremely costly program, but one that paid a maximum  benefit of only $224 a week since 1983. For the past seven years, the governor  has insisted on reforms before increasing benefits. One goal of the 1989  legislation had been to double the top payment, with the additional outlay to  be financed by reforms that would cut program costs. The weekly maximum will  increase by just 50% by 1991. The measures will limit an injured worker's  ability to shop for a doctor who would certify him for maximum benefits. Claim  processing will be more efficient. There will be a tougher test to collect  compensation for alleged stress-related disability and more emphasis on  vocational rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Like the insurance debate, the workers' compensation issue pitted insurance  companies against attorneys, but also involved a coalition of business,  industry and labor on one side and high-stress professions such as law  enforcement on the other. Further deadlock probably would have led to opposing  ballot initiatives -- none of which would have provided a balanced reform.  California is fortunate that Margolin and his colleagues did not give up on  workers' compensation reform this year, even though no party had a chance to  get all it wanted. The state will benefit further if the Legislature can  complete the job in the next year or so.  </P></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: TR Technology net assets rise to Pounds 185m TOTAL NET assets of TR Technology grew by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 185m in the year ended April 30 1992, but net asset value per share fell to 111.85p, against 124.25p a year earlier. Net revenue in the year dropped to Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.33m) reflecting both lower interest rates on cash deposits and a higher average weighting over the year in the US market where dividends on smaller technology companies are rare. Earnings dipped by 36.5 per cent to 2.31p, while the dividend has been maintained at 1.75p excluding last year's special 0.45p. The company warned, however, that it might be necessary to reduce the base level of ordinary dividends. That arose from the board's intention to continue to add to holdings of lower yielding US technology shares, which together with the expectation of lower interest rates on liquid balances and only modest dividend growth in the UK, implied that the company's revenue account would come under growing pressure. The company announced that it was making arrangements for the listing of a 'unit' of the shares, comprising 7 Zero dividend, 4 stepped preference and 4 ordinary shares.</p>

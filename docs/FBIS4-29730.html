			<p>BFN     [Text] All 15 Phalang Tham [PDP] hardliners resigned en  masse from the party's executive committee last night as a  crucial party caucus resolved to remain with the Chuan coalition.    The resignation of the majority of the executive board  effectively warrants a new election of the executive line-up,  which observers said would have to decide again on the question  of whether the party should stay with the government.    Yasothon MP Sombun Thongburan said he and 14 other hardline  members of the board submitted letters of resignation to party  leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian during yesterday's meeting. An  election of the new board must be held within a month.    Sombun said the resignations were motivated by "total  political failure" of the party's executives.    The decision to remain with the government was adopted after  a marathon debate lasting six hours, during which the hardliners  lambasted the performance of Phalang Tham's executives.    "We resolved not to pull out of the coalition and to  continue  to give the government our solid support," Phalang Tham leader  Bunchu Rotchanasathian told reporters at the end of the meeting.    Earlier, party members voted in a split decision to revive  its controversial motion on charter reform for this week's House  deliberation and to ask the coalition to allow a free vote.    Twenty-four participants approved a proposal for Phalang  Tham  to renew its push for the motion seeking to establish a House  committee to draft a new Constitution. Twenty others, including  party leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian, voted against it.    The decision means Phalang Tham will seek to push the motion  up the parliamentary agenda this week. It coincided with a  government whips' resolution allowing Phalang Tham to continue  pushing unilaterally for the motion.    The coalition whips agreed that the motion, submitted by 21  Phalang Tham MPs sympathizing with radical pro-reform activists  and shelved last week because of pressure from Phalang Tham  allies, can be debated in the House on Thursday.    "If necessary, the motion can be moved forward and the  Phalang Tham Party can have a free vote on it," PM's [Prime  Minister's] Office Minister and chief whip Thoetphong Chaiyanan  said.    But he added that the four other coalition parties would not  support the motion.    A resolution by whips not to support the motion sponsored by  21 Phalang Tham MPs outraged Phalang Tham hardliners, who vowed  to push for their party's withdrawal from the coalition at  yesterday's meeting. The whips' pressure last week prevented  Phalang Tham from asking the House of Representatives to move  the motion up from the bottom of a 28-motion agenda.    Thoetphong said the whips had not decided to try to help the  PDP solve its crisis by allowing the party to move the motion up  on the agenda.    Phalang Tham members were divided over the issue of pulling  out of the coalition. But tension within the party could  subside if the controversial motion was debated in Parliament.    Thoetphong dismissed speculation that whips resolved last  Friday to expel the PDP from the coalition if its rebel faction  pushed for an early debate on the controversial motion.    Solidarity Party secretary general and deputy Commerce  Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap said his party would support the  motion.    [Text] Thoetphong said government whips agreed that if  coalition parties wanted to vote for the motion, they would have  to inform him first.    Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said it was a  "misunderstanding" that government whips had prevented the  rebels from having their motion debated last week.    "The motion can be moved forward, if necessary," he said.    PDP Secretary-General Udon Tantisunthon said it was now up  to  Phalang Tham members to decide if they want to move the motion  up on the agenda.    The Phalang Tham meeting, chaired by party leader Bunchu,  was  held under tight restrictions. Non-MP and non-executive members  of the party were not allowed in. Participants were subject to  body searches as part of a ban on tape recorders.    Earlier yesterday, the pro-Bunchu faction seemed to have  scored a morale-boosting victory when the Interior Ministry  approved the new official line-up of Phalang Tham executive  members.    The approval effectively barred the most outspoken  hardliner,  Chaiwat Sinsuwong, who was a member of the old executive board,  from yesterday's meeting. Earlier, members of both old and new  executive boards were invited to the meeting.    Thamrong Saengsuriyachan, another hardliner, claimed there  was a conspiracy between the "ministerial wing" of the PDP,  party member holding Cabinet positions, to bar Chaiwat from the  crucial meeting.    Normally, it took the ministry a least a week to approve an  executive line-up of a political party, said Thamrong. He added  that the Phalang Tham line-up was approved in only two hours.    Before and during the meeting Chaiwat and a few other former  Phalang Tham executives held serious discussions in another room  of the hotel and kept monitoring the meeting through Bangkok MP  Sudarat Keyuraphan who kept shuttling between the meeting room  and Chaiwat's group.    Before the meeting, Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang  told reporters it was Bunchu who would set the direction for the  discussion. Bunchu, meanwhile, vowed to allow an "open debate"  on the party's future.    The meeting was held as activist Chalat Worachat, whose  hunger strike to press for controversial pre-reform demands  triggered the current political crisis, returned to his protest  site in front of Parliament to continue his fast. He gave  himself up to police last week to face charges of sedition and  lese majeste but was released on bail on Sunday night.    Chamlong yesterday refused to comment on Chalat's new move.  Earlier, the "ministerial wing" had seriously questioned  Chalat's motives and said the activist had been "used" by groups  bent on toppling the government.    The 21 MPs who submitted the controversial motion seeking to  establish a House committee to draft a new charter insisted they  did so to save Chalat's life.    Bangkok MP Sutin Nopphaket, who initiated the motion, said  before the meeting yesterday that even though the issue of  whether the motion should be moved forward was settled, the  party must consider whether it should remain with the government.    "We want the party to stay with dignity, not under the  influence of others," Suthin said.    The opposition last week promised to vote for the motion.  But after it was shelved last week opposition leaders backed  down from the pledge.</p>

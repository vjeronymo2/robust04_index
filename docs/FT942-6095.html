			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Colombian find shores up Lasmo's bid defence Lasmo, the independent explorer under siege from hostile bidder Enterprise Oil, yesterday shored up its defence by announcing the discovery of a new find in Colombia. The Revancha 1 well, which was tested at a rate of 6,200 barrels of oil a day, is just 3km from an earlier discovery. Lasmo estimated the combined recoverable reserves at between 50m and 150m barrels. Analysts said the new discovery could be worth some 2p to 5p on Lasmo's share price. But some speculated that finds announced during the bid process might eventually be scaled back. Colombia accounts for about 5 to 7 per cent of Lasmo's output. It has been cited by Enterprise as one of the areas which suffers because of Lasmo's heavy financial commitments elsewhere. Mr John Hogan, Lasmo's chief operating officer, acknowledged that development of the latest discovery was not in the budget. But 'there is always money available for good projects'. He noted that three more exploration wells for the area were in next year's budget. Full scale development is not envisaged before late 1995 or early 1996, by which time Lasmo will have completed its extensive capital programme to develop the Liverpool Bay gas field. The two discovery wells in Colombia are 5km from the Purifacacion field, from which Lasmo is trucking out 5,000 barrels a day. Mr Hogan said the expensive trucking operation, which analysts say can add up to Dollars 5 a barrel in costs, will end later this year when a pipeline with a capacity of 35,000 b/d is completed. Lasmo wants to achieve early production from the new discoveries to generate cash which will be used for the further development of the field. A temporary pipeline might be built to link the new discoveries to Purifacacion as early as next year, Mr Hogan said. Lasmo's 66 per cent interest in the block will fall to 30 per cent when it proves to be commercially viable and Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil company, exercises its option to back into the deal. Lasmo yesterday retracted an earlier statement which claimed that: 'In the 1990s Enterprise has lost over Pounds 150m in international operations.' It acknowledged that the lossmaking operations mentioned did not include Norway, which '. . . was not lossmaking over the period'. Enterprise pointed out that Lasmo had 'chosen to ignore' 93 per cent of its international production. Norway last year accounted for turnover of Pounds 144m, against total international revenues of Pounds 154.6m. Enterprise has until the opening of the London Stock Exchange today to extend its Pounds 1.3bn bid. See Lex</p>

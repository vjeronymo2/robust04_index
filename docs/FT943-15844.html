			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Stranded, but never short of valuable advice Sir, Mr Peter Barnes (Letters, July 2/3) is right to emphasise the importance of correct technique in making a proper dry Martini. I must point out also the indigenous and often overlooked secondary value of the constituent ingredients. Stranded in the desert, and in desperate need of assistance, one would need only to produce the requisite bottles for five Americans instantly to appear  -all telling you where you are about to go wrong.

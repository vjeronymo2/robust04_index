			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Bank of Scotland surges despite weak demand HIGHER loan margins and increased fees helped Bank of Scotland raise interim pre-tax profits 58 per cent to Pounds 117.6m, against Pounds 74.2m, despite being hampered by weak loan demand. Economic recovery enabled provisions for bad debts to be lowered 25 per cent compared with the second half of last year to Pounds 174.4m in the six months to August 31. But this was still 26 per cent up on the first half of last year. Assets such as loans rose only 1 per cent on the second half of last year to Pounds 29.4bn, well within the bank's self-imposed limit of 5 per cent asset growth for the year. Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor and chief executive, had been surprised by the 'extremely weak' loan demand. As a result, assets might well expand this year by less than the 5 per cent limit it had set in order to maintain its capital adequacy ratio. He said improvements in management and the reshaping of the bank over the past three years had started 'to come through to the bottom line'. Bad debt provisions should continue to fall in the second half. This would be helped by some release of provisions as it sold assets such as distressed companies which it had helped to continue trading. Operating profits before bad debt provisions rose 39 per cent to Pounds 288.2m. Net interest income rose 22 per cent to Pounds 376.1m (Pounds 307.3m) and non-interest income rose 24 per cent rise to Pounds 186.5m (Pounds 150m). The rise in net interest income was achieved by increasing the average margin on loans from 2.37 per cent to 2.57 per cent. This was reflected in a widening of the spread between interest charged on assets and paid on liabilities. Mr Pattullo said that margins on syndicated loans to large corporate customers were starting to narrow as competition re-emerged, but this had been more than offset by the rise in margins on loans to small business customers. More than half the rise in fee and income commission in the clearing bank came through branches and included increases in personal and corporate customer charges. Mr Pattullo expected further improvements in the second half. The Bank of Wales subsidiary, which suffered a Pounds 15.3m loss last year because of problems with a finance subsidiary, returned to a half-year profit of Pounds 400,000. The bank reduced its ratio of costs to income to 49.6 per cent, in spite of a 10 per cent rise in expenses to Pounds 274.4m. It raised its interim dividend 5.6 per cent to 1.87p, against 1.77p. It maintained its tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets at 5.8 per cent after retaining Pounds 40.4m profit. The shares closed 3.5p up at 184p. Lex, Page 24</p>

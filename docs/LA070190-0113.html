			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: ENTERING 13 HOURS OF 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'  </P> <P> Viewers of KTLA's semiannual The Twilight Zone marathon will find much to keep  them chained to their sets during 13 hours-22 episodes-of the series that begin  at 9 a.m. on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Classic "Twilight Zone" irony is dished out in: "To Serve Man" (7:30 p...), in  which aliens want to do more than just chew the fat with earthlings; "I Shot an  Arrow Into the Air" (4:30 p.m.) about the desperation of a trio of lost  astronauts, and "People Are Alike All Over" (noon), with a title that proves  all too accurate.  </P> <P> Evil lives in: "It's a Good Life" (7 p.m.), starring cute little Billy Mumy as  an unholy terror; "The Howling Man" (1 p.m.), whom good people have a devil of  a time trying to keep locked up, and "He's Alive" (2 p.m.), with Dennis Hopper  as a neo-Nazi.  </P> <P> A step into the future provides answers to a World War I coward who gets a  second chance in "The Last Flight" (1:30 p.m.) and a 19th-century man heading  West in "A Hundred Yards Over the Rim" (10 a.m.).  </P> <P> Soul-selling has unfortunate consequences for "Jess-Belle" (9 p.m.), a woman  who makes a deal with a witch to win a man, and a newspaperman who hires a  "Printer's Devil" (Burgess Meredith, 8 p.m.).  </P> <P> Other typically heavy episodes are "The Purple Testament" (10:30 a.m.), a  moving story of an Army lieutenant with a rare gift of sight, and "The Masks"  (6 p.m.), about a group of unenviable heirs.  </P> <P> The marathon lightens up with "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" (5 p.m.), starring  Burgess Meredith again as a loser who gets a chance to be a big shot.  </P></p>

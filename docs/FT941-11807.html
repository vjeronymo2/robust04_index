			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Japanese raising up to Pounds 250m Fleming Japanese Investment Trust has placed Pounds 94.9m of a conversion share issue with institutions, and is seeking to raise up to a further Pounds 155.1m through a public offer, closing on February 23. The trust is the largest in its sector, with net assets of Pounds 288m at the end of 1993. The maximum issue size has been set fairly high at Pounds 250m to avoid the necessity of scaling down applications. Conversion of C shares into ordinary shares is due to take place between mid-March and the end of June, once 90 per cent of the new funds have been invested. On conversion, one free warrant will be issued with every five ordinary shares, to rank equally with existing warrants, which are trading at about 140p. Expenses for the issue are capped at 1.7 per cent, meaning that the 100p shares will have a net asset value of 98.4p or more. The existing ordinary shares have been trading at a premium to net asset value of almost 8 per cent. The C share issue was planned to take advantage of the weakness in the Tokyo stock market and buy in cheaply while the Nikkei index was trading at less than half its peak level. On Monday, the Nikkei climbed 7.8 per cent in one day on news that parliament had passed a political reform package. However, Mr Patrick Thompson of Fleming Investment Management, said the rally was unlikely to continue at the same rate.</p>

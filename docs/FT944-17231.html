			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Banks 'ease lending criteria to win business' Banks are slackening their lending criteria, reducing margins and attempting 'imprudent' rates of lending growth in response to UK companies seeking finance from other sources, says the latest annual survey from the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Bank Relationship Consultancy. It says the fall in margins on syndicated loans to the biggest companies in the past year - a trend which is increasingly worrying bankers - is also occurring in private loans to large and medium-sized companies. The survey of 139 banks and 233 companies finds that companies are seeking alternative funding as business confidence grows. Banks are allowing looser loan criteria in an effort to persuade companies to borrow from them. It also finds that banks are increasingly willing to lend for up to 10 years, rather than restricting loans to two or three years, as in the past. More banks want to lend in larger amounts of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m. Companies say they are willing to pay slightly higher margins on loans in order to reduce the number of criteria. They are also willing to pay more to ensure that banks do not have the right to sell their loan to others. The survey says that although companies want to increase borrowing from banks, they intend to seek more funding from other sources such as private placement of debt in the US, leasing, and issuing sterling bonds. It says these trends are no longer confined to the largest companies with high credit ratings. In response, banks are becoming more willing to lend to unquoted companies and those with lower ratings. Mr Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy said commercial-bank lending was being restricted by the growing ability of investment banks to bridge the gap between investors and companies. The survey says 70 per cent of banks plan substantial lending growth, with three-quarters of those seeking growth of more than 5 per cent. It is often thought risky for banks to expand their loans faster than the company is growing. Although banks say that they have to gain other forms of business from big companies to make up for low returns on lending, the survey found that few banks have minimum requirements for returns from borrowers. Banks have also made only limited efforts to build up strong relationships with companies. More than 60 per cent of them allocated 10 or more accounts to each lending manager, and changed managers more frequently than every three years. The UK Corporate Banking Market 1994.

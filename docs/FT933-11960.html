			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / MPs attack size of fees in Maxwell asset probes: Bill for sorting out finances could exceed Pounds 100m ACCOUNTANTS and lawyers unwinding the empire of the late Robert Maxwell are charging too much for their services and are taking too long to recover assets for pensioners, a committee of MPs said yesterday. A report by the Social Security select committee said: 'The unravelling of the chaos and confusion left by Robert Maxwell has so far cost the creditors of the former companies, which include the pensioners, some Pounds 50m. The final total cost could exceed Pounds 100m.' Mr Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said the work to sort out the tangled finances of the companies could take three to four more years. The 30-page report singled out Buchler Phillips, an accountancy firm, and its solicitors for criticism, noting that their Pounds 1.1m in fees to date had resulted in a relatively low level of recoveries. It added that the sums of what had actually been recovered appeared to have been overstated. The committee urged the government to consider establishing an independent monitor in the case of larger insolvencies to help *something in here (HP) * determine whether the actions of practitioners and their fees were appropriate. 'We are dependent on the judgments of the professionals involved to tell us whether those costs are appropriate,' Mr Field said. The committee noted that despite repeated requests to the various administrators for detailed information about their fees and the profits they were deriving from Maxwell-related business, only one, Mr John Talbot of accountants Arthur Andersen, responded in detail. The committee issued, but later rescinded, an order to the professionals to provide the information, the report noted. It called on the Department of Trade and Industry to widen its inquiry into corporate voluntary administration and insolvency to include a review of recovery of assets. The report also criticised several of the banks which dealt with Mr Maxwell, particularly Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse. These two resisted providing full details of transactions they handled, ultimately forcing the liquidators to seek a court order. The committee also criticised several leading insurance companies which provided up to Pounds 100m in insurance policies for company officers and pension fund trustees. The companies are now seeking to void their policies on the basis that Mr Maxwell failed to inform them of his fraud. MPs slam liquidators, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

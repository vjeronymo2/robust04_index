			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: REAGAN: THROWING THE BOOK AT HIM  </P> <P> Until a few days ago, my life and Ronald Reagan's life had some shocking  similarities:  </P> <P> He was born in Illinois and I was born in Illinois.  </P> <P> He was born in this century; I was born in this century.  </P> <P> He became governor of California; I have been to California.  </P> <P> He became President; I have voted for President.  </P> <P> Eerie, no?  </P> <P> And even though it is childish and wrong, I couldn't help but constantly  measure my accomplishments against his. (He had his own plane; I had my own  car.)  </P> <P> Last week, however, he really did me in. When I learned that we were both  working on books, I figured it was yet another case of the weird kismet that  has connected our lives.  </P> <P> And then I found out how much he is getting for his book: Around $4 million for  his memoirs, plus another million for a collection of his speeches.  </P> <P> This is somewhat more than I am getting for my book. And my first reaction to  this news was jealousy. Which was followed by my second reaction: more  jealousy.  </P> <P> Since I am thoroughly ashamed of my thoughts, I figured I would share them with  you:  </P> <P> Thought No. 1: Ronald Reagan was the President who couldn't remember things.  </P> <P> I'm sure you remember this. During the Iran-Contra scandal, he constantly said  he couldn't remember what he approved when. Ed Muskie, a member of the Tower  Commission that investigated the scandal, said of Reagan's testimony to that  body: "What he didn't remember astonished us."  </P> <P> When asked why he couldn't remember when he had approved the first shipment of  arms to Iran, Reagan replied: "Everyone who can remember what they were doing  on Aug. 8, 1985, raise your hand. I think it's possible to forget."  </P> <P> But if he forgot all this stuff, how is he going to write a $4 million book  about it?  </P> <P> Answer: He must have taken notes.  </P> <P> Thought No. 2: Ronald Reagan was the President who didn't take notes.  </P> <P> In his address to the nation following the Tower Commission report, Reagan  said: "One thing still upsetting to me, however, is that no one kept proper  records of meetings or decisions (of the National Security Council). This led  to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arms shipment before or after  the fact."  </P> <P> He didn't take notes. Nobody else took notes. So this part of his book, the  greatest scandal of his presidency, should be a very short chapter.  </P> <P> Thought No. 3: Ronald Reagan was the President who, according to his aides,  never knew what was going on in the White House.  </P> <P> Book after book by the people who worked for him has said that he was  "detached" or "out of the loop" or "delegated" away his authority.  </P> <P> And, according to James Cannon, former aide to White House Chief of Staff  Howard Baker, Reagan was so "detached" that high level White House aides  considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.  </P> <P> In the book, "Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984-88," Cannon is  quoted as saying: "They (aides) told stories about how inattentive and inept  the President was. He was lazy; he wasn't interested in the job. They said he  wouldn't read the papers they gave him -- even short position papers and  documents -- all he wanted to do was to watch movies and television at the  residence."  </P> <P> Thought No. 4: Ronald Reagan was the President who even had his "ad-libs"  scripted for him.  </P> <P> Yet, according to his publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, Reagan has decided "he  is going to write it (the book) himself."  </P> <P> Thought No. 5: Ronald Reagan is going to make a fortune off this book.  </P> <P> And I am happy for him. Having got all my mean and jealous thoughts off my  chest, I now feel liberated. So I called my agent, Rafe (Agent to the Stars)  Sagalyn, to ask the key question: Can anyone sell enough books to earn a $4  million advance?  </P> <P> "The short answer is yes," Rafe said. "Simon &amp; Schuster also probably got  world rights and paperback rights for that kind of money, which will help. And  if I were them, I'd print a special leather-bound, slip-cased edition, maybe  3,000 to 5,000 of them, and sell those for $200 or so each. That would help.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, however, the First Ladies have outsold their husbands. Rosalynn  outsold Jimmy and Betty outsold Gerry. Nancy's book will be out this fall. She  got $3 million for hers."  </P> <P> (But look at it this way: She's been running the country for the last eight  years. Sorry, that just sneaked in. I am thoroughly ashamed of myself.)  </P> <P> But how many books, I asked Rafe, does it take to earn $4 million?  </P> <P> "Let's say about 500,000 copies," he said.  </P> <P> Gee, I said, that sounds like a lot of books to sell.  </P> <P> "Well, yes and no," Rafe said. "Last year, the 'Eight Week Cholesterol Cure'  sold a million."  </P> <P> Which is what makes this country so great: Not only can anyone be President;  anyone can write a best seller.  </P></p>

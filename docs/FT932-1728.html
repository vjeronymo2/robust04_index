			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): Hi-tech phrase book - Industry THE BUSINESS DICTIONARY OF COMPUTERS by Jerry M Rosenberg John Wiley Pounds 39.95, 403 pages SOME PEOPLE read dictionaries for fun, but it would take an uncommon turn of mind to enjoy browsing through a dictionary of computing. The Business Dictionary of Computers, however, is a useful addition to the works of reference available to those who might need to know the meaning of  -for example - disabled module, global variable symbol or sparse array just once in a lifetime. Written by Professor Jerry M. Rosenberg, of Rutgers University, it contains definitions of 7,500 such phrases. It suffers from the usual American-centred view of the business data processing world. The Univac 1 is described as the first commercial electronic computer. No mention of Leo, Ace or Atlas, alas.</p>

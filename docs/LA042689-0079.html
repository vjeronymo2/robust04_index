			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ORDINARY ADVENTURE TALE OF 'THE FORGOTTEN'  </P> <P> USA Network tonight debuts its World Premiere Movies with "The Forgotten"(9-11  p.m.), a story of six American MIAs who are released from the hell of Vietnam  into the hell of U.S. military and political corruption.  </P> <P> The first of 24 original movies that the cable channel has commissioned, the  production is turgid and airless, a murky filament in USA Network's  self-described "new" look.  </P> <P> The cast features strong performances from Keith Carradine and Steve Railsback  as the key MIA guys suddenly freed and whisked off to a U.S Army base in  Germany after 17 years as Vietnam POWs.  </P> <P> But the production's early going, particularly the debriefing scenes, are  grueling. The show never develops a style or any zest.  </P> <P> Stacy Keach (whose brother James Keach produced, directed and co-wrote with  Railsback) delivers a ho-hum performance that looks phoned in, playing a  Nazi-like lackey for the National Security Council. He interrogates the gaunt  MIAs as if they're all brainwashed traitors. That's because Keach's bosses in  Washington have a lot to cover up.  </P> <P> Cliches (check out Bruce Boa's unctuous Secretary of State) and fog (Americans  shooting Americans on dark Bonn streets) choke the production. Meanwhile,  flashes of welcome light flare along the story's edges from Don Opper, Richard  Lawson, Pepe Serna and Michael Champion as other MIAs in the group betrayed by  Uncle Sam.  </P> <P> It's this unevenness, even in the lighting, and the flat, by-rote action scenes  (the show was shot in Yugoslavia) that make the adventure ordinary at best,  stifling at worst.RAY LOYND  </P></p>

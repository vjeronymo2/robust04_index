			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMERS LIFT CSUN OVER CAL POLY SLO  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge hitters played a version of follow the leader Friday  afternoon during a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game against  Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Held in check for the first three innings by Mustang starter Keith Chura,  Northridge's Ted Weisfuss led off the fourth with a home run, which was  followed by a Craig Clayton double, a home run by Chae-Ho Chong and consecutive  singles by Rusty McLain and J.D. Haendiges.  </P> <P> The five-hit, three-run rally was the first of three productive innings for  Northridge as the Matadors defeated San Luis Obispo, 10-3, in the opener of a  three-game series at Matador Field.  </P> <P> Northridge, ranked 14th in Division II, improved to 17-10-1 overall and 7-6-1  in conference play. Eighth-ranked San Luis Obispo is 18-17 and 8-6.  </P> <P> "They're (Northridge) very young and when somebody hits the ball hard, they get  all excited and think, 'Well heck, why can't I do the same thing?' " said San  Luis Obispo Coach Steve McFarland, whose team entered the game atop the  conference standings with a half-game lead over Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Northridge's 13-hit attack featured four home runs, including two by Chong, who  has recovered from a slow start to raise his average to .320.  </P> <P> "The air was so thin and so hot today, you just put it up in the jet stream and  it was going," said Chong, who also had a single. "I feel like I was in a slump  at the beginning of the year. Now, I feel like I'm getting back in the groove."  </P> <P> Northridge pitcher Fili Martinez maintained his season-long groove with his  fifth complete game. The senior left-hander surrendered eight hits, struck out  eight and walked just one batter to improve his record to a misleading 3-3.  </P> <P> Just as he did in his last start against USC, Martinez kept San Luis Obispo  hitters off balance and did not allow a hit until the sixth inning.  </P> <P> "The curveball was working again," said Martinez, who lowered his earned-run  average to 2.33. "If you get your curveball over for strikes when you're behind  then you're going to be successful."  </P> <P> Northridge increased its lead to 5-0 in the fifth inning when Clayton, who had  three hits and four runs batted in, hit a shot off San Luis Obispo third  baseman Matt Drake that scored Mike Solar and Weisfuss, who had walked and  doubled.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo scored two runs in the sixth on a bases-loaded double by Sean  Harper that followed a single by Bill Daly, an error by Northridge second  baseman Randy Thompson and a single by Robert Hale.  </P> <P> Northridge answered with five runs in the home half of the inning to increase  its lead to 10-2.  </P> <P> Haendiges led off with a single and scored on a double by Denny Vigo. Two outs  later, Weisfuss singled for his third hit of the game and then scored on  Clayton's fourth home run of the season, a low drive just inside the left-field  foul pole.  </P> <P> Dave Mossman replaced Chura (5-4) after Clayton's home run and Chong greeted  him with a fly ball over the scoreboard in right field for his seventh homer of  the year.  </P> <P> Martinez surrendered a solo home run to Ron Crowe in the ninth before slamming  the door.  </P></p>

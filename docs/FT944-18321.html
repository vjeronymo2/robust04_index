			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gates slides 8% Pre-tax profits at Frank G Gates, the Essex-based car dealer, fell 8 per cent for the six months to June 30, from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 1.06m. Turnover improved from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 38m. Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said it was largely due to the 30 per cent rise in profits on contract and daily hire that the results were only marginally reduced on last year's. Combined sales of new and used cars showed a 20 per cent increase. However, departmental profits fell 18 per cent, with profits from the sale of used cars almost three times those from the sale of new vehicles as margins continued to decline. Earnings per share were 3.51p (3.6p). Mr Gates said he did not expect 1994's full-year figures to improve on 1993.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: HILTON A SAFE HARBOR FOR COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Finally, a hotel they can call home. In Orange County, a social tribe without a  ballroom is like a socialite without a diamond -- she can paint the town  without it, but it's a little harder to shine.  </P> <P> With the advent of the new Waterfront Hilton in Huntington Beach, the  Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee -- the single largest annual  contributor to the Orange County Philharmonic Society -- can kick up its heels  without leaving home, so to speak.  </P> <P> The 300-room resort, just a swim away from Huntington Harbour, boasts not only  an elegant ballroom but also a pool area with a surf-and-sand view, something  no other major Orange County hotel can claim.  </P> <P> On Friday night, about 300 members of the Huntington Harbour committee  schmoozed around the undulating pool, sipped something cool, and dug into a  generous array of appetizers.  </P> <P> Guests were hard-put to believe that they were in Huntington Beach. The hotel's  structures were on either side and straight ahead: the deep-blue ocean view.  </P> <P> Overheard: "This doesn't feel like Huntington. You can't see any oil wells!"  </P> <P> Ah, but an oil tanker lurked on the horizon, giving Leonard Catalano -- the  hotel's catering manager -- fits. "What can you do?" he asked, rolling his  eyes.  </P> <P> If you're Catalano, you distract guests with the Pandemonium Steel Band, a duet  of dolphin ice sculptures, and enough floral exotica to camouflage the Exxon  Valdez, now called the Exxon Mediterannean. You pass tulips of wine and bubbly  on silver trays. And finally, you bid guests into the ballroom for dancing and  a repast that includes warm duck-breast salad, lamb chop, grilled tuna, and  fruit tarts drizzled with champagne sauce.  </P> <P> Guests included Philharmonic board president Robert Searles and Huntington  Harbour Committee Chairwoman Doris Willis, attending with her husband, Dr.  Burton Willis. (Holiday entertaining tip: the committee's annual Cruise of  Lights -- open-to-the-public boat tours of Huntington Harbour to view homes  decorated with lights -- is set for Dec. 13 through Dec. 21. Proceeds to the  Philharmonic Society are expected to exceed $140,000.)  </P> <P> Also on the party scene: Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County  Philharmonic Society; Philharmonic board member Bobbitt Williams with her  husband, Bill; Joanne and Howard Fernbach; Joyce and Mark Weiss; Sherry and  Dale Skerik and Isabel and Paul Greenwald.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, members of the Little Mermaid Guild -- also a Huntington  Beach-based group -- of Children's Hospital of Orange County helped launch the  new hotel. After a pool-side reception, guests filed into the ballroom for  dinner, an auction conducted by Lyle Waggoner and a surprise performance by  singer-songwriter (the "Rocky" theme) Carol Conners.  </P> <P> Another highlight for guests: the chance to gaze upon posters up for auction  that showcased the touching "Secrets" painting created by Laguna Beach artist  Ivan Anderson. Each "Secrets" poster -- an impressionistic portrayal of a boy  and girl whispering as they walk down a path -- displayed the signatures of  celebrities. The party was themed "Celebration for Children." Among guests:  gala co-chairwomen Lori Bobo and Jackie Teichmann, Joyce Graham, Barbara Alter,  Joyce Berneart, Ginny Bowman, Sarah Faber, Ellen Pook, Lotus Williams and Kathy  Brandt, president of the Little Mermaid Guild.  </P> <P> Super scoops: Vice President Dan Quayle will appear at a $1,000-per-person  fund-raiser for the local and statewide chapters of the GOP on Sept. 25 at the  home of John and Donna Crean of Santa Ana Heights. (Imagine the Secret Service  trying to safeguard the jillion nooks and crannies of the luxurious Crean  "hotel" -- more than 35,000 square feet of Tara-esque grandeur that, among  other things eye-popping, features a dance studio, screening room, and a  private apartment for the owners. . . . Talk about a social coup. The Center  Dance Alliance, a support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center,  has landed the post-performance party of 1990. On Sept. 30, the group will  stage a "Stars and Stripes Gala" at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. Up for  gawking: members of the super-hot New York City Ballet, including its  Adonis-like master-in-chief, the Danish-born Peter Martins (There is nothing  like a Dane). Guests at the $125-per-person, black-tie preferred event -- which  is open to the public -- will enjoy cocktails at 6 p.m. (the party follows the  company's final matinee at the Center) and dinner at 7 p.m. The New York City  Ballet appears at the Center from Sept. 25 through 30. During its engagement  the company will perform the West Coast premiere of a work by Martins entitled  "Ecstatic Orange." How appropriate. . . . The Viba Guild of Opera Pacific is  staging a bus trip to Los Angeles on Oct. 7 to see the opera "Nixon in China"  at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. (John Taylor,  the new director of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda,  saw the show in New York. But he may decide to take in the L.A. production  soon, says library spokesman Kevin Cartwright, who saw the production last week  and claimed it interesting and confusing. Personally, I got a kick out of  watching Pat Nixon arrive in China in those '60s-style boots we all wore.  Remember?). . . .  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN PRESIDENT BLASTS ABDUCTION OF DRUG SUSPECT  </P> <P> Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari charged Monday that the apparent  abduction of a Guadalajara physician to Los Angeles to face drug-related  charges threatens the war on drugs, telling a gathering of newspaper publishers  here that the United States cannot eliminate "one illegality with another  illegality."  </P> <P> Salinas told a luncheon at the 104th annual convention of the American  Newspaper Publishers Assn. -- meeting this week in Century City -- that the  apparent role of U.S. drug agents in the reported kidnaping April 3 of Dr.  Humberto Alvarez Machain undermines efforts to stop the flow of narcotics from  Latin America.  </P> <P> "The battle against narcotics traffickers requires unprecedented international  cooperation," Salinas said, delivering his remarks in Spanish.  </P> <P> "But that cooperation, in order to be effective and real, has to be  accomplished with the strictest international respect and no unilateral actions  against the law and rights of other nations. It is not with abritrary acts by  the pursuers that we are going to combat the illegality of the narcotics  traffickers.  </P> <P> "This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who have the  obligation of defending the law and could create a problem much larger than the  one we are trying to combat."  </P> <P> The speech came during a hectic schedule for the Mexican president at the  Century Plaza Hotel.  </P> <P> Later in the day, he presided over a ceremony in which Mexico, for the first  time, agreed to extend medical benefits to the families of Mexican citizens  working outside of the country. Under the historic agreement, eligible members  of the United Farm Workers Union of America would pay between $160 and $200 a  year for comprehensive health care for immediate family members back in Mexico.  </P> <P> Salinas also met separately with Mexican-American businessmen and Chicano  activists before returning to Mexico City late in the day.  </P> <P> The role of agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in the Alvarez  affair has created an uproar in Mexico, where government officials claimed the  United States violated Mexican sovereignty and interests.  </P> <P> Mexican authorities have charged that DEA agents offered as much as $100,000  for the abduction of Alvarez, who U.S. authorities believe was present during  the torture of slain DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985. Mexican authorities  believe Alvarez was forcibly removed from his home in Guadalajara and flown to  El Paso, Tex., where he was arrested by U.S. officials.  </P> <P> Alvarez is now in Los Angeles, facing drug-related charges in connection with  Camarena's death.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal judge has asked U.S. officials to explain Alvarez's  arrest.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the chief spokesman for U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he  could not foresee any circumstances under which Alvarez might be returned to  Mexico.  </P> <P> In his speech, Salinas said Mexico is doing its share to combat the trafficking  of illegal drugs.  </P> <P> "The street value of the 43 tons of pure cocaine that we have seized during the  (last) 16 months . . . is equivalent to the total amount of our foreign debt,"  Salinas said.  </P> <P> While the publishers politely applauded Salinas' remarks, the president and  Cesar Chavez, head of the UFW, were showered with shouts of "Viva Mexico" and  rhythmic handclapping from more than 100 local activists and UFW members as  they took part in a ceremony extending the medical benefits.  </P> <P> Chavez said Salinas was the first Mexican president in nearly three decades to  understand the UFW's desire to help families left behind by workers who come to  the United States.  </P> <P> "It has not been possible for the union to protect members' families in Mexico  with the union's medical plan here," the labor leader said. "Our joint efforts  began a creative type of binational pact which gives concrete expression to the  solidarity and brotherhood of the Mexican people here and in Mexico."  </P> <P> Chavez claimed that as many as 100,000 UFW members were covered by the  agreement, under which the union would pay their health premiums to the Mexican  Institute for Social Security.  </P> <P> But not all Mexican politicians agreed with Chavez's assessment.  </P> <P> Mexican opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who was winding up a three-day  visit to Los Angeles on Monday, told supporters in Chinatown that the agreement  would have "little impact," saying as few as 15,000 agriculture workers might  be covered by the pact.  </P> <P> "It's just not enough," said Cardenas, who pointed out that as many as 2  million Mexican workers -- illegally or otherwise -- are in California.  </P> <P> Many of Cardenas' supporters in Los Angeles urged Chavez not to appear with  Salinas, reiterating allegations that Salinas' party, known as PRI, stole the  1988 presidential election from Cardenas, the son of a revered former  president.  </P></p>

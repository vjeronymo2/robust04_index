			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 16 May HOMMIKULEHT, p. 3; "News Bulletin" No. 93/94] </F>   [Text] Chairman of the Trade Unions Central League Raivo  Paavo expressed his "amazement" at some claims of Prime Minister  Mart Laar made in London last week.    Laar was quoted as saying that the government should sell  everything possible to private owners, irrespective of price.  The premier also allegedly claimed that granting excessive  rights to the trade unions may threaten the state's economy.    Paavo pointed out that such claims could be made by a  right-wing politician, but not "a prime minister of a democratic  state, a leader of a coalition government which includes Social  Democrats." He also pointed out that the premier's statements  contradict the Estonian law on privatisation which stipulates  profitable sale of state property. As for the rights of the  trade unions, Paavo stressed that the Estonian trade unions obey  the Estonian laws as well as the conventions of the  International Labour Organisation, ratified by the Riigikogu  [parliament].</p>

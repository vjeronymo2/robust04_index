			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The administrative law judge found that the Respondent had been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances, and therefore grounds exist to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration pursuant to 824(a)(2). In considering whether grounds exist to revoke Respondent's registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the administrative law judge found factors one, three, four and five listed in 823(f) relevant. Factor one is applicable by virtue of the California Medical Board's filing of an Accusation and Supplemental Accusation against the Respondent. Factor three is applicable to Respondent's felony conviction, and factors four and five were found relevant based upon Respondent's abuse and alleged unlawful sale of controlled substances, as well as the subsequent related criminal charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge concluded that the Government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent sold cocaine to his girlfriend's sister on March 29, 1991. The administrative law judge made this determination based upon the fact that neither the deceased's sister nor her car was thoroughly searched prior to her entering Respondent's house; that the alleged purchase was neither seen nor heard by law enforcement personnel; and that the sister of the deceased had a reason to lie.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the record clearly established that Respondent has abused controlled substances for many years. The administrative law judge also found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Respondent has recognized and dealt with the severity of his problem, or that he has progressed in his recovery to the extent that he should be permitted to continue to hold a DEA registration. Based upon evidence of Respondent's felony conviction and past drug abuse, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked and any pending applications be denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommendation. The Respondent argued in part: That the administrative law judge's recommendations were inconsistent with the testimony given by Respondent, particularly as it related to the duration of Respondent's use of cocaine and marijuana, and the extent of the use of cocaine by Respondent's friends and acquaintances while at his home; that although the administrative law judge concluded that the Government failed to establish that a controlled buy took place, the administrative law judge nevertheless made unnecessary references to events surrounding its occurrence; that the Respondent has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to drug rehabilitation based in part on his nearly three year successful participation in a strict and monitored regimen of random drug testing administered through the Probation Office of Los Angeles County; that based upon the legislative intent of the public interest amendment to the Controlled Substances Act, felony convictions are not per se violations since Respondent's crime did not involve abuse of prescription drugs; statements relied upon by the administrative law judge regarding Respondent's insufficient attempts at drug rehabilitation in light of his 20 year drug addiction, were based on faulty and incomplete evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Acting Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling, in part. The Acting Administrator concurs with the Respondent's exception to the administrative law judge's finding of fact regarding testimony attributed to the Respondent of his friend's and acquaintances' daily partaking of food, drink, and cocaine while at Respondent's home. While the record is not clear as to the exact time Respondent starting using cocaine, it is clear that he abused drugs for a significant period of time. Additionally, the record does not support Respondent's allegations regarding the administrative law judge's reliance on factors involving the alleged controlled buy. Finally, the record does not show that the Respondent has demonstrated a life long commitment to drug rehabilitation, nor that the administrative law judge, in making her recommendation, unduly relied upon the conclusions of the California Medical Board consultant that the Respondent's rehabilitative attempts were insufficient to overcome his 20 year addiction to drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent further argued that his felony convictions are not per se violations since his crime did not involve improper prescribing of controlled substances. DEA Administrators have consistently held that controlled substance-related felony convictions need not involve the misuse of a DEA registration to justify revocation of the registration or denial of an application for registration. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> William H. Carranza, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Docket No. 84&hyph;23, 51 FR 2771 (1986),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paul Stepak, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  51 FR 17556 (1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's history of non-compliance with the laws relating to controlled substances speaks for itself. The Respondent not only admitted to a long history of drug abuse, but he also admitted to using cocaine and marijuana with friends, including his use of these controlled substances on an occasion when his girlfriend died as a result of cocaine use. The totality of the facts leads to the conclusion that the continued registration of Dr. Azen would be inconsistent with the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AA8786329, issued to Stanley Alan Azen, M.D., be and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective March 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

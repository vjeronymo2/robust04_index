			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Fedorov May Return, </F> Gerashchenko May Go"]    [Text] The meeting between former Finance Minister B.  Fedorov and Russian President B. Yeltsin, originally planned for  Monday and then postponed until Tuesday 25 January, failed to  take place again. According to information from the president's  administration, B. Yeltsin will nevertheless receive B. Fedorov,  most probably after returning from St. Petersburg, and we will  at last find out how the government crisis connected with the  protracted formation of the new Cabinet of Ministers is going to  be resolved.    As already reported, on 24 January V. Chernomyrdin went to  the Kremlin and, as competent sources assert, the discussion  focused not only on budget matters but also on cadre affairs.  First and foremost they discussed the vacancy in the post of  finance minister, a key office in the current situation. As a  result of this conversation the prime minister's list of two  nominees remained on the president's desk -- they are B. Fedorov  and V. Shcherbakov, who is a former vice premier in V. Pavlov's  cabinet.    Before flying out to Orel, V. Chernomyrdin hinted to  journalists that the choice must be made by the president  himself. But he has already made his own choice: Either B.  Fedorov, who is perceived as an indicator of the reformist mood  of Russia's top leadership, is to be rejected or he is to be  restored to his post. The premier has chosen the latter option,  and there were significant reasons for that. Paradoxical though  it may seem, they are connected with the role of the fourth  estate in our society, which rose up solidly against the  government apparatus' games designed to get rid of the  reformers. According to some reports, during the conversation  with the president he agreed to B. Fedorov's appointment as  finance minister directly subordinate to the premier. Why was  this?    Recently economists have been predicting increasingly  vociferously that Russia is approaching the point of economic  collapse. In the words of V. Krivov, leader of the group of  experts under the Russian Federation president, the main factor  which could lead to a further, sharp decline in production, a  fall in standards, and an end to food imports is the rapid rise  in the cost of oil extraction, with the result that the export  of oil and likewise of coal and timber will become unprofitable.  V. Chernomyrdin was bound to know about this prospect, and thus  he hesitated and did not want to shoulder the full  responsibility himself.    At the same time he has not abandoned the idea of an  "independent" premier. The ostentatious "friendship" with V.  Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, whose days  in that post are numbered according to what is being said in the  Kremlin, may be considered indicative in this respect. V.  Chernomyrdin's gesture of inviting V. Gerashchenko to go to Orel  is being perceived there as a clear challenge to the president.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the initiative of Professor Virgil Magureanu,  director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], the  leadership of that institution had a meeting today with  editors-in-chief, directors, and general directors of press  organizations, radio and television, and the Romanian Press  Agency, during which they addressed issues related to current  relations between the SRI and the media and the more fluid and  open circulation of information, both in the interest of the  public readership and national security.    After the conclusion of the meeting, Virgil Magureanu  granted  a brief interview to Gheorghe Verman, director of the  Information, Journalism, and Sports Department of Radio Romania,  in which Magureanu assessed that it had been a useful  conversation during which everyone was able to very openly state  their opinions. There were also some slightly biased accents,  but, on the whole, the expressed opinions were objective and not  acrimonious, Magureanu stated.    Answering a question as to whether openness and the security  of the state are compatible, the head of the SRI assessed that  within certain limits they are compatible, adding that openness  should refer primarily to the already final results of actions  designed to protect national security. It would also be  necessary, Magureanu said, for the illegal monopoly of one or  the other party -- that is, the SRI or the media -- over  national security information to be dissolved so that cases can  be solved more rapidly through correct cooperation.    Asked to comment on cooperation so far, especially on the  current cooperation between the SRI and the "Romania  Actualitati" [Current Events] program, Prof. Magureanu  appreciated, above all, our radio's optimal objectivity with  respect to the image of the institution he leads. That image is  sometimes good, sometimes bad, changing with time, Magureanu  added.    At the end of the interview Magureanu stated that he is  quite  optimistic on relations between the SRI and the press and that  he believes that the institution he is leading has a great deal  of things to do before it obtains the necessary trust of those  who should be its partners. He concluded by saying that such  relations are not necessarily identical to those among equal  partners.</p>

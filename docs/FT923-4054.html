			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Opinion poll group makes switch to secret balloting A LEADING opinion poll organisation is to change its survey methods radically, following the disastrous performance of pollsters at the general election in April. Other polling organisations may follow. ICM, one of the big five pollsters, said yesterday it would abandon oral questioning of electors on voting intentions in favour of a system of confidential ballot papers. Extensive research since the election has persuaded ICM that this would produce more accurate results as it is more likely to disclose true voting intentions than a face-to-face interview. The final polls before the April 9 election recorded, on average, a Labour lead of 1.3 per cent and varied between a 0.5 per cent and a 3 per cent swing to Labour. In the event, the Tories won by a margin of 7.6 per cent, gaining 42.8 per cent of the vote compared with Labour's 35.2 per cent. It was described by one leading pollster as 'the worst result for the opinion polls since they were invented', and the inquest has been going on ever since. Mr Brian Gosschalk, director of Mori, is still looking at polling methodology, but said: 'We are considering introducing a secret ballot.' Mr Bob Wybrow, director of Gallup, said the idea of a secret ballot was being studied. ICM's research involved reinterviewing those who took part in its final pre-election survey. This confirmed a high degree of reluctance among Conservative supporters to say how they would vote. When the election polls were adjusted in the light of the new information, and the confidential ballot paper substituted, the outcome was very close to the actual election result. Only 1 per cent of the people in the tests refused to take part in the secret ballot compared with 7 per cent when using conventional polling methods, and the results were found to be much more accurate. Under the new method, anyone who declines to take part in the secret ballot will be asked to say which party has the best policies on the economy. This answer will then be used to determine how they would probably vote. Mr Nick Sparrow, managing director of ICM, said yesterday: 'This change in technique has the effect of increasing the Tory vote in line with what actually happened in the election. It must therefore be a big step forward, and other polling organisations will have to take note of it.' There are already signs that this is happening. Mr Nick Moon, director of NOP, said the research was encouraging. 'We are reaching no decision yet, but it could be a sensible thing to do.'</p>

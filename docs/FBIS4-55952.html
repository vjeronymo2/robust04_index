			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andras Koves, scientific director of the </F> Institute for Business Cycle and Market Research and the  Processing of Foreign-Trade Data: "Can the Worsening of the  Balance of Payments Be Halted? The Economic-Policy Dilemmas of  Export's Decline"]    [Text] The development and state of Hungary's foreign trade  are investigated usually on the basis of trade data reported in  dollars. The figures for dollar-denominated trade from 1988  through 1992 show exceptionally dynamic growth. They are very  impressive even if we know that ruble-denominated trade has  ceased in the meantime. Until 1988-1989, transactions  denominated in hard currency accounted for about 60 percent of  our foreign trade. Since 1991, however, practically all of  Hungary's foreign trade has been denominated in hard currency.    Our dollar-denominated exports nearly doubled between 1988  and 1992. The growth of imports was even faster--it more than  doubled during that period. The growth of imports accelerated in  1993, but there was an unprecedented sharp decline in exports.  As a result, the balance of payments showed a very significant  current account deficit.    On the basis of its rapid growth through 1992, foreign trade  seemed a success in comparison with the national economy's other  branches. There was debate about whether the success had  occurred despite, or actually as a direct result of the  Hungarian economy's general depression. The former view was  held by those who felt that the growth of exports could be  attributed to significant effort, and not just to economic  necessity; and that economic policy had to maintain and  stimulate the orientation to export. The other group's opinion  was based on the belief that the Soviet (or rather CEMA)  market's collapse and the contraction of domestic demand  automatically compelled producers to storm foreign markets and,  therefore, export incentives were unnecessary. Anyhow, it seemed  that the shift in foreign trade had been completed, and  adjustment to foreign markets was faster than had been expected.    Naturally, last year's events have modified the above  assessments. It is obvious that both domestic and foreign  factors played a role the sharp decline in exports. But the fact  that, among the former socialist countries, the decline in  Hungary's exports was uniquely severe indicates that Western  Europe's recession cannot be regarded by any means as the  decline's decisive cause. There are many possible domestic  economic explanations that could be offered. What distinguished  Hungary from several other Central European countries, until the  autumn of 1993, was an exchange-rate policy that revalued the  forint in real terms. Consequently, Hungarian export's  cost-competitiveness declined. while import's  cost-competitiveness against domestic production increased. In  addition, the arsenal of export incentives that Hungarian  economic policy employed was very meager.    Because farm and food-industry products traditionally play  an  important role in Hungary's exports (their significance is much  greater than in the exports of our competitors), the  agricultural sector's collapse in recent years inevitably caused  serious harm to export trends. But we are not talking only about  agriculture. From 1992 on, "supply-side shock therapy" had an  unfavorable affect on the entire economy. I have in mind  primarily the statutory regulations (the Bankruptcy Law, the  Accounting Law, and the Banking Law) that were introduced in  quick succession, amidst a severe recession. The statutory  regulations rocked the enterprises that were in an already  unstable financial situation, coping with marketing problems and  by no means able to say that the difficulties created by the  transformation were behind them. This reduced the available  stocks of commodities and had an unfavorable effect on the  ability to export.    A protracted and deep recession--in conflict with earlier  views--does not help exports in any way. To the contrary, after  a time it makes a decline in export value inevitable.  Essentially the point is that between 1990 and 1992, even during  the dynamic growth of dollar-denominated exports at current  prices, the total export volume dropped by about 7 or 8 percent.  The export volume's shrinkage accelerated in 1993: its decline  was 13 percent. On the import side, a decline similar to that of  export in 1990-1992 was followed in 1993 by dynamic growth (of  21 percent, according to official statistics). From the  preceding it is evident that, until 1992, the decline in exports  was less than in GDP or in industrial and farm output. Amidst  the economy's general contraction, that was a considerable  achievement. On the other hand, the data also show that the  switching of markets actually occurred, but at a much lower  level of export activity than in 1990. Thus, even before 1993,  the export problems had been much greater than they seemed. In  the light of the processes that took place during the preceding  years, therefore, last year's export trends are even less  surprising. Finally, the negative and positive signs,  respectively, of the development of exports and imports in 1993  make it more unambiguous how serious the tensions are that  developed in Hungary's foreign trade last year.    The conclusions that can be drawn from all this are as  follows:    1. At the beginning of the 1990's, the problems of our  foreign trade (and balance of payments) eased only temporarily,  and today they are hampering the search for a way out just as  much as they did four years ago. The only difference is merely  that the economy (GDP) has declined by more than 20 percent  since then.    2. Today and in the future, our external economic policy has  to (or should) focus on an opening to the world market. In the  short term, however, external economic policy is a function of  business-cycle policy; and the question is how the strategy of  an opening to the world market can be reconciled, if at all  possible, with a business-cycle policy that is inevitably  restrictive.    3. It is certain that a current deficit such as the one in  the 1993 balance of payments cannot be maintained over a longer  period of time. The only thing debatable about the deficit is  whether it can be reduced this year or be allowed to ride  through 1994, in which case a decision regarding possible  austerity measures would have to be made next year, in the light  of the external economic situation and the domestic developments  by that time. Sound arguments can be presented in support of  either variant. Technically--primarily as a result of our  relatively substantial foreign currency reserves and the  continuing influx of foreign direct investment--also a a  wait-and-see policy could be pursued. But if the deficit on  current account in the balance of payments continues to rise  until the elections or thereafter, we will have to reckon with  the possibility of a worsening of the conditions for obtaining  external financing, to an extent such that a more drastic  curtailment of domestic expenditure will then become necessary.  In this sense, then, we have a choice between curtailing  domestic expenditures as soon as possible, or curtailing it more  drastically later on. There is no doubt as to which option  economic common sense would support.    Yet, that is not the real dilemma. I suspect that the  restrictive stages have not really been successful either. I am  far from convinced that, when Hungarian economic policy resorted  to stimulation or restriction, it did so at the right time and  in the right way. Yet I do not think that business-cycle policy  in the narrower sense is to blame for the economy's serious  situation. Behind the external economic tensions there are  structural problems that cannot be solved merely with these  instruments.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / US banks face probe into racial lending FEDERAL banking regulators are investigating the lending records of 266 US banks suspected of having discriminated against customers from minority groups. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates a number of federally chartered banks, said yesterday the banks had been asked to reply to Washington by the end of the week. 'We have been investigating for several months and a number of banks have received letters saying we are looking into racial disparities in lending,' an OCC official said. The OCC said the mortgage lending records were being scrutinised after officials found a disproportionate rejection rate by some banks of mortgage applications from minority groups such as black and Hispanic Americans. The practice is known colloquially as 'redlining,' a term based on the notion of bankers drawing a red line on a map around neighbourhoods they do not wish to lend to. Other federal bank regulators also examining the issue include the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). If the OCC decides that a bank is guilty of discrimination it may employ a series of sanctions, ranging from administrative or civil penalties to limiting the institution's ability to expand its operations or open new branches. The Bank of Boston, one of the leading banks operating in the depressed New England economy, has claimed it will make Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of new business loans over the next five years in an effort to stimulate the region's economy. Banking analysts are sceptical, however, that the bank can fulfil such a forecast. The bank described the claim as a projection of loan demand, rather than an actual commitment to make the loans.</p>

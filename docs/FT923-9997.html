			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Bretton Woods remembered - by its last remaining star EDDIE Bernstein is squinting at the numbers on his desk-top calculator. 'Thirteen point six per cent,' he calls out. 'That's what the Russians were offered at Bretton Woods. The British got 14.8 per cent of the votes in the IMF and the Americans 31.4 per cent.' Sliding the old book back on the shelf and settling back into his chair at Washington's Brookings Institution, the 87-year-old Bernstein reflects on the combined less-than-five per cent share of the votes the 15 former Soviet republics accepted in April on becoming full members of the International Monetary Fund. 'Don't forget, Britain and France under the ninth quota review will each have only five per cent of the shares. So I'd say Russia - given its small share of trade and absence of reserves - has received very generous treatment.' A pause. 'They've gotten just about as much as we offered them at Bretton Woods.' It has been 48 years since the monetary conference at the mountain resort in northern New Hampshire, and Bernstein is the last of those taking part to remain alive and working. The wartime conference, attended by 44 nations, established the IMF and World Bank. The UK Treasury's John Maynard Keynes and US Treasury's Harry Dexter White were the visionaries behind the fund and the bank. But Bernstein - assistant to White and secretary of the US delegation - played a pivotal role. With rare immodesty, he observes: 'I, not Keynes, was the star at Bretton Woods.' White and Bernstein were the chief American contacts with Keynes in the difficult 1943 and 1944 bilateral negotiations that culminated in Bretton Woods. But White - alienated from his colleagues and often ill-tempered - was no match for the worldly, erudite Englishman. In the US delegation at Bretton Woods, it was understood that only Bernstein could hold his own against Keynes. Grudgingly, Keynes called Bernstein the hero of Bretton Woods, 'The person who made everything clear.' Keynes diary from a year earlier was less generous, though. There, the New Yorker - who insisted that key elements of Keynes' draft be modified - was a 'ghetto rat.' But Bernstein calls Keynes the greatest intellect of the 20th century after Einstein. Bernstein - who took a PhD at Harvard, wrote a highly-regarded text on money and worked as a university professor before going to the Treasury in 1940 - went on to be the first research director at the IMF, a post he held until 1958. After that, he set up his own consulting firm and made a lot of money. Finally, in semi-retirement, he went to Brookings where, as a research fellow, he continues to issue papers on such matters as US interest rates, the dollar, the Japanese surplus, and the budgetary impact of German unification. Bernstein believes the IMF has never lived up to the lofty ambitions of Keynes and White. 'It suffers,' he says, 'from having never been able to discipline its principal member, the United States.' Even now, Washington retains veto power with 19 per cent of the votes. Bernstein feels the IMF was handicapped at the start because it was overshadowed by the Marshall Plan, and that it lost influence steadily after exchange rates began to float in 1970. Until the collapse of communismm, he notes, the fund had been relegated to dealing mostly with developing countries instead of the big players in the global economy. Now, with Russia finally a member, perhaps that will change. 'This is a very big thing for the fund. They have been given a very big responsibility in guiding Russia into the world economy.' What about transforming post-communist states into market-based economies, prescriptions for which are being handed out by the fund and such academics as Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs? Bernstein is in general accord with the new orthodoxy but has serious doubts about convertibility. 'Don't forget that, after the war, the west Europeans waited 10 years to make their currencies convertible.' He believes premature convertibility is, almost certainly, a mistake. 'The first priority has to be creating a capitalist economy at home, industry by industry. Prices have to be based on costs and brought to world levels. The exchange rate should be set low enough to promote exports, but not too low.' In retrospect, he argues, the Russians could have avoided hyper-inflation by isolating the huge rouble balances the population built up involuntarily during 70 years of communist austerity. The suppressed consumer demand represented by those savings should have been absorbed by allowing citizens to buy their apartments and farms from the state. But that is all past tense. The task now, he stresses, is stopping inflation, stabilising the economy, reviving - and then boosting - exports. There is a lot of the professor left in Eddie Bernstein. He says he would give Sachs an 'F' for his assertion in a Brookings lecture that high US interest rates explain the dollar's relentless rise between 1980-85. Rather, says Bernstein, speculation drove the dollar higher; and while high interest rates might have initiated its rise, it was the enormous demand for US assets, and the expectation of further dollar advances, that fuelled the currency's upward move. Reflecting on how the world has changed in 50 years, Bernstein says it is ironic that so many of the pre-war economic ambitions of Germany's Adolf Hitler and Japan's Hideki Tojo have been realised. 'They've accomplished their goals economically and, in some cases, surpassed them.' Viewing Tokyo's huge payments' surplus, he notes that surplus countries call the shots eventually, just as the US did through the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Bernstein is, however, no apostle of American decline. Dashing to a stack of reports, he retrieves statistics showing that US labour productivity exceeds that of Germany and that US manufacturing competitiveness has improved vastly since the mid-'80s. Referring to GDP figures, he points out that the growth in the US economy in the 1980s was, by itself, a number bigger than the entire West German economy. Have events in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union put an end to Marxism? 'Yes, without doubt,' says Bernstein. 'But Marx's labour theory of value was always nonsense. Interestingly, Marx was a great believer in gold, just as Keynes loathed it. And, by the way, Keynes' thinking at Bretton Woods was shaped by the belief that a depression would inevitably result from the end of hostilities in the Second World War.' What are the lessons of the transformation process, now 2 1/2 years old in eastern Europe? 'The recent back-tracking of Poland proves that, in a democratic system, you have to back off when the social costs become too great,' Bernstein says. 'What you've got in all these countries - including the former Soviet Union - is huge repressed demand that requires prices being brought into line with costs. 'Wages have to be related to productivity and exchange rates must be set low enough to promote exports while surging imports must not be permitted to destroy domestic industries. And there has to be rapid privatisation.'</p>

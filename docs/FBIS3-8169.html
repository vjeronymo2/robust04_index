			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Army expert  for special forces, retired Colonel Stojan Jovic, has told  TANJUG that none of the big powers miss an opportunity to test  their special units under actual war conditions. He said this  in reaction to a recent report that 60 British Special Air  Service (SAS) troops were infiltrated into the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In Jovic's opinion, the SAS troops have been in Bosnia since  the beginning of the conflict, some have even been captured in  actions, but they posed as mercenaries. Jovic, a commander of  the parachute brigade for many years, said on the basis of his  long experience, that the operations preceding the  disintegration of former Yugoslavia as well as those taking  place today in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, can be  termed special war or a low-intensity conflict.    The special war doctrine originated in the U.S. in the 1960s  on the basis of its experience in the local wars in Korea and  Vietnam and the conclusion that the next war would not be a  global conflict of opposing blocs but an endless series of  limited clashes and special operations which would require  special units. All the developments in the territory of former  Yugoslavia in recent years fully fit in with the special war  doctrine, Jovic said.    The generally known special units are the British SAS, the  American Green Berets and Rangers, the Russian Spetznaz and  others.    British SAS units continue the tradition of British units  from the World War Two and subsequent local wars, and they use  their ample experience to perfect their training and operations.    The present U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, used to be an SAS  commander and participated in operations in the Falklands. Gen.  Rose has been known to Yugoslav experts because he lectured at  the Belgrade Military School in 1983.    Other countries were also preraring for operations in  Yugoslav territory, Jovic said. For instance, there was a unit  within the first batallion of the 10th group of the Green Berets  located in Bad Tolz in Germany, which was trained for operations  in Yugoslav territory even some 20 years ago. The unit included  Yugoslav emigres. There is numerous evidence that the troops of  this American special unit are now in Bosnia. Some have been  captured, and former UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia  Philippe Morillon confirmed their presence in Srebrenica.    Jovic said that some operations in Bosnia can come under the  heading of "dirty tricks" stipulated in the American special war  rules. To illustrate this, he mentioned the alleged shelling of  the presidential office in Zagreb, the massacres in Sarajevo's  Vase Miskina street and in the Markale market, the fabrication  of Serb death camps and massive rapes of Moslem women.    There is no proof for the presence of special units of other  countries in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is  obvious that these countries have taken part in training troops  of the breakaway republics, Jovic said, mentioning the training  of Slovene territorial defence officers in Germany and special  Bosnian Moslem police units in Libya.    The army of the Bosnian Serb republic, the Serb state in  Bosnia, also has special sabotage and reconnaisance units, storm  troops and anti-terrorist units. Their training and combat  experience is evident from the daily reports on routing of enemy  sabotage groups in the Bosnian Serb territory, Jovic said.</p>

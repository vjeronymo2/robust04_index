			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gad Yaacobi, ambassador to the United </F> Nations, in New York, by correspondent Jon Snow, in London; from  the "Channel 4 news" -- live]    [Text] [Snow] Ambassador, do you see this accord today as  the beginning or the end.    [Yaacobi] Yes, it is the beginning of the end of a process  which may lead towards reconciliation and comprehensive peace in  the Middle East. But it is not a time for celebrations, it is a  time for realization of the implementation of the agreement.  And the Palestinians are facing the main challenge -- to be in  charge of their lives and the municipal and civilian affairs of  their people in the territories.    [Snow] Do you think you've done it soon enough for the PLO  to be those Palestinians in charge?    [Yaacobi] Yes, I believe that we did it in a very  accelerated way. Within three weeks the implementation will be  over and at that time the Palestinians will take over and I  believe that this will be perhaps the end of the conflict  between the two peoples that has lasted for 100 years in  general, but for the last 27 years, since the six-day war.    [Snow] Now, two other very important ingredients to the  global Middle East peace -- Jordan and Syria -- have both said  that this accord will not lead to a wider peace in the Middle  East. They've both condemned it.    [Yaacobi] I am sorry to hear it because I think that Jordan  supported the whole move for a very long period of time. One  day after the Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington  DC, Israel signed with Jordan the agenda for peace which  included a mutual agreed agenda to make progress toward a peace  treaty between Jordan and Israel. But I agree with those who  think that this is not enough. First of all, we have to  implement this agreement, and the main task is that of the  Palestinians.    Secondly, we have to conclude positively the negotiations  between Israel-Syria, Israel-Lebanon, and Israel-Jordan. And we  know very well that Syria is a key state in the whole peace  process in the Middle East. And following a peace treaty  between Israel and Syria -- I believe that it is the only option  that the two states are having -- then of course other states  and neighboring Arab countries will join the peace process with  Israel and hopefully it will be within the next year.    [Snow] Well, sitting where you are in New York, briefly do  you see the Syrians actually concluding something within in the  next year?    [Yaacobi] We would like to see them doing it, because we  believe that this is the only way that the Syrians can achieve  their goals, which means having back some of the territory of  the Golan Heights, doing peace with Israel, developing resources  from the conflict into the economy and the society, and  communication and housing, and the same is relevant to Israel.  We are willing to build a new Middle East and a new future for  our people. This is what the whole story is about.    [Snow] Ambassador, thank you very much.</p>

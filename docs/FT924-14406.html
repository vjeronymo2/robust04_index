			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Sweden reveals plans for venture capital project THE Swedish government yesterday announced plans to create an Ecu1.6bn (Dollars 2.22bn) venture capital project for small and medium-sized enterprises, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The project will be financed initially from a state-run fund abolished last year which the government used to buy shares in Swedish companies. The fund, which was financed through a tax on profits, is in effect being converted into a private capital scheme in which the government will retain a 37 per cent stake. It will be owned and run by the Swedish companies that contributed to the old wage earner fund. Two main funds will be set up and operated by 150 of Sweden's large companies. Each will have capital resources of SKr2.2bn (Dollars 429m). In addition, six regionally based funds will be established with capital resources totalling around SKr400m each. They will be controlled and 89 per cent owned by around 2,600 smaller companies.</p>

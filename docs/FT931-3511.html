			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors Sir James McKinnon, who steps down as director general of the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas) in September, could soon pick up his first company chairmanship. He is replacing Sir Graham Day as deputy chairman of MAI, Lord Hollick's financial services and media group. Sir James, 63, one of Britain's more combative regulators, announced last month that he was retiring a year earlier than planned. Sir James has known Sir Ian Morrow, who has been chairman of MAI since 1974, since their days together at the Scottish Institute of Chartered Accountants - of which they have both been president. However, Sir Ian has turned 80 and now that Sir Graham has decided to relinquish the deputy chairmanship of MAI, Sir James, a former finance director of Imperial Tobacco, would seem a natural successor to the MAI chair. Sir Graham, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, remains a non-executive director of MAI. John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, is David Sainsbury's first non-executive appointment to the board since he took over as chairman of supermarket chain J Sainsbury last November. Ashworth says that the directorship 'formalises' a long-standing involvement with David Sainsbury. Ashworth is a trustee of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the two families have known each other for years. He adds that, as far as he is aware, the Sainsburys have never given any money to the LSE. Knowing 'nothing' about retailing, Ashworth, 54, says he has been recruited rather for his biological expertise with its application to food science. Starting out in the department of biochemistry at Leicester University, Ashworth subsequently became professor of biology at Essex. Before his nine year stint as vice chancellor of Salford University, he worked at Cabinet Office as chief scientist in the central policy review staff. He notes that as a Gatsby trustee he has had a hand in evolving its policy towards plant science and in helping set up the Sainsbury laboratory which carries out research into disease resistance in plants.</p>

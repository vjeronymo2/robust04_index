			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: AMR beats forecast to give lift to airline sector AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday gave a fillip to the entire US airline sector when it unveiled better-than-expected results for the first quarter of 1993, and suggested that there was a 'good prospect for much-needed profitability' ahead. AMR reported a Dollars 22m loss after tax for the first three months of 1993. This compared with the Dollars 8m profit which the company - one of the 'big three' US airline operators - made in the same period of 1992 (ahead of accounting-related charges). The first-quarter figures translated into a loss per share of 43 cents (10 cents profit). Analysts, however, had been predicting a loss of about Dollars 1 a share. AMR also made an operating profit (before interest charges and tax) of Dollars 116m in the most recent quarter, virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 1992. It said the first three months of 1992 had been fairly favourable, because Pan Am had just gone out of business leaving American as the only US carrier operating on a significant scale in Latin America. AMR is often seen as a bellwether for the US airline industry, and its first quarter figures are the clearest sign yet that domestic business is recovering in the absence of any severe fare wars. Mr Mike Durham, finance director, suggested that even if the recent fare discounts initiated by Northwest prevailed for a while, 'it would not be a bad fare for the summer'. AMR shares bounded Dollars 6 higher on the news, at Dollars 71 1/4, while United gained Dollars 9 3/4 at Dollars 149 3/4, and Delta rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 59 1/4. USAir added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 24 1/4. Ironically, just as the domestic operations look more stable, American reported mounting problems on the international front. The European operations almost certainly made a loss in the first quarter - partly, AMR said, because of recession, aggressive fare discounting, and adverse currency movements. Latin American results were also down year-on-year, although the comparison was tough because of the Pan Am situation. Overall, AMR's revenues were up by 8.8 per cent on the same period of 1992, at Dollars 3.81bn, while operating expenses increased by 9 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn. However, Mr Durham said the company still expected unit costs to be unchanged in 1993.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Personal View: Mercantilists are treading on thin ice It is starting to look as though Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has unwittinglydone the British government a political favour by banning UK bidders from public contracts in retaliation against press reporting of the Pergau dam affair. As well as eclipsing the domestic controversy over who did what in the affair, the ban has made it easier for ministers to defend their conduct by asserting that they were simply batting for UK plc in a ruthless world market. This stance may prove popular, to judge by recent letters to this and other newspapers. Business leaders have closed ranks to insist that Britain cannot afford to alienate customers who can choose from plenty of other suppliers. That companies with commercial exposure to Malaysia should seek to limit the damage in this way is understandable. However, it is quite another matter to suggest, as some have done, that export-dependent countries such as Britain can pay their way only by subordinating other priorities and principles to the greater goal of a concerted foreign sales drive. The neo-mercantilist lobby typically takes as its model Japan, whose postwar economic success it ascribes to seamless co-operation between government and industry. However, such arguments fly in the face of the very evidence adduced in their support. Not only have leading Japanese companies such as Honda and Sony thrived precisely because their exclusion from this nexus of power forced them at an early stage to seek most of their business overseas. The institutionalised collusion and indulgence of special interests at the heart of the Japan Inc. system is now exacting a massive political price, in the form of the country's biggest peacetime crisis this century. If the system has any parallel in Britain, the nearest is probably with the arms trade, where the government acts as producers' biggest customer, financier and salesman. Some may say that proves the virtues of a helping hand from Whitehall. After all, is not defence one of the few manufacturing activities in which UK companies still enjoy world-class excellence in engineering and technology? However, the industry's 'strategic' status and monopoly privileges in most countries mean international competition is as much between governments as between companies. In most other sectors, commercial risks and rewards are geared more directly to straightforward rivalry on quality, delivery and price. Few people would dispute that governments can assist by gathering information, opening doors and otherwise smoothing exporters' path in foreign markets. That is particularly valuable in developing countries, where foreign companies' credibility gains from a show of confidence by their governments. But the line between encouragement and second-guessing commercial judgments can be stretched dangerously thin if governments go much further. Beyond a certain point, moral hazard comes into play. How many bad debts have been accumulated by companies which over-zealously obeyed injunctions to export or die, in the belief that their governments would pick up the tab if things went wrong? Nor does a narrow national focus on chasing foreign orders necessarily yield the expected rewards. In the 1960s, the Duncan Report recommended that Britain's embassies abroad downgrade classic diplomatic activities in favour of export promotion, a view enthusiastically accepted by the Wilson government. Yet the following decade, inadequate political reporting left Britain wholly unprepared for the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, support for whom had been at least partly influenced by his regime's importance as a customer for British exports. But perhaps the most objectionable feature of the neo-mercantilist fallacy is the idea that successful exporting requires avoiding any action which might offend foreign governments. In its most extreme form, this comes dangerously close to implying that countries which respect freedom of expression and the rule of law should bend their principles to please those which do not. In Britain, those who believe themselves victims of libel may seek redress in the courts. Dr Mahathir has not explained why he has not yet done so. Perhaps he does not believe he would receive a fair hearing. More likely, he refuses to treat with a system so closely identified with the 'western values' which he has condemned as selfish and decadent. In this view, many individual liberties guaranteed by western-style democracy are irrelevant - if not, indeed, inimical - to economic progress. The argument is false. Hong Kong, though not historically a parliamentary democracy, is blessed with a judiciary of unimpeachable integrity, an apolitical civil service and a free press. Its population also enjoys Asia's highest standard of living after Japan. Last week, Mr Richard Li, a prominent Hong Kong Chinese businessman, told a London conference: 'The cornerstone of Hong Kong's commercial success, and its ability to create wealth-creating capital, has certainly been the existence of an independent and impartial legal system. 'Coupled with a sound administration, it has provided entrepreneurs and investors, whatever their origin, with a level playing field. It is for that reason one of the most significant contributions to Asia's development, and is very much to Britain's credit.' Dr Mahathir - and those in Britain who appear so anxious to appease him in the name of economic self-interest - should take note.</p>

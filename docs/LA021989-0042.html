			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING TO COPE WITH TOO MANY CHOICES  </P> <P> There were scary stories in the Sunday paper: "911 System Crashes," "Medicare  Costs Rising," "Jerry Brown Returns to California Politics." Scariest of all  was "Overchoice . . . Experts . . . Wonder . . . If 57 Varieties . . . Too Much  of a Good Thing."  </P> <P> Only in America would such a complaint be printed in a major newspaper. The  gist of the polemic was that the marvelous abundance of goods produced by  capitalism causes consumer stress and anxiety. The implied conclusion: These  dumb bunnies need to be protected for their own good from greedy, manipulative  marketers.  </P> <P> Who are the protectors? Why, experts! Experts like the psychologist/attorney  who sells relief from such terrible stress. Experts like author Jeremy Rifkin,  who now ventures into pop psychology to tell us that people are really  emotionally stressed over product choices. What Rifkin is selling is control  over people's lives. He wants rules. And he wants to be the rule-maker.  </P> <P> It's the rule-maker's never ending refrain: People are too stupid, apathetic,  irresponsible, to be free. They cannot possibly enjoy America's abundance. . .  .  </P> <P> It's ironic that as country after country turns away from rules and regulations  and toward free-market capitalism, aspiring rule makers work ever harder here  at home. The marketplace will cure "overchoice," if it exists, by bankrupting  products and companies which do not provide value.  </P> <P> BEN M. ENIS  </P> <P> Professor of Marketing  </P></p>

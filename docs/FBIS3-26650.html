To select and train minority nationality cadres well, we  must  first deepen our understanding and clarify the guiding ideology  and principal tasks of our work.    To select and train minority nationality cadres properly, we  must take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, put into practice  the party's nationality policies and the "Law on Regional  National Autonomy," and, closely centering around the major task  of economic construction, intensify the building of leading  bodies according to the principle of "four transformations" for  cadres--making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger  in age, better educated, and more professionally competent, to  train and foster a contingent of minority nationality cadres  who: Have both ability and political integrity, will work  honestly, and who can maintain close links with the masses of  various nationalities with a complete range of specialities and  well coordinated professions rationally formed to suit the needs  of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist  market economy. To this end, it is necessary to: Proceed from  the reality of the nationality regions, adopt effective  measures, step up training and education, and further enhance  the political and professional levels of the ethnic minority  cadres; tap the sources and increase the number of cadres for  special training in a planned way to replenish various kinds of  scientific, technological, and management personnel and improve  the structure of the ranks of nationality cadres; and to boldly  select and use fine young and middle-aged cadres of minority  nationalities, take great pains to enhance the ability of  leading bodies at all levels in nationality regions to control  the socialist market economy, and build leading bodies into  staunch collectives adhering to the party's basic line,  persisting in doing two types of work simultaneously, and having  the ability to lead building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, providing an organizational guarantee for  carrying out in-depth reform and promoting economic and social  development for minority nationalities in nationality regions.    To train minority nationality cadres well, we must intensify  training and education to comprehensively enhance the quality of  minority nationality cadres. Education in political theory must  be strengthened and education in Marxism, particularly Comrade  Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, conducted universally among minority  nationality cadres. Education in the party's nationality and  religious policies must also be carried out to further elevate  theoretical and political levels, set up Marxist concepts on  nationality and religion, consciously safeguard the unification  of the motherland and unity of all nationalities, and resolutely  resist and oppose splitting and infiltratiion activities by  antagonistic forces at home and abroad. At present, it is  necessary to carry out the decision of the central authorities  on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. We must enlist, in a planned and systematic  manner, the vast numbers of minority nationality cadres,  intermediate and senior cadres in particular, to study Comrade  Deng's works conscientiously, put in a lot of time and energy to  read the works in the original, and deeply understand and master  the strategic ideology and theoretical views on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics in a bid to enhance the  consciousness, steadfastness, and creativeness of implementing  the party's basic line. In this regard, it is also necessary to  vigorously conduct cultural, professional, and practical  training. Party schools at all levels must really undertake the  task of training cadres of minority nationalities.    In training nationality cadres, we must reinforce the  building of grass-roots cadres in nationality regions. Cadres  in townships and towns, and in township and town enterprises,  are the backbone forces of agriculture and animal husbandry in  nationality regions. Building up this contingent of cadres well  is a necessity for the reinforcement of the party's grass-roots  organizations and the state power at grass-roots level in  nationality regions. It is also a foundation for selecting  cadres at relatively higher levels. For this purpose, we must  increase the number of grass-roots ethnic minority cadres and  tap the sources for these cadres in a planned manner in light of  the requirements for economic and social development in  nationality regions.    When training minority nationality cadres, we must step up  building a contingent of ethnic minority professional and  technical cadres. In order to change from having insufficient  economic, scientific, technological, and management minority  nationality cadres, various localities and departments should,  in light of the organizational reform, select a number of  capable minority cadres suitable for doing economic work, to  receive the necessary training in a planned way and then send  them to work in economic departments or enterprises. To adapt  to the requirement to transform operational mechanisms and  institute a modern enterprise system, we must extensively search  and enthusiastically train management personnel of minority  nationalities for enterprises of various kinds and enhance their  standard in operation and management.    To train and select minority nationality cadres well, we  must  select and assign leading cadres of minority nationalities  properly. Leading bodies at all levels in the localities  practicing national autonomy must select and assign minority  nationality cadres in an appropriate manner in accordance with  the "Law on Regional National Autonomy" and stipulations in  pertinent documents. Minority cadres should be assigned work in  leading bodies in provinces, prefectures, and counties with  relatively large minority nationality populations; in minority  nationality townships and towns with a relatively large minority  nationality population; in departments closely related to the  production and lives of minority nationalities; and in  enterprises and institutions which have relatively more minority  nationality staff and workers. Attention should also be paid to  selecting and assigning minority nationality cadres to work in  various departments of state organs at the central level.    Finally, to do a good job of training and selecting minority  nationality cadres, we must stress the necessity to intensify  leadership and ensure implementation of the above measures.</p>

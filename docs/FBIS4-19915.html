			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [GGD (JPB) report: "Belgian Ships Participating in North </F> Sea Maneuvers"]    [Text] Brussels, 21 Apr (BELGA) -- Three ships belonging to  the Belgian Navy are among the 40 NATO vessels taking part in  maneuvers in the North Sea, which started Monday [18 April] and  will continue until the end of next week, a military source  revealed on Thursday.    On Monday, ships from eight countries (Belgium, Denmark,  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Great Britain, and the  United States) launched this antimine exercise, code named Blue  Harrier 94, which is scheduled to end on 29 April. The exercise  area stretches along the German and Danish coasts.  Approximately 20 aircraft are also involved, NATO revealed.    Three ships from the Belgian Navy are participating in these  maneuvers, a spokesman for the naval chief of staff said on  Thursday. The vessels in question are the tripartite mine  hunters (CMT) Aster and Lobelia -- the latter belonging to the  STANAVFORCHAN, the standing (NATO) Naval Force for the Channel,  and the minehunter/minesweeper Dufour.    According to NATO, the objective of the exercise is to train  ships' crews, harmonize multinational defensive operations, and  improve antimine procedures and tactics.    France, which has not been part of the integrated military  structure of NATO since 1967, is participating in the maneuvers  within the framework of normal training relations with its  allies, the Atlantic Alliance stated in a press release.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received this report from Travnik:    [Unidentified correspondent] The Serbian aggressor was not  honoring the cease-fire today either. In addition to day-long  artillery and small arms provocations and unsuccessful attempts  to breach our defense lines, the aggressor pounded civilian  targets in Travnik from strongholds on Mt. Vlasic early this  evening. Unfortunately, the victims were again civilians.  According to the information available so far--it is now 2245--  three persons have lost their lives, while many more have been  seriously or slightly wounded.</p>

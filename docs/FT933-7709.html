			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Germany tied by its own policies THE key to turning round the recession in Germany lies in export markets: on that, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Economics Ministry, and the country's main economic institutes are agreed. They are not sure, however, when the upturn will come, and how strong it will be. Moreover, there is a clear relationship between policies intended to tackle domestic problems and the health of Germany's main export markets. The Bundesbank's strict monetary stance, designed to stabilise inflation and maintain D-Mark stability, has been a deciding factor in the stagnation afflicting other European Community economies. At the same time, the D-Mark's strength is an important factor militating against a rapid recovery of German exports. The latest OECD report sums up neatly the arguments of optimists and pessimists. The former, it says, 'expect declining German interest rates will quickly lead to lower rates elsewhere, and thereby stimulate European activity, and hence the demand for German exports'. They argue that recent losses of export market share are due more to the high proportion of investment goods in German exports than to their price. Pessimists, on the other hand, fear that expensive German exports will continue to lose market share in 1994. They blame the rise in wage costs and D-Mark revaluation. The OECD errs on the pessimistic side: it forecasts export growth next year at 2.3 per cent, compared with 3.8 per cent suggested by the economic institutes, and the Economics Ministry's 4 per cent. That is against a background of 2.5 and 5 per cent expected growth this year and next in Germany's main export markets. The OECD suggests that higher wages and the strong D-Mark this year add 5 per cent to relative unit labour costs in manufacturing. That should subside to under 1 per cent in 1994. The report also points to important changes in the composition of Germany's balance of payments, which led to a huge swing into deficit on the current account in the aftermath of unification. Main factors were a surge in imports (largely unification-related) and more modest growth in exports. The deficit on invisibles widened for four reasons: soaring tourism payments; a drop in net investment income, as appreciation of the D-Mark meant large valuation losses on foreign assets; loss of military receipts with withdrawal of allied troops; and rising transfers abroad. The OECD is loath to criticise any German institution too openly, but it does allow some questions about the adequacy of the Bundesbank's M3 measure of money supply to creep into its analysis, and therefore some implicit questioning of the strictness of its interest-rate straitjacket. It also points out that inflation has been caused by several factors which do not respond easily to the Bundesbank's lead interest rates: tax-push effects and administrative price rises in east Germany; service sector inflation; and structural excess demand in the housing market, forcing up rents and construction costs. It urges the central bank to use all its room for manoeuvre to keep cutting interest rates. As for the federal government, the criticism is mainly of past policy failures. The OECD economists say the costs of unification were not seen in time, and the fiscal adjustment was also far too late. The solidarity pact negotiated with the federal states last March has gone some way to stabilising state spending and the rising deficit. But it relies too much on increasing direct taxation from 1995, too little on cutting subsidies in the west. The latest DM21bn savings package in the west is much more like it - concentrating on expenditure, not taxation. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the Royal Government of Cambodia" issued in </F> Phnom Penh on (?5) February]    [Text] We, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech  Hun Sen -- respectively first and second prime ministers of the  Kingdom of Cambodia -- wish to state that a valuable time has  arrived for all of you, the officers and rank and file of the  Democratic Kampuchea [DK] faction. As you are already aware,  the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have vigorously attacked and  utterly destroyed important DK positions in the Anlung Veng,  Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, and  Banteay Meanchey regions, and have completely seized the command  posts, hospitals, war materiel, and [word indistinct]. In  addition, a number of DK officers and rank and file have  deserted their ranks and either rallied to the Khmer Royal Armed  Forces or returned to the national community, bringing along a  significant quantity of documents, armaments, ammunition, and  mines.    In view of this, the Royal Government of Cambodia wishes  once  again to appeal to all DK officers and soldiers -- especially  those in the Anlung Veng and Preah Vihear regions and in the  northwest -- to return quickly to the national community as good  Cambodian citizens. You are urged to contact any KRAF unit or  the royal administration. You will be enthusiastically welcomed  by units and officials at all levels.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, (?5) February 1994    [Signed] First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh; Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS DOWN MACCABI AS TEAGLE WARMS UP  </P> <P> Taking a break from their usual exhibition fare, the Lakers bumped aside  Maccabi Tel Aviv Tuesday night, 129-106, before a crowd of 17,505 at the Forum,  but they had to stay awake later than was expected.  </P> <P> Maccabi was within 90-83 early in the fourth quarter before the Lakers went  off, sparked by Terry Teagle.  </P> <P> Teagle, three for 25 in exhibition games until then, made seven of eight shots  in the fourthquarter and finished with 21 points.  </P> <P> Aside from that, there may not be great practical application for the winners,  since Maccabi sank back in a zone defense for most of the game.  </P> <P> Donald Royal of Maccabi scored 33 points, making 17 of 18 free throws, and  teammate Ed Horton had 25 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> James Worthy added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, Byron Scott had  17 points, Sam Perkins had 16 points and eight rebounds, Magic Johnson had 14  points and 10 assists, and A.C. Green had 12 points to go with 17 rebounds.  </P> <P> The Lakers announced before the game they have signed 6-8 forward Irving  Thomas, a rookie from Florida State.  </P> <P> Thomas was impressive for the Lakers' summer league team, signed with a team in  Greece, but recently returned. He is given a good chance to make the final cut.  </P> <P> Thomas averaged 17.1 points and 8.8 rebounds during the Lakers' 10-game  summer-league season.  </P> <P> As a senior at Florida State, Thomas averaged 16.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per  game.  </P></p>

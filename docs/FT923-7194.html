			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm minister warns of 'scissors crisis' MR VIKTOR Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, said yesterday that a 'scissors crisis' of high industrial prices and low farm prices which accounted for peasants withholding grain could only be dealt with through continued subsidies and anti-monopoly measures which had not yet materialised. He said the government had tried to hold back farm prices but industrial managers, starting with producers of industrial raw materials, had been responsible for exorbitant increases that made agricultural machinery and other industrial goods inaccessible for farmers at current prices. The minister said that the only tangible result of market-reforms so far had been a change in people's attitudes. There could be no question for now of cutting back government subsidies to loss-making farms as initially planned since 'everybody was losing money' as a result of the high prices for agricultural machinery and other industrial goods. Reforms, he said, would take at least 5 to 6 years to show significant results. A significant obstacle remained continuing restrictions on the free sale and purchase of land, which prevented banks from holding land as collateral to finance improvements to it. He announced that he had obtained an alteration in Russia's privatisation programme designed to prevent monopolists resurfacing in food-processing as they had done in manufacturing industry. This gave 40 per cent of shares in privatised enterprises to employees, and allocated the rest to enterprises which supplied inputs to it. It was not clear however how this would prevent them from acting in a monopolistic fashion. Declining to give new estimates for how much imported grain would be required, he said imports would remain essential as long as Russia preserved its extremely wasteful system of using unusually high amounts of grain for animal feed because of an absence of suitable additives. He said the livestock and dairy situation was particularly worrying, and had been dealt a fresh blow from a recent increase in state grain procurement prices. The number of chickens was down 19 per cent, cows down 2 per cent on last year's level, while the overall production of meat had fallen 12 per cent.</p>

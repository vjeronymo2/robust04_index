Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said  Tuesday  [29 March] trade among countries which had opted for the  arrangement had shown remarkable progress in terms of the volume  involved.    Trade had grown from about RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1 billion  (about US$370 million) in 1989 to RM4 billion (about US$1.48  billion) last year, he told Malaysian reporters covering the  three- day summit which began Monday.    He said heads of government attending the G-15 summit felt  that the success proved that the BPA had become an effective  mechanism to promote trade among countries of the South.    Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed informed the  other heads of government attending the summit that Malaysia  would strive to get more countries to sign the BPA. So far 19  countries had signed the agreement.    On the North-South dialogue, Abdullah said all G-25 leaders  felt that it was an important agenda and they hoped that the  dialogue would benefit developing countries.    On Malaysia's proposal that academic excellence centres be  set up in G-15 member countries, Abdullah said it was not  discussed at the plenary session because the foreign ministers  had already accepted the proposal at their meeting two days ago.    He said efforts to identify suitable institutions for the  purpose would be made as soon as possible in member countries  even though several countries had still to state their views on  the proposal. The centres would be set up in countries which had  agreed to the proposal and which were ready to implement it,  Abdullah said.</p>

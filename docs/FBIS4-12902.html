			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman (Star)--Dignitaries from across the Muslim  world are gathering in Amman for a ceremony on Monday [18 April]  to mark completion of restoration work on one of Islam's holiest  sites.    Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock has received a new veneer of  gold as part of a two-year renovation project. His Majesty King  Husayn paid $8.25 million for the restoration.    The official opening ceremony is scheduled to take place at  al-Madinah al-Riyadiyah (Sports City) sport center in Amman at  11 am [0800 GMT].    After a speech from His Majesty, the covering of the shrine  will be removed and the Dome of the Rock will be officially  reopened. Due to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, none  of the attendants will actually see the Dome of the Rock first  hand. Instead, Jordan TV will transmit the unveiling via  satellite from Jerusalem in the first ever live broadcast from  the Occupied Territories. Jordan Radio will also cover the  unveiling.</p>

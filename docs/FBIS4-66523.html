			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Ya'aqov Katz: "Whither Religious Zionism"] </F>   [Text] Since the beginning of modern Zionism and, more  particularly, since the rise of the State of Israel, religious  Zionism has worked closely with secular Zionism. Mizrahi,  Hapo'el Hamizrahi, and the National Religious Party [NRP] viewed  the close ties to the secular Zionist parties as a vital  commandment to advance the central needs of the state and the  nation. Despite the differences of opinion on certain matters,  especially in the religious realm, the NRP was willing to  compromise with the secular Zionist parties in order to  establish a constructive national partnership. Even when the NRP  did not get satisfaction in religious legislation, it continued  to cooperate with secular Zionism, fully aware that this  partnership was vital and necessary for the construction of  government institutions and an exclusively Jewish way of life in  the State of Israel.    The NRP, therefore, cooperated with governments headed by  Mapai [forerunner of Labor], headed by the Labor Party, headed  by Likud, and headed by the National Unity government, as well.  The NRP representatives believed that active partnership with  the governments of Israel would increase understanding among the  Zionist camps and strengthen national life in the State of  Israel. The NRP was able to exert influence in fateful courses  of events such as on embarking on the various wars, on decisions  having to do with settlement in all parts of the Land of Israel,  on central educational, ethical, and social issues, and on the  Jewish flavor of the State of Israel. Certainly not all Israeli  governments were happy with the policy lines adopted by the NRP  in various areas, and occasionally real or imagined crises arose  between the ruling secular parties and the NRP, but most of the  time the NRP was a full and wanted partner in all Israeli  governments and was able to express the desires of the  national-religious community with pride and resolve from its  seat in the various Israeli governments.    Since the 1992 elections, it turns out that the NRP is no  longer a desired partner. The secular parties that make up the  present coalition--Labor, RATZ [Citizens Rights Movement],  Shinui, and MAPAM [United Workers Party]--have adopted an  ideological line that collides head on with that of the NRP,  representing the national-religious community. The parties in  the government coalition espouse the rights of the  individual--as opposed to the approach of the NRP, which  espouses an approach calling for realization of the obligations  of the individual to people and country. The rights of the  individual, according to the coalition parties, are divorced  entirely from his obligations to community and country, while  the NRP avers that the individual's rights flow directly from  the fulfillment of his obligations to state and community. The  contempt that the coalition parties display toward traditional  religious and social-ethical values stirs up the  national-religious community and its representatives. A  significant abyss has opened between the values that serve the  coalition parties and those that characterize the NRP as a party  representing the national-religious community. It is now clear  that anyone who is concerned about all that is dear to the  national-religious community cannot work together politically  with the secular parties that make up the present government  coalition.    It may be that the time has come for the national-religious  community and its political representatives in the NRP to do  some soul searching to find out whether it is preferable in the  present situation to exchange the historic partnership with the  secular Zionist parties for a partnership with the  ultra-Orthodox parties that are considered non-Zionist and even  anti-Zionist. It turns out that on purely religious issues there  is almost full agreement between the NRP and SHAS [Torah  Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Israel. On educational,  socioeconomic, and ethical issues there is close proximity  between the national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox  community.    The sharp disagreement that exists between the  national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox community  centers on the governmental character of the State of Israel.  There is also disagreement on central government prerogatives  such as military service and the drafting of seminary students  into the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. These are substantive,  ethical disagreements, but the sharp disagreements existing  between the national-religious community and the secular  community are no less sharp or relevant to the Jewish nature of  the country. It may be that in serious, rational, principled  negotiations between the NRP and the ultra-Orthodox parties it  will be possible to bridge the gap on various governmental  issues, which would facilitate close cooperation between the  religious parties to the point of establishing a broad religious  front.    The present emergency requires new thinking and new creative  measures to produce a unified ethical, social-religious front  that can stand up to the erosion in education, in values, and in  the Jewish nature of the country. It is worthwhile to examine  the possibility of cooperation with the ultra-Orthodox, who show  greater understanding of the needs of the national religious  community in terms of settler image and the settlements in all  parts of the Land of Israel. Recently it turns out that a not  insignificant number of ultra-Orthodox have participated  actively in the demonstrations against submission to the Arab  demands and in support for settlement on the Golan and in Judea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. It is incumbent upon the NRP  leaders to open regular channels for negotiation with the  ultra-Orthodox parties in order to achieve a unified front that  will stand tall against the secular coalition parties that are  endangering the ethical, national, and Jewish fortitude of the  people of Israel in the State of Israel.</p>

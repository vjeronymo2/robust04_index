			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS SEEK KVEA EXEC'S OUSTER  </P> <P> For the second time in two weeks, KVEA Channel 52 found itself beset on  Wednesday by 30 angry demonstrators outside its Glendale offices protesting the  Spanish-language station's alleged insensitivity to its majority audience of  Mexicans and Mexican-Americans.  </P> <P> This time, however, the demonstrators attempted to raise the stakes by  demanding the ouster of Stephen J. Levin, KVEA's vice president and general  manager. They accused him of failing to meet with them to discuss recent news  department personnel changes -- including the departure of Mexican-American  news director Bob Navarro -- that they say have eliminated Mexicans and  Mexican-Americans from KVEA senior management.  </P> <P> "Channel 52 owes an explanation to our community," said Antonio Rodriguez,  director of the Latino Community Justice Center, one of about a dozen local  political, labor and community organizations represented in the picketing  outside Los Angeles' No. 2 Spanish-language station.  </P> <P> "How is it they can say there are no qualified Mexicans to run the station when  it was Mexican administrators who got this station off the ground?" Rodriguez  asked. "That's an assault to our dignity. This is especially bad when you have  a company that benefits directly from the Mexican community."  </P> <P> Station officials said that Levin was not available for comment, and  representatives of KVEA's parent Telemundo network in New York were also  unavailable.  </P> <P> KVEA's critics claim that Navarro's dismissal was the last straw in a  long-simmering dissatisfaction with the station. The protesters criticized  KVEA's programming practices, Levin's alleged inability to speak Spanish and  Telemundo's failure to retain and promote Mexicans and Mexican-Americans such  as KVEA's former general manager Frank Cruz, who resigned in February.  </P> <P> "It seems very unfair that none of our people are in management when you have a  station which is broadcasting to an audience that is over 90% Mexican," said  protest organizer Raul Ruiz, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State  Northridge. (Recent marketing studies indicate that Mexicans and  Mexican-Americans make up 80% to 85% of the Latino population in Los Angeles.)  </P> <P> Ruiz also wondered how a general manager could run a station without having a  strong command of Spanish or broad understanding of Mexican and Latino cultural  and social realities.  </P> <P> Levin, in a previous interview, insisted that he did have a working knowledge  of Spanish that permitted him to make qualitative judgments about station  programming.  </P> <P> And Telemundo officials have previously defended Levin's efforts to restructure  KVEA's news department, arguing that improvements were needed after a recent  ratings decline. These officials have also suggested that it would be  discriminatory to insist that KVEA's news director or other senior managers be  selected on the basis of their national origin.  </P> <P> But Ruiz argued that this assertion does not stand up in Los Angeles, where the  Spanish-speaking population is overwhelmingly Mexican and Mexican-American.  </P> <P> "I know some people have tried to twist our concerns into reverse racism," he  said. "That's nonsense. It's not being racist to ask that some, not all, of our  people be hired to these positions. In fact, it's equally racist to imply that  all Hispanics are the same. It's like saying all Europeans are the same."  </P> <P> Wednesday's picketing was the latest development in a controversy that erupted  last month at KVEA's rival station, KMEX Channel 34, when more than half the  station's employees signed a petition expressing fears that Mexicans and  Mexican-Americans faced losing key programming and management jobs at the  station and its parent Univision network.  </P> <P> But the controversy changed channels last month after the departure of three  KVEA news employees, including Navarro, a veteran Mexican-American reporter who  claimed that he was fired after seven months as news director.  </P> <P> Community leaders such as Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American  Legal Defense and Educational Fund, rose to Navarro's defense and chastised  KVEA's parent network, Telemundo. About 30 university students and community  organizers picketed outside KVEA on June 5.  </P> <P> KVEA also came under fire from the National Hispanic Media Coalition, an  umbrella organization for several national and local Latino organizations,  which fired off a letter to Telemundo's corporate headquarters in New York.  </P> <P> Among other things, the coalition claimed that employment documents in KVEA's  public file show only token support of Latino community organizations.  Moreover, the letter said that the network has only one Latino on its board of  directors and no Latino directors on the board of Reliance Capital Group, the  corporate holding company that controls the network and its six  owned-and-operated stations, including KVEA.  </P> <P> "It is extremely troubling to the coalition," the letter said, "that a TV  station as profitable as KVEA would give so little in return to the community  from which it reaps its profits."  </P> <P> Telemundo officials offered earlier this week to meet with the National  Hispanic Media Coalition and the community groups represented by Ruiz. But no  date has been set.  </P></p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / European Government Bonds: Fears of fresh upheaval in the ERM GERMANY remains a safety play as tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism continue. In spite of the recent realignments of parities in the ERM, economists and analysts agree that the crisis is not over. Fear of further ERM realignments kept markets such as Irish gilts, and Spanish, Portuguese and Danish government bonds under pressure last week. The key to the survival of the ERM remains the interest rate stance of the Bundesbank. Some observers insist that it will cut rates on December 10 to suit domestic needs and EC politics ahead of the Edinburgh summit. Others, pointing to remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, insist it will continue to follow a policy of unreconstructed monetarism. Meanwhile, several European markets regained some of the ground lost on German bonds in the latter part of last week, after Germany produced the week's biggest disappointment - its poor inflation and money supply figures. Provisional figures for November showed inflation stubbornly high at 3.7 per cent for the second month in succession, with forecasts saying it is heading for 4 per cent. Money supply is growing at more than 10 per cent on an annualised basis. Analysts say that the realignments have highlighted the attractions of the stronger currencies. They say we are witnessing a decoupling of the two tiers, and that currency uncertainty is now shifting to Ireland, Denmark and France. These three countries are seeing the most dramatic changes in yield curves as short-term rates rise to defend the currencies. Ireland was only delaying inevitable devaluation, agreed bond analysts late last week. The high short-term rates introduced to defend the punt have sharply inverted the yield curve and are not sustainable. If Ireland does devalue, they say, Denmark and even France could move into the firing line. Although Denmark's latest inflation figure is one of the lowest in the EC, its trading position is becoming more vulnerable as other currencies are devalued. Denmark has suffered particularly badly in the ERM turmoil. Given its much lower inflation rate than Germany, and much better government finances, its 10-year spread of around 160 reflects entirely devaluation risk, say analysts. It could tighten significantly in the near term. Political uncertainty continues to put a question mark over France. With elections due next March, the 'franc fort' policy may be further challenged. Before Sweden devalued, there had been hopes of a French cut irrespective of German action; French franc bonds are suffering as rate cut expectations have been disappointed, say analysts. France's new problems include the possibility of its vetoing the EC/US farm accord. The margin between French and Germany government bonds, which has been fluctuating with the perceived devaluation risk, did start to narrow again to finish the week just above 90 basis points. They could tighten towards 80 basis points this week if devaluation fears subside, says Mr Michael Burke of Yamaichi. 'Whether this spread narrows or widens depends on whether the franc can be seen as a hard currency or not,' adds Mr Malcolm Roberts of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'On straight economic fundamentals, France should yield less than Germany.' SG Warburg Securities, on the other hand, argues that the spread could widen to 125 basis points as investors question the franc's status as a Tier 1 ERM currency. If it survives the present crisis, the franc could move to a narrow 1 per cent band against the D-Mark, joining the Benelux countries at the hard core of an evolving ERM, says Mr Julian Jessop of Samuel Montagu. The French yield curve continues to shadow the D-Mark and the other hard core currencies, but with higher rates at the short end to defend the currency and at the long end where there is less certainty about inflation. Looking further ahead, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, is taking what some might regard as an extreme position. He argues that while 1992 has been the year of the D-Mark, Germany's accumulating inflation problems, high public sector borrowing requirement and other factors will lead to a reappraisal and end what he describes as its near mythic status. 'Germany is very much an accident waiting to happen,' he says, predicting that the Bundesbank will at some stage have to cut interest rates dramatically. 'It will be weaker against not just the dollar but other European currencies.' Mr Burke agrees that the D-Mark could weaken, at least against the harder ERM currencies. 'The Bund market is looking overbought,' he says.</p>

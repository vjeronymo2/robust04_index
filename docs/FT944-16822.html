			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Thai state sell-offs prove to be a half-hearted business: Privatisation can mean the government retains control and will not let go When is a privatisation not a privatisation? The answer, according to critics of Thailand's half-hearted attempts to sell state enterprises to the public, is when the government retains management control over the 'privatised' company and will not let go. Thai Airways International was floated on the Thai stock exchange more than two years ago, but only 7 per cent of the company was offered to private investors; the poor performance of the shares has delayed the sale of further tranches; the finance ministry has 93 per cent. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) embarks on privatisation in the next few weeks by floating a subsidiary called Egco that will own at least one power station, but Egat will keep a controlling stake and sell only half the shares to the public. The Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT), which failed for years to provide Thailand with enough telephone lines, has contracted private companies to instal 3m new lines in exchange for a share of revenues. But the TOT and the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) maintain monopoly control over local and international calls respectively. In the oil industry, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand still controls 71 per cent of PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), the subsidiary it floated last year. Private investors hold only 20 per cent of Bangchak Petroleum, the oil refiner and distributor floated last month. 'It's not real privatisation,' says Mr Prachai Leophairatana, chief executive of the privately-owned Thai Petrochemical Industry. 'The government still holds and controls the whole thing.' Thailand has embraced the principle of privatisation since 1988, both to raise funds for heavy capital spending by state utilities and to increase their efficiency, but successive governments have been slow to implement the policy. Until now, there has been little sense of urgency. Egat, the biggest state enterprise, has increased electricity generating capacity fast enough to meet surging demand in Thailand's fast-growing economy. In other state companies, some managers are reluctant to lose control of lucrative fiefdoms or open the financial accounts of their companies to the public. Before its privatisation, Thai Airways was controlled by the air force; the company bought a bewildering array of aircraft and engines which appeared to have little to do with building an efficient airline. Civilian managers are now attempting to rationalise the company. 'Anomalies are more apparent in listed companies,' says Mr George Morgan of stockbrokers HG Asia. 'It's much easier to spot where money can be siphoned out.' He claims: 'Vested interests are woven deep' into the fabric of various organisations. Anxious about the slow pace of privatisation, the Thai finance ministry last year asked the World Bank to send a mission to Thailand to examine the issue. Mrs Manimai Vudtitornetiraks, one of the privatisation officials, says the various state enterprises and their parent ministries have been reluctant to privatise. 'I don't think we can force any ministry to do it, but we can try to pressure them,' she says. 'That is why we asked the World Bank to make suggestions. We expect to see a steady stream of privatisations but each ministry will have to make the move itself." World Bank officials are in no doubt about the benefits of selling state companies to investors. 'Massive capital need is driving privatisation,' says Mr Ismail Dalla, head of the Bank's privatisation mission to Thailand. According to Mr Dalla, the 15 Thai utilities on which the Bank concentrated its research have Dollars 94bn (Pounds 62.6bn) of capital expenditure requirements up to the year 2000. They are not badly run and can generate Dollars 41bn internally, but still need a further Dollars 53bn. 'If this financing gap is taken care of by the private sector, the government can focus on education, environment policy and welfare, which should be the role of the government,' says Mr Dalla. Apart from recommending the use of a range of international and domestic financing mechanisms to ease the strain on the Thai equity market as it absorbs huge privatisation issues, the bank has delicately suggested that Thailand should end the confusion arising from the hesitant privatisation moves made thus far. The most pressing need is for independent regulators. At present the state-owned TOT and CAT are expanding into new telecommunications markets via private concessions and acting simultaneously as operators and regulators. If the TOT and CAT are privatised, they could find themselves competing against, and regulating, their own contractors. Egat will be in a similar position in the electricity market. It would hardly be surprising if Egat favoured Egco, which it controls, over its private-sector rivals in the awarding of power contracts. Indeed it already does so, according to Mr Prachai; he says Egat will buy surplus electricity from his petrochemicals complex at a much lower price than from Egco. 'We are not aware of any country that has chosen to promote private power by creating a generating company that is affiliated with, and competes for, the purchases of its parent company,' comments the draft World Bank report on Thai privatisation. 'We recommend that the government fully divest Egco as soon as possible.' State enterprise managers and employees may balk at privatisation because they fear the loss of sinecures, but they are also tempted by windfall profits from share offerings and by big salary increases for civil servants who suddenly become executives in a 'private-sector' company. 'It is kind of tricky when you are taking away someone's toy,' says Mr Vuthipong Priebjrivat, managing director of Thailand Rating and Information Services, which assigns credit ratings to potential bond issuers. 'But once they realise they can get another, perhaps even more attractive, toy when their business expands, they get interested.' The World Bank's Mr Dalla agrees. 'A year and a half ago there was a lot of fear, especially among the employees. But after PTTEP and Bangchak I think they realise it's a win-win situation because all the employees become wealthier through privatisation ..I think it will accelerate. There are really no major hurdles in the way.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      STATUS OF PRIVATISATION STUDIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Being                                      Not Yet  Con-      On-     Com- Name of State Enterprise             Started  tracted  going   pleted  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

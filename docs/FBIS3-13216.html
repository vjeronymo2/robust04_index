			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Kuwait's permanent representative at the United  Nations, Ambassador Muhammad 'Abdallah Abu al-Hasan, has warned  against the Iraqi regime's recent maneuvres to get around the UN  Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 786, to  benefit from the lifting of the oil embargo imposed against it.  Ambassador Muhammad 'Abdallah Abu al-Hasan stressed to the  chairman of the UN Security Council, France's permanent  representative at the UN, Jean-Bernard Merimee, the need for  maintaining the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi regime as long as  that regime, which was still refusing to release Kuwaiti POWs  and detainees held in its prisons, did not recognize the  sovereignty and independence of the State of Kuwait.

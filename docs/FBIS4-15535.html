			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkmenistan stopped the supply of its gas to  Azerbaijan as of 10:00 of April 7. Until that time the rate of  supply was 8 Mn cubic meters a day. Officials of the Azerigaz  state-owned company told Interfax that the cause was that  Azerbaijan had not pay the $50 Mn it owed for supplies in the  first quarter of the year. That amount had to be paid with oil  products, machinery and consumer goods. The Azeri government  has not, however, set the export quotas.    Turkmenistan was supposed to supply to Azerbaijan 3 Bn cubic  meters of gas evaluated as $240 Mn. Since the beginning of the  year 956 Mn cubic meters have been supplied and partly paid for  in kind.</p>

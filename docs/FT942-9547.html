			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Outdoors: When the French grayling rise - Fishing In an out-of-season camping ground two men sat under the roof of a closed dance floor in a downpour. A table was spread and products of the region were arrayed; meats, cheeses, wine - le picnic: a big part of the French fishing experience. In front of us, through dripping walnut trees, sped the river, a coffee-coloured flood, carrying autumn's first leaves. The Dordogne river was, as it frequently is, a torrent. It is a happy moment when the rain stops. Through the lightening cloud came the glimmering sun. And as the air warmed, they appeared, white, black, and yellow, from the luxuriantly-vegetated valley, insects for fish to feed on. In unpropitious conditions we resorted to what the French call 'combing the water', and the English 'fishing down the pool'. The usual French method on the Dordogne is to spot rising fish and then cast to them. Our intended quarry was the grayling, a little-understood member of the trout/salmon family, which has a high and colourful dorsal fin. A grayling must rise a few times in the same place to interest Beber, my fishing guide. He is a Deep Nature man. From the larvae on the bottom of the stones he can tell the health of the water. The shadows falling through the trees give him pleasure. The strange strands of white mist carrying cool air down the opposite bank stir echoes of his childhood, spent on this self-same river. Fishing for him is not an extraction process: it is a rustic ritual in which the emotions must be thrilled to the right pitch if the catch is to be pleasurable. The grayling feeds actively in spring when fly-life emerges, and again in September, October and November to replenish the reserves for winter. Its season coincides with the times on the Dordogne when fishing is possible because the canoeists have gone home - and most attractive, because the vacated landscape is itself again. As trout fishing ends, grayling begins. Grayling country is appealing. The Dordogne near Argentat runs through oak-wood valleys. In Britain we fight to conserve our few surviving native woodlands: in France there are hills of uninterrupted natural woodland. In the valley-bottom, walnut orchards line the bank, mixed with small fields of maize, and sunflowers. Velvety-brown Limousin cattle crop rich grass. Tight building control has kept intact a homogenous native architecture that is centuries old. Stone-slab roofs with steep pitches crown fairy-tale houses with peep-hole windows. Big buildings never look big, their grey towers and high walls protruding like outcrops of rock. The rivers carry gudgeon, pike, perch and rudd. Eels and crayfish are present too. This great biomass of fish in the greenish-black river is vigorously depleted by many comers. A French fishing licence entitles you to an immeasurable mileage of fishing water for a pittance. In the Correze alone there is 5,000km of public angling water. Poaching practices are almost as numerous and complex as the regulations specifying methods and keep-sizes for different species in different regions. They include the deployment of poisonous washing-up liquid (bottles of it litter the bushes) used to kill little fish in the feeder-streams. Even the fish-filled field-drains are attacked after rain. As fast as these practitioners remove the fish, farmed replacements are tipped in. In the Correze alone 10 tonnes of large trout are introduced each year, and 600,000 small pike. Grayling are still mostly wild. To purists like Beber it is all haywire. Money spent breeding fish for anglers could be saved if the Dordogne's multifarious fishery was properly controlled. For example, if grayling were protected during their breeding season. But French fisheries are left to run themselves: the departments (regions) in central France maintain a force of only around seven fishery inspectors each. This under-muscled team spends much of its time as far from river-banks as possible, for example in the safety of the hatchery. The Correze is glorious country, from the plateau of which a huge landscape unfolds. The castles and changeless scenery give it a strangely medieval feeling. As I freed a golden dace twiddling on my line, an osprey flapped in fixed position over the water up-river and a kingfisher darted along under the opposite bank. In rural France, tolling church bells emphasise the quietness of the land. Under the trees across the way a very old man was slowly assembling his tackle. I felt part of deeply-ingrained customs on time-worn soil. Information: self-catering accommodation to suit all pockets can be arranged through: French Affair, 5/7 Humbolt Rd, London W6 8QH.

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Private health market 'may suffer' - Insurance Premium Tax The premium tax introduced by the Finance Bill could hinder the growth of the private health and creditor insurance market at a time when these sectors are being asked to fill gaps developing in the welfare state, insurers said yesterday. Neither line of insurance is among those specifically excluded from the tax, which will be imposed on most general insurance from next October. Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the Association of British Insurers, said insurers may press for an amendment to the bill. 'We don't think health and creditor insurance should be taxable. This will send the wrong signals to the public. Mr Julian Ross, product development manager with Prime Health, a specialist medical insurer, said: 'If the whole philosophy and policy of this government is to make people more self-reliant, it seems rather stupid to penalise them for taking out private medical insurance. They are effectively being double-taxed.' Medical insurers are also searching for a way around the tax, using the distinction between long-term insurance, such as life cover, which is exempt from the tax, and general short-term insurance, which is not. Bupa, the largest supplier of private medical insurance, has applied to the Department for Trade and Industry for a licence to write long-term business, for a subsidiary it is planning to set up this spring. Bupa is considering using it to write some private medical cover as long-term business, avoiding the tax. Norwich Union and PPP, which can already write long-term business in addition to conventional private medical insurance, are also considering this option. However, Mr Tim Baker, product development manager with Norwich Union Healthcare, said there were many complications involved in writing PMI on a long-term basis. At present, PMI premiums are reviewed once or twice a year. Insurers have been able to increase premiums steeply to cope with rising costs and claim levels in the past few years, but if policies were arranged over longer terms, underwriters would have to be careful to price them correctly from the start. There may also be discrepancies in other sectors. Prime Health also offers long-term care insurance to cover nursing for the elderly, written on an annually renewable basis, while all its competitors offer cover on a long-term basis. Unless it obtains an exemption, Prime Health's policies will be at a competitive disadvantage, as it has no long-term side to which to switch the business. Large corporate medical schemes may avoid most of the tax's impact by unbundling their cover into its constituent parts. Insurance - in the form of stop-loss cover - accounts for only a tiny proportion of their total premiums, while the rest is actual hospital costs, administration and so on. Lines of insurance excluded from the tax include reinsurance, large scale marine and aviation, and exports.</p>

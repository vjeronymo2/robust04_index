			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Begins New Drive To Steady Prices"] </F>   [Text] The State Council, China's cabinet, once again, in  mid-June, sent price monitoring teams across the country, to  continue efforts to bring prices under control.    Leaders at all levels should correctly perceive the meaning  of "price reform," Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said at the closing  session of a national meeting on price monitoring.    He emphasized that price reforms help establish a socialist  market economy.    He observed that some people think government will let  producers and retailers set prices freely after price reforms  are in place.    "This is totally a misunderstanding of price reform," Zou  said.    China will establish a price system mainly based on market  demand and supply, and a price readjustment mechanism supervised  by the government.    He conceded that price reforms have a long way to go,  although control on prices of most commodities have been lifted.    The vice-premier revealed that the government would continue  to adjust the prices of some essential materials and utilities  in line with market reforms. He did not elaborate.    Zou blamed profiteering, marketing of shoddy and inferior  goods and fraud for the current price rises adding that this  problem must be solved through nationwide price inspection.    Monitoring also is expected to control market price  fluctuations and prevent unauthorized price hikes.    "China's overall economy and local development will both  benefit from this," Zou told the meeting.    He called on local authorities to keep pace with the central  government, to take uniform action to curb price hikes.    "Governments at all levels must put price inspection on top  of their working agendas," he said.    He called for faster drafting of China's price laws and  regulations, prohibiting profiteering and price cheating.    The State Council at the end of March sent six price  inspection teams to 14 provinces to promote efforts in curbing  inflation.    Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10  to  May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations,  involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price  charges.</p>

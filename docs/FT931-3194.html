			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Industry welcomes export measures INDUSTRY leaders welcomed the chancellor's measures to improve the UK's much-maligned export credit system, helping businesses win contracts abroad in fiercely competitive markets. Over the past two years, recession-torn manufacturers and contractors have complained about having to compete against foreign rivals able to offer customers better terms - especially in fast-growing markets in developing countries - because their export credit is subsidised. In his speech Mr Lamont said many British companies are 'sometimes at a disadvantage in seeking business overseas'. The government had negotiated hard over the years, he said, to secure a reduction in the subsidies offered by other countries. He added that, with the increases in export cover announced yesterday and in the Autumn Statement, the annual cover for some of the fastest-growing and most important markets around the world will have increased by more than 75 per cent in just four years. The two important moves announced yesterday were: a further 7.5 per cent reduction in the level of ECGD premiums, following an average 20 per cent cut last year; additional export credit cover of Pounds 1.3bn over the next three years, on top of the total Pounds 700m increase for this year and next, announced in the Autumn Statement. The British Chambers of Commerce said the measures would be 'a major boost to exporters'. Mr Neil Johnson, director general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said the export credit measures, along with the changes to advance corporation tax and business rates, would be seen by its members as 'ticks in the box'. Commenting on the chancellor's assertion that the average level of premiums paid by British exporters next year would be down to 'around the average' paid by their G7 exporters, Mr Johnson said: 'If what he says is borne out in practice, that is a level playing field. It is good news.' Other business organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry and the Machine Tool Technologies Association, also welcomed the export credit measures.</p>

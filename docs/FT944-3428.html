			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: UBS denies wrongdoing in share vote Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday dismissed suggestions that it had done anything improper to win its board's controversial share unification proposal at an extraordinary general meeting last month. Two leading Swiss newspapers said at the weekend that the recent discovery of some large off-market transactions made during October and November in UBS registered shares raised questions about the bank's role in the market during that period. UBS confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was the buyer of 1.45m registered shares on October 28 in 'a normal options deal'. At that day's closing price, those shares were worth nearly SFr400m (Dollars 299.3m). UBS did not comment on a 2.9m-share deal on October 17 or a 946,000-share transaction on the day of the extraordinary general meeting. 'There were some transactions in the normal process of business, but we have done nothing against the law,' UBS said yesterday. Mr Martin Ebner, chairman of BK Vision, the investment fund appealing against the share unification scheme, said his BZ Bank, a market-maker in UBS securities, was not involved in any of the transactions. He suspects that UBS directors secured votes for the EGM by having the bank or its affiliates write option deals for large registered shareholders at favourable terms. Such deals would remove the risk of retaining the registered shares but leave the holder still able to vote them. Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, said at the EGM that the bank had only entered into normal agreements and fulfilled normal contractual conditions. 'In no case did we influence the vote. All larger transactions were checked by our internal auditors,' he said. In the end, the UBS board won by only 65,449 votes out of 31.6m represented at the meeting. Under its plan, the registered shares would be converted into bearer shares on terms that eliminate their extra voting power. BK Vision has obtained an injunction blocking its implementation.</p>

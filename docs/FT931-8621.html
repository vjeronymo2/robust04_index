			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Seaq to list Russian venture ONE OF the few eastern European ventures listed on a western stock market will make its debut today on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter market, and will shortly also be traded on London's Seaq International share market. Petersburg Long Distance, which owns part of an international telephone system in St Petersburg, is thought to be the only publicly traded stock which gives equity investors a straight exposure to the Russian economy. The listings on Nasdaq and Seaq International follow a move by one of the original investors to place its 29 per cent stake in the venture through Smith New Court, the London-based securities house, for Dollars 24m (Pounds 16.6m). The company's main asset is a 50 per cent holding in PeterStar, a joint venture company partly owned by the St Petersburg city authorities. PeterStar, formed last year, is setting up an international telephone service aimed mainly at other western joint ventures and tourists in the area. It will charge customers in US dollars. The company's system is already connected to St Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, and is expected to be linked to two other hotels in the next two months. It is only the second international telephone ex-change in the former Soviet Union, after Moscow's 10,000-line exchange. PeterStar chairman Mr Gordon Owen, a former group managing director of Cable and Wireless, said the project involved few technical or financial risks, and that the main risks for investors were likely to be political ones. Shares in Petersburg Long Distance, which are already quoted on the Toronto stock market, have proved volatile in recent months. Since the venture was set up a year ago they have risen from a low of CDollars 5 each to a high of CDollars 12. Earlier this week, they were trading at CDollars 9 3/8 , valuing the company - which expects to come into profit this year - at nearly CDollars 75m (Pounds 41m). The shares are held mainly by specialist funds. The venture joins a small group of Hungarian companies listed in Vienna, and just three listed funds investing in the region, as the only vehicles available to western stock market investors looking to put money into eastern Europe.</p>

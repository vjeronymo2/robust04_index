			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (15): A valuable selling point - Islamic trade finance / Demand for Islamic trade finance is set to increase significantly over the next few years as economic liberalisation measures finally take hold in a number of Islamic countries For companies selling into the Muslim world, Islamic trade finance has emerged as an increasingly available - and used - option for funding deals. Its appeal for ethical and commercial reasons to importers in 46 Islamic countries can be an important selling point. The access to funding it provides offers the potential to increase an exporter's capacity to sell into markets where other forms of financing may be constrained. It does this by tapping funds available in the Islamic banking system, which are variously estimated at between Dollars 20bn to Dollars 80bn. Islamic banking is based on the explicit Quranic prohibition on riba (interest). It, instead, puts emphasis on risk-sharing, by which the yield on a transaction is calculated on a profit-and-loss basis, with the institution which arranges the transaction taking an agreed management fee. Islamic funding has gained increasing momentum in the 1990s, especially for short-term trade credits, where the best instrument, the morabaha contract, is now an internationally accepted mode of financing. Morabaha is used to fund trade-related transactions on a cost-plus funding basis. Under this structure, the Islamic financier purchases the export from the supplier and sells it on to the importer, taking a profit (mark-up) usually close to the prevailing cost of borrowing. A market leader is the morabaha facility pioneered by the Faisal Islamic Bank of Bahrain (FIBB), a subsidiary of the Geneva based Al Maal Al Islami Trust (DMI), a leading Islamic financing group led by Prince Muhammed Al-Faisal, son of the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. FIBB reports arranging 22 morabaha syndications totalling Dollars 2.05bn in the last decade, mainly for export and lease financing for Pakistani state enterprises. Islamic trade finance encompasses a growing range of products including ijara, a leasing facility, project and equity finance, letters of credit, shipping and other guarantees, virgin trade bills and instalment sales. Moreover, istisna and salam are two types of forward contract for the sale of goods where the price is paid in advance and the goods are delivered at a future fixed date. Although mainly still a short-term instrument, there is considerable potential for Islamic financing to be used for larger contracts requiring longer term financing. Islamic banks have provided two elements of the Dollars 1.89bn Hub River power project, including a pioneering Dollars 92m istisna facility, arranged by ANZ International Merchant Banking and Al-Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation (Arabic). In this operation, the Saudi Arabian bank Arabic will buy purpose-built equipment from western suppliers through advance payment and resell it to the project sponsor, Hub River Power Company (Hubco), at a mark-up. Islamic principles are slowly being integrated into Muslim countries' trading regimes. Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, has pioneered a bilateral payments system based on Islamic banking principles for trade with developing countries such as Iran, and an export credit refinancing scheme. The relevance of Islamic instruments for selling into the Muslim world is illustrated by the increasingly active role taken by western institutions, including Citibank International, Kleinwort Benson, ANZ Grindlays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. Citibank arranged its first Islamic trade finance in Malaysia in the early 1980s. According to Atiq Ur Rebman, the bank's vice president for corporate affairs, responsible for Islamic trade finance, in 1993 Citibank's London office arranged mainly short term Islamic morabaha commodity trade finance totalling Dollars 6bn. Kleinwort Benson and ANZ arranged similar transactions, totalling Dollars 4bn and Dollars 400m respectively, also through London. Most of the financing arranged by western banks is for blue-chip European and North American corporations, bankers say. Islamic investors place funds with western banks to be invested under Islamic banking principles. Specialist banks have developed their own in-house expertise to act as the arranger matching the Islamic funds with potential users, and in some cases have established segregated Islamic banking units. The leading commercial Islamic groups include the Saudi Arabian-owned DMI, Arabic and Shaikh Salah Kamel's Dallah Al Baraka group; Kuwait Finance House and the Kuwait-based consortium The International Investor; Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB); and Dubai Islamic Bank. National markets are catered for by Islamic institutions in countries such as Pakistan, Sudan, Iran and Turkey. The Arab world's largest bank, National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia is establishing a substantial Islamic operation. Islamic banks are creating niche markets. Arabic's London office, for example, is pioneering aircraft and tanker leasing using the ijara contract. The International Investor, Al Baraka and others are developing equity funds. The largest Islamic trade and project finance institution is the multilateral Islamic Development Bank (IDB), based in Jeddah but owned by some 46 Islamic countries through equity subscriptions. The IDB has raised its capital to over Dollars 6bn in anticipation of increased demand. It already runs specialist trade finance schemes including the Islamic Banks' Portfolio for Investments and Development, which provides financing with commercial banks; the Longer Term Trade Financing Scheme, which emphasises exports of non-traditional goods; and a trade-related Unit Investment Fund. The IDB is now boosting its trade finance activity with a new subsidiary, the Islamic Investment and Export Credits Guarantee Insurance Corporation. This new institution has been advised by a London political risk specialist, Investment Insurance International, part of the Bain Hogg Clarkson group. Islamic institutions are also starting to feature in larger projects, including those requiring multi-source financing, which combine financing backed by export credit agencies, multilateral agencies and commercial banks. Examples of this include the Dollars 92m istisna and Dollars 110m morabaha facilities arranged for the multi-sourced Hub River power project. Demand for Islamic trade finance is set to increase significantly over the next few years as economic liberalisation measures finally take hold in a number of Islamic countries. It could also flourish in high growth economies such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Gulf States. Islamic trade finance, says Hussein Lawai, president of Pakistan's Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), is ideally suited to the competitive environment of the free market economy with its free trade, open capital market and minimum government intervention. Malaysia is developing a dual banking system which could form a model for systems elsewhere. This involves a conventional interest-based system and an Islamic interest-free one operating side-by-side, but not interactively. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, is encouraging local banks and the branches of foreign banks to open 'Islamic Windows' to offer Islamic products and to compete with BIMB and other Islamic institutions.</p>

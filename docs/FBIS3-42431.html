			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kirill Lebedev: "Pour in the Money, Defense </F> Industry Workers Say"]    [Text]  <H3>  It Seems the Restructuring of the VPK [Military-Industrial  Complex] Will Have to Wait </H3>   Russia truly is a strange state! Two events of the past week  make one proclaim this.    Minister of Finance B. Federov prepared a report for the  session of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers, in which  he noted that an increase in the budget deficit from 11.9 to  22.2 trillion rubles is taking shape this year. This exceeds the  gross national product by 14 percent. The nation is on the  threshold of hyperinflation.    Shortly before the session of the Presidium of the Council  of  Ministers President B. Yeltsin issued for official distribution  an ukase "On Stabilizing the Economic Situation of Enterprises  and Organizations of the Defense Industry and Measures to Secure  State Defense Orders." The reader unfamiliar with this ukase  will assume that it has to do with curtailing the appetite of  the military-industrial complex. This would be only natural,  since the minister of finance is warning of hyperinflation.  Unfortunately, the reader would be wrong. That is how it is with  us. We are moving toward hyperinflation but we do not want to  reform defense production.    First, a brief account of the measures contained in the  president's ukase. Military plants are allowed an advance on  state defense orders up to a maximum of 20 percent of the total  of annual budgeted allocations for the purchase of weapons and  military equipment. At the beginning of next year enterprises  filling defense orders are allowed to include in the basic cost  of products outlays for wages in the amount of eight times the  minimum wage; those engaged in the development of nuclear  weapons, nine times the minimum. By way of comparison, other  branches of industry are allowed to include only four times the  minimum wage.    Let us say right off that the president cut back the rigid  demands of the directors of the military-industrial complex.  They wanted not 20 but 30 percent in advance for defense jobs.  The president would go no further.    The commentators did not fail to underscore the fact that  the  president was pressured by the political atmosphere. It is not  worth arguing with the directors of the military-industrial  complex on the eve of elections, and the president understands  that full well. This is why he signed the ukase.    The restructuring of the military-industrial complex will  still have to continue, however. This unpleasant fact will not  be mitigated by statements to the effect that the economic  effectiveness of the defense industry has to be improved. It is  clear even to a person only superficially familiar with the  situation in this sector that the defense plants have never  recognized market economic principles, but have operated and  continue to operate by the rule: If you want reliable weapons,  pour in the money!    Of course, one can take comfort from the fact that  individual  defense enterprises are now doing a great deal to produce  substitutes for imported equipment, saving foreign currency for  the state, that they are in fact converting and switching to  totally civilian products. Nor can one forget that outlays for  arms production are being reduced year after year. Still, in  Russia's present situation it cannot afford outlays for these  purposes, which place a great burden on it. Otherwise, no steps  to stabilize the financial situation, over which the government  is racking its brain, will help us avoid hyperinflation.  According to the finance minister, it is even now at our front  door.</p>

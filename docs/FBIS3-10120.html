IUTE leader Luis Lara told EFE that the health, education,  roads, and public works workers, among others, will not lift the  strike until the government meets their demands. The government  workers have turned down an annual bonus of 360 quetzales  (approximately $62) that President Ramiro de Leon offered them  to lift the strike.    One union leader said, "We want our basic salaries raised,  not bonuses that will not help us resolve our economic  problems." In view of this, De Leon announced that the economic  cabinet will present a new proposal to the workers, but he  warned he will not issue currency without backing.    Finance Minister Ana de Molina said the new proposal will be  directed at the National Federation of Public Employees  (Fenasep), which is not on strike and which has been negotiating  with the government for pay raises since last week. De Molina  also announced that, beginning in March, the government will  withhold the striking workers' salaries for the days they remain  on strike.    Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the Presidency,  has admitted that the government workers' salaries are low, but  he said the government has failed to raise the salaries not  because it does not want to meet their demands, but because  there is no money.    In addition, Alberto Villar, a leader of the National  Federation of Unions of Guatemalan Government Workers (Fenasteg)  told EFE that some 70,000 Fenasteg workers have lifted their  strike to give the government a chance to reconsider its  position. Villar warned, however, that if De Leon refuses to  discuss their demands, the organization does not rule out the  possibility of calling for another nationwide strike to pressure  the government. "We are waiting for the government to invite us  to negotiate the pay raise," the union leader said. He added  that, although the strike has been partially lifted, the demand  for a 40 percent pay raise stands.    The strike was also called to reject the government's plans  to privatize several public institutions, such as the electric  energy sector and hospitals, and to demand a larger budget for  education and health.    Villar said the president so far has not shown political  willingness to resolve the labor crisis in the government. He  said his group plans to demonstrate in Guatemala City today to  demand serious talks with De Leon who, nevertheless, has advised  he will not sit down to talk without any sector because of  pressure. The president has also rejected the mediation of the  Catholic Church and the Central American Parliament in seeking a  resolution to the labor crisis.</p>

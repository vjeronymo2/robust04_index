			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / DGB backs part-time working The German government is not doing enough to encourage part-time work, Ms Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy head of the trade union federation (DGB), said yesterday. Ms Engelen-Kefer said the current arrangements for part-time work are not flexible enough, particularly for women with families. Last June Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported a plan to privatise more of the state sector, cut unemployment benefits after a certain period of time, and introduce more part-time work as a means of cutting unemployment. But Ms Engelen-Kefer said the legal basis for part-time work, including insurance, health and pension schemes, was inadequate. Recent studies have shown that more than 2.5m Germans would prefer to work part-time. About 15.5 per cent of the labour force already works part-time, most of whom are women in low-paid jobs.</p>

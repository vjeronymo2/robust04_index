			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 28 May (EFE) -- Uruguayans will have the  opportunity to vote on 29 November 1994 in the national  elections and also for three constitutional reform projects. Two  of these projects were made known this weekend.    The first project, which was approved by an ample majority  in  Congress, foresees national elections being held separate from  municipal elections.    Of the two other projects, which were promoted by teachers  unions through the popular mechanism of obtaining 10 percent of  the signatures of those who figure on the election lists, one  calls for a clause in the Constitution to oblige the government  to set aside 27 percent of the national budget, or 4.3 percent  of the GDP, for the educational sector.    The second seeks to prevent any modifications to the pension  and social security system, which is now in the hands of the  state, to avoid future privatizations.    If the proposal to improve the educational sector receives  the required 1.2 million votes, the budget for education will  increase from $380 million to $600 million.    The project for reforming the educational sector obtained  430,000 signatures, which must now be checked by the Electoral  Court, while the pension and social security project obtained  280,000.    A minimum of 230,000 valid signatures of citizens registered  to vote, 10 percent of those who are registered at the electoral  offices in accordance with the Constitution, are needed to  request a constitutional reform.    The presentation was made on the last valid day and  Electoral  Court President Juan Carlos Furest has said the court "now faces  a dramatic situation due to the volume of last minute projects  for constitutional reform."    The Electoral Court must now organize the election, and  control and verify some 700,000 signatures.    Furest explained that these tasks surpass the physical  capability of the Electoral Court.    He said the 1,500 Electoral Court employees have just  finished the slow process of registering new voters and are now  purging the registers of the balloting places where more than 2  million Uruguayans will vote on 19 November.    The cost of the elections, which has been estimated at $5  million, will increase due to the simultaneous voting.    Furest stressed that the Electoral Court will carry out its  task and comply with the Constitution, but added that it will  not be easy to double the work of the employees, who are working  between 10 and 12 hours a day.</p>

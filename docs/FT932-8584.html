			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese Life and non-life insurers to announce 1992-93 results Japanese life and non-life insurers, which announce their 1992-93 results next month, will disclose problem loans for the first time, although on a much smaller scale than those of Japanese banks, for the year 1992-93, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's biggest life insurer, said it may have about Y20bn (Dollars 180m) in problem loans at end-March 1993, or about 0.2 per cent of loans then outstanding. Of these, Y5bn were in bad loans to clients who had gone bankrupt and Y15bn in non-performing loans on which interest payments were in arrears for six months or more. The five big insurers, including Dai-ichi Mutual Life, Sumitomo Life, and Nippon Life, each appear to have problem loans totalling less than Y50bn.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton aims to bushwack US agricultural vote - The candidate's Midwest campaign BILL CLINTON, the Democratic candidate for US president, is doing all he can to ensure that he reaps a bumper harvest of votes on the Farm Belt. Recognising that the Midwest could be key to victory in November, he has promised more effective management of the US Department of Agriculture, support for ethanol (vegetable-based fuel oil), and tough action against overseas protectionism. Last weekend in Iowa, the governor was able to capitalise on widespread disaffection for President Bush, whose heavy-handed largesse - particularly an announcement of Dollars 1bn in export subsidies, which came too late in the growing season for the benefit of most farmers - and reluctance to retaliate against the protectionism of the European Community has left him vulnerable. Mr Clinton promised farmers what all candidates must - higher prices - to be achieved through 'decent supply management' and 'a vigorous opportunity to export'. 'We can do better than corn (maize) and soyabean prices going down,' he said. 'We can do better than declining farm incomes and better than a Farm Bill that has been mismanaged by people who never wanted to see it work.' More importantly, his support for ethanol came at a time when - to the disgust of farm lobbyists - the White House is torn by indecision over demands for the inclusion of ethanol in a federal programme requiring the use of cleaner fuels in the nation's smoggiest cities. Its inclusion could give a big boost to a struggling industry, raise demand for maize and decrease American dependence on imported oil. Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency says ethanol emits chemicals which contribute to smog, and the oil industry - with its many Bush backers - has joined forces with environmentalists against ethanol. While the White House remained unable to resolve its dilemma, Mr Clinton promised to find a way to use ethanol 'as a part of our nation's energy security future.' An adviser in his campaign said additives could be used to blunt the effect of ethanol on smog. Without actually saying that he would retaliate over the EC's oilseed subsidy - a case farmers view as having dragged on for years too long - the governor indicated that foreign policy considerations would not stop him from imposing sanctions to open markets. 'Trade barriers cost our oilseed producers Dollars 2bn,' he said. 'The law today gives George Bush the weapons he needs to level the playing field, but he always puts them in mothballs.' He also took aim at the EC for its ban on US pork 'on the flimsiest of excuse' and the president's early failure to approve export subsidies for pork to Russia. He vowed support for biotechnology to develop products made from US-grown commodities - biodegradable plastics, soyabean-based inks, industrial oils, lubricants and biofuels. 'We can drive up incomes and profits for decades to come and create businesses that will stay in smaller communities,' he said, 'if we have a little vision and the kind of research and development and technology-spreading we need.'</p>

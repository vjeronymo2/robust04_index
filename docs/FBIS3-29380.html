Masahito Tani, deputy minister for policy coordination, who  returned Thursday from a trip to the U.S. for talks on the phone  issue, also said the U.S. was vague on its argument that Tokyo  breached a bilateral 1989 accord on boosted foreign access to  Japan's mobile phone market.    In his talks with deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene  Barshefsky, the U.S. side declined to specify which parts of the  accord Japan has failed to fulfill, Tani said.    Citing Japan's perceived breach of the pact, the U.S.  announced Tuesday its plans to impose sanctions against Japan, a  move apparently prompted by the breakdown of the bilateral  "framework" trade talks last week.    Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and  telecommunications, told a separate press meeting that Japan has  little to do to avert the threatened U.S. sanctions.    "We have done what we could, but the U.S. says we have  breached the accord. I doubt there is anything more we can do,"  he said.</p>

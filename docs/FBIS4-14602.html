			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 1 Apr -- The Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR] advocates cooperation with Japan, and Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy "is not planning any aggressive actions vis-a-vis  that state." This was stated to ITAR-TASS today by Yevgeniy  Bolshakov, State Duma deputy from the LDPR, who was the first  representative of this party to visit Japan at the invitation of  the Foreign Ministry as a member of the Russian parliamentary  delegation. The delegation has left for Moscow today after its  week-long stay here.    The deputy said that of all political forces of Japan, the  LDPR would like to maintain contacts with the LDPR. The program  of the delegation had included a meeting with representatives of  that party, which used to be the ruling party in Japan.  Yevgeniy Bolshakov believes that in the course of this meeting  "certain mutual understanding of the commonality of partisan  interests of factions of both parties in their respective  parliaments" was achieved. "Of course one cannot say that the  two parties are alike, but it appears that the LDPR and the LDP  of Japan have common concerns," he believes.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had extended invitations, via  Bolshakov, to the leaders of the LDP of Japan to visit the  congress of the Russian party which begins on 2 April in Moscow.  However, ITAR-TASS was told in the headquarters of the LDP of  Japan that no official document inviting party leaders to the  LDPR forum in Moscow had been received, and doubt was expressed  as to the feasibility of receiving it before the start of the  congress.    Asked whether the LDPR leader was planning to make a  personal  appearance in Tokyo, Yevgeniy Bolshakov said that Zhirinovskiy  probably intends, in principle, "to take a closer look at  Japan;" however, there are too many acute problems at home, and  at least "April and May have been fully booked in his political  diary."</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland to step down next year Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, confirmed yesterday he would not be a candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation due to succeed Gatt next year. The announcement, in a statement issued from Gatt headquarters in Geneva, came as no surprise. Mr Sutherland, a former Irish attorney-general and EU competition commissioner, was pressed to take the Gatt job last year to see the Uruguay Round of trade talks to a successful conclusion. But, that mission achieved, he has made clear for some time that he wished to rejoin his family in Dublin. Mr Sutherland, who was 48 yesterday, has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Jacques Delors who steps down from the presidency of the European Commission at the end of the year. However, the Gatt chief has consistently denied any interest in the post. Before going to Geneva, Mr Sutherland was chairman of Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's biggest bank, and held a range of company directorships. Trade officials have already begun to speculate on Mr Sutherland's successor. The job has up to now been monopolised by Europe - Gatt's three previous director-generals were British and Swiss. However, Mr Sutherland faced energetic competition from three Latin American candidates last year and Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, is one name already doing the rounds. Developing countries, which comprise three-quarters of Gatt's 123 members, believe they have a strong claim to the WTO's top job. The IMF and the World Bank are run by a European and an American respectively, they point out. However, Japan too is under-represented in Gatt and could well field a candidate this time.</p>

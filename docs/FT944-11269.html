			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Institutional buyers drive trend towards global deals - International issues News that the number of overseas listings on the London Stock Exchange so far this year doubled during October is further evidence of the internationalisation of the equity capital market. Although the numbers are small, with the five newcomers to London listings raising Pounds 146m in October, one of them was Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications giant which, with a total capitalisation of Dollars 138bn, is the biggest company in the world. The desire by companies in emerging markets to access international capital was shown by the growth of Indian groups listing in London, since the regulations for the listing of global depositary receipts were changed in August. New Indian GDRs now listed in London include: East India Hotels; Shriram Industries, the food oils group; JK Corp, the copier/airmail group; and Bajaj Autos, the scooter and motorcycle group. Overall companies - mainly from the emerging markets - have raised more than Dollars 11bn since the birth of the GDR in 1990, with Dollars 5.5bn of that raised so far in 1994. While lagging far behind the world's bond markets, equity markets are rapidly becoming more international. A further small example of this is the vendor placing on Friday by Forte, the UK hotel group, to pay for Meridien, the French hotel group. Forte won control of Meridien earlier this year, defeating Accor of France, and used Forte shares to pay for the acquisition. Since Forte wanted to broaden its global shareholder base, it turned to UBS and Paribas, the European bank, to place the shares internationally. 'It is attractive to have our equity in the same place as our assets,' said Mr Richard Power of Forte. Two other equity issues being prepared for launch also highlight the tendency towards the globalisation of equity. BSkyB, the satellite television broadcaster, and TeleWest, the UK cable television and telephony operator that has two US parents, are both thought to be planning roadshows in the UK and US and listings in London and New York. A report published last Friday by the McKinsey Global Institute, the consultants, addresses the same issue. It says: 'The equity markets have been slower to globalise than the foreign exchange or bond markets. Significant differences in valuation still exist across different national equity markets even for comparable companies in identical industries.' While the daily volume of global foreign exchange markets is about Dollars 1,000bn a day and that of government bond markets Dollars 200bn a day, the total daily volume of all the world's stock exchanges is only Dollars 23bn a day, the report says. However, globalisation of equity markets is now being driven by institutional investors, who are rapidly increasing their mix of international equities in their portfolios. This globalisation is also helped by liberalisation of regulations, advances in technology, securitisation and the use of derivatives, says the report. Growth in the global capital market will also mean more integration. The report says financial assets are 'beginning to act as if they were part of a single, integrated market that links together the foreign exchange markets, money markets, bond markets and equity markets'. But for the bankers at UBS and Paribas, who shifted Pounds 175m of shares within four hours on Friday, the global market is already here.

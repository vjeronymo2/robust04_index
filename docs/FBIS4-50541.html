			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today ordered peacetime draft registration and the  selective service system to be continued, said the White House.    "It is essential to our national security to continue draft  registration and the selective service system (SSS)," Clinton  wrote in letters to Congress, said White House spokeswoman Dee  Dee Myers in a statement.    Clinton argued that the SSS and the registration provide "a  hedge against unforeseen threats and a relatively low-cost  `insurance policy' against our underestimating the maximum level  of threat we expect our armed forces to face."    "Terminating the SSS and draft registration now could send  the wrong signal to our potential enemies who are watching for  signs of U.S. resolve," he warned.    He added that "it is increasingly important" to maintain the  link between the all volunteer force and the U.S. society at  large at a time when fewer and fewer people have direct military  experience.    In January, Clinton ordered the National Security Council to  review the policy.    The process involved representatives from the Office of the  Secretary of State, the Pentagon inspector general and the  Office of Management and Budget and SSS.    The decision, in effect, rejected a Pentagon conclusion  earlier this year that ending draft registration would pose no  risk to national security.    Clinton also urged lawmakers to support the administration's  1995 budget request of 23 million dollars for the SSS.</p>

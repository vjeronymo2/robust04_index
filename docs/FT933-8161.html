			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: US sentiment positive in wake of bullish data LONGER-DATED US Treasury securities continued to post solid gains yesterday as sentiment in the bond market remained positive in the wake of recent bullish data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  19/32 at 99 1/4 , yielding 6.304 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/2 , to yield 3.964 per cent. Bonds firmed from the opening, although traders said the gains were more a reflection of the lack of selling rather than the presence of heavy buying. The morning's economic news had little impact upon prices. The 0.4 per cent increase in July industrial production was in line with forecasts, although the rise in capacity utilisation to 81.5 per cent was smaller than expected. Analysts said the data confirmed that the manufacturing economy remains subdued, and that overall growth this year would struggle to break 2 per cent. Otherwise, the main feature of the day was some technical yield curve-flattening trades, which involved buying longer-dated Treasuries to shrink the gap between yields at the long and short ends of the market. The long bond was also helped by the fact that last week's auction of Dollars 11bn 30-year bonds will be the last such auction until next February. UK GOVERNMENT bonds, which ended last week on an enthusiastic note, came down to earth yesterday, with longer-dated issues closing nearly 1/4 point lower. Friday afternoon saw a sudden rally in gilt prices following an announcement by the Bank of England that it would not be holding a gilt auction this month. There had been plenty of speculation last week that the Bank might still hold an auction in August, even though it is well ahead with the government's borrowing programme: the announcement that this month's auction would not take place helped to boost the market and the Liffe gilt futures contract closed at 113.09 on Friday. However, the euphoria did not last in yesterday's trading as the market appeared to be overbought, and the futures contract touched a low of 112.29 before trading at around 113.00 by late afternoon. One economist pointed out that, even though the Bank is not holding an auction this month, the market could still see further new supply, albeit in tap form. The market's main focus of attention this week is likely to be the Retail Price Index figure, which is expected to show a rise to about 1.4 per cent in July, compared with 1.2 per cent in June. The RPI will be announced tomorrow. GERMAN government bonds fell sharply in afternoon trading, partly due to heavy selling by US investors. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 97.56, quickly rose to its high of 97.63 yesterday morning and then drifted for much of the day. But heavy selling in the afternoon took the futures contract down to a low of 97.15 where it ended the day. Bund market participants expect the Bundesbank to announce its M3 money supply figures for July sometime this week. However, dealers warn that the figures are likely to be distorted because of heavy intervention by the central bank during the recent bout of currency turmoil. JAPANESE government bonds ended lower on the day, despite the combination of a strong yen and a fall in money market rates. The bond market started off on a relatively firm note as some market participants believed that the sharp fall in prices on Friday had been overdone. The yen reached a new post-war high against the US dollar of 101.10 in Tokyo trading and strengthened still further to 100.80 in the London trading session. But dealers said the yen's strength did little to boost the bond market. In the money market, the rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell to a record low of 2.96 per cent, from 3.0 per cent on Friday. The Bank of Japan did little to mop up excess liquidity, dealers said, raising expectations that the central bank may cut its Official Discount Rate fairly soon. The December futures contract, which opened at 111.31, rose to a high of 111.43 and closed at 110.90, only slightly down from Friday's close of 110.95.</p>

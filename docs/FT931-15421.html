			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Recovery at Howden continues with 4% rise HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern that was brought low by a Danish tunnelling contract, continued its recovery in the first half of the year. Pre-tax profit rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 6.05m (Pounds 5.81m) in the six months to October 31 after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m, the final loss on the infamous Great Belt contract for four tunnelling machines. Last month's settlement of the long-running dispute with the client, MT Group, helped the shares rise from 34p in mid-October to 67p ahead of the results. They eased 4p yesterday on profit-taking. Operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 9.9m on sales of Pounds 156.2m (Pounds 138.3m). Earnings per share, affected by a Pounds 30.6m rights issue in 1991, slipped back to 1.8p (2.2p). Mr Ronald Watson, finance director, said the growth came from a healthy opening order book of more than Pounds 300m and from overseas business, which accounted for roughly 60 per cent of sales. The largest division, air and gas, had shown a strong profit increase. Construction and mining, however, had been held back by delays on big contracts such as the Jubilee underground line in London and a project for British Coal. These two contracts, plus delays on a power station for Iran, lay behind a reduction in the order book to less than Pounds 300m by the half-way stage. Interest costs fell from Pounds 3.31m to Pounds 1.39m. Debt rose from Pounds 24.9m to Pounds 40m after Pounds 6m of spending on acquisitions and the translation impact of sterling's devaluation. Mr Watson said payments from MT and working capital improvements had brought debt down to Pounds 32m by December 31 and it should fall below Pounds 30m - giving gearing of less than 30 per cent - by the year-end. The interim dividend goes up to 0.75p (0.7p). COMMENT After the Great Belt horror story - it trebled debt to Pounds 76m and nearly wiped out profits in 1990-91 - it is a relief for Howden to return to the normal level of uncertainty that surrounds contracting companies. The order book could do with confirmation of some of the big delayed contracts, although overheads have been cut in the meantime. There is also some uncertainty overseas because of the downturn in Germany. With the second half traditionally stronger, Howden is forecast to hold pre-tax profit at about Pounds 18m for the full year, giving a prospective p/e of nearly 12. The absence of the Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge lays the basis for resumed earnings growth of perhaps 15 per cent next year, although the late-cycle nature of the business keeps the outlook tough. Contracting uncertainty and MT memories lie behind its discount to the market. After a good run, the price looks about right.</p>

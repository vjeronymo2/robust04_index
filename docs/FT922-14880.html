			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television In an election campaign notable for backbiting and boredom, C4's Star Chamber has been providing something a little out of the ordinary (6.00, repeated at 2.30 am). Politicians are 'interviewed' by a pair of 'computers' which exploit the old nice/nasty police technique. A female machine asks a mixture of nice soft questions ('Who is your favourite sex symbol?') and more conventional political questions ('Why should the electorate trust your party with the NHS?') while her male counterpart inserts nasty supplementaries ('How do you square that claim with this clip?'). If the male machine were even tougher and nastier, the series, which is surprisingly revealing, would be even better. Julian Pettifer begins a new series of Nature (8.00 BBC2) with a consideration of European legislation designed to control 'green' claims for items on supermarket shelves. C4's Short Stories (8.30) investigates a course run by British Airways for those frightened of flying. Fay Weldon's drama serial Growing Rich (9.00 ITV) about three young women who become involved with the devil reaches its final episode.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Lecturers walk out over contracts More than 800 lecturers went on strike yesterday at Sheffield College, the country's largest further education college, as the dispute over government-backed 'flexible' contracts escalated, John Authers writes. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, has withheld Pounds 50m from college budgets until the new contracts are introduced. The government believes the contracts are necessary if the growing demand for flexible training courses is to be met. Members of the Natfhe lecturers' union at Sheffield College, which has more than 850 lecturers on six different sites, plan to strike for a total of five days. The lecturers say the new contracts include no limits on working hours. Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe negotiating secretary, said union branches at more than 100 colleges were holding strike ballots and predicted that most would lead to strike action next month. Two other unions with fewer members in the sector, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the Association of College Management, have agreed to the contracts, which offer a one-off payment of Pounds 500 for longer hours and a 50 per cent cut in holidays.</p>

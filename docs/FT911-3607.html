			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Flat showing as FR dips to Pounds 21.3m - Worldwide defence cuts and project delays take their toll FR GROUP, the aviation products group which makes 65 per cent of its sales in the defence sector, reported flat profits and earnings for 1990. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 22.6m), on turnover of Pounds 169.2m (Pounds 153.8m). Earnings per share came to 20.07p (20.75p). The final dividend is unchanged at 4.14p maintaining the total at 6.37p for the year. The results came against a worldwide background of cuts in defence procurement. They were also specifically affected by losses at WES, the con-tainers and general engineering division. Without these, profits would have been slightly ahead, said Mr Giles Irwin, finance director. He said FR had now 'taken the knife' to WES, which had been integrated into Flight Refuelling, the dominant air-to-air refuelling pod division. Mr Irwin said this division put in a good performance as did the other larger operations - notably FR Aviation, which provides training and maintenance to the military. However, group performance had been, and continued to be, affected by delays in sizeable projects. Supplies of refuelling pods to the US airforce, for instance, had been delayed owing to a change in specification. There had been cost overruns on the Phoenix air vehicle project where GEC is the main contractor. Mr Irwin said the Gulf conflict had produced a 'number of small value items' for FR but nothing significant in a group context. COMMENT The long-running sore of delayed contracts continues to trouble FR along with other companies in its sector. The current year is promising no relief from the complaint, especially ahead of the white paper in June, which is expected to clear up deep uncertainty about how big the British armed forces are going to be in the future. That means FR is set to complete its third year of broadly flat profits, perhaps making no more than Pounds 20m pre-tax. This puts the shares on a prospective p/e of about 8.5 while the yield is some 5 per cent. The shares are well down on levels achieved at the start of last year but still look fully-valued for the moment at 160p. It is reasonable to expect a recovery in 1992; but there is no near-term relief for long-suffering investors who have now been waiting for four years for FR to recover the momentum of its earlier career.</p>

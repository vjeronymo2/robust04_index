Chea Sim, chairman of the Kingdom  of Cambodia [KC] National Assembly, led a high-level KC National  Assembly delegation on an official friendship visit to the LPDR  from 5 to 7 March 1994.    During their visit, Samdech Chea Sim and delegation paid  separate courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and H.E.  Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime minister of  the LPDR.    During the courtesy calls, H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan stressed  that Lao-Cambodian ties consist of fine relations of friendship,  fraternal solidarity, neighborliness, and comradeship. The  traditional fine relations and cooperation between the two  countries have existed since ancient times. The peoples of the  two countries have practiced similar customs and traditions,  ardently given support and assistance to each other, and shared  weal and woe both during the periods of struggle against  colonialism and neocolonialism and of national defense and  national construction in each country. H.E. Khamtai Siphandon  regarded that in the new period, there is a need to further  strengthen the long-standing traditional relations of  friendship, solidarity, and multifaceted cooperation between the  LPDR and the KC in coordinating with each other to improve and  readjust the forms and methods of cooperation for better harmony  and higher efficiency for the immediate and long- term common  and individual interests. This will ardently conform to the  ever-increasing strong aspirations of the peoples of Laos and  Cambodia in building their respective countries with peace,  national independence, and prosperity.    The receptions and conversations between the hosts and  guests  were permeated with an atmosphere of profound friendship from  beginning to end.    Samdech Chea Sim and delegation laid a wreath at the  Monument  of Unknown Combatants and visited many places of economic and  cultural significance in Vientiane capital and Vientiane  Province. Wherever Samdech Chea Sim and delegation visited,  they were given a warm and intimate welcome by the local  administrations, authorities, and Lao residents.    A meeting between the KC National Assembly delegation headed  by Samdech Chea Sim and the LPDR National Assembly delegation  headed by H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket to exchange views on the  situation took place at the Lao National Assembly in Vientiane  capital in an atmosphere of friendship, sincerity, and mutual  understanding. At the meeting, the two sides informed each  other of outstanding situations in their respective countries  and exchanged views on the strengthening of relations and  cooperation between the two countries and between the two  legislative organizations. They exchanged views on regional and  international issues of mutual interest. The Lao side regarded  that the official friendship visit by Samdech Chea Sim and  delegation constituted a gesture of historic significance,  contributing to strengthening and multiplying the intimate,  normal relations which have existed since ancient times between  Laos and Cambodia. At the same time, it also wholeheartedly  hailed the increasing achievements of the implementation of the  Paris agreement, which is the process of achieving peace and  national reconciliation in Cambodia; as well as the successful  National Assembly elections; the endorsement and promulgation of  the new Constitution; the revival of the constitutional  monarchy; the return to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia by  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk who has played the supreme, historical  role in realizing the unification, peace, political stability,  national reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction; and  the establishment of the Government of the KC.    The Lao side highly assessed the role of the KC National  Assembly in the process of national reconciliation and in  developing and building the KC into an independent, peaceful,  neutral, nonaligned, and prosperous country.    Samdech Chea Sim and delegation hailed the great  achievements in various fields made by the Lao Government and  people, noting that such successes have been scored thanks to  the policy of principled and all-around restructuring under the  clear- and far-sighted leadership of the Lao People's  Revolutionary Party. He also hailed the role of the LPDR NA in  building and broadening the popular democratic regime, carrying  out socioeconomic development, and pursuing the broad foreign  policy of peace, independence, friendship, and cooperation,  thereby ardently contributing to turning Laos into a country of  peace, independence, democracy, unification, and prosperity.    The two sides expressed satisfaction with the traditional  fine relations of friendship which have continued for centuries  and have thus been worthy of being good-neighborly countries  which have practiced cooperation in many fields. They see a  need to incessantly multiply and increase such relations and  cooperation on the basis of the principles of respect for each  other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;  noninterference in each other's internal affairs; refraining  from the use force and coercion; resolving all problems between  the two countries peacefully; cooperation; equality; and mutual  benefits. They regarded the exchange of visits of the high-level  delegations headed by the prime ministers of the two countries;  the Laos- Cambodia joint statement issued in July 1993; and the  Laos-Cambodia joint declaration and the agreement on economic,  scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation between the two  countries signed by the two governments in Phnom Penh in  November 1993 as very significant to the relations and  cooperation between Laos and Cambodia in the new period.    The two sides were unanimous in planning to set up a  friendship association between the LPDR National Assembly and  the KC National Assembly to exchange delegations at various  levels, and to assist each other in the sphere of legislative  work on a regular basis.    The two sides share a common aim of establishing close  relations and cooperation with the legislative institutions of  other countries in the region and the Interparliamentary Union  to contribute to turning Southeast Asia into a region of peace,  friendship, and cooperation.    The Lao side expressed extreme appreciation with the success  of the visit to the LPDR this time by Samdech Chea Sim and  delegation, terming it a new glorious milestone in the history  of relations between the two legislative institutions as well as  the two countries.    Samdech Chea Sim and delegation highly valued the success of  the visit and expressed profound thanks to the Lao National  Assembly and people for having accorded an intimate welcome  filled with a spirit of fraternal warmth and good neighborliness  to the KC National Assembly delegation during its official  friendship visit to the LPDR. On behalf of the KC National  Assembly, Chairman Samdech Chea Sim extended an invitation to  H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the LPDR National Assembly,  and delegation to pay an official friendship visit to the KC.  The chairman expressed his thanks to Samdech Chea Sim and  accepted the invitation with pleasure. The time and date of the  visit will be notified to the Cambodian side through diplomatic  channels.    [Dated] Vientiane, 7 March 1994</p>

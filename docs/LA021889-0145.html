			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANCH MARKET FOUNDER IN BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Jon Hubbard, founder of the Irvine Ranch Farmers Market chain, has filed for  personal bankruptcy, listing total debts of about $2,645,000.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, shows  assets of $7,900 in cash. "He's got his clothes and his furniture," said  Hubbard's bankruptcy lawyer, William C. Starrett II.  </P> <P> Hubbard's 12-store, upscale grocery chain filed for protection from creditors  in July, listing liabilities of $17.5 million. The Costa Mesa-based chain was  bought in September by a group of investors led by Daniel Bobroff, owner of  Chalet Gourmet in Hollywood.  </P> <P> According to Starrett, creditors are likely to get "zero" from Hubbard. "It's  all over. They're going to have to get (anything recovered) out of Irvine  Ranch," Starrett said, because Hubbard "put everything he owned into the  market."  </P> <P> Hubbard could not be reached for comment Friday. He is managing the chain's  Costa Mesa store. MARY ANN GALANTE  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / North Korean nuclear crisis deepens The crisis over North Korea's nuclear capabilities deepened yesterday as the US said it was increasing its intelligence efforts to prepare for the possible use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang. President Clinton met with senior defence and foreign policy advisers at the White House and made it clear in talks by telephone with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam, that the US was seeking punitive United Nations sanctions against the North for its suspected nuclear programme. A draft UN resolution is expected to be drawn up next week. Mr Ashton Carter, US assistant secretary of defence, said North Korea had ballistic missiles and 'they may have other things as well.' The US has said that North Korea is believed to have as many as two nuclear weapons and is developing more. He said the US would quickly send more warplanes, ships and troops to the tense peninsula in the event of trouble. Even more sharply, assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci said in an appearance before a convention on nuclear arms control that President Clinton had made clear if a nuclear weapon were used by North Korea 'that would be the end of the North Korean state.' In Vienna, North Korea said it could no longer guarantee continuity of nuclear safeguards and would ask two United Nations inspectors to leave the country. 'We will not allow any of the verification activity, which is now under way,' Mr Yun Ho-jin, a North Korean envoy, said. The statement came after the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution condemning North Korea for violating safeguards agreements by refusing inspectors access to sites suspected of involvement in the secret production of nuclear weapons. The board also suspended technical aid. China abstained on the vote. Though limited in scope, the cut off in aid amounts to the first formal sanctions against North Korea. An intensive week of diplomatic shuttling by foreign ministers and officials has so far failed to forge a common position on measures to be taken to punish Pyongyang for its refusal to open its facilities to inspection. China has refused to play ball, while Russia and to a lesser extent Japan have been reluctant to give strong backing for a UN resolution. In Istanbul Mr Warren Christopher ,the US secretary of State held talks on North Korea with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on the fringes of a Nato meeting with former communist adversaries, but had yet to reach complete accord with Russia which first wanted an international conference held on the issue. Mr Christopher however said he expected the US 'to be putting forward a (sanctions) resolution within a few days' at the UN. China has so far resolutely opposed sanctions. Yesterday President Jiang Zemin said: 'Sanctions could have serious consequences, and China is against such sanctions.' Diplomatic efforts will continue today as Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign minister, goes to Seoul for meetings with President Kim Young-sam and foreign minister Han Sung-joo. On Sunday, Mr Kakizawa will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, to urge renewed efforts by Beijing to get the North to permit inspections. Mr Kakizawa will relay to China's leaders the hardening resolve of the international community and urge them not to block a possible UN Security Council resolution. Japan will co-operate with UN sanctions, but believes efforts to seek a diplomatic solution should be continued to the last minute. Yesterday, Mr Kakizawa met Mr Peter Tarnoff, US undersecretary of state for political affairs, and stressed China's role in a peaceful solution. Hang-ups and hesitation, page 9</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Malaysia warned of retaliation risk Calls for retaliation against Malaysia are likely to increase unless Kuala Lumpur moves to lift a ban on giving public sector contracts to British companies, Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said yesterday. Mr Needham said at the end of his second visit to Malaysia in a fortnight that a lifting of the ban was likely within the next six weeks. 'They've said in principle they are going to take it off. But the longer they leave it the more likelihood there is of retaliation on the British side and the more voices will be raised against it,' Mr Needham said. Malaysia imposed the ban at the end of February after a report in the Sunday Times alleged that Wimpey, the British construction company, had been involved in negotiations to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Dr Mahathir's government had also been angered by the controversy surrounding a British loan for the Pergau dam project. At the time the ban was imposed, Malaysia said hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts for British companies could be affected. A UK-Japanese consortium that had been given the contract for project management of a Pounds 3bn airport being built outside Kuala Lumpur has been one of the main casualties of the Malaysian government's action. Mr Needham has played a central role in trying to persuade the Malaysians to lift the ban. Two weeks ago he proposed a Malaysian/British forum to promote co-operation on trade, investment and technology transfer. 'We have a long relationship with Malaysia, but the better you know someone when you have a row, the worse it will be,' said Mr Needham. Some Malaysian exporters are concerned the ban could ricochet on their business. Malaysia is lobbying the European Union for an extension of trading privileges under the generalised system of preferences. Mr Needham said Britain supported continuation of Malaysia's preference status. The system allows Malaysia preferential tariffs on its exports. More than 15,000 Malaysian-made Proton cars are exported each year to Britain, where they are sold for less than in Malaysia.</p>

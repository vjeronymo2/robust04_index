			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press conference which was supposed to be held  by Belarusian Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB  Chairman Eduard Shirkovskiy at 1500 [1300 GMT] on 27 January has  been called off. As BELAPAN has learned, the management of the  National Press Center has withheld its consent to hold the news  conference, explaining that the ministers are just "private  people." At the press center of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, a BELAPAN correspondent has learned that, in connection  with the dismissal of [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav  Shushkevich, Vladimir Yegorov considers the press conference  ill-timed. Nevertheless, the Journalists' Union of Belarus is  currently working on holding such a press conference.</p>

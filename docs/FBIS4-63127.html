			<p>BFN     [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], May 17, RIA -- The Christian  Democratic Popular Front of Moldavia [Moldova] views the current  dialogue between the leaders of Moldavia and Transdniestria  [Dniester] as a blow at national interests.    The Front's current statement notes that the negotiating  process signifies the admission of equality of the  Transdniestrian Moldavian Republic.    A RIA correspondent was told by sources close to the Front's  leadership that it also has a negative vision of the CSCE  mission's participation in the negotiating process because it  becomes a supporter of Russia's imperial policy.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADE MONEY FROM BOOK, GINGRICH SAYS  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright's chief accuser, Assistant Minority Leader Newt  Gingrich (R-Ga.), said Tuesday that he and his wife, Marianne, together earned  more than $35,000 by co-authoring a book in 1984 and then soliciting more than  $100,000 from 21 prominent Republicans to help promote it.  </P> <P> Gingrich acknowledged that soliciting money to promote the book was highly  unusual but he denied that it violated House rules in any way. He also insisted  that there can be no comparison between this arrangement and the scheme used to  market Wright's book, which has been criticized by the House Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> "There's a difference between doing it correctly and doing it in a way that's  not correct," he said. " . . . We went overboard to make sure that we followed  every rule."  </P> <P> The couple discussed the book at an emotional news conference called to answer  ethics allegations filed against them by Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who  contends that there is a similarity between the two book deals. When reporters  pressed them about the alleged comparison with Wright, Gingrich's wife ran from  the room in tears.  </P> <P> Wright, who authored a 117-page book of personal essays entitled "Reflections  of a Public Man," has been accused by Gingrich and the Ethics Committee of  selling the book in bulk to special interest groups to evade the House-imposed  limit on outside earned income.  </P> <P> Gingrich, who co-authored "Window of Opportunity" with his wife, is accused by  Alexander of evading the limit on outside income by soliciting money from  investors who, like some of those who purchased Wright's book, had direct  interest in legislation. The Ethics Committee has not yet reviewed the charges  against Gingrich.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prominent Republicans  </P> <P> The list of Gingrich's investors, which he made public for the first time  Tuesday, included prominent Republicans such as Joseph Coors and Howard H. (Bo)  Calloway, as well as business people in Georgia. Gingrich acknowledged that he  has sought legislative and other government benefits for some of his  home-district investors, but denied that it had any connection to their  willingness to kick in $5,000 to help promote his book.  </P> <P> Gingrich said that the partnership, which was organized by his wife to promote  the book, was created in a vain attempt to turn the volume into a best-seller.  Although the investors never realized a cent, they were able to write off the  loss on their taxes.  </P> <P> He described the scheme as "new and different, but honest."  </P> <P> Despite the partnership's expenditure of $51,571 to advertise and promote the  book from 1984 through 1986, the publisher reported a net loss of $6,259.  </P> <P> According to documents released by Gingrich, he and his wife each got a $5,000  advance for the book, they each received $7,018 in royalties, Mrs. Gingrich got  $10,000 for her work in establishing the partnership and she also received  $1,500 for work she has done for the partnership since it was created. The  partnership also reimbursed Gingrich for his travel expenses in promoting the  book.  </P> <P> Gingrich said that the partnership was a legitimate business deal -- not a  clever way to collect personal contributions from people with interest in  legislation. Unlike Wright's book, he noted, his was published by a mainline  publishing firm and under a routine royalty agreement.  </P> <P> He and his wife each received 3% royalties on paperback sales from St. Martin's  Press; Wright's royalty agreement with his publisher and friend, William Carlos  Moore, was for 55%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CUBA;  </P> <P> FAMILY ENDS ASYLUM BID, LEAVES EMBASSY  </P> <P> A Cuban couple and their baby daughter who had sought refuge at the Spanish  Embassy six weeks ago ended their bid for asylum. An embassy official said  Sergio Wong and his wife, Maribel, had decided to leave the embassy in Havana  with their daughter, Elizabeth, because Maribel was worried about the health of  her elderly father, who has a heart problem. The Wongs, looking nervous but  otherwise well, were escorted with their baby by Spanish diplomats through the  Cuban police cordon around the embassy and driven to the home of Maribel's  father.  </P></p>

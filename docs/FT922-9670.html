			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Petro-Canada returns to profit in quarter PETRO-CANADA posted a modest first-quarter profit after inventory accounting changes. In 1991, it incurred a CDollars 598m loss including special charges. The profit of CDollars 32m (USDollars 26.8m), or 15 cents a share, including proceeds from asset sales, compares with a net loss of Dollars 52m a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.1bn against Dollars 1.3bn. Cash flow from operations doubled to Dollars 124m, or 58 cents a share. Capital spending was halved to Dollars 97m. The upstream division was under pressure from low oil and gas prices and lower production. The downstream side increased sales of refined products and reduced overheads. The change in inventory accounting for 1992, being followed by all Canadian integrated oil companies, inflated first-quarter earnings by 12 cents a share. The upstream business is being re-structured. Investment is being concentrated in western Canada and in the east coast off-shore light oil. Producing assets in the west will be rationalised, resulting in greater control of core properties. However, the net impact on production volume would be small, the company said. But staff cuts will total 1,200 by the end of 1993. The re-structuring will require a special charge in the second quarter. Petro-Canada, 80 per cent state-owned, is closing nearly 1,000 retail outlets and reducing refining capacity in the next year. The company remains 80 per cent owned by the federal government after the first stage of privatisation two years ago. It is trying to become more competitive in preparation for a further privatisation step.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang  Province plans to restrict its urban unemployment rate at below  three percent this year by relying on market forces, according  to an official of the provincial labor department.    He said that the provincial government plans to introduce a  competitive labor market system province-wide over the next five  years to pave the way for the creation of a market economy.    Now, more people have found jobs on various type of labor  markets, in a change from getting job assignments from the  government, he said.    Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in China,  currently  has 70 labor markets, 500 job placement agencies, and 7,000  labor service enterprises and workers' training centers.    In 1993 700,000 urban residents in Zhejiang found jobs  through labor markets and nearly 60,000 residents were employed  following vocational training, he said.    As a result, the urban unemployment rate went down to 2.6  percent, he added.    The provincial authorities have decided to open a number of  major labor markets in urban areas, and job-placement agencies  in all counties and cities this year, he said.    In 1994 Zhejiang will also improve the social insurance  system consisting primarily of old-age pensions and unemployment  insurance, he said.    The premium will be shared by the state, the collectives and  individuals, according to local officials.    Specifically, the mutual pension insurance system will be  introduced in half of prefectures and cities, while unemployment  insurance will be extended to all urban workers, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E. G. Chikirdin, Moscow Research Institute of </F> Diagnostics and Surgery, Russian Ministry of Health, under the  rubric: ``Help for Medical Practitioners'']    [Text]In 1992, seven items of x-ray equipment underwent  clinical trials and were recommended by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Health for series production. First of all, we  should mention the Obraz-2 [Image] magnetic resonance tomograph  (developed and manufactured by the Agregat AO [Joint Stock  Company], Moscow), which will replace the preceding model,  Obraz-1 that was produced in series. The tomograph has a 0.14 T  resistance magnet (instead of 0.12 T as in Obraz-1), which  produces an image with higher resolution. At the same time, the  cost of the product has also risen (from 18 to 27 million  rubles).    A phantom kit (from the Ekran [Screen] NPO  [Research-Production Association]) has been developed and is  being manufactured for monitoring and adjusting the magnetic  resonance tomographs.    The x-ray diagnostic unit, Rentgen-47 (Sevkavrentgen plant,  Kabardino-Balkariya), which has a 3-phase, 6-pulse, 125 kV, 800  mA power pack, and two interchangeable No.1 and No.3 cradles,  which are ordered by the user, is designed to examine children.  The unit is equipped with a turntable and film holder, which are  the same as in the Rentgen-40 series of units.    Kruiz, a flat x-ray image amplifier, has been developed  (Special Design and Technological Office for Medical X-ray  Equipment, an affiliate of the Mosrentgen AO) to obtain 150-fold  enhancement of screen brightness. However, its contrast index is  not high enough (0.8 versus the desirable value of 0.9), which  makes it necessary to work in a darkened room.    The ARS-2 film-taking x-ray unit (Mosrentgen AO) has a  3-phase, 6-pulse, 125 kV, 800 MA power pack with microprocessor  control (Reneks 50-6-2 power pack). It is equipped with a  refined film table with a Storens tomography attachment and  Stors film holder. The unit has passed clinical trials at the  Moscow Research Institute of Diagnostics and Surgery.    An improved quality of x-rays and tomograms is obtained with  the kit for optimum x-ray filtration (Ekran NPO, Moscow), which  consists of compensation wedges with different configurations  that are transparent to visible light and placed at the end of  the depth collimator.    The AIRM VR (Neftepromavtomatika [Oil Industry Automation]  NPO, Kazan), an automated interactive roentgenologist's work  station, reduces time and enhances quality of roentgenological  findings. It also puts out automatically the mean radiation dose  to the patient over the examination time, and records the number  and format of films.    There are many other developments that are close to  completion, about which we will make an additional report.    Izdatelstvo ``Meditsina'', 1993</p>

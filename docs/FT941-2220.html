			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong dollar helps lift Bunzl 38% to Pounds 56m The strong dollar, acquisitions and profits on disposals as well as organic growth helped Bunzl raise pre-tax profits by 38 per cent, from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 55.8m, in 1993. The shares rose 2p to 183p. Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said that with 60 per cent of group sales coming from the US, the 16 per cent rise in the dollar contributed about 9 1/2 percentage points to the 13.5 per cent rise in sales from continuing operations to Pounds 1.46bn. Total turnover was 16 per cent up at Pounds 1.52bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Operating profits rose 12.5 per cent to Pounds 64m, including Pounds 1m from acquisitions and an unchanged Pounds 1.4m from discontinued operations. Mr Habgood said the group suffered from falling prices during the year and a Pounds 1.5m cost of closing the southern Italy paper distribution business. Profits on disposals totalled Pounds 1.3m (losses Pounds 5.2m) and interest charges dropped by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 9.5m. A fall in the tax rate helped lift earnings per share from 5.6p to 8.3p. A final dividend of 2.3p (2.2p) is proposed to give a total of 4.1p (4p). Mr Habgood said that although small, it was the first increase since the dividend was cut in 1991. He said that under FRS 3 accounting the group had paid Pounds 80m in dividends from no profit over the previous four years. Even now the cover was only two times. Operating profits from paper and plastic disposables rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 40.6m, matching the rise in sales. This division benefited from the currency gain and the purchase of ACS, though the Grossman acquisition made a small loss as expected. In dollar terms sales rose 5 per cent although prices fell 2 per cent. Fine paper distribution suffered from falling paper prices, especially in Germany where prices were 16 per cent lower. Profits fell from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 6m. A rebound in profits in building supplies, from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 4.2m followed cost cutting and a rise in demand. Profits from cigarette filters rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 11.4m and made a 34 per cent return on capital. Plastic products recorded a 40 per cent jump in profits to Pounds 8.8m with the main caps and plugs business doing well and in spite of continuing losses at Stewart, the consumer plastics operation. COMMENT The new management at Bunzl has certainly brought a discipline and coherence to a group which had been one of the worst examples of late 1980s acquisitiveness. Even so, there is still precious little homogeneity to the five divisions and a distinct impression that the building supplies side, at least, could be up for sale once its recovery is nearer completion. If paper and packaging distribution is to be the core, with cigarette filters a mature cash cow, Bunzl does not deserve the significant premium to the market it currently enjoys. With forecasts of about Pounds 66m for the year, and a higher tax charge slowing earnings growth, the prospective p/e is about 19 1/2 , a rating which looks further into 1995.</p>

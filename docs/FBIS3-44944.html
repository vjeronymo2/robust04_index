Organized by local governments, many farmers living in the  impoverished mountainous areas have left their homes and settled  down in some fertile areas.    Northern Guangdong is the poorest area in the province since  it lies in karst areas where most land is dry and not arable.    In sharp contrast with the province's coastal area, which is  seeing brisk economic progress, about 200,000 people living in  the north still did not have enough food and clothing in 1993.    Since the beginning of 1993, the provincial government has  started a large-scale migration in many villages and towns in  the north, where the natural conditions are bad.    "I'm glad to move," said Ye Shuisheng, a migrant farmer from  a village in the north.    "My home was two or three hours' walk from highways. It is  even hard for bicycles to reach," Ye said.    He said his village had no electricity and little arable  land. His family had only 0.15 ha of dry land, which at most  produced some 500 kg of sweet potatoes and 400 kg of grain a  year.    "We had no money to send our children to school," he said.    Ye has moved to another town with over 60 other households  from his village.    The provincial government estimates that, by 1995, a total  of  100,000 people in 45 towns in karst areas will voluntarily  migrate to other, more fertile land.    Local governments will provide migrant farmers with  subsidies  and arrange for residences and farmland for them.    Up to now, the well-organized migration has achieved marked  results.    Half a year ago, 131 households moved into migration zones  in  Shantang town, Qingxin County. With 600 yuan (70 U.S. dollars)  per capita in subsidy, they built houses and planted 50 ha of  land.    By the end of last year, they had reaped 250,000 kg of  paddy,  which equalled three years' harvest in their previous home  places. Many farmers secured enough food within half a year.    Now, several migration zones are being built in Qingxin  County.    Another successful example is Qingyuan city, which has built  up 56 resident zones and will accommodate 90,000 migrant farmers  by 1995.    Besides settling farmers in towns around the city, the city  government also encourages farmers to work in the urban area.  Now, many farmers are engaging in manufacturing and service  trades, not only improving their own living standards, but also  promoting the local economy.    Due to considerate arrangement by the local government, the  migration is going smoothly.    Some 35,000 people have moved out of the karst areas in the  north of the province, among whom are more than 4,000 people of  Yao nationality.    Urban residents have given full support to the migration. In  Qingyuan city, people have donated 2.6 million yuan (300,000  U.S. dollars) and 20,000 clothes items.    In addition, many overseas Chinese are also offering aid to  this project, among whom is Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of Goldlion  Holdings Limited, who has donated three million yuan (350,000  U.S. dollars).</p>

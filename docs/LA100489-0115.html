			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bristol-Myers, Squibb Holders OK Merger: Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp.  stockholders approved their companies' $11.5-billion merger into Bristol-Myers  Squibb Co., which will be world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company. The  merger is a further step in the consolidation of the global pharmaceuticals  industry. Analysts say mergers are encouraged by the industry's stiff  competition and development costs of hundreds of millions of dollars for the  introduction of a single drug. The merger will take effect today, Bristol-Myers  officials said. The combined company will be headquartered in New York.  </P></p>

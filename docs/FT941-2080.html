			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / More Finns favour joining EU Support for joining the European Union has strengthened in Finland since accession terms were agreed in Brussels earlier this month. A poll in yesterday's Helsingin Sanomat newspaper showed the 'yes' vote rising to 42 per cent from 39 per cent last month, while opposition slipped to 27 per cent from 30 per cent. A referendum on joining is expected in September. In Norway, where the opposition is still well ahead, a poll showed support for the anti-EU Centre party had surged by 5.4 percentage points to 20.9 per cent since Norway reached its EU accession accord.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: W Canning falls to Pounds 2.2m but better year in prospect Pre-tax profits at W Canning, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and electronic components group, took their expected knock from a provision for bad debts and fell from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.21m for 1993. Last month Canning reported a Pounds 1.4m provision against an exposure of Pounds 1.9m at its Italian electrical components business and noted yesterday that the size of the debt 'reflects the extended credit given to customers, which is normal business practice in Italy.' The effect meant a cut in attributable earnings of Pounds 536,000, taking them down to Pounds 610,000 against Pounds 260,000 in 1992. Basic earnings per share worked through at 2.2p (0.9p). However, adjusting for the exceptional and bad debt provisions adjusted earnings emerged at 7.8p (7.2p). A maintained final dividend of 4.35p makes a same-again 7.29p total. Mr David Probert, chairman, said he did not feel that a reduced dividend would be justified given the strength of the Canning balance sheet and market prospects. The difficulties in Italy obscured an improvement in the group's performance last year. Sales in fact were lower at Pounds 109.31m (Pounds 114.03m) after the sale of the French company. However, profits before the debt provision and the exceptional item associated with that sale rose from Pounds 4.04m to Pounds 4.67m. Trading during the first 10 weeks of the current year was described as 'satisfactory'. Sales in and from the UK have increased, while the French and German markets, which take half of Canning's sales, have stopped declining. This year will be better than last, Mr Probert said.</p>

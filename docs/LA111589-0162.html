			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRATEGIES HURT RICE'S HEISMAN ODDS, HOLTZ SAYS  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz says he knows that his game strategies diminish the  chances for quarterback Tony Rice in the Heisman Trophy balloting.  </P> <P> Rice has passed little this season, seen most Irish rushing touchdowns executed  by backs Ricky Watters and Anthony Johnson and stood on the sidelines during  blowouts while Holtz exercised reserve quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Holtz calls Rice a complete quarterback: a leader, a strong rusher and a  competent passer when he needs to be.  </P> <P> "But I don't believe there's any way in the world that we could get the  statistics for Tony Rice that would impress other people without being  detrimental to the overall goals of the University of Notre Dame," Holtz said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rice leads Notre Dame this season with 693 rushing yards on 128 carries for  five touchdowns. He has completed 56 passes in 112 attempts for 969 yards, two  touchdowns and six interceptions.  </P> <P> "When I reflect upon it, I think we've done the right things," said Holtz, who  coached flanker Tim Brown to the Heisman two years ago.  </P></p>

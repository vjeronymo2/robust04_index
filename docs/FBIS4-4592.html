			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: `Dissolve House, Return Mandate to the People'] </F>   [Text] On the face of it, the successive setbacks  inflicted on the ruling coalition during the messy  constitutional-amendment exercise last week underscore a serious  miscalculation by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's government  regarding the cohesiveness and political bias of the Senate.    The coalition had wanted to reduce the number of Senators as  part of a larger package of proposed political reforms,  purportedly to make the constitution more democratic. But  coalition leaders did little homework in terms of lobbying or  coordinating with members of the Upper House.    So when the full parliament convened its extraordinary  session last Thursday, the Senators pulled the rug out from  under the Government and threw their full support behind an  alternative charter amendment draft submitted by the Opposition  which contains most of the previously agreed to amendment points  but minus the contentious Senate down-sizing. And when the  Government's own draft on this very subject was raised the  following day, it was -- not surprisingly -- scuttled by  wholesale Senatorial abstentions.    But what is at stake here is not so much a case of the  Senate  flexing its muscles in an over-zealous exercise to protect its  own turf. No one in his right mind would expect the Senators to  vote in favor of a charter amendment draft that would reduce the  number of their own peers and scale back their powers. Even  with the increasing public scrutiny over the legitimacy of their  existence, most probably still hold on to the constitutional  edict that they remain the 'representatives', albeit  non-elected, of the people.    What is far more disturbing is the combination of the  insincerity and internecine bickerings among the elected members  of the House, both coalition and Opposition. Their collective  mishandling of this entire constitutional amendment episode has  reduced the sanctity of the parliamentary system to naught.    The Democrat Party highlighted constitutional reforms as one  of its main political platforms during campaigning for the 1992  general elections. Indeed, many of the voters who cast their  ballots for the Democrats at the time had probably expected the  party to initiate changes in order to make the Constitution more  democratic.    But despite its successful post-election emergence as the  core party of the coalition, the Democrats did little to fulfill  this electioneering pledge. Rather than exerting leadership and  guidance, the Prime Minister instead passed the burden of  constitutional amendments over to Parliament. What followed was  a lengthy series of deliberations by a special parliamentary  panel, interspersed with squabbling among the MPs of both  benches.    When the coalition was finally forced to take action in the  face of mounting public pressure for constitutional reforms, it  decided to take the easy way out by tabling what it perceived to  be the less contentious points to ensure smooth passage --  instead of picking substantive issues that would otherwise be  needed to make the Constitution truly democratic.    If the efforts by the coalition were insincere and  half-hearted, the fickleness by the Opposition alliance calls  for stronger condemnation. It may be recalled that  representatives of the coalition and Opposition originally  agreed to amend only eight of the total 25 proposed changes, but  the Opposition side subsequently broke ranks and insisted on  tabling the total package in one go.    Acting once again under the apparent impulse of public  pressures rather than genuine determination, the Government  decided on the eve of the extraordinary parliamentary session to  go along with the Opposition demand, but only to find out that  the Opposition changed track at the last minute by proposing a  different, alternative draft. It has become all-too apparent  that, through its constant changes of heart, the fickle  Opposition was more intent on out-scoring the Government and  forcing a drastic political change such as the Government's  resignation or parliamentary dissolution in the process --  rather than entertaining any genuine desire to make the  Constitution more democratic. After all, the 1978 charter on  which the Opposition draft is based is probably one of the least  ideal models to follow.    Mr. Chuan and his Democrat colleagues can continue to try  distancing themselves from the constitutional-amendment charade  by blaming it on Parliament. But having been handed two  humiliating defeats on two successive days, the Government has  run into a political dead-end. The legitimacy of its existence  as much as its ability to govern effectively is put into serious  doubt. Under these circumstances, the most logical option for  the Government is to dissolve Parliament and return the mandate  to the people.</p>

			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Coopers to abandon 'confusing' Deloitte COOPERS &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, is to drop the last word of its name in June. The move follows confusion among clients caused by the merger that created the combined firm in 1990. Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the UK, but with Touche Ross in most other countries to become Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu. The change of name comes after speculation that Coopers &amp; Lybrand would act to erase signs of its merger with Deloitte. Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu will become Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in June. Touche Ross in the UK has no plans to change its name.</p>

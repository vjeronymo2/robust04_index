			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Comcast to buy cable TV unit for Dollars 1.27bn Comcast, the US telecommunications group, announced yesterday that it has agreed to buy the cable television operations of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian communications and media group, for Dollars 1.27bn in cash. The acquisition is the latest mega-deal in the consolidation of the US cable TV market, which is becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators. Two weeks ago, Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises paid Dollars 2.3bn for Times Mirror's cable TV unit. Comcast is buying the cable interests of Maclean Hunter, which include services and operations for about 550,000 subscribers in New Jersey, Michigan and Florida, from Maclean Hunter's parent, Rogers Communications, Canada's largest cable TV group. Rogers bought Maclean Hunter three months ago for Dollars 2.2bn. Rogers said then it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable operations. The purchase will make Comcast the third largest cable TV operator in the US with 3.5m subscribers, behind TCI, which has 10m subscribers, and Time Warner, which has 7m. Comcast also provides cellular telephone services to more than 7.4m people. Comcast's purchase, however, has several regulatory hurdles to overcome. Not only is the deal subject to US government approval, but Rogers' acquisition of Maclean Hunter is also awaiting approval in Canada, where the federal Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Bureau of Competition are likely to scrutinise carefully a merger between the country's two largest cable TV operators.</p>

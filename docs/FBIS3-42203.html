			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>   [Excerpt] Crown Prince Hasan has led a delegation to  receive the body of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran  al-Ma'ayitah, which has arrived in Amman aboard a military  plane, following his assassination in Beirut in front of his  residence. The coffin, which was wrapped in the Jordanian flag,  was taken off the plane while the members of Na'ib's family  shouted: Allahu Akbar [God is great], O martyr of Jordan.    Official Jordanian sources have ruled out any personal  motive  behind this operation because it was carried out in an organized  way. The Jordanian officials, who do not see any clear  explanation for the assassination, noted that it is linked with  extremist elements, perhaps against the background of Jordan's  involvement in the peace process. Amman is waiting for the  results of the ongoing investigations in Lebanon and asked to be  briefed on the results as details are available. [passage  omitted]</p>

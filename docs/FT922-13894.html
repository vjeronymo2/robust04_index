			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ALUMINIUM prices on the London Metal Exchange reached fresh nine-month highs yesterday before being pared back by profit-taking. The three months delivery price reached Dollars 1,370 a tonne at one stage, but by the end of after hours trading it was down to Dollars 1,355.50 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on the day. Dealers said the early rise reflected a continuation of the recent speculative activity, some of which they said was linked to options business. And they thought that, once the technical reaction was absorbed, an upside objective of Dollars 1,400 a tonne was a distinct possibility. COPPER prices came under pressure after New York prices moved lower in early trading. The cash price at the LME closed at Pounds 1,264.50 a tonne, down Pounds 22.25 from Tuesday's close. At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices were marked down in the morning following a sharp overnight sell-off in New York. The July robusta position dipped to Dollars 863 a tonne at one stage before profit-taking by holders of short positions pared the fall. At the close it was quoted at Dollars 871 a tonne, down Dollars 11 on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

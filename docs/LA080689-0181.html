			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPECT, CONTEMPT FOR GUEST CONDUCTORS -- FROM THE MUSICIANS UNDER THEIR BATON;  </P> <P> WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MYSTERIOUS LINK BETWEEN CONDUCTOR AND ORCHESTRA?  </P> <P> A conductor should reconcile himself to the realization that regardless of his  approach or temperment, the eventual result is the same -- the orchestra will  hate him.  </P> <P>  -- Oscar Levant, "A Smattering of Ignorance"  </P> <P> As a summer sport, it hardly ranks with water-skiing or body-surfing for sheer  visceral excitement. But for thousands of orchestra fans, the annual game of  conductor watching at the Hollywood Bowl offers its own special thrills.  </P> <P> Until mid-September, the Los Angeles Philharmonic plays host to an array of  guest conductors, some well-known to the orchestra, some appearing with the  orchestra for the first time.  </P> <P> In some ways, each series of rehearsals and concerts is a little like a blind  date. Each visitor on the podium undergoes intense scrutiny by the players.  </P> <P> "A new guest conductor in front of an orchestra is pretty much stripped naked,"  says Roy Tanabe, Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist and assistant personnel  manager. "We're all thinking, who is this person? What does he or she have to  offer?  </P> <P> "We have to establish our sig  </P> <P> nals. We have to determine not only what the conductor wants musically but also  how he's going to convey it. I have a job to do. I need to know how much I'm  supposed to contribute. Will I have to carry him?"  </P> <P> There isn't much time to form an opinion. The Philharmonic typically has only  one or two rehearsals for each Hollywood Bowl concert during its 11-week summer  season, as opposed to three to five run-throughs for a subscription concert at  the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> The distractions of working alfresco at the Bowl can also make it hard to  concentrate. For this reason, Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist Edith Markman  says the orchestra's relationship with Bowl guest conductors is enhanced  greatly if the visitor has a sense of humor. Soviet conductor Yuri Temirkanov,  who conducted several concerts at the opening of the summer season, rated high  on this point.  </P> <P> "He had a great perspective," Markman says. "He got terrific results by using  exaggeration when he rehearsed with us. So that by the time the concert came  around, we'd clearly remember the musical point he was making. And even if you  gave him only a little of what he wanted, it would come across."  </P> <P> And, of course, it helps if a visitor is well-prepared. A guest conductor must  know his repertory perfectly, says John Mack, principal oboe of the Cleveland  Orchestra. "He mustn't shy away from addressing problems of ensemble, pitch,  style, note-length, anything. The more convinced a conductor is about what  they're doing, the more the orchestra will respect the conductor."  </P> <P> According to the Philharmonic's principal concertmaster Sidney Weiss, that  respect is won or lost quickly. "We know within a matter of seconds whether  this is going to be a rewarding experience or just time we have to put in."  </P> <P> How do they know? "It's an elusive thing to define," Weiss admits.  </P> <P> What activates this mysterious link between an orchestra and its conductor?  Does it always end in bitterness, as Oscar Levant insisted? Does a warm rapport  between conductor and players necessarily lead to satisfying Schubert? Does  mutual distrust inevitably result in muddled Mahler?  </P> <P> Finally, as far as orchestral musicians are concerned, what makes a great  conductor?  </P> <P> A random poll of players around the country elicited some surprising answers.  </P> <P> The first myth to be shattered was that of the clearly defined beat. Superior  baton technique apparently is not a prerequisite for superb music-making.  </P> <P> Many esteemed conductors, from Wilhelm Furtwangler to Carlo Maria Giulini, were  notoriously lacking in the clear beat department.  </P> <P> "I used to think it was crucial," Weiss says. "But as the years pass, I find  it's less and less important. For the great bulk of the standard literature --  a Mozart or Brahms or Tchaikovsky symphony -- once you start playing the  movement, the pulse is self-explanatory. We don't need a traffic cop."  </P> <P> Mack cites the example of his orchestra's principal guest conductor: "Vladimir  Ashkenazy is a magnificent musician. But my friends in the audience always  complain that he makes awkward stabbing gestures with the baton. So what if he  makes stabbing gestures? He's making great music."  </P> <P> Still, there are technical skills that a first-rate conductor can't do without.  </P> <P> For Nathan Stutch, who retired this spring as associate principal cello of the  New York Philharmonic, they include a strong rhythmic sense; an ability to  adhere to a strict tempo; a highly developed ear for intonation, balances and  different timbral possibilities; vast insight into varying musical styles, and  an intuitive musicality.  </P> <P> "Ideally, a great conductor must be able to hear all, see all and know all  about the music he performs," says the 42-year veteran of the New York  Philharmonic. Stutch says musicians rarely encounter such a person.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, articulate speech rated low on everyone's scale.  </P> <P> The way one uses language is a big part of one's personality, Tanabe said, "but  a conductor has his whole body to use, his facial expressions, his sheer  energy. And during a concert, there are no words.  </P> <P> "A conductor should be able to rehearse the orchestra with a minimum of verbal  communication. We don't want him to tell us, 'Play it like the blue waters  emanating from the source of eternal light.' We want to hear 'slow, fast, loud,  soft.' If he achieves a distinctive sound, then we allow him his blue waters  and eternal light."  </P> <P> Violinist Arnold Brostoff, a 25-year veteran of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,  concurs.  </P> <P> "Look, Moses was tongue-tied, he could hardly talk. All he had to say was 'Let  my people go!' And said (it) with intensity. That certainly meant something!"  </P> <P> Loquacious conductors can "drive an orchestra crazy," Brostoff says,  particularly when the gift of gab isn't complemented by serious conviction. He  singles out three noted Americans for special scorn: James Levine, Leonard  Slatkin and James Conlon. "The dishonesty, the posturing," Brostoff exclaims.  "These people are not making a connection with the orchestra."  </P> <P> That connection does appear to benefit from a conductor's personal warmth and  spirit of camaraderie.  </P> <P> JoAnn Falletta, who officially begins her first season as music director of the  Long Beach Symphony on Sept. 16, gets high marks from many members of the  orchestra, not only for her musicianship, but also for her engaging manner.  </P> <P> "She treats us like human beings," says Long Beach violinist Jeff Gauthier.  "She seems interested in getting to know us. There's a strong commitment there,  both to the orchestra and to the music."  </P> <P> Yet some of the most celebrated conductors of this century were not exactly  proponents of the warm fuzzies.  </P> <P> Sidney Weiss, who performed in several major orchestras before joining the Los  Angeles Philharmonic in 1979, remembers a rehearsal with the Cleveland  Orchestra at which the late George Szell fired the entire trumpet section,  player by player, as each one failed to perform a certain phrase in Debussy's  "La Mer" to the famed Hungarian conductor's satisfaction.  </P> <P> "Fritz Reiner was even worse," Weiss says. "This was a truly sadistic man. I'm  convinced he would try to think up ways to humiliate the players."  </P> <P> Weiss freely acknowledges that Szell and Reiner got phenomenal results from  their unhappy bands.  </P> <P> The late Herbert von Karajan was also well-known for his uncompromising  attitude, both on the podium and off.  </P> <P> Stutch vividly remembers a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that he  played under Karajan in 1958 in New York. "He definitely had a cool, detached  presence on the podium," Stutch said. "It was the antithesis of Bernstein, who  hugs and kisses and wants everyone to love him. With Karajan, there was no  fraternizing.  </P> <P> "Yet you knew you were in the presence of a giant. Such economy of motion, such  command. You wanted to be enmeshed in this great musical mind."  </P> <P> So if personal charm, baton technique and a way with words are not essential,  what makes a great conductor? Weiss says it's an innate gift that is rare.  </P> <P> "A lot of young people are getting a chance to conduct who don't deserve to,"  he said. "There's a common misconception that if a person has enough experience  on the podium, he's going to excel. It just doesn't happen. A conductor is  trained in his own home, studying scores.  </P> <P> "Most conducting courses are a waste of time. You really can't teach this art.  The real talent is the ability to inspire -- to impart one's musical ideas to  every musician in the orchestra in such a way that  </P> <P> they play better than they thought they could . . . better than they can."  </P> <P> The means by which this inspiration is imparted varies widely.  </P> <P> Leonard Bernstein sweats, swoons, cries and dances, Tanabe says. "It's a carnal  experience. Part of his conviction is to call attention to himself. He never  holds himself back.  </P> <P> "To explain the feeling of buoyancy he wanted in a Beethoven symphony, he  exploded in a series of belly laughs."  </P> <P> Doriot Anthony Dwyer, since 1952 the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony,  is still haunted by a glance she received from Bruno Walter more than 30 years  ago.  </P> <P> "At Tanglewood, we were (recently) playing Dvorak's New World Symphony, a piece  we've done hundreds of times," Dwyer said. "There isn't a time we play it that  I don't see Bruno Walter's face looking at me during the first big flute solo.  It was such a beautiful expression. I knew exactly what he wanted. When the  spirit of the music lights up a conductor's face before you play, there's  nothing like it."  </P> <P> Recent Bowl guest Neeme Jarvi capitalizes on his physical stature, Markman  said. "He has huge hands, he's a very large man, and he just envelops us with  his interpretation.  </P> <P> "Erich Leinsdorf, a much smaller man, also does this beautifully. His hands,  arms, head, body are all working together with such a strong sense of purpose.  You feel like you're on Ninja at Magic Mountain. He's  </P> <P> taking you away and there isn't any other way to go. You can't fight the  G-force. For me, that makes playing in the orchestra very exciting."  </P> <P> Concept and heart are the most important conductorly qualities as far as  Markman is concerned. "If the concept is deeply felt, and if a conductor has  the ability to produce that concept in the orchestra, I'm willing to risk all  to go with him."  </P> <P> "It has to do with an insight beyond the work itself," Tanabe said. "Way beyond  the achievement of a good, technical performance. It's a gut-level emotion. The  whole orchestra feels it. And we all hope it will happen."  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Nadir says Tory gifts were lawful MR ASIL NADIR, former chairman of Polly Peck International, accepted that there had been a non-disclosure in the company accounts of donations to the Conservative party, according to a statement from his lawyers Pannone March Pearson. Mr Nadir did not understand the reason for this and the donations were lawful, the statement said. Labour MPs are demanding that the Conservative party should repay the Pounds 440,000 it received from the collapsed Polly Peck empire. Mr Nadir is due to go on trial in the High Court in March next year on 25 charges of theft and false accounting. His lawyers are worried that the controversy over the payment could affect the conduct of the trial. In the Commons Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Lab Workington) called on Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, to ensure action was taken to hand the money over to the receivers administering the companies concerned. Mr MacGregor stressed that the Conservative party had received the money 'entirely legally and in good faith'. He reinforced earlier comments by Mr John Major, the prime minister,that during the last general election campaign the contribution which the Labour party received from the Transport and General Workers' Union exceeded all the donations made by companies for political activities. Conservative backbenchers denied Labour charges that the Conservative party was 'in receipt of stolen cash'.</p>

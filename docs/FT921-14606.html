			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil expected to retake lead in coffee sales BRAZIL EXPORTED 19.46m bags (60 kg each) of green coffee in 1991, worth Dollars 1.45bn, figures which the local coffee sector believes will propel Brazil back into its traditional position as the world's biggest coffee exporter, in terms of both volume and earnings. The results, announced by the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters, represented a 33 per cent increase in volume over 1990, and a 26 per cent increase in earnings. In 1990, Colombia overtook its southern neighbour in terms of receipts from coffee exports, pulling in Dollars 1.5bn on 13.9m bags, compared with Brazilian earnings of Dollars 1.2bn on 14.6m bags. As Colombia's 1990 sales depleted much of its coffee stocks, the country is expected to register slightly lower results for 1990. According to coffee traders, Brazil's poor performance in 1990 was caused by international consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for better quality arabica. Colombia's quality is generally considered to be superior to that of Brazil. Last year, Brazil accounted for an estimated 30 per cent of the world coffee market in terms of volume. Several factors accounted for the surge in Brazilian coffee exports last year. 'We had a relatively good harvest,' said Mr Orlando Correa, president of the Coffee Trade Centre in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian government no longer makes an official estimate of the country's production, but according to Mr Correa the 1991 harvest was about 27m bags. Another reason, Mr Correa said, was that Brazil's coffee farmers were caught in a credit squeeze 'and were therefore forced to sell off their stocks to finance their harvest.'</p>

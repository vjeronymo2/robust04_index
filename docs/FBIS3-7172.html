			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Why Do the Communist Vietnamese Force </F> Their Puppets and Lackeys To Bark Repeatedly about the Pailin  Battlefield and Why Does the Alliance Tremblingly Echo the  Shouts?"]    [Text] Since they sent their lackey puppets' troops to  carry out military operations in the Pailin region on 28  February, the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance have  ordered the puppets to bark repeatedly about the Pailin  battlefield. As for their propaganda machines, including AFP  and the French, Australian, and American radios, they have  relayed the shouts in a shameless manner, showing their face as  the undeniable propaganda apparatus of imperialists. While they  barked that they had captured this or that village, they said  that they had already postponed their military operations.  Later, they claimed that they were continuing their offensives  and that they were this or that far from Pailin.    The general public asks: In the circumstances where the king  father calls for an end to the war and the entire Cambodian  nation and people abhor the battle, why do the communist  Vietnamese continue to force their lackey Khieu Kanharit to bark  repeatedly about the attack on the Pailin battlefield, and why  do the alliance's propaganda machines tremblingly echo, in  earnest, the shouts in complete contradiction of the truth?  Because:    1. The communist Vietnamese and the alliance as well as  their lackey puppets within the two-headed government need to  bark sharply and (?lie) profusely in accordance with the tactics  [word indistinct] employed in the time of Hitler to conceal  their most shameful and utter defeat on the Anlung Veng  battlefield.    2. They need to bark to prevent their troops from becoming  further demoralized and to motivate them to further invade this  or that area in line with their plan and policy to continue the  Vietnamese war of aggression.    3. They need to bark to threaten the masses and people in  Phnom Penh and provinces not to rise up against them with regard  to the problems of land, Vietnamese nationals, wages, and  corruption.    All in all, their actions are a psychological war to fool  their troops on the Pailin battlefield into going to war and to  prevent the latter from breaking loose and ceasing to fight.  Apparently, the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed  government have continued to live on by waging war. They need  to launch the onslaughts on the Anlung Veng and Pailin  battlefields to collect money from foreign warmongers who want  Cambodians to get killed further. This is why they have  painstakingly muffled such barks.    In Phnom Penh, nobody can be trusted. The communist  Vietnamese deceive the alliance; the alliance deceives the  Vietnamese lackey puppets; and the Vietnamese lackey puppets  deceive the two-headed government and glibly lie to the  communist Vietnamese and the alliance. It is not known who  deceives who and who lies to whom. So what is the truth behind  this?    It is that the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese  puppets and two-headed government are being surrounded by the  people and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], which  have constantly attacked them everywhere, such as in the  Battambang provincial town, Kamping Puoy, Thnoeng, Sdau, Treng,  and along Route 10. As of 18 March, nine of their T-54 tanks  have been blown up, and more than 300 of their troops have been  killed and 400 others wounded. Apart from this, they have been  afflicted with malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea, and many of them  have died while many hundred others have been shipped to the  rear. The event at the Anlung Veng battlefield is clear  evidence.    Moreover, the puppets and two-headed government, especially  the communist Vietnamese, have already been aware that in 1985  and 1990, tens of thousands of troops from the genuine  Vietnamese 330th, 309th, and 4th divisions and the puppet 4th  and 196th divisions backed by nearly 100 tanks, multiple rocket  launchers, and cannons could do nothing to Pailin. Now, with  the untidy soldiers, illegitimate officers and generals, and Pol  Sareoun always staying in an armored carrier, can they live  long? This can be seen in broad daylight. Nevertheless, they  need to launch such offensives only to save themselves from  peril now and then.</p>

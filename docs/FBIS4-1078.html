			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The South African  Defence Force [SADF] has replaced the National Peacekeeping  Force [NPKF] in the strife-torn East Rand townships, Wit Command  spokesman Major Christo Visser confirmed on Wednesday [20  April]. He said a few platoons were sent in to "stabilise" the  area where more than 20 people have died since Sunday night in  fighting between hostel dwellers and Thokoza residents.    The decision was taken at a meeting on Tuesday night between  the SADF and NPKF "to avoid further bloodshed" in the townships,  Maj Visser said. "Since April 18 the security situation in the  Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus area deteriorated to such and  extent that the commander of the NPKF in the area, Lieut Col  Quentin Painter, requested the assistance of the SADF in the  area.    On Wednesday, the SADF were patrolling "hotspots" while most  NPKF units had been confined to barracks, he said. Maj Visser  added: "The NPKF is now busy with a reassessment of the  situation and will present this to the NPKF Command Council as  we are going to present our reassessment to the chief of the  army regarding our involvement in the area from now onwards."    Thokoza was quiet on Wednesday.</p>

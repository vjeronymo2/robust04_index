This is because historical experience shows that  it: will be by no means easy to attain this objective.  <H5>  Prices Rose by 18 Percent Last Year </H5>   A few days ago, the Guangdong Commodity Prices Bureau  provided deputies attending the Guangdong Provincial People's  Congress meeting with a document on the market price situation.  According to the document, Guangdong's general index of retail  prices last year rose by 18.2 percent over the previous year.  Market prices rose considerably across the province, with hefty  increases registered at the beginning and end of the year and  prices stabilizing in the middle of the year.    According to analyses, the steep price increases in  Guangdong  last year were caused by economic growth, the introduction of  various reforms, and other normal factors, and by natural  disasters, artificial, and other abnormal factors. Through hard  work, the momentum of excessive price hikes has been curbed to a  certain extent, but the planned control target was still  exceeded by 8.2 percentage points.    The principal cause of Guangdong's consistently high prices  was rapid economic and investment growth. The originally  planned price control target was determined according to planned  growth of 12 percent in Guangdong's GNP. In fact, Guangdong's  GNP grew by 21 percent last year, which was certainly reflected  in the general index of retail prices. Rapid economic growth  gave rise to rapid investment and credit growth. On the one  hand, this led directly to hefty increases in the price of  capital goods, especially steel products and cement; on the  other hand, as some 40 percent of the investment was turned into  consumption funds, pressures to raise prices increased, bringing  about a hefty increase in the price of relevant products. In  terms of the macro environment, this determined that Guangdong's  general index of retail prices outstripped the originally  planned control target by a big margin last year.  <H5>  Great Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Swap Prices </H5>   Last year, the state increased the weight of reform,  readjusted tax rates, allowed exchange price fluctuations, and  carried out price reform. All these have also directly  contributed to price hikes in Guangdong. For example, the state  raised the retail sales tax rate from 3 to 5 percent. As retail  prices for over 90 percent of commodities in Guangdong were  subjected to market regulation, the increase in tax rates was  also reflected in prices. Moreover, as a lot of operators also  jumped on the bandwagon, the actual impact was greater than had  been theoretically estimated.    Besides, foreign exchange swap prices fluctuated wildly last  year. As Guangdong imported large amounts of energy, raw and  semifinished materials, and household electrical products, a  drop in the exchange rate directly drove up prices of these  commodities by a big margin, and, at the same time, caused some  people to expect that the renminbi would be devalued. With the  acceleration of price reform across the nation, prices of most  commodities, such as grain, steel products, and coal, were  liberalized, and prices of railway cargo transport were also  adjusted upward substantially. The impact was especially  serious in Guangdong, which principally relies on imports of  energy materials and raw and semifinished materials from other  provinces and which sells most of its products to other  provinces.    Guangdong was repeatedly hit by natural calamities last  year.  What with the low-temperature cold front at the beginning of the  year and typhoons and rainstorms in the middle of the year,  there was a sharp drop in the output of fruit, vegetables, and  grain. This exacerbated the contractions caused by supply  falling short of demand. The impact of natural calamities on  vegetables, in particular, was most severe, and vegetable prices  soared three times. Furthermore, some localities relaxed or  neglected the "shopping basket" project by turning vast tracts  of vegetable fields into real estate. As newly cultivated  vegetable fields are remote and their output is low, vegetable  prices tended to rise when natural calamities occurred.  <H3>  Artificial or Indiscriminate Collection of Fees Adds Fuel to  the Flames </H3>   Artificial or indiscriminate price increases and collection  of fees also contributed to rising prices. For a time last  year, the phenomena of jumping on the bandwagon and artificially  forcing up prices were rampant in Guangdong, but they were  curbed by the provincial government through vigorous  rectifications. By late November last year, however, because  some newspapers erroneously reported that grain was in short  supply and grain prices were likely to rise, and because some  rice traders and self-employed grain shops took advantage of the  opportunity to jack up prices, the price of rice soared in the  short space of half a month and in Guangzhou rose by about 60  percent.       Maintaining the basic stability of market prices bears  heavily on social and economic stability. Last year, Guangdong  Province took measures to curb wanton price increases, such as  organizing a general inspection of fees collection and commodity  prices across the province, seizing the right time to introduce  price reform in light of the market price situation to reduce  the impact on prices, and doing a good job in the production of  staple food to stabilize prices of those commodities that bear  heavily on the people's well-being.    Guangdong also stepped up controls over the collection of  administrative and operational fees in accordance with the law.  According to statistics, in the first 11 months of last year, a  total of 2,189 fee collection items were abolished and another  608 rectified in the province as a whole, thus reducing social  burdens by about 300 million yuan. Moreover, individual  dynamic, direct management at different levels was also  administered toward prices of commodities and services that are  monopolies, mandatory, and protective and have public welfare  characteristics.  <H5>  Establish Price Regulation and Control System </H5>   Looking ahead into the new year, the price situation in  Guangdong will still be very grim because many reform projects  will be introduced and the economy is still growing at a fairly  high speed. The various price hike factors have not been  eliminated. For example, in reforming the taxation system and  readjusting the tax burden structure, tax reduction does not  necessarily lead to price reductions and a rise in taxes will be  shifted onto prices. The current overheated social demand will  also drive up the price level.    Wen Wuhan, secretary general of the Guangdong Commodity  Prices Association, gave an incisive analysis of the strong  motives behind the government's attempt to "control commodity  prices." In his view, of the price reform aimed at establishing  a socialist market economic structure, liberalizing competitive  prices constitutes only part of the price reform. What is more  important and arduous is to establish a price regulation and  control system suited to a market economy. Viewed from this  angle, price reform still has a long way to go.    He stressed: First, it is necessary to make clear that the  objective of reform is to establish, under state macroeconomic  regulation and control, a price structure based on fixed market  prices so that the government can regulate and control the  market, the market can fix prices, and prices can guide  enterprises. Second, it is necessary to have corresponding  economic, legal, and administrative means to exercise regulation  and control over prices, and to place these reform tasks on the  government's agenda. If we pay attention only to price  controls, we are likely to return to the old path of direct  regulation and control.</p>

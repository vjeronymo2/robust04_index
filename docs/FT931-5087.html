			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Observer: A yen for altruism The last country either Bill Clinton or Boris Yeltsin probably thinks deserves a good turn from them at the moment is Japan. The US president thinks it should bring down its trade surplus. His Russian counterpart thinks it ought to be less tight-fisted with aid. So it is a testimony to their altruism that they should be combining to thrust their own nations' money into Japanese pockets at their summit meeting in Vancouver next month - unless their supposedly omniscient advisers have made a boob. In choosing the Pan-Pacific Hotel as the summit's venue they perhaps didn't twig that, like several more of Vancouver's top hostelries, it is owned by a Japanese group, in this case the Tokyu conglomerate. Still, all may be forgiven once the two presidents arrive. The hotel sits atop Canada Place, the waterfront convention centre whose giant Teflon sails bear a passing resemblance to the Sydney Opera House. The views over Burrard Inlet and the snow-capped mountains beyond are superb. The Pan-Pacific is especially proud of its kitchen. Its executive chef was a member of the Canadian team which won last year's Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt. Almost as distinguished is one of the sous-chefs, Enrico Balestra, a former opera singer who provides the entertainment at an 'Italian Opera Buffet' in one of the restaurants each Friday night. Clinton and Yeltsin will be spared that treat, however, as the summit doesn't start until the Saturday.</p>

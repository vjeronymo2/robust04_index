			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Motor move by First Direct First Direct, the direct telephone banking company owned by HSBC Holdings, is to enter the growing market for direct telephone sales of motor insurance. The group will launch a pilot later this month, offering motor insurance to a targeted range of customers through Hexagon Insurance, an existing HSBC subsidiary which sells insurance for a panel of 70 insurers. 'Our customers tell us they are very interested in a car insurance service from First Direct,' said Mr Peter Simpson, commercial director. 'Car insurance is a natural progression to the development of our range of services', added Mr Simpson. First Direct will join a series of other telephone broking services run by companies such as Hill House Hammond, a subsidiary of Norwich Union, Select Direct - owned by General Accident and Rollins Hudig Hall, and Telesure. Telephone-based brokers aim to compete in the direct sales market, which has grown rapidly in recent years following the success of Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, which both sells and underwrites motor insurance by telephone and is the market leader insuring more than 1.4m motorists. Analysts estimate that telephone-based companies already control more than 15 per cent of the market.</p>

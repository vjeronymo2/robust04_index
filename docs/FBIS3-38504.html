Klaus arrived on Thursday [28 January] in Switzerland to  attend the World Economic Forum.    Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia,  started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been  strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially  in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are  involved in the project.    "It is another reply to those who are falsely accusing us  both back home and among our southern neighbors," Klaus stated.    The bank certainly took this step after careful  consideration, he said, adding that he had expected the bank to  make the decision.</p>

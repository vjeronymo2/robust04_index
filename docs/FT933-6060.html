			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Observer: Unchristian A burglar rifling a house was suddenly surprised by a voice saying: 'Me and Jesus are watching you.' Frightened, the burglar swung his torch round desperately until he spotted the culprit, a parrot. Recovering his composure, the burglar asked the parrot what it was called. 'Imogen', replied the bird. 'That's a silly name for a parrot', said the burglar. 'Not half as silly as calling a rottweiler Jesus', chirped the bird.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Jobs: Such are the laws of the jungle - The dynamics of organisational daftness that top managements do not see fit to study SUDDENLY the Jobs column understands how its family's spaniel Max must have felt when the unaccompanied bull mastiff began gnawing him the other day. True, I'd often heard fellow-journalists quoting 'dog eats dog' as a motto of our trade - a second is 'there's always another quarter of an hour' - but the meaning of the first one, at least, had never been really brought home to me. So it was in peaceful mood that I began thumbing through a slim volume sent in by Economist Books, called 'Pocket MBA' and evidently written mainly by The Economist's former management editor Tim Hindle. There was certainly nothing to ruffle the calm in the earlier chapters consisting of the usual propaganda for courses leading to master's degrees in business administration, a potted history of management literature and such, although I should perhaps have been warned by seeing that the bit on sources of business information nowhere mentions the Financial Times. Nor was my peace disturbed when the first item in the book's main section, a glossary of management ideas and gurus, turned out to have familiar associations. Headed 'Abilene Paradox', it read: 'A paradox first stated by an American psychologist called Jerry Harvey. He noticed that groups of people (committees, for example) often make decisions which, as individuals, they would consider to be silly . . . .' There didn't seem much wrong with that, apart from 'silly' being a poor substitute for the original formula's 'stupid'. So I skipped on through the glossary to the letter M. Whereupon the canines finally bit home. There before my eyes was the heading 'Macaulay's Transfer', followed by: 'A rule first stated by the historian Lord Macaulay'. Which set me wondering why the said lord was hogging the credit when all he did was explain why the old East India Company's on-the-spot executives, such as Clive, took such effective initiatives. Admittedly some of what they did was also reprehensible and would never have been approved by the board. But as Macaulay points out, if they had consulted their London-based directors, there wouldn't have been any effective action, because 'the average interval between the sending of a despatch and the receipt of an answer was above a year and a half '. There, however, the historian bows out of the act. The credit for first stating the rule based on his words - which reads: Initiative declines with increasing ease of communications - belongs to the Financial Times Jobs column. Indeed, like the Abilene Paradox, Macaulay's Transfer (alternatively entitled the 'Buck-shifter') is one of the Laws of Organisational Stupidity of which, for a decade now, I've been the official codifier. Nor are those two the only examples of the current 23 which the booklet has annexed. It's all my own fault, of course, for letting senile caution prevail over readers' requests. Every time I have introduced a new law - the last occasion was 14 months ago - numerous of you have got in touch asking me to set out the entire lot. But I've been chary of doing so. For one thing, yet another maxim of my trade holds that repeating material at too frequent intervals is akin to selling wet coke, and I printed the full code as it then existed as recently as autumn 1986. For another, as long as there was something else to write about, I felt it wiser to save the laws for a rainy day. Still, as the weather-proofing has not saved me from being nibbled, I'd better change my ways. The trouble is that even if I hadn't already wittered on for half the room available, the full laws just couldn't be stated in a single column. So I shall have to offer them chunk by chunk, spaced over the next few weeks. A further snag is that those of you who're familiar with the code will need to shut your eyes for a spell while, for the benefit of any less enduring readers present, I reiterate two basic points about the laws' status. The first is that they are not all of my own formulation. Some have been taken ready-made from famous authors, albeit with due acknowledgement, such as C. Northcote Parkinson's first law: Work expands to fill the time available. Still more of them were originated by various of you out there, my role being merely to tidy up the wording. An example is Mangham's Muffler, mis-named 'Maugham's' by the book, which was inspired by Bath University's Professor of Management Iain Mangham, and pronounces: When communicating to superiors, new news is bad news. The second point is that the laws are not of the inviolable kind exemplified by the law of gravity. Not only can they be broken, but when they are, the result is beneficial. What they define are simply regularities: events that occur continually in organisations of all kinds the whole world over. Accordingly, the laws' nearest parallel in established theory is economics. Indeed, an acid test of whether a proposed rule is fit to enter the canon, is whether it looks to be at least as reliable in predicting what actually happens as the laws of economics. There is nevertheless one key difference. Top executives believe in economics and study same on MBA courses and the like. The stupidity parallels are not studied on high, but just left to be suffered by those below. Hence, despite the teeth-marks, the Jobs column feels a touch grateful to the aforesaid Tim Hindle. After all, by putting some of the stupidity laws in a book with 'MBA' in its title, he has given the code what seems to be its first chance of being seriously studied where it counts. Even so, I do wish he'd got them right. For his presentation sometimes serves to obscure the real cause of the daft dynamics the laws describe  - which for those cited so far lies in power politics. Professor Parkinson saw the push to win power by amassing subordinates as underpinning his first law, although in the other instances the root is not so much the acquisition of power as top managers' yen for wielding it relentlessly over others. But that is hardly recognised by Mr Hindle's explanation for the Abilene Paradox, which goes: 'The group agrees to do a silly thing because each individual knows he or she can sidestep responsibility for the action of the group.' The reason offered by the originator Jerry Harvey was different. He attributed the lemming-like urge to go with the mob to the separate individuals' fear that dissent would lead them to be branded not-one-of-us, and have the skids put under them. The same often justified fear that outstanding deeds are more likely to bring punishments than rewards is also at the root of the two other laws I've quoted. Given the popularity of the phrase 'shoot the messenger', Mangham's Muffler needs no explanation. Nor does the decline of on-the-spot initiative when the risk of retribution can be minimised by swiftly passing the buck to power-loving bosses. Moreover the wisdom of safety play gives rise to a further law, Marshall's Metamorphosis. It was inspired by a certain educational inspector's comments on how futile it is for governments and other authorities which lay down rules to expect them to be followed broadly in the spirit instead of narrowly to the letter. It reads: Guidelines from superiors are straitjackets to subordinates.</p>

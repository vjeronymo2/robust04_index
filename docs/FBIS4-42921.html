			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Synthesis" of interview with Senate speaker Carlo </F> Scognamiglio by RAI Uno's Demetrio Volcic in Rome on 8 June,  reported by "ri.lu.": "Scognamiglio: `Senior Management Must  Be Appointed by the Government'" -- first paragraph is LA  REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- If it had been up to Carlo Scognamiglio, his  "colleague" Claudio Dematte [RAI chairman] and the other RAI  [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] wise men would not have been  pilloried. However, once the problem had hit the fan -- "due to  a number of newscasts which were too partisan" -- the Senate  speaker joined issue and, in an interview with TG1 [RAI  newscast] director Demetrio Volcic, which was broadcast  yesterday during the "23.00 Hours" program, he agreed with  [Prime Minister] Berlusconi on the fact that the public  broadcaster ought not be antigovernment, and he added that, in  the future, the company's top management ought to be appointed  by the government. Here is the gist of what he said.    [Volcic] Is it good or bad that the issue of the broadcast  media has been posed now, and in such terms?    [Scognamiglio] The problem must now be tackled, but it would  have been better if it had never been posed and if things could  have continued the normal way. However, I do not think that  this was a piece of naivety, but rather a reaction against an  attitude that called for such a reaction. What attitude? The  broadcast media in general, not only the RAI, were showing a  marked hostility toward the government. However, when a  political force becomes the "state," the tone used must be  adapted accordingly.    [Volcic] Do you think the RAI is too critical of Berlusconi?    [Scognamiglio] I think so. I do not watch TV very often, but  two days ago I watched the TG3 newscast, which was an example of  factiousness against the government.    [Volcic] Must the company's senior management go?    [Scognamiglio] The board of directors will stay legitimately  in office until the end of its term. Afterwards, in the  unfortunate event that once again the parliamentary speakers  are called upon to appoint the top management, I can anticipate  that another power-sharing agreement will not take place.    [Volcic] Who should appoint the RAI's board of directors?    [Scognamiglio] Just as in the United States the "agencies'"  top management is appointed by the government under the control  of a parliamentary commission, I believe that also in the RAI's  case the government should be entrusted with the task of  appointing the management, and the opposition forces should be  entrusted with the task of critically vetting the appointments  made.    [Volcic] Does this not involve the risk that the winning  tribe will eat up the losing tribe?    [Scognamiglio] In a democracy, every rule can be used  against  the majority eventually when citizens, through their vote,  decide to send the majority into opposition.    [Volcic] Would you place public broadcasting in the  government's hands?    [Scognamiglio] Information should remain neutral, but  someone  must be responsible for appointing the top management. Whoever  has been chosen by the citizens to govern the country must  assume responsibility for the appointments. The citizens will  judge.    [Volcic] Is this not an unrealistic position?    [Scognamiglio] In the United States, the vetting process  undergone by the government's appointees is such as to make it  very difficult for a professionally and morally unqualified  person to be vetted.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST SANDWICHES  </P> <P> Question: My children take peanut butter sandwiches to school every day. They  enjoy them, I've been told that peanut butter is nutritious, and the sandwiches  take very little time to prepare.  </P> <P> But I've noticed that there's usually a little bit of oil at the top of the  jar, and I'm becoming concerned that my children are getting too much  cholesterol. Would you please let me know how much cholesterol there is in  peanut butter, compared, for example, with a frankfurter? Which would be better  for them to have?  </P> <P> Answer: One frankfurter provides about 34 milligrams of cholesterol. Peanut  butter is not an animal product, and therefore does not contain any  cholesterol. On all counts, a peanut butter sandwich, particularly if prepared  with whole wheat bread, would be much more nutritious than a frankfurter.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Heads attack school rankings THE NATIONAL Association of Head Teachers yesterday set out its strong opposition to the government's planned league tables of school performance, on the eve of a speech to its annual conference by Mr John Patten, education secretary. Mr David Hart, general secretary, said when opening the conference in Newcastle that headteachers in England and Wales would continue to object to 'unfair and misleading' national league tables, even if the government decided to reform the national curriculum tests on which they were based. He said: 'We are opposed to league tables and the position is not just for this year . . . We would be opposed to league tables even if the tests had been reformed next year so that they were satisfactory. We are opposed to league tables pure and simple.' This afternoon delegates will debate a motion calling on Mr Patten to 'abandon any plans to press ahead with publication on a school by school basis'. An alternative motion 'deplores the league table mentality which has arisen to provide parents and the media with lists of meaningless examination statistics and attendance figures'. Mr Hart said he was under 'enormous pressure' from his members to withhold results from local education authorities, and reveal them only to pupils, parents and governors. The three largest teachers' unions are refusing to implement the tests, which are due to start in schools in England and Wales next week. In a statement last night Mr Patten said: 'The essence of professionalism is an openness to scrutiny. Everyone - taxpayers, employers and the wider community, as well as parents - has a right to know how all schools are performing and whether standards are improving.'</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / French ex-PM investigated over tainted blood Former prime minister Laurent Fabius was yesterday placed under formal investigation for being 'an accomplice to the poisoning' of more than 1,000 haemophiliacs who received transfusions of blood contaminated with the HIV virus - believed to lead to Aids - up to mid-1985, when he was head of the French government. The long saga of France's HIV-blood case thus entered a new phase, as Mr Fabius joined two of his former social affairs and health ministers - Mrs Georgina Dufoix and Mr Edmond Herve - under investigation on the same charge of conspiracy to poison. Mr Fabius has denied knowing anything about the contaminated blood until the summer of 1985, when he ordered compulsory testing of blood donors for HIV. 'I go into this investigation with much compassion for those who fell ill, and their families, and strongly determined to establish the truth,' he said yesterday. The investigation by senior magistrates, expected to take up to a year, could eventually lead to the three Socialist ex-ministers going on trial before a special court of MPs, senators and judges. In 1989, the French state conceded general responsibility to the haemophiliacs, some 400 of whom have since died of their infection, by deciding to give FFr100,000 (Pounds 12,000) compensation each to survivors. This did not, however, lessen pressure for more specific action to be taken against those running the health service and its blood bank. Two years ago, two health officials were jailed for fraud for distributing the tainted blood products. Out of this case came charges that the real culprits were government ministers, who failed to heed the officials' warnings, but who could not be tried under ordinary French law. A move was made to impeach the ministers, but this procedure was held to be too self-serving because it gave the parliament, then controlled by the Socialists, the role of bringing charges as well as judging them. Last year's constitutional reform gave the haemophiliacs' association the right to take their complaints against ex-ministers directly to a panel of senior magistrates, who will now undertake the investigation. Mrs Dufoix has summed up the ex-ministers' attitude in proclaiming that she is 'responsible (in a political sense) but not guilty (of any crime)'. The investigation will centre on what the ex-ministers knew about the risk of HIV contamination, when they first received this information, and what they did to prevent the spread of infection. One of the more serious allegations is that the government, or at least senior officials in it, deliberately delayed approval for the distribution in France of a US HIV test in order to protect the market for a similar French test then in development.</p>

This Time the Parliament  Raised No Objections"]    [Excerpts] The latest session of the Georgian parliament  was not marked by any particular upheavals: In a brief  presentation Shevardnadze outlined his position on the  expediency of the state of emergency, and, stressing that the  emergency regime has prevented an outbreak of a full-scale civil  war and helped accomplish successful operations to destroy  criminal gangs, proposed that it should be extended to continue  the struggle against banditry. The parliamentarians did not  object, and yesterday the head of state signed a corresponding  document. [passage omitted]    From time to time high-ranking officials of various services  start talking about the need to involve the Russian Army to  restore law and order. All this, amid a recent statement by  parliament speaker Vakhtang Goguadze on the need to enter the  ruble zone and also to seek assistance from the Russian Army,  aroused a stormy protest from the opposition.    Eduard Shevardnadze himself made a rather vague statement on  this score: Apparently Western expert advice should be sought  on the issue of the ruble zone, while crime should be combated  with our own resources. This, however, only added fuel to the  fire. In particular Irina Sarishvili, a leader of the National  Democratic Party and former vice premier, observed sarcastically  that if things go on like this, soon Georgia will ask for  ministers from Moscow to be invited to run the country.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile on the question of additional Russian troops being  brought into Georgia, the command of the Russian army group in  the Transcaucasus made it clear that its position on this  question does not play a decisive role and that everything  depends on the Russian Defense Ministry.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government demands that the Cease-Fire  Commission [CCF] immediately investigate the disappearance of  (Renuge Paconote), main witness of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] in the accusation that the Mozambican  Government is training a battalion in Nachingwea. In the  document, the government's delegation to the CCF says Renamo's  verbal accusation that the government abducted (Renuge Paconote)  in the city of Nampula is outrageous. The government delegation  says it regrets the undignified attitude of the head of the  Renamo delegation to the commission and adds that to make  unfounded accusations, kidnap witnesses, and pretend to be  innocent is to be simultaneously plaintiff and judge. (Renuge  Paconote), a former government soldier, has alleged that the  government is training a battalion in Tanzania. He went missing  after the first session on the issue was held. In the CCF  meeting held on 19 May the government requested the suspension  of the investigations on the alleged training of the battalion  because the main witness was missing.</p>

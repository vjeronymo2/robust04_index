			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Ex-envoy contradicts Hurd over aid-arms linkage Britain's former high commissioner to Malaysia yesterday contradicted claims made by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that an offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam had been 'disentangled' from sales of defence equipment. Sir Nicholas Spreckley told the House of Commons foreign affairs committee that a complex mathematical formula linking the aid and defence deals in a protocol signed in March 1988 had not been discarded by the UK government when concluding final negotiations over aid for Malaysia. Instead, he told MPs that the formula - which Malaysian negotiators had insisted on when drawing up the protocol on defence sales - had determined the UK's decision to offer about Pounds 200m to Malaysia later that year. Sir Nicholas's testimony contradicted claims made by Mr Hurd and by Lord Younger, the former defence secretary - who also gave evidence to the committee yesterday - that there was no long-term linkage between aid and defence contracts signed with the Malaysians in 1988. The committee is investigating Britain's decision to give Malaysia Pounds 234m to help build the Pergau dam, a decision that members of the Overseas Development Administration have described as 'a very bad buy'. It is also examining whether ministers broke Whitehall and international guidelines by linking aid money to defence contracts. Last week, Mr Hurd told the committee that there had been 'a brief entanglement' between aid and trade in a protocol signed by Lord Younger, in March 1988. But the foreign secretary strongly argued that ministers sought to 'disentangle' the contracts later that year, pursuing them as two distinct projects. to avoid breaking the guidelines prohibiting linkage. Sir Nicholas admitted yesterday that, after Lord Younger had returned from Kuala Lumpur, ministers wanted to remove a clause in the protocol which offered Malaysia up to 20 per cent of the Pounds 1bn sale of defence equipment in the form of aid money. Sir Nicholas said he advised ministers that if that clause were withdrawn, 'something had to be put in its place, something that would bear comparison'. He told the committee a promise of up to Pounds 200m for development projects made in a letter of June 28 1988 to the Malaysian government was a technical restatement of the formula in the original protocol. Lord Younger denied that '20 per cent' had been a 'shaping figure' in negotiations but admitted he alone had agreed to the inclusion of the aid formula in the arms contract. In contrast to Mr Hurd, he said the protocol did not link arms and aid, because the document had no 'executive role'. He also said Lord Howe, then foreign secretary, had agreed that the protocol did not make a firm commitment of aid. Lord Younger also said he had held discussions with Foreign Office officials on the nature of his trip before flying to Kuala Lumpur in March 1988. Malaysia still cool, Page 7</p>

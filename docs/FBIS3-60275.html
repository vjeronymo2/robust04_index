Speaking to the state news agency, JAMPRESS, Douglas said  the  move is to protect the island's delicate ecology, regarded as "a  national asset." The environment minister said his government  also intended to institute a licence, which would be necessary  for any type of significant development, industrial or  otherwise, of interest to the environment.    The Natural Resources Conservation Development Authority  (NRCA) would be the body responsible for granting such licences,  Douglas said. And there would be close collaboration with the  Town and Country Planning Department to avoid duplication and to  better co- ordinate and speed up the process, he added.    Douglas repeated previous announcements that steps were  being  taken to have the Cockpit Country and the Black River area  designated as national parks. He observed that action would soon  be taken to clean up the Kingston Harbour which was badly  polluted in some parts. The main contaminants are sewage and  chemical residue from the 21 gullies and mains which emptied  their contents into it. The environment minister also said the  city's sewerage system is to be upgraded.</p>

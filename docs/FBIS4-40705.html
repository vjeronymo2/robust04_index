			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Marchenko] Elements of the Ukrainian  Interior Ministry's special forces arrived in Simferopol last  night. Aleksey Tkach, deputy head of the Republic's Interior  Ministry explained the aim of the deployment for our radio  station.    [Begin Tkach recording] Yes, it is true that such an outfit  was deployed. They are special forces from the 21st special  detachment. The aim of their transfer is, generally speaking,  the situation that has emerged in connection with the fact that  the Crimean golden eagles [berkuty] are not carrying out their  duties. Around a third of the Crimean golden eagles are busy  guarding [Crimean President] Meshkov and [Crimean Interior  Minister] Kuznetsov himself. They are not looking after public  order. [end recording]    [Marchenko] We asked the Crimean interior minister, Valeriy  Kuznetsov, to comment on this statement by the Ukrainian  Interior Ministry.    [Begin Kuznetsov recording] There is no slacking. The  Interior Ministry of the Crimean Republic is fulfilling its  obligations. I will tell you one thing: They [Ukraine] are  doing everything in their power now to dissolve the Interior  Ministry of the Crimean Republic, which is against the  Constitution of the Crimean Republic and even Ukraine's law on  delegating powers. They are breaking a lot of the laws of both  Ukraine and Crimea. [end recording]</p>

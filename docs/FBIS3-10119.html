			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Attorney General Telesforo Guerra Cahn has charged:  "A well-known political party and radical groups are plotting  against the executive to weaken it to the extreme of creating  total anarchy."    The attorney general has referred to the strike of  government  professionals and bureaucrats during the past days. He has said  it was a clear example of the plan being implemented by the  mentioned sectors, which, by the way, have not agreed to  negotiate with executive representatives.    When one studies seriously the actions taken to end the  strike of the workers, who are demanding a wage increase, you  will notice there have been several officials who have disobeyed  the president's orders, Guerra has stated.    He has cited the case of the San Juan de Dios Hospital  directors who have refused to comply with the law and write the  corresponding reports against the striking workers and, in  addition, have decided to resign as a whole. This, he has said,  is evidence they are being manipulated by the destabilizing  groups I have mentioned.    The attorney general has said the decisions made lately by  many judges is another act included in the plot. The rulings  attempt to mock government officials who have started actions to  get work to advance in the proper legal framework.    Although the health workers and those in the municipal  cemetery were acting illegally, a judge ordered their release  last week and opened a criminal case against representatives of  the Attorney General's Office, he has reported.    Guerra has also said a judge had rejected the charges  presented against the strikers who occupied the National Palace.  Obviously, he said, an illegal action was committed there.  Furthermore, an amparo was presented to order the bureaucrats  to reinitiate the rendering of basic services to the public,  and, up to now, nothing has been resolved on this issue.    Attorney General Guerra has said he believed there is an  attempt to weaken the government's authority and to confuse  public opinion to get it to believe there is a power vacuum.</p>

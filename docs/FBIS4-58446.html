			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ehud Ya'ari studio report from Cairo -- live] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The next central issue, if I  may call it that, is the fact that last night -- and so far I  have not heard that this has changed -- 'Arafat told the  Americans, Rabin, and Mubarak that he is not ready to  immediately send in a large police force into the Gaza Strip.  Therefore, the implementation of the agreement in practice, the  practical handing over of the keys, may last more than the seven  days which were initially scheduled for the initial assumption  of power by 'Arafat's forces in Rafah and Jericho.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Cannibalism in Kilburn - Radio THE 1968 Sunday play on Radio 3 was, as I warned, Edward Bond's Early Morning, which the Royal Court reckoned a factor in the end of theatre censorship. The scheduled opening, confined to club members, was halted by the police, but some of us were at the dress rehearsal; and in the evening there was a 'teach-in' about restrictions in the arts, where I sat between Mick Jagger and Tom Driberg. John Calder was sound on the censorship of literature; but later interventions, by William Gaskill, Bond, David Mercer and John Arden were increasingly unpractical. As for the play, now adapted for radio by the author and directed by David Benedictus, it seemed less amusing than it did in 1968, so many of its outrages barely being outrages at all today. In Queen Victoria's reign, Disraeli and Prince Albert are planning a revolution. The Queen (Margaret Courtenay) is in love with Florence Nightingale, whom she calls Freddie. The heir to the throne is Prince George, a Siamese twin with his brother Prince Arthur. At first it is fun to hear anachronistic and common talk in the mouths of such folk, but one gets tired of it, and the story, which includes actual and metaphorical cannibalism, in Kilburn High Road and in Heaven, is too unlikely to arouse any real indignation. Later in that year the Lord Chamberlain lost his power of censorship, but not, I suspect, on account of Early Morning. Last night I made what I mean to be my final dip into 1968, Caryl Churchill's half-hour Identical Twins. I could not miss this, being one myself. I thought it fair romantic comedy but without much dramatic use of of the identicalness of the twins. As I see it, her point is that, however alike your looks and upbringing, your characters may not be so. Speaking from inside, I think this is on the whole unusual. Both twins were played by Kenneth Haigh, sometimes in unison. John Tydeman directed. Radio 4's Monday Play, for 1993, was Peter Tinniswood's The Governor's Consort, about Lady Edith (an earl's daughter?) sailing out to a fictional south Atlantic island colony where her husband is to be Governor. En route, her husband dies and the ship's captain commits suicide, but the unmoved Lady Edith is offered intimacy by the Chief Engineer, a doctor and a waiter. Ultimately her cabin is entered by a figure from her youth; but, as I had guessed halfway through, it was all imagination. Tinniswood is always amusing, and Mary Wimbush, for whom the play was written, was splendid; but this was a bit too easy. The Prospect of Hanging is a curious theme for Radio 4 on a Sunday evening when the week's news was mainly of murder. But it covered no more than Martyn Wiley's interview with a retired hangman. Syd Dearnley seemed a decent fellow and old prejudices could have been suspended by the end of the programme. He had been a welder in Mansfield, as much interested in crime as any other reader of crime stories, and at age 27 applied for the job of assistant executioner at Lincoln prison. The procedure he described - leg straps, arm straps, hood, lever - was done in a very short time, in one recorded case, 7 1/2 seconds and sounds singularly unbrutal. 'I had no qualms,' Dearnley said. 'It suited me and got me an extra pint or two of beer.' It goes on no longer, but lovers of statistics might learn that the rope was 10ft 6in long, and the trap measured 7ft 6in by 4ft 6in. More detail can be found in Charles Duff's Handbook on Hanging, even more from James Berry's My Experiences as an Executioner, unlikely to be still in print. Neither is liable to follow this programme on Radio 4 on a Sunday evening.</p>

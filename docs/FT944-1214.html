			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Court seeks talks on Cadillac debt An Ontario court has ordered Goldman Sachs and Cadillac Fairview, one of Canada's biggest property groups, to negotiate further on ways to restructure more than CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) of Cadillac debt. The New York investment banker went to court on Monday in Toronto asking the judge to put Cadillac under the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. Goldman indirectly holds CDollars 1bn of Cadillac's senior debt on which interest is in default, and could legally force Cadillac to reorganise under court protection. The judge gave temporary assent, but Cadillac's lawyers soon obtained a reversal. Mr Justice James Farley directed Goldman and Cadillac to meet this week and negotiate on the financial restructuring. Cadillac is protected from legal action until both parties reappear in court this Friday. Goldman believes Cadillac's restructuring could be achieved faster under court protection, with better terms for senior creditors. Debt would be converted to equity and senior debt holders would end up with 93 per cent control.</p>

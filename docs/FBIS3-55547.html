Officials in the president's press service told  Interfax that it will start with a speech by the oldest deputy,  Georgiy Lukava, of the Liberal Democratic Party.    After that, deputies will hear a report of the Central  Election Commission on the elections to the State Duma, elect a  commission to supervise the operation of the electronic voting  system, as well as elect a counting commission and a provisional  secretariat of the State Duma, and discuss the procedural rules  on parliamentary groups.    Following that, the organizing committee wants to have a  break for the formation of a parliamentary group. The Duma must  approve the minimal size of the group to be registered. Figures  such as 14, 20, and 50 deputies have been suggested.</p>

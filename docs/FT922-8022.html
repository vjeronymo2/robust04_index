			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television One of the highlights of the week is Paul Merton's contribution to the BBC2 quiz Have I Got News For You (10.00). The lines delivered by chairman Angus Deayton are often funny, but so they should be since his are scripted. Merton is working off the top of his head (or perhaps the seat of his pants) yet his jokes, delivered with marvellous casualness, are almost always fast, dry and sharp. Sometimes they sound, to a non libel specialist, hair-raisingly close to actionable. At 10.30 you can switch from the end of that Hat Trick Production to the beginning of another: Clive Anderson Talks Back on C4. Here the chairman from 'Whose Line Is It Anyway', which brought Paul Merton to our attention, runs a chat show which is funny and in which the egos of chairman and guest are just about equally served. Since the talented Rory Bremner is now doing another batch of his impressioist/comedy series on BBC2 at 9.00 Friday has become rather a good evening for laughter. Just for a change BBC2 launches a series about Spain. To be fair, this one, Spain On A Plate, is about cookery, which should make a change from Spanish history (7.30).</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Caution continues DEALERS in most European cash and futures markets continued to be very cautious about the prospect for further monetary policy easing in Europe after the Bundesbank's rate cut on Thursday, writes James Blitz. Dealers in German markets continued to take the view that the  1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate was a technical move to restore a gap between the repo rate and the interest rate floor - and that this may have been the last policy easing before November. The near-term Euromark futures contracts continued to fall back, as they did on Thursday. The December contract was down 5 basis points at 94.03 at the close. Conditions in the cash market were not a lot easier than they had been on Thursday, with call money being quoted in a broad range of seven to 7.25 per cent. The market continued to be dogged by the low level of bidding in the weekly repo and the recent low usage of rediscount funds. In the French market, interest rate futures were a little stronger towards the end of trading, partly because of the franc's better performance against the D-Mark in the European afternoon. The December contract was trading at around 93.99 towards the close, up 4 basis points on the day. The Belgian franc futures market continued to look as though it belonged to a different epoch of trading. The September contract rose 105 basis points, to close at around 90.50, indicating expectations of sharp cuts in rates. This followed Belgium's cut in its important central rate by  1/4 of a percentage point, to 10.25 per cent, on Thursday. The cut in Belgian official rates has been accompanied by a dramatic fall in 3 month money this week from about 13 per cent on Monday to around 9 1/2 per cent yesterday. But the Belgian authorities are clearly not prepared to decouple interest rate policy from the Bundesbank. Sterling interest rate futures were given a slight lift from the latest trade figures, which showed a slight narrowing in the deficit. The December contract rose 3 basis points to close at 94.39. Conditions in the cash market were soft after the easy removal of a Pounds 700m shortage. Three month money again closed at around 5 7/8 per cent, but with a slightly narrower spread.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The United  States and the European Union agreed today to open government  contracts to competitive bids, except those of  telecommunications, U.S. and EU trade representatives said here  today.    Under the accord, European enterprises will have the right  to  compete for public bids in 39 U.S. states while American  manufacturers of heavy-electrical equipment will be able to  increase sales to state-owned utilities in Europe.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU trade chief  Leon Brittan made the announcement at a joint press conference  in the city, where 120 ministers are meeting to sign the Uruguay  round of trade accord reached last December under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Kantor said that the accord, to be signed Friday within the  Uruguay round framework, will allow the two sides access to  markets worth some 200 billion U.S. dollars.    But the public market of telecommunications in Europe,  coveted by U.S. firms, still remains to be discussed here later.    Kantor and Brittan had met several times outside the  ministerial meeting of GATT, which opened Tuesday in this  Moroccan city and will last till Friday.</p>

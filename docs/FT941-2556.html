			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Fishing: Fine chub save the day or rather staring into mid-air with the end of my pen in my mouth - when a thought struck me. It was not a thought conducive to completing the tedious task on which I was engaged. But it was one of those thoughts which demands immediate action - like the realisation that you have forgotten your mother's birthday or left the garden hose running. It was that if I did not go fishing immediately, I would have no further opportunity before the coarse fishing season closed in a few days. Outside the sun was shining, the birds were chirruping, the daffodils were just blooming, and the river - in my mind's eye - was running clear and sparkling. An internal debate between duty and inclination was brief, and within the hour I was by the water. I had decided that I would catch perch to begin with, spinning; then one or two of the sizeable roach which had long eluded me, on floatfished bread; and finally a hard-fighting barbel of seven or eight pounds, on a helping of Sainsbury's breakfast slice, which I had been assured was the barbel bait of the moment. At 5pm - with an hour of daylight on my last fishing day remaining - I had caught neither perch, nor roach, nor barbel, nor anything else. What is more, I had endured a series of trifling misfortunes. I confess that some of these were self-inflicted. It was absurd to believe that I could successfully flit from species to species, and method to method. I should have identified one target, and gone for it. And I should have remembered to bring a stool to sit on, and not relied on the ground - for a damp backside in chill March is no laughing matter. On the question of my wet feet, I am prepared to accept some of the blame. I knew that my right gumboot had a leak, and was careful to keep it out of the water. But how was I to know that the left one had developed a gash as if attacked by a maniac with a butcher's knife? I soon found out. All right, I should have been alert enough to prevent Bertie the spaniel stealing half the packet of breakfast slice; and I should not have been so careless as to cast into the upper branches of the alder opposite. As you may have gathered by now, the idyllic quality of the day as I had imagined it had departed. All these incidental irritations would have been negligible, if I could have caught something. This is what most aggrieved me  -the obstinate, unreasoning refusal of the fish to bite. As the evening drew in, so my frown grew deeper. Then I had another thought. I should be after fish that were permanently hungry. That meant chub. Only the chub could save me. I hastened to the millpool below the house. And there, on the remains of the breakfast slice, I caught five fine, fat chub. The bites were bold, the fights in the foaming water strong and satisfying. I applied myself intently and intelligently, and all the fondness for the chub that I had had as a boy  -as a fish which could be depended on - returned. The last was the best, a good 4lb. As I slid the net beneath its gleaming, silver flanks, I murmured my appreciation for the inspiration which had come to me that morning - and for a day redeemed from disaster.</p>

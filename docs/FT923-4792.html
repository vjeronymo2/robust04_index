			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / BBC plans return to its roots: Blueprint reveals strategy to quit 'derivative formula' programmes THE BBC plans to return to its public service origins in order to justify its future. Confidential documents prepared for the corporation's board of management and governors show that the BBC is planning to abandon programmes already provided by commercial rivals. Instead, the BBC will concentrate on what is distinctive to it and what it believes the commercial market will not provide. What the draft report describes as 'derivative formula' comedy shows and unchallenging game shows will be dispensed with. There is still uncertainty in the BBC about what a policy of going for 'the higher ground' would mean in programming terms. Home produced soaps such as EastEnders would probably survive, but not necessarily cheap bought-in programmes such as Neighbours. The blueprint for the future of the BBC under Mr John Birt, who takes over as director general on March 1, was due to be published later this autumn. The intention was to publish the document after a green paper on the future of the corporation, expected in early October. A copy of the blueprint arrived at Broadcast magazine, the industry trade magazine, on Tuesday after the furore about the future of the BBC at the Edinburgh Television Festival last weekend. In an important paragraph, the report says: 'The BBC will need to withdraw from areas in which it is no longer able or needed to make an original contribution.' In trying to come to terms with the intensified competition from commercial and satellite television the BBC emphasises, however, that it must avoid the 'cultural ghetto' that weakened public broadcasting in the US and Australia. It concludes instead that the BBC of the 1990s 'should offer a range of distinctive, high-quality programme services in each of the major genres. That range should encompass programming that appeals to a broad viewing and listening audience as well as programming which meets specific needs and interests of smaller audiences'. The BBC has decided to set itself four main tasks: the provision of news and information to support fair and informed national debate; development and expression of British culture and entertainment; programmes and services creating opportunities for education; interchange of culture and ideas between Britain and abroad. On this basis, the BBC will ask the government to renew its Royal Charter in 1996 and the universal licence which finances the corporation. The details include a continuous news service on radio and a 24-hour satellite and cable television news service, as well as the restoration of the corporation's reputation for drama in order to make the BBC 'the National Theatre of the airwaves'. Above all else, the BBC points to the need to 'limit and define' its specific role as a public service broadcaster in the face of rapidly growing competition.</p>

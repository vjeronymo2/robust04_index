			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Mammon under a pall: Despite the war Kuwait, and its absentee citizens are still obsessed by money ON THE road north from Saudi Arabia towards Kuwait City the sky ahead turns from the dark purple of a summer thunderstorm to the deep black of ecological disaster and the mid-afternoon sun becomes as easily viewed as the midnight moon. A few cars bearing Free Kuwait stickers and loaded high with possessions are also heading north, but there is little sense of anticipation and every indication, once through the border, that the euphoria of liberation has long since dissipated. At the International Hotel in Kuwait City, opposite the fortified American embassy, the management insists on guests signing their credit card charge slips in advance, before handing over the key to a Dollars 200-a-night room which has no lock. The unstated fear is that the new wave of hotel guests, many of them nationals from the countries which helped to drive Saddam Hussein's troops out of Kuwait will, like the occupants from August 2 to February 26, depart without paying. It is a precaution that might seem prudent or depressing. Perhaps it merely provides confirmation that the trauma of occupation did not have much effect on the primary historic concern of Kuwait: making money. A sense of national identity is never more fiercely put to the test than by foreign invasion. In Kuwait, it is the financial drive of the citizens which so far seems to have survived unscathed. And it is fitting that among the least damaged buildings in town, down to its crystal ashtrays, white leather settees and original oil paintings, is the one housing the Central Bank. Kuwait, during the the 1970s, prided itself on being the smartest, sharpest, most cosmopolitan and liberal of the Gulf emirates. Nationals privately mocked the provincial Saudis and were dismissive of Qataris and Bahrainis. Kuwait's Fund for Future Generations, into which 10 per cent of oil revenues was automatically diverted, emphasised national foresight while its policy of building equity stakes in large international companies demonstrated its political self-confidence. At the dawn of the 1980s Kuwait's annual investment income was reckoned to have surpassed its oil revenues. At the then current rates of depletion its hydrocarbons reserves were good for a couple of hundred years. The joke used to be that in order to derive full benefit from the all-embracing welfare state which such affluence spawned, it was necessary to make one huge sacrifice - to live in Kuwait. But it was an expatriate's joke. The Kuwaitis knew better, and spent a good part of their year showing their wisdom by living abroad. Which is where the majority of them were when Iraq invaded, are today, and where many more are planning to be as temperatures soar in the next couple of months. For the non-Kuwaiti visitor it takes a while to adjust to the impression that there are few, if any, Kuwaitis involved in the actual physical reconstruction of their country. In part, this could be because an estimated 350,000 of Kuwait's 650,000 citizenry is out of the country, but more relevant is the assumption among Kuwaitis that generally they do not involve themselves in manual labour. Thus, for most of the day, the streets of central Kuwait City are empty, still unswept and littered with the residue of war. But enter one of the official buildings slowly returning to life and young men will invariably be found near the entrance, often with guns, certainly with cigarettes, lolling, laughing and seemingly indifferent to the squalor around them. They know that eventually it will be cleaned up, although how quickly is one of the multitude of issues awaiting resolution in post-occupation Kuwait. Officially, the Cabinet table is groaning under the weight of the agenda resting upon it. Almost every question that could be asked of a modern state is being posed. Should the hereditary monarchy continue, be replaced by, or share power with an elected assembly? Who is a citizen? What should the size of population be? Should women be allowed to vote? Should the welfare state continue? How can the country defend itself? Should foreign troops remain on Kuwaiti sand? And, depending on those answers, what the country's immediate and medium financial strategy should be at a time when perhaps three or more times its normal daily output of oil is going up in smoke. It is not easy to discover how, by whom and with what urgency these issues are being approached. The signals are confusing. One evening, illegally sipping a Chablis bottled while Kuwait was still only a gleam in Saddam's eye, and looking out over the freshly-filled swimming pool of a local businessman, the conversation alternated between the responsibility of the individual in the modern state, the absurdity of expecting anything from the newly-appointed government, the disappointing performance of property prices in London and the basic decency of the local Iraqi battalion commander during the occupation. The next evening it was alcohol again, this time offered by young men at the kerbside who from the back of their car dispensed scotch or vodka in celebration of what they hoped would be an explosion of booze and bars in the one country in the Gulf which had banned even resident diplomats from importing liquor. As their friends noisily challenged fate from the back of high-powered motorcycles, the young men explained that they did not mind too much about democracy, just about bars. In the public areas of the International Hotel, the well-fed but disgruntled business community of Kuwait, including former Ministers, seemed to be in almost permanent session. Their attitude to the composition of the new Cabinet made the reaction of the British Labour Party towards Margaret Thatcher's selections over the past decade seem generous by comparison. But it was also possible to sense, not too far below the surface, that this view might be tempered if certain large re-supply contracts were to be sensitively awarded. Indeed, official dispensation of national wealth remains the essence of government in Kuwait. Fewer than 4 per cent of Kuwaitis operate in the private sector and for the past nine months those outside the country have been in large part funded by their local embassies. Lack of domestic investment opportunities, an excess of funds and a belief that the government would ultimately bail out all but the most extravagant debtors shaped Kuwaiti attitudes during the 1970s. For gamblers it was paradise. At the end of that decade it led to the creation and subsequent spectacular collapse of a secondary stock market based on Kuwaiti-owned offshore companies which existed in little more than name and were not required to issue balance sheets. A combination of reckless greed, government indifference, and a trading system based on post-dated cheques left an astonishing Dollars 90bn (Pounds 53bn) of worthless notes in circulation. The effects of the 1982 Souk al-Manakh crash had still not been fully resolved when Iraq invaded. The opposition in Kuwait, which even in its present loose, unstructured, unthreatening form is being harried by the government, fairly points out that the administration which was responsible for failing to forestall either the Souk al Manakh disaster or the Iraqi invasion cannot, with entire confidence, be trusted to oversee the country's reconstruction. Yet for the foreseeable future, it will be. The first stage, dismissively referred to by some local businessman as 'faucet-fixing', has almost been completed. The US Army Corps of Engineers, operating from the 16th floor of the Plaza Hotel without air conditioning, generously insists on sharing the credit with Kuwaiti engineers for having restored essential services to the city, but its role is concluding. In the oilfields to the north and south of Kuwait City the bigger and most awesome physical part of the battle to return the nation to normality has been joined. To be in the pitch-black mid-morning darkness of the fields, amid the roar and shriek of the burning wells, is to experience both the frightening power of natural forces and the horror that can be ignited by one man. It is also to appreciate the daily caution and courage needed by the men seeking to extinguish the fires in circumstances which can change with the perilous suddenness suffered so devastatingly less than a fortnight ago by two Financial Times colleagues: Alan Harper, who took the front page photograph, and David Thomas, the newspaper's Natural Resources Editor. Scarcely less shockingly impressive is the devastation wreaked by the Allied forces on the retreating remnants of Saddam's army. On the Mutla ridge, north of Kuwait City, where the lraqi army was squeezed into a fatal funnel by its own minefields, military and civilian vehicles lie in brown, burned lines by the roadside, disturbed only by souvenir hunters, the verges still littered with discarded military clothing. Even so, clearing the wreckage will be easier than the subsequent stages of reconstruction which become progressively more difficult as they have to be placed within the context of an overall political vision. The Cabinet remains largely silent on these issues. The Emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who is assumed by most Kuwaitis to be in failing health, has promised a more participatory form of government, but his cousin, Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah has yet to flesh out the plans. In the coming weeks tens of thousands more Kuwaitis will return home, although the government expects that they will do so primarily to initiate work on the refurbishment of their homes, and will then depart again for the summer. The opportunities for consultation remain restricted. Perhaps by September more than 60 per cent of Kuwait's nationals will be, more or less permanently, in residence. How many more will follow could depend on how the government decides to resolve the issue of non-Kuwaiti labour. Senior Kuwaitis, including members of the al-Sabah family, argue that the pre-war population of close to 2m should be scaled down to about 1.3m. This means, as one member of the ruling family put it, 'thinning out' the Palestinian presence and clearing out the Yemenis, Jordanians and Sudanese, all of whom were deemed to have collaborated with the occupying forces or at least supported Iraq's invasion. The government has admitted that there were serious human rights abuses in the days immediately after liberation when retribution was taken against those who had most openly assisted the Iraqis, but claims this has stopped. Yet reports of torture persist. International frustration is meanwhile growing. Apart from the oil sector, the expected bonanza of profitable reconstruction contracts has not been forthcoming, in spite of a series of western ministerial visits alternately pleading for business and warning against further abuses of human rights. What, perhaps, should be slowly dawning on the world's business community is that the primary concern for the government is not spending what it has, but exploring every possible avenue for raising funds from others. In particular Kuwait hopes to persuade Saudi Arabia and other Gulf friends to sell oil on its behalf until it can again resume exporting. It is all a far cry from whatever sense of idealism was thought to have accompanied the Allied military action. The people of Kuwait suffered; many families still bear the mental and physical scars of occupation. The Kurds have suffered far, far more. Less than an hour's drive from Kuwait City in southern Iraq, the people of the impoverished town of Safwan are waiting for the return of Saddam's police under the umbrella of a UN observer force. The people of Kuwait were, in immediate human terms, the sole beneficiaries of an extraordinary international effort. They should not be surprised if their response is assessed against that sombre background.</p>

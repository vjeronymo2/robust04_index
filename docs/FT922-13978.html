			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Cambodians take the first steps on the road back to normality / Sensing recovery in the air after 20 years of civil war GOING to the seaside on a Sunday may not sound like a big deal to most people, but the arrival of carloads of day-trippers at the southern Cambodian resort of Kep each weekend is a sign of how the country is groping for normality after 20 years of slaughter and civil war. The town and its luxury villas were destroyed long ago, and today the only inhabitants are a few squatters living in the ruins and a lone elephant contentedly munching grass near the beach. Holidaymakers return to the capital, Phnom Penh, before dark to avoid the depredations of drunken, unpaid soldiers on the road home. A hint of recovery, however, is in the air. One businessman is building a bar in Kep, and others have laid claim to plots of land in what used to be the town centre. Vendors offer fresh boiled crab and rice, and Tiger beer imported from Singapore. And at least the road is open; it used to be the haunt of Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The confidence inspired by the peace accord signed in Paris last October and by the arrival of UN troops in Cambodia is equally visible in the battered but still charming riverside town of Kampot 25km to the west. Long-neglected hotels are being refurbished, and the welcome signs at the entrances to the town are freshly painted. On the bumpy road to Phnom Penh, peasants are taking live pigs to market in baskets on the back of their mopeds, or driving bullock carts loaded with timber to sawmills further north. Fish, meat and fruit appear to be plentiful. In the capital itself there is feverish economic activity. Ships which have come up the Mekong River unload cargoes of imported motorcycles, cars, clothes, beer and soft drinks in the heart of Phnom Penh (a safer route, the shippers say, than the road from the main seaport of Kompong Som); new and refurbished hotels offering satellite telephone calls are doing brisk business; market women are selling decorative plants; the Cafe No Problem serves champagne and French cheeses and boasts a billiard table; and luxury cars are again on display in the Peugeot showroom. Ms Geraldine Seng Mealy, a 29-year-old half-Khmer Frenchwoman, has sold imported Yves Rocher beauty products in a small shop on the city's main boulevard since December. It was, she believes, the first foreign shop to open in Phnom Penh after the peace accord. These days she also has a line of locally made toys and textiles. At the museum, staff of the Australian National Gallery are preparing the catalogue for an exhibition of Khmer artefacts in Canberra, and wondering how to help the Cambodians protect priceless sculptures from the thousands of bats in the ceilings which defecate onto the exhibits. Freelance Cambodian taxi-drivers who could barely handle their borrowed government cars four months ago are negotiating the city's increasingly crowded streets with confidence. They are also paying to learn English at roadside schools, or studying Soviet textbooks containing less than useful phrases such as: 'Could you explain to me what the term 'socialist realism' means?' Foreign investors, many from Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, are looking for opportunities, and consultants Ernst and Young have set up shop in Phnom Penh. Western and Japanese investors remain generally cautious, although several companies have won rights to explore for oil offshore. Few would begrudge Cambodia its recovery, but aid workers are concerned about the speculative and corrupt nature of the capital's economic boom. Almost all investment so far has been in services - property (often of doubtful legal title), hotels, banking and trade - rather than in industry or agriculture. A request for a Cambodian product - any Cambodian product - at a stall in the central market produced only a packet of batteries made in Thailand. Import-export companies do a great deal of importing and very little exporting, and such exports as there are - timber, for example - are largely uncontrolled and unsustainable. The capital's numerous pharmacies, meanwhile, sell drugs given by aid agencies to Cambodia, and hypodermic needles labelled 'Unicef' (the UN Children's Fund). Down in Kampot, residents are still fearful of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and landmines in the hills, while the government soldiers and policemen have only just been paid their wages for January. Mr Nop Phan, a 20-year-old soldier lying in Kampot hospital, testifies to the fact that Cambodians will continue suffering the effects of war, regardless of any economic recovery, long after UN forces have left the country. He was looking for firewood when his left foot was blown off by a mine. 'After I heard the broadcasts from Phnom Penh about the UN presence I was very happy,' said Mr Nop Somnang, the victim's older brother. 'I want to join them to help with the mine-clearing and everything else.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Trademark Infringers Shut Down"] </F>   [Text] A number of illegal producers and retailers have  been closed down in Guangdong Province for infringing on the  property rights of Lucozade, a British beverage trademark,  according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  (SAIC).    The local administrations for industry and commerce in  Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang cities started the  investigation immediately after Beecham Group PLC [public  limited company], the British holder of the trademark, handed in  its complaint about the infringement.    The infringers were promptly ferreted out in early April,  with 947 boxes of bottled beverages, 600,000 bottle tops, 52,000  packages and 58,000 empty bottles seized, according to a report  issued by the SAIC last week.    This is the latest case handled in Guangdong, a province  which has won praise from foreign businessmen for protecting  their registered trademarks in China.    In the capital city of Guangzhou alone, more than 900  foreign  trademark violation cases have been investigated and dealt with  in the past decade, which made up 15 percent of the total  trademark infringement cases in the city.    Most of the cases handled in Guangzhou concerned trademarks  from Hong Kong, Japan, Italy and the United States such as the  trademarks for Goldlion, Sharp, Sony, Diadora, Levis and Mobil.    China stands firm on the protection of the exclusive rights  of the trademarks registered by foreign businesses in China,  said a trademark administration official with SAIC,    The number of trademark infringement and counterfeiting  cases  handled by the Chinese administrative authorities for industry  and commerce reached 13,042 last year out of which about 500  cases involved foreign trademarks, as disclosed by SAIC  statistics.    The State's vigilant efforts continue, although the number  of  trademark violation cases handled so far this year is  unavailable, said the official.    To ensure rigorous protection, China has so far promulgated  the Trademark Law, the Patent Law the Copyright Law, and, the  Law Against Unethical Competition, among other laws and  regulations, all of which provide a legal guarantee for the  protection of intellectual property lights.    There has been a rapid increase in trademark applications  filed in China by foreign manufacturers and traders. The number  of registered trademarks amounted to 59,466 by the end of last  year, which was 10 times that of 1979.</p>

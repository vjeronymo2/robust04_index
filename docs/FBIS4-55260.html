			<p>BFN     [Text] With the internationalization and placement of the  corridor under UN supervision, which is also the basis of the  Vance-Owen plan, the international community tried to sell the  Serbs a pig in a poke, the president of the Democratic Party of  Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, said at the news conference.    The Serbs in Bosnia were forced to wage this war, not for a  road, but for a state. Vladimir Nikolic reports:    [Begin recording] [Nikolic] According to Kostunica, the  international encirclement is living a life of its own  regardless of what is happening in Bosnia. There has never been  more negotiations about peace and less actual peace. The  international community is not in even in a position to decide  on the makeup of a body that would discuss the situation in  Bosnia, let alone about the issue of peace.    [Kostunica] The Muslims attacked Brcko. There were human  casualties. The international community and its most powerful  protagonists are not responding to this, probably because the  Serbian reports about casualties are correct, while the Muslim  reports about the casualties so far have, as a matter of rule,  never been accurate, but exaggerated.    [Nikolic] At this moment, Brcko could be a means for getting  a more favorable division of the territory to the advantage of  the Muslim-Croatian federation, however, it can also be a goal  per se, that is, to break the Serbian territory in half and fan  the war, Kostunica believes.    President of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro Novak  Kilibarda  appeared as a guest at the news conference. In the name of this  party, he put forward an opinion that if the corridor near Brcko  is interrupted by force, Yugoslavia must become involved in the  war, or must at least openly say so. Saying that there is no  alternative, Vojislav Kostunica concurred with this opinion.    Regarding the affair with the Dafiment Bank, the position of  the Democratic Party of Serbia is that SRPSKA REC has published  a fabrication. The statements of the Serbian Renewal Movement  were branded as an expression of the lack of political culture.  Kostunica said that he will privately press charges against  SRPSKA REC.

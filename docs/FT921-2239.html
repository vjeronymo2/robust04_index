			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Sixth delay for tram project in Manchester REINTRODUCTION of the tram into Britain was yesterday postponed for the sixth time because drivers and staff want more training. Manchester's supertram - a Pounds 135m light-rail transit system designed to run on railway lines as well as through city centre streets  - was supposed to start operating on Monday, but yesterday the launch was postponed until April 6. The supertram will provide a through service from Bury, in the north of greater Manchester, to Altrincham in the south, and will connect Manchester's rail termini. Monday was supposed to see the opening of the section over normal rails from Bury to Victoria Station, followed a month later by street-running through the city centre to Deansgate Station. The extension to Altrincham was due a month later, followed by a spur from the main shopping area to Piccadilly Station, the main railway terminus. Tracks, trams and signals are ready, but staff have asked for more training. The system was scheduled to open last October but problems with British Rail lines, extra work on bridges and modifications to the Italian-built trams have caused five postponements. Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive said a derailment two weeks ago, followed shortly by the first suicide under the wheels of one of the trams, had not affected the schedule.</p>

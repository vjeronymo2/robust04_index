			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Premier Cons boosted by new developments PREMIER Consolidated Oilfields, the independent oil company, raised pre-tax profits by 29 per cent at the interim stage, as new developments began to make a contribution. The company earned Pounds 8m before tax, up from Pounds 6.2m, in the six months to June 30 1992. The figures reflected the full impact of Wytch Farm production and a significant contribution from the North Sea. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the result marked Premier's aim of generating enough cash flow for a substantial exploration and production programme without having to call on shareholders. Goal Petroleum made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.94m, an increase of 7 per cent, in the six months to June 30. Gearing was reduced to 20.7 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

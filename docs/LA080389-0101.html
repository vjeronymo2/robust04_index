			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEATER IN THE PARK BRINGS CLASSICS UP TO DATE  </P> <P> Elizabethan morality, Greek tragedy and French and English comedy are coming to  a Culver City park this month during the city's outdoor festival of classical  plays.  </P> <P> The Theater in the Park series at Paul Carlson Park kicks off this weekend with  "Dr. Faustus," Christopher Marlowe's 16th-Century tale of a scholar who sells  his soul to the devil. Subsequent weekends will see Euripides' "Alcestis,"  Moliere's farce, "The Imaginary Invalid," and Francis Beaumont's comic "Knight  of the Burning Pestle."  </P> <P> Sponsored by the city's Human Services Department, the free festival began  three years ago when Anne Laskey, a Westside director, approached Culver City  with a proposal to stage classical plays. She chose Culver City because she had  previously acted in a city-sponsored play at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium  and because "being a small city, there's not a lot of bureaucracy and red tape  to go through."  </P> <P> The city this year is donating $600 and rehearsal space in two recreation  centers and paying for printing, postage and lumber for the productions, Laskey  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 35 Actors  </P> <P> Auditions, advertised in local newspapers and on flyers posted at colleges and  libraries, were held in early July. The 35 actors selected, who are not paid  and who fill about 55 different roles among the four plays, have been  rehearsing furiously ever since, said Laskey, artistic director and co-producer  of the series.  </P> <P> In real life, the actors range in age from 10 to about 50, and include actual  actors, as well as writers, waitresses, accountants, clerks and a pastor,  Laskey said. Most of them are Westside residents.  </P> <P> Linda Israelson of Culver City, at 5 feet, 10 inches tall, will try to persuade  audiences that she's George the Dwarf in "Knight of the Burning Pestle." She  waitresses in Santa Monica and has had jobs as an extra in movies and  commercials. Having acted in Theater in the Park before, she says she enjoys  performing in the "wide open space" of the outdoors.  </P> <P> The Rev. Frank Ramirez, who plays a psychiatrist in the festival's modernized  version of "Alcestis," a quack doctor in "Invalid" and a merchant in "Knight,"  sometimes has had to juggle two different rehearsals per night. "It gets  confusing to keep track" when he has to switch from slapstick comedy to Greek  tragedy in one evening, he says. "I have to ask, 'Who am I right now?' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father-Son Act  </P> <P> Ramirez, a theater-arts major in college who continued working on plays during  his seminary studies, says this is his first acting role in seven years. A  Shakespeare fan, he attends Oregon's Shakespeare festival in Ashland every  year. The love of Elizabethan theater, he says, has rubbed off on his  10-year-old son, who also landed roles in "Knight."  </P> <P> The congregation at Ladera Church of the Brethren in Ladera Heights is amused  with their pastor-actor, Ramirez says. He considers the acting, along with  running and free-lance writing, another activity that "takes me totally away  from the ministry" and "keeps me from burning out or doing something like Oral  Roberts or Tammy Bakker."  </P> <P> The festival, Laskey says, aims to bring theater to "some people who aren't  used to seeing theater" and to win over those who, with a groan, remember  plodding through Shakespeare and Sophocles in high school English classes.  </P> <P> To spice them up, "Alcestis" and "The Imaginary Invalid" will be thrust forward  in time to the present, Laskey said. In "Alcestis," written in 438 BC, a king's  wife volunteers to die for him, and Heracles battles Death to rescue her.  Shifted to 1989 Beverly Hills, "the king is a major studio executive, the wife  would be the starlet who'd give up her career to have his children, and Death  would be a typical high-powered drug dealer," Laskey said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modern Plot Twists  </P> <P> In "The Imaginary Invalid," about a hypochondriac who tries to marry his  daughter into a family of doctors, Paris of the 1600s becomes Los Angeles of  today. The daughter wants to wed a young rock 'n' roll music teacher "who  speaks in Valley talk," said stage manager Diana Utech. The father's choice, "a  real nerd of a doctor," is called a "dweeb," said Utech, who is also a  department store saleswoman.  </P> <P> Classics can be "funny, moving, bawdy," Laskey says, describing "Knight,"  written in 1607, as "on the level of the Three Stooges go Elizabethan." In the  play, a grocer and his wife interrupt a play and insist on substituting its  scenes and lines with their own and casting their assistant, Ralph, as the  leading man. Ralph is cast as a Don Quixote-type knight who tries to save  damsels in distress; meanwhile, the real actors try valiantly to continue their  show.  </P> <P> Laskey and co-producer Richard Stone chose the plays based on their length and  whether they could be whittled down to an hour's playing time. Another factor  was whether they could be pulled off in a park. That meant complicated sets,  costumes, lighting and atmosphere were out, she says.  </P> <P> "Very quiet plays don't work, because (in the park) there are wild parrots that  screech, ice cream trucks, kids having birthday parties. So you need something  that doesn't rely on a lot of mood."  </P> <P> "Dr. Faustus" will be presented Saturday and Sunday; "Alcestis" on Aug. 12 and  13; "The Imaginary Invalid" on Aug. 19 and 20; and "Knight of the Burning  Pestle" on Aug. 26 and 27. All performances start at 2 p.m. at Paul Carlson  Park, at Motor Avenue and Braddock Drive.  </P> <P> THEATER IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Sat-Sun: "Dr. Faustus."  </P> <P> Aug.12-13: "Alcestis."  </P> <P> Aug. 19-20: "The Imaginary Invalid."  </P> <P> Aug. 26-27: "Knight of the Burning Pestle."  </P> <P>  All performances start at 2 p.m. at Paul Carlson Park, at Motor Avenue and  Braddock Drive.

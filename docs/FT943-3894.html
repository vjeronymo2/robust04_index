			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / English culture not yet vindicated The role of late Victorian English culture in the relative decline of the British economy continues to excite scholarly controversy. It was in the years around the turn of the century that key features of the English upper-middle class assumed their familiar mould: education for an imperial role in spartan boarding schools, which emphasised classics and neglected science; the aspiration of business leaders to the lifestyle of country gentlemen; preoccupation with distant overseas investment rather than domestic business; the exaggerated differentiation of male and female roles; and the suppression of feeling in the famous stiff upper lip. Analysis of English relative economic decline in these terms received a new lease of life in a book by the American historian, Martin Wiener, in English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit, 1850-1980 (published in 1981 and republished by Penguin). His thesis about how crippling the dislike for the capitalist ethos was to economic development is not, of course, novel. The economist Alfred Marshall observed in 1903: 'By the 1860s and 1870s, many of the sons of manufacturers were content to follow mechanically the lead given by their fathers. They worked shorter hours; and they exerted themselves less to obtain new practical ideas.' What distinguished Wiener was the verve of his writing and its wealth of detail. An aspect on which he shed new light was the English rural affectation. Between the wars not only the Conservative leader, Stanley Baldwin, but also the Labour leader, Ramsay MacDonald, made great play of being countrymen at heart. The historian JH Plumb remarked: 'The dream of an Elysian England of patriarchs, well-fed peasants, contented, if illiterate craftsmen, and compassionate, profit-sharing landlords has haunted English radicalism.' I have myself been told that the countryside was only real when the majority of the population were involved in country pursuits - making me think, not very guiltily, of pleasant afternoons spent sipping Pimms in the west country, or drinking Gluhwein looking at the Alps. A counter-attack was launched by an Australian historian, WD Rubinstein, in Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain, 1750-1990 (Routledge, 1993). Rubinstein's argument is that there is nothing that needs explaining in Britain's economic record and that the cultural attitudes highlighted by Wiener were not a source of weakness. He does seize on a genuine fault in Wiener's identification of economic development with industry. The latter always accounted for less than 50 per cent of British employment, as I guess it would of other industrial countries such as the US and Germany; and it was a mistake to emphasise complaints about the decline of manufacturing, which is worldwide. But if 'business' is substituted for 'industry' in Wiener's book, 90 per cent of his argument remains unaffected. Rubinstein maintains: that British living standards have risen remarkably in the past few decades, even while commentators have bemoaned British economic performance, and that ownership of specified consumer durables compares quite favourably with, for example, the US or France; only a small proportion of pupils at the great public schools came from a business background in the 19th century, and among these there was no drift to other careers; English culture was no more anti-business than Continental or even American culture. He can call in aid the entrenched anti-capitalism of postwar German novelists and the automatic Marxism of the French intellectual elite until a decade or two ago - although it is rather less convincing to bring in American writers from Twain to Henry James; more tangibly, that concentration on financial and overseas activities was a rational and successful allocation of talent and capital in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite the rave notices of reviewers, who only examine one book at a time, Rubinstein is not ultimately convincing. Of course the British, like most other western peoples, 'never had it so good' in the postwar decades. But the best available indices of consumption per head show that most European countries have overtaken Britain; and the gap is increased if account is taken of longer British working hours. But the gap has stopped widening since the advent of the 1979 Thatcher government. Rubinstein's own researches on public schools are inconclusive. The business classes entered these schools in much greater numbers in the 20th century and were present even in the 19th in lesser public schools, for which there are no data. The point is not that these schools triggered a drift out of business, but the somewhat distant managerial style which their products assumed - people who affected to talk like Harold Macmillan and saw foreign exchange as a matter for 'Jews and Armenians'. The cultural comparisons encourage a wallow among favourite authors. But in my subjective view, Rubinstein does not in the end score. Of course German scholars excelled at classics as well as chemistry. But they were also better at both. The point about relative returns in British industry compared with financial activities or overseas investment seems more tangible, but only seems. Even if these domestic returns appeared low, they were not given by ineluctable natural forces but reflected the quality of entrepreneurship and professional skills which were applied to them. The historical controversy is now itself history. But let us not romanticise the pseudo-aristocratic culture which was not all that nice to those that got on the wrong side of it.</p>

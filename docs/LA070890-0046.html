			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NIGERIAN SEEKS RELIEF FROM CURSE;  </P> <P> AFRICA: SON SAYS HIS MOTHER'S BODY WAS MISHANDLED WHILE BEING FLOWN TO HER  VILLAGE -- AND THAT CROP FAILURES AND OTHER WOES HAVE FOLLOWED. HE IS SUING THE  AIRLINE.  </P> <P> Almost four years after his mother died, Onyebuchim Onyeanusi yearns to give  her an honorable burial that might lift a curse against him and his family.  </P> <P> The curse, rooted in African tribal beliefs, has been blamed for all sorts of  woe in his native Nigerian village: dismal yam harvests, a canceled wedding and  an epidemic that killed chickens, goats and sheep.  </P> <P> The bad things started after his mother was buried in shame, after, he says,  her body was mishandled and misplaced for eight days while being shipped from  the United States.  </P> <P> Because he was responsible for the funeral, Onyeanusi says he was cursed by the  gods of his native Ibo tribe, as were 98 family members.  </P> <P> Onyeanusi hoped to set things right the Western way: He and the relatives filed  suit against Pan American World Airways, which shipped her body home. But a  federal judge ruled against him last month, and his efforts to avenge his  mother's spirit now hinge on appeals.  </P> <P> "The war is not over," Onyeanusi said. "This was only a battle."  </P> <P> Onyeanusi's saga underscores the challenges of Africans emerging in the modern  world, but still rooted in traditional beliefs.  </P> <P> It began Oct. 1, 1986, when his mother, Olamma, died of pneumonia while  visiting Onyeanusi, who lives on visa status with his American wife and their  four children in Philadelphia. The mother was about 90 when she died, although  her age was unknown because of uncertain birth records.  </P> <P> Pan Am shipped his mother's body while Onyeanusi flew to southeastern Nigeria  to arrange the funeral. The body was supposed to go to Paris, then home via  Nigeria Airways.  </P> <P> According to tribal custom, all business stops until the honored person is  buried. The family bears all expenses, and Onyeanusi pledged the family's  155-acre plantation to feed the 20,000 villagers who gathered for the feast  honoring his mother.  </P> <P> "We believe people should rejoice in death. The highest honor you can give  someone is at death. There is singing, feasting, the shooting of guns,"  Onyeanusi said.  </P> <P> But the villagers waited and waited and waited. Each day for eight days, a  frustrated and bewildered Onyeanusi made the two-hour drive to the airport.  </P> <P> The funeral tab eventually came to about $24,000. But that was the least of the  family's problems.  </P> <P> The Videon Funeral Home of Broomall, Pa., embalmed Olamma Onyeanusi's body and  dressed it in a blue sarong, blue turban and white gloves. She was placed in a  sheet metal case, which in turn was put into an air tray made of corrugated  paper.  </P> <P> The body left New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 15.  </P> <P> But a Pan Am memo dated Oct. 20 from the director of cargo at Roissy Airport in  Paris said: "Shipment received with a crate surrounding the coffin damaged.  Nigerian Airways refused to accept transfer and we had to call the Pompes  Funebres (French funeral home) to repair that crate."  </P> <P> When the body arrived in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the family said it had  decayed. And somewhere along the line, Olamma Onyeanusi had been wrapped in  burlap and turned upside down -- tribal taboos that show someone committed  suicide or was an evil person.  </P> <P> "These are regarded as the greatest abuse to be given a corpse," Onyeanusi  said. "We knew from the smell the body had spoiled. She was decomposed,  decaying. The skin was peeling off."  </P> <P> At the funeral, the family burned heavy incense to mask the smell before  burying her in disgrace.  </P> <P> The family offered sacrifices of yams, money and English wine to appease the  gods. But tribe members say they have seen the woman's spirit roaming, despite  placing chains on her grave to hold her down.  </P> <P> "If anything happens, the family is blamed for it," said Onyeanusi. "My mother  was treated as if she were nothing. My mother is not at peace. She is angry."  </P> <P> One relative, Obioha Onyeanusi, was a prominent farmer, but was ruined by a  poor harvest of yams, an Ibo delicacy. An epidemic blamed on the curse also  killed 2,500 chickens, 95 goats and 89 sheep.  </P> <P> The woman's daughter, Nnalu, earned a degree at Cheyney University in  Pennsylvania and went home in 1986 to marry a man she had known for 10 years.  But he called off the wedding because of the curse.  </P> <P> Business deals also went sour, the family says.  </P> <P> "It was as if the family had been shunned. Nobody wanted anything to do with  them," said John Beavers, Onyeanusi's lawyer.  </P> <P> The family sued in 1988 to recover costs for mental anguish, emotional distress  and breach of contract. But U.S. District Judge Edmund Ludwig threw the case  out June 13 without saying anything about the curse.  </P> <P> Ludwig ruled that the case was covered by the Warsaw Convention, an  international treaty that limits liability on shipments to about $18 per pound  with a maximum damage claim of $75,000.  </P> <P> The treaty also requires that damage claims be filed within 21 days. Onyeanusi  didn't notify Pan Am for 60 days, so his claim was invalid, the judge said.  </P> <P> Thomas Bracaglia, Pan Am's attorney, denied the airline mishandled the corpse,  but refused to comment on specific allegations. But, he said: "The issues  themselves are fascinating."  </P> <P> Onyeanusi has asked the judge to reconsider and, failing that, will seek relief  from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> "It goes against the grain of not only Nigerian thinking but American thinking  that human remains are just goods that can be lost like luggage," Beavers said.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to prove to an American jury these curses are real. All we  want to do is convince them the family believes it's true and they've suffered  consequences," he said.  </P> <P> Onyeanusi, who is about 50, was a captain in the losing Biafran army during  Nigeria's 1967-70 civil war, Africa's bloodiest tribal conflict, in which 1  million people were killed.  </P> <P> He left his native village of Uzuakoli and the land of the Ibo, the  fourth-largest ethnic group in his homeland, to study in America. He earned a  bachelor's degree at Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, a master's  degree at Temple University and a doctorate in vocational education at Temple.  </P> <P> Experts on African beliefs say Onyeanusi might not be able to offset the curse  even if he wins the appeal. But it's his only chance to regain respect.  </P> <P> "The gravity of a curse like this is such that one lives with it forever," said  Emeke Akaezuwa, an Ibo who is executive director of the African Academy of  Arts, Science and Technology in North Brunswick, N.J. "If you lose respect in  the Ibo culture, no one takes you seriously. You are as good as dead."  </P> <P> Onyeanusi can only ask the gods for mercy.  </P> <P> "If this had been done to us by an individual, my whole tribe would have gone  to war," Onyeanusi said. "If I win the case, it would be like bringing back  someone's head. It would prove I'm a warrior, a strong man. It will show the  gods I have done something against someone who shamed my mother."  </P></p>

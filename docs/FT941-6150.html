			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / SmithKline shuts plant and warns of further closures Healthcare group SmithKline Beecham is to shut a plant in St Helens, Merseyside, and warned yesterday that further closures were possible. Some production will be switched to contractors for the first time in the UK. Most of the 480 workers at the plant, which makes non-prescription medicines, will be made redundant when it closes at the end of the year, cutting the company's 4,500-strong UK manufacturing payroll by more than 10 per cent. The shutdown is the result of 'an extensive review' of all SmithKline Beecham's UK production sites and will end the Beecham family's 150-year association with St Helens. The company said that announcements on the future of other manufacturing sites as a result of the review were planned. The closure is part of SmithKline Beecham's drift from consumer goods towards Higher specification healthcare products for sale in pharmacies and available on prescription. Its biggest selling products are antibiotics and ulcer treatments which between them have sales of about Pounds 1.5bn a year. But the company is fighting to improve profits in the face of global healthcare reforms which have seen cuts in the price of drugs as governments move to control healthcare spending. Last year the company sold its personal care products division, a move which cut production at St Helens by 30 per cent. Output will be further reduced by the sale, announced yesterday, of seven more brands, including dietary supplement Phyllosan and Fynnon Salts for baths. The company said falling production at St Helens had reduced the competitiveness of the site's remaining manufacturing activities. The use of an outside contract manufacturer was a first in the UK, SmithKline said.</p>

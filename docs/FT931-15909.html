			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Lucky seven cut their literary teeth: A look at the work of the new novelists that WH Smith is launching this month ONE of Aldous Huxley's characters says: 'No publisher would ever publish a first novel if he could possibly avoid it.' This is not quite true. One or two exceptional first novels, such as Donna Tartt's The Secret History, published earlier this year, are fiercely competed for and reap huge pre-publication advances. But for the most part, taking on first novels is to publishing what planting oak trees is to forestry: you do it more for the benefit of your successors than yourself. A first novelist may take 10 years or more to mature into a steady, profitable seller. WH Smith, sometimes criticised in the literary world for its alleged indifference to the existence of worthwhile non-bestselling novelists, is taking an initiative to try to remedy this. It has got together with a number of fiction publishers to select seven first novels which will all appear as paperbacks and will be given the same high profile promotion in its shops as is currently afforded to the likes of Danielle Steel, Catherine Cookson, Robert Ludlum and Stephen King. Although none of the lucky seven has had a novel published before, several of them have experience in other forms of creative writing or in working for publishers. Valerie Windsor, whose psychological thriller Telling Stories comes from Sinclair Stevenson, cut her dramatic teeth as one of the writers on the Channel 4 Brookside team and has had plays broadcast. American Jane Stanton Hitchcock is also a playwright turned novelist. Her play, Vanilla, caught the attention of Harold Pinter, who put it on at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, where it rapidly came off. But it seems she will have better luck with her novel Trick of the Eye (Penguin), where the investigative heroine is an artist who specialises in illusion. The assignment to re-design the ballroom of a grand Long Island home plunges her into a world of illusion and counter-illusion that for once is not entirely of her own devising. Anne Billson has lived professionally in a world of illusion as the film critic of New Statesman and, clearly, her novel Suckers (Pan) is an attempt to cut through all the pretence this engenders, especially that surrounding the affluent young financial high-livers of contemporary London. Elizabeth Palmer began her professional life as a graphic designer in a publishing house. She moved from there to the Financial Times, where she met her husband David, now its chief executive, and then became a freelance book designer. Two years ago, she began writing The Stainless Angel (Arrow) and on submission of the manuscript was rewarded not just with acceptance but also a forward-looking deal for further novels. The story she tells is of Camilla, a widowed Englishwoman with a small son living in Rome. She marries a fellow member of the British set. His roots are in upper-class rural England where she finds herself obliged to live - far from permissive Rome. How she comes to terms with his background - and it with her - is developed in a traditional linear narrative. Ben Woolfenden was for eight years deputy manager of a bookshop in Covent Garden. He saw for himself all too well what shifted and what stuck on the fiction shelves. The model for his The Ruins of Time (Black Swan) is the Penelope Lively type of novel which begins with an investigation of the past, after which the trail loops disconcertingly forward into the investigator's present. In this case, the past is that of a late 19th artists' colony in Newlyn, of which the hero's grandfather was a member - an attractively bohemian setting. In the case of Joanna Hines, the model is even more illustrious. Hines's heroine in Dora's Room (Coronet) becomes the chatelaine of Chatton Heights, where a sequence of revelations and painful remembrances awaits her in shades of Daphne du Maurier. To underline the comparison, Hines has lived with her Canadian husband and children in Cornwall for the past 18 years. And, finally, Marika Cobbold is Swedish, married to an Englishman whom she met when he was part of a Royal Naval helicopter squadron visiting Gothenburg. Her father was the editor of a leading Swedish newspaper. But Nordic Strindbergian gloom is the last epithet to be applied to her Guppies for Tea (Black Swan). It is in that vein of domestic social comedy beloved of English women novelists from time immemorial. Martin Lee, WH Smith's product group manager for adult books who is putting his muscle behind the launch of these seven new novelists on January 7, said: 'We do not see the hardback as the natural format for these titles and believe that they can become more successful as paperbacks.' That may be so, but it does not, surely, entirely preclude their eventual hardback publication, and indeed at least one of the titles - Dora's Room - is being published in both formats simultaneously by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The fiction hardback is dead. Long live the fiction hardback]</p>

Here is an update on the partial results by Kokou  Tordjro:    [Tordjro] In this first round of the 1994 legislative  elections, the results--which have yet to be confirmed after  verification by the National Electoral Commission [CEN]--are as  follows: 57 seats are provisionally occupied and 24 are in a  tie. Remember that these results have not yet been confirmed by  the CEN. According to our investigation, a breakdown of the 57  seats that are provisionally occupied shows the following  results: The Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] won 33 seats;  the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], 19; the Togolese Union  for Democracy [UTD], three; and the Union for Justice and  Development, two.    Concerning the 24 seats in a tie, here is the breakdown: UTD  and CAR tied in 12 constituencies, RPT and CAR in six, RPT and  UTD in four, RPT and CFN [expansion unknown] in one, and PDC  [expansion unknown] and CAR in one.</p>

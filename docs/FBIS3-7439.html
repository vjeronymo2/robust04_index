			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 22 March, the people and National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] attacked the command post of the  puppets' 6th Division located at Kompong Chhnang and Bavel  villages and swept the enemy troops from Bavel District seat  which were a part of the two-headed government's invading forces  in the Pailin area.    The people and NADK launched the attack in four prongs: the  first coming from Dangkao Ta Mang to Bavel; the second from  Samlor Khlanh to Bavel; the third from Ta Em to Bavel; and the  fourth from Kbal Thnal to Prey Totoeng and Bavel.    After three hours of combat, we smashed and seized full  control of the 6th Division's command post and Bavel District  seat. We killed 22 enemy soldiers and wounded over 30 others.  We destroyed a T54 tank; 85-mm, 122-mm, and 76.2-mm cannons;  two 37-mm anti-aircraft guns; an 80-mm mortar; a DK-85; a  12.7-mm gun; an RPK gun; an RPD gun; and 35 military barracks.  We also set ablaze three depots storing various ammunition and  mines for use in the Pailin offensive. The fire burned for six  hours from 0500 at dawn to 1100. We also seized four B-40's, a  12.7-mm gun, 39 AK's, three crates of AK ammunition, 60 B-40  rockets, two field radios, and a large antenna.    At the same time, we attacked the invading forces at Thmar  Kol which is the supply route for serving the Pailin  battlefield. The invading forces were routed and forced to flee  to Battambang which was then in chaos. The puppets in  Battambang were in a panic and immediately declared a dawn to  dusk curfew which is still being imposed.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Employers' optimism grows but fears of staff cuts remain OPTIMISM IN British industry has increased sharply over the past three months but the outlook for investment and jobs remains bleak, according to the latest quarterly industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The survey, to be published today, shows that the number of companies which are more optimistic about the general business situation than four months ago exceeds the pessimistic by 11 percentage points. In the last survey, taken around the time of September's currency crisis, pessimists out-numbered optimists by 23 points. The findings set a hopeful tone ahead of other economic indicators due this week. However, trade data on Thursday are likely to show imports exceeding exports by more than Pounds 1bn, while money supply figures out today are unlikely to show a clear recovery trend. The CBI survey says that companies expect a small rise in output in the months ahead. Expectations are polled monthly by the CBI and the latest survey found a positive balance of 2 percentage points in companies expecting output to rise in the next four months against a balance of minus 7 points in December. The survey found that the number reporting increased export orders exceeded those reporting a decrease by 18 percentage points this month. This compares with a positive balance of just 6 points in October. On exports, expectations remained optimistic: the balance of companies positive about export prospects over the coming year was 19 percentage points against a positive balance of 20 points in October. The CBI report confirms the growth of business optimism shown in other recent surveys and this part of its findings will be welcomed by the government. However, revival of optimism and exports has not translated into any willingness to increase staff or investments. This will increase pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to cut interest rates and craft his March 16 Budget with the aim of helping industry and creating jobs. The number of companies expecting job cuts exceeds those planning to take on staff by 35 percentage points: down only slightly from October's negative balance of 42 points. Investment intentions show some signs of recovery but remain weak. On balance, the number of companies planning to cut spending on plant and machinery in the next 12 months exceeds the number planning an increase by 7 percentage points compared with a negative balance of 18 points in October. There are signs that more companies have been trying to increase their prices in January in line with the seasonal trend.

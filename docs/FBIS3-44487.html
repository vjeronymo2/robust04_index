			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Basic Norms Concerning Building Army </F> Grass-Roots Units in New Period"]    [Text] The Central Military Commission [CMC] decided to  promulgate the "Outline of Army Building at the Grass-Roots  Level," revised by the General Staff Headquarters, the General  Political Department, and the General Logistics Department, for  trial implementation in the entire Army. This is a major move  by the CMC and the general departments for intensifying the army  building of the grass-roots units in order to suit the new  situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure  and to meeting the demands of the Army's modernization.    The leading CMC cadres take the building of the grass-roots  units seriously. After the 14th National Party Congress, the  CMC explicitly pointed out: In order to meet the requirements  of the new situation, it is necessary to revise the "Outline" so  as to raise the building of the grass-roots units to a new  level. In line with the CMC instructions, the three general  departments have conducted substantial work in investigation and  demonstration and have fully heeded and assimilated opinions  from various quarters. The revised "Outline" takes Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period as  guidance.It takes Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall requirement of  being "qualified politically, proficient militarily, fine in  style, strict in discipline, and adequate in maintenance and  supplies" as a foundation; and the enhancement of the Army's  combat capacity as the fundamental purpose to fully reflect the  instructions and guidelines of the CMC and the 14th National  Party Congress.It inherits and develops the fine tradition of  our Army, maintains the strong points of the original "Outline,"  and sums up and absorbs the fresh experiences in army building  at the grass-roots levels over the last few years. As a basic  norm and foundation for the building, the revised "Outline"  definitely standardizes its criteria, principal tasks, methods  of examination and appraisal through comparison, as well as  principal duties and requirements of organs at various levels  which are responsible for the grass-roots units. The  promulgation and trial implementation of the "Outline" will  provide a more definite direction, clearer ideas of work, and a  more perfect incentive mechanism for the building of the  grass-roots units. It will also straighten out the relations  between leading organs and grass-roots units. All this will  play a major role in, and produce a momentous impact on the  building of the grass-roots units in the new period. This will  repeatedly push forward the building of a revolutionized,  modernized, and regularized Army.    Guiding and standardizing the building of the grass-roots  units in line with the overall requirement of being "qualified  politically, proficient militarily, fine in style, strict in  discipline, and adequate in maintenance and supplies" as  proposed by Chairman [zhu xi 0031 1598] Jiang Zemin, is the core  substance and most striking characteristic of the revised  "Outline." Chairman Jiang's requirement in five aspects is a  summary of the major contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thinking on army building in the new period. It is a  concentrated reflection of the objective laws governing army  building in the new period. This is an overall requirement for  army building as well as for the building of the grass-roots  units. The building of the grass-roots units is systems  engineering, which is complicated and difficult to put into  effect. Hence, stress should be put on building in the above  five aspects. If we guide and standardize the building of the  grass-roots units with Chairman Jiang's instructions, we will be  able to give impetus to all fields of endeavor in order to  promote the comprehensive building. We should deeply understand  the significance of guiding and standardizing this building with  the above instructions in the areas including: the direction of  the building, the formation of the Army's fighting capacity, and  the performance of its basic functions. On this basis, we  should command and standardize the building of the grass-roots  units.    The major content of the revised "Outline" stresses the  seven  principal regular missions for the grass-roots units, which are  all basic and long-term tasks. If these tasks are well  performed, we will be able to administer strict discipline to  the Army, implement the principles of intensifying the  comprehensive building of the grass-roots units, and provide a  reliable guarantee for the fulfillment of Chairman Jiang's  instructions, so that the Army will be able to stand the trials  under various complex conditions. In a bid to intensify the  building of the grass-roots units, it is necessary to always  take firm, regular, and continuous control of the seven  principal regular missions stipulated in the "Outline," with  efforts really concentrated on the building of a basic and  regular character. With regard to specific Army units,  particular emphasis should be laid on a certain aspects of the  tasks but, generally speaking, we should have in mind building  in a comprehensive way and persistently hold fast to the seven  principal missions so that they will coordinate with and promote  one another in making advances.    It is another major point of the revised "Outline" to  universally strive to become advanced companies and excellent  soldiers throughout the entire Army. Summing up the  activities of appraisal through comparison previously conducted  in the grass-roots units, the "Outline" stipulates that such  activities be launched throughout the entire Army in a unified  manner and determine their specific practices. These activities  developed under the new situation, and reflect the aspirations  of the vast number of officers and men in the grass-roots units  of the entire Army and play an extremely inspiring  role,developing into a vigorous and lively situation wherein  everyone is emulating, learning from, catching up with, and  helping one another striving to become an advanced element. In  line with the requirements of the "Outline," we should  straighten out our ideas, organize and guide our work in a  scientific and meticulous manner, have the mobilization of  positive factors, promotion of work, implementation, and  intensification of the comprehensive building in mind. We must  pay attention to overcoming and guarding against such problems  as formalism, scholasticism, and so on, which were liable to  emerge in the previous appraisals and contests, so that the  activities will embark on a solid, effective, and healthy path  of development from the very beginning.    In carrying out the "Outline," leading organs should  shoulder  their major responsibilities. The "Outline" has made explicit  stipulations on the principal duties and basic requirements of  the leading organs at all levels in charge of the grass-roots  units, as well as on the style of thinking and work style that  they should adopt. Leading organs at all levels should comply  with the requirements of the "Outline," intensify their  self-building, and provide guidance and service to the  grass-roots units. At present, they must first study the  "Outline" seriously, acquire a good grasp of its main substance,  increase their sense of responsibility, go into the midst of the  troops to conduct propaganda, and give proper guidance to the  study of the troops. Divisions, battalions, and regiments  should train their grass-roots cadres and office workers with  the "Outline" in a planned way. Units above army level should  conscientiously hold fast to the selected sites for experiments  and give proper guidance to the work in the pilot units. It is  imperative to handle affairs strictly according to the  stipulations and requirements of the "Outline," and, at the same  time, combine implementation of the "Outline" with the pertinent  rules and regulations. Leading cadres at all levels should  conduct thorough investigations and studies, give concrete  guidance and assistance to organs and grass-roots units in their  implementation of the "Outline," keep abreast of the new  situation and problems which emerge in the course of  implementation, and sum up and acquaint themselves with the  newly gained experiences. Through solid and effective work, a  lively situation in which leading organs give guidance and  assistance to grass-roots units and grass-roots units intensify  their own building according to the "Outline" will certainly  emerge. The building of the grass-roots units will be pushed  forward constantly.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Plea for two more London airfields London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports could handle an extra 30m passengers a year if two other small airfields were developed, the Adam Smith Institute, the free market think-tank, said in a report yesterday. The institute said expanding RAF Northolt in Middlesex and Redhill aerodrome in Surrey would take much pressure off Heathrow and Gatwick. The government is already considering developing Northolt - six miles from Heathrow and currently used for Royal Family, VIP and military flights - for business and smaller commercial aircraft.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Technology: Rescuing the Peruca dam - Croatian engineers risked their lives to open the sluice gates and safeguard 20,000 people Serbian militia came 'within an ace' last month of destroying the Peruca dam in Croatia, threatening the lives of 20,000 people, according to British engineers who travelled to the war zone to help make the dam safe. Only the robust nature of the dam's design and construction and the fact that the water level was not higher prevented an immediate disaster, according to Paul Back, chief technical director of consulting engineers Sir Alexander Gibb. Back, an international expert on dams, was one of three Britons who travelled to the Dalmatian coast to assist the Croatians. The others were Derek Wilden, head of Gibb's hydro-mechanical engineering division, and Terry Pike, chief engineering adviser to the Overseas Development Administration. They praised the Croatian engineers, who risked their lives by opening sluice gates - feared to have been booby trapped - to lower the water level in the lake. 'Without this immediate action, more of the clay core in the centre of the dam might have been washed away with terrible consequences,' said Back. Peruca is an embankment dam, the impervious clay core enclosed in sloping shoulders of local limestone. The stone protects the core and gives the 450 metre-long, 65 metre-high dam its strength. It holds back up to 541m cubic metres of water, more than twice the volume of Kielder, England's largest dam. 'It is not easy to blow up a dam when it has been designed to withstand earth movements in an area of high seismic activity,' says Back. Three separate blasts - one alone is estimated to have involved 15 tonnes of explosive - are thought to have occurred in an inspection tunnel running through the centre of the structure. The crest of the dam above the explosions sagged by more than two metres. The immediate threat was that water would pour over the gaps washing the structure away and accomplishing what the explosions failed to do on their own. 'That was why it was so important to get the sluice gates open and reduce the level of water,' says Back. The next problem was to identify what other damage had been done to the structure. Most worrying was that water pouring from an access tunnel to the damaged inspection gallery, 15 metres from the top of the dam, was chocolate brown - indicating that the clay core was being steadily eroded. If the core was destroyed there would be nothing to prevent water pouring through the limestone and washing it away completely. The first task has been to reduce the level of the water to below the inspection tunnel outlet to see if this would halt the damage to the core. The emergence of large sink holes at the southern end of the dam has suggested it is there that water has been getting into the core. Silty clay has been used to backfill the sink holes in the hope that this would replenish the damaged core. That work is still continuing and it could be several weeks before the dam is finally considered safe. A remote-controlled submarine with a video camera provided with operators by Shoreline Engineering of Britain has been carrying out extensive surveys to assess the damage and whether the structure is booby-trapped. Engineers are also using dyes to establish the course of the seepage which has been damaging the core. Once the water level has been sufficiently reduced, there will be a joint inspection by Croatian and British engineers to assess what repairs might be needed. Dams would appear to be natural terrorist targets given the massive destructive potential of hundreds of millions of tonnes of water suddenly being unleashed. In reality, they are very difficult to destroy, as Peruca has shown. 'Dams are designed to withstand huge natural forces which are much greater than most man-made devices,' says Back. He quotes an incident in 1986 when he was sent to investigate the failure of the Kantalai dam in Sri Lanka, which was feared to have been caused by Tamil terrorists. The clay embankment dam built in 600 AD had been 'improved' last century by Royal Engineers from Britain who had dug a culvert built in dressed stone, using a lime-based mortar. Rather than any actions by terrorists, it was erosion of the clay through the mortar that had caused the dam to collapse</p>

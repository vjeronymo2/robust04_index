			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, 7 May (SNARK) -- Meanwhile, diplomats  try to find the ways of Karabakh conflict settlement, the  battles do not cease in here. According to data received by  SNARK from the Karabakh Defence Army press service, today  Azerbaijani troops took offensive on Omar pass in the north of  Kelbajarskiy region. However, Karabakh forces, keeping under the  control all important hills, beat off the attacks of Azeris, who  lost more than 100 people.    According to the same source, till evening of 6 May there  were battles in the north-eastern (Mardakertskiy) and eastern  (Agdamskiy) sectors of the front.    After beating off the attacks of Azerbaijani troops,  Karabakh  forces began counter-attack in the direction of Leninavan  village of Mardakertskiy region and Hovsepavan village of  Agdamskiy region and, as a result, Azeris were forced back deep  into their positions.    The observers in Stepanakert consider that the activation of  offensive military actions by Azerbaijan should be connected  with its uncompromising position at the negotiations in Bishkek,  where, as it is known, official Baku frustrated the peace-making  initiative of the CIS.</p>

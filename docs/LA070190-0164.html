			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A  </P> <P> Q: I am close to retirement and will receive 15,000 shares of Rockwell  International stock when I leave that company. I see that in the past month or  so Rockwell's stock has moved off its $22-$23 base and is around $27 a share.  Since the recent events in Eastern Europe could bring hard times for the  aerospace industry, should I hold on to the stock? -- Westminster  </P> <P> A: Rockwell has problems, but not because of its defense business.  </P> <P> The company isn't as dependent on military contracts as most people think. In  fact, Thomas McNaugher, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says work  from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is far more important to  Rockwell, "and NASA's budget is going up."  </P> <P> McNaugher says Rockwell is one of the fortunate companies that saw the writing  on the Berlin Wall in the mid-1980s and started weaning itself from defense  contracts. The company now does lots of business with car makers and the  publishing industry.  </P> <P> But Rockwell has other worries. As you've probably read, neither the automotive  industry nor the publishing business is doing particularly well. And the  strength of Rockwell's stock has at least one Wall Street analyst concerned.  Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Inc. says the shares are "somewhat overpriced,  given the flat earnings and revenue growth picture we see for the next three to  four years."  </P> <P> One of the biggest problems the company has is that many newspapers have  already purchased the big, expensive color presses that Rockwell develops. And  those that haven't probably can't afford them in today's business environment.  Nisbet is telling clients to hold on to their shares; don't sell, don't buy  more. He thinks that Rockwell will earn $2.55 a share this year and $2.75 in  1991. The company had a profit of $2.87 a share in 1989.  </P> <P> The Institutional Brokers Estimate System computer shows that Nisbet's  estimates for Rockwell's earnings aren't much different from those of his  peers. The average estimate among analysts who follow Rockwell is $2.54 a share  this year.  </P> <P> Q: I have two certificates from the registrar of the Land Office in St. Louis.  One is signed by Franklin Pierce and dated June 10, 1856. The other is signed  by Zachary Taylor and dated June 1, 1850. They should have some value. Whom  could I contact to see how much they are worth? -- Hermann, Mo.  </P> <P> A: Zachary Taylor was the 12th President of the United States. He was in office  from his inauguration in 1849 until his death in early July, 1850. If it is  authentic, President Taylor's signature is worth about $950, according to Haley  Garrison, an expert in antique financial documents. There is a big "if" here  that I will get back to in a moment.  </P> <P> Franklin Pierce was the 14th President and was in office from 1853 to 1857. His  signature is worth about $600, Garrison says. He apparently liked to sign his  name a lot more than President Taylor.  </P> <P> As happens today, Presidents don't always sign documents themselves, leaving  that chore to secretaries and assistants. So the signatures on your  certificates may not be authentic. Garrison says if you send him photostats,  he'll try to determine if they are. He can be reached at (800) 451-4504.  </P> <P> For all the other readers who wrote to me about antique financial documents  that they want evaluated, you can call Garrison, R. M. Smythe &amp; Co. at  (800) 622-1880 or Scott Winslow at (800) 225-6233. They do some types of  evaluations for free but charge for others.  </P> <P> Q: I am 70, retired and living on a limited income. The few assets that I have  are invested in Templeton Global Income Fund. I bought into it at $8.875 a  share, and the price has moved to $7.50. Does fluctuation in interest rates  have an influence on this type of fund? Is this fund a wise choice for the  short and long haul? -- Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> A: The Templeton Global Income fund is a closed-end bond fund that trades on  the New York Stock Exchange. It is one of a number operated by John Templeton,  considered one of the smartest investors around. The Global Income Fund invests  in bonds of companies around the world. In 1989, the fund rose 5.2%. It's down  about 0.2% this year. Neither performance would get the fund into the record  books.  </P> <P> Incidentally, it recently had a net asset value of $8.23 a share. The folks at  Templeton say John Templeton is so sure that the fund will do well that he  invested $1.4 million of his own money in it. But the truth is that a fund of  this kind carries multiple risks.  </P> <P> Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research, a  newsletter publisher in Ft. Lauderdale, points out that not only does this fund  react to changes in interest rates, but it also fluctuates on the value of the  dollar. "If the U.S. dollar goes up 20%, all things being equal, you are going  to lose 20%," Fosback says.  </P> <P> Someone looking for less volatility in his investments should "leave the  currency risk to professionals," Fosback says. "There is no reason for a  70-year-old to get involved in this," he adds.  </P> <P> Q: I read in a newsletter that an investor could purchase stock without dealing  with a broker. I would appreciate knowing if you have heard of this method. --  Kenmore, N.Y.  </P> <P> A: "Theoretically, you can do it," says Enno Hobbing, a spokesman for the  National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory brokerage industry  group. "But I've hardly heard of it" being done.  </P> <P> If a friend owns a share of AT&amp;T and wants to sell it to you, all you have  to do is give him an agreed-upon price, and he can sign the stock certificate  over to you. Then you'd have to contact the stock's transfer agent, which is  usually listed on the certificate, so the company knows that you are the new  owner and are entitled to dividends.  </P> <P> Now suppose you met a stranger on a street corner. "Psst," he says. "Ya wanna  buy some AT&amp;T stock?" You could, theoretically, also do this transaction  without a broker. Handle it in the same way as with your friend. But, of  course, you have no way of knowing whether the stock is valid. The stranger  could have printed it in his basement, or it could be stolen. "You don't know  what you are getting," says Hobbing. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

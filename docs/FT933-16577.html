			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas puts helicopter plans on hold McDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, said yesterday that it had decided not to actively pursue the sale of its helicopter business or its involvement in a joint venture. The company, which announced last year that it was exploring partnership and sale possibilities, said it had intensively evaluated a number of serious prospects but had concluded that a partnership or sale at this time was not in the best interests of the company or its customers. The helicopter unit, which is based at Mesa, Arizona, produces the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter and the MD 500 and MD Explorer commercial lines. McDonnell Douglas said it would now fully integrate the unit into its McDonnell Douglas aerospace business. McDonnell Douglas also announced yesterday that its second-quarter results would include Dollars 57m of unusual after-tax gains. Some Dollars 43m would come from the partial reversal of a charge taken in the first quarter of last year for the adoption of a new accounting standard on retirees' health benefits.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIROHITO'S FUNERAL  </P> <P> I cannot find the words to describe the feelings I am undergoing regarding  President Bush's trip to Japan for the funeral of Hirohito.  </P> <P> I remember so well the three years-plus I spent as a young Marine in the  Pacific. I cannot forget all the dead on all those islands. The remains of all  the sailors and Marines entombed on the Arizona, the death marches -- dear God,  has it all been forgotten?  </P> <P> Bush did not have to go. I feel such sorrow and such shame for us all.  </P> <P> M. RAY FENSTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

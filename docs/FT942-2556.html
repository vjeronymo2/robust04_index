			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Greycoat Yesterday's Pounds 47m rights issue from Greycoat underlines how much baggage many property companies are still carrying. Like Wates City of London's cash call on Thursday, Greycoat is making a second demand only months after asking shareholders to rescue it from the brink. Also like Wates, a large slice of the proceeds will go towards refinancing an existing property. Greycoat is taking full control because a partner is unwilling to put up additional funds when outstanding debt falls due. One wonders how many more recently distressed property companies will be tempted to come back for a second helping. By pricing its rights at a 30 per cent discount to net asset value, Greycoat is at least offering something like fair value. Although the company will still be 137 per cent geared after the issue, most of its debt is fixed rate. With its portfolio fully let, servicing the debt burden out of rental income should not cause sleepless nights. The company's largest properties are also in the west end of London, where the prospects for rental growth are brightest. With some of its largest tenants already paying higher rents than the market norm, though, much depends on Greycoat's ability to add value though development. Its interest in sites such as Paternoster Square, near St Paul's Cathedral, certainly gives plenty of scope. Finding the right institutional partners and striking attractive development deals will be the real test.</p>

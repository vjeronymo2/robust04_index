			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu by </F> Ryszard Malik; place and date not given: "Politics Is Decided  by the Strongest"]    [Text] [Malik] The "Partnership for Peace" initiative -- a  program for all former communist countries proposed by NATO in  Brussels -- does not fully satisfy the Poles. As you probably  know, Poland had its own vision of a future security structure  in Europe. How does Romania assess the "Partnership for Peace"  plan?    [Spiroiu] I think the NATO proposal is a good resolution for  our part of Europe, for all countries of the former communist  bloc. It does not single out or discriminate against anyone,  and, first of all, it does not draw any new borders or a new  geopolitical divisions within Europe. The Romanian Army seeks  integration with NATO. This is in line with our foreign policy,  the key goal of which is the preservation of peace and stability  in the region. I would like to stress that all political forces  agree on this. Romania is not interested in conflicts with any  country. On the contrary, it longs to see peace in the Balkans,  in the former Yugoslavia. I would like to remind everyone that  due to the embargo imposed on our exports to the new Yugoslavia,  our state loses millions of dollars annually. Romania  understands, however, that there is no other way to achieve  peace in the former Yugoslavia than through dialogue. Despite  great losses endured through support for such policy, Romania  will not break free from the group of countries observing these  sanctions.    I suppose, however, that the "Partnership for Peace" in its  current form does not satisfy all countries or meet all their  expectations -- particularly in Poland, the Czech Republic, and  Hungary. I understand that, for example, German policy seeks to  move NATO's borders farther to eastward. However, what might be  good for Germany does not mean that it could meet the  expectations of all Central and East European countries.  Romania speaks out for the creation of a security structure  throughout Europe that would eliminate the fear of new conflicts  and treat all states on an equal footing, without any privileges.    [Malik] At the same time, you support Russia's position,  which blocked Poland's admission to NATO....    [Spiroiu] I also understand Russian fears of NATO expansion  with new members. Such an outcome would serve all those who  oppose the continuation of the democratic process in Russia  begun by President Boris Yeltsin, all conservative and  pro-imperialist forces. It would be grist for the mill of such  people as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In this situation,  "Partnership for Peace" is the optimal but not the final  solution. It is also a good endeavor for another reason -- it  coincides with the period of transformation that our part of  Europe is now experiencing, and the changes in NATO which is  trying to find a place for itself after the end of the Cold War.    [Malik] Prior to the NATO meeting in January, President Ion  Iliescu criticized the proposal of joint guarantees for Central  and East European countries provided by the Americans and  Russians. Do you not think that such guarantees would actually  mean a new Yalta?    [Spiroiu] I will respond briefly: Politics is decided by the  strongest.    [Malik] Over recent years, Romania, like other countries of  the former communist bloc, has changed its foreign and defense  policies. What changes have occurred in the Army?    [Spiroiu] Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the  socialist bloc, we began to adjust the Army to meet the new  situation. Under the agreement on conventional armed forces,  the Romanian Army can retain the maximum number of 230,000  servicemen. We predict that in the future it will be an Army  based on professional soldiers to a great extent. "Partnership  for Peace" meets our expectations and as it confirms the  expediency of the covered course concerning the reorganization  of the Army. The aim of this reorganization was to adjust our  military structures to West European standards, particularly to  NATO structures.    [Malik] Polish-Romanian relations are not assessed as very  good, and I became convinced of this during a visit of mine to  Bucharest. How does military cooperation look against this  backdrop?    [Spiroiu] Good and friendly relations have existed between  Romanian and Polish citizens, as well as between our states,  throughout history. Over the last two years, we have begun the  restoration of the ties we severed after the changes in both  countries. I believe that our armies should also have good  relations. I am saying with regret, however, that currently  there is no closer cooperation despite a number of initiatives  undertaken since 1991. Some unforeseen circumstances have  always hampered the conclusion of such an agreement, for  example, the replacement of the Polish defense minister, and  last year's elections in Poland. I hope that a relevant  agreement will be signed shortly.</p>

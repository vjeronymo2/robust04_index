			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Galvis from the "AM-PM" newscast] </F>   [Text] Upon arriving in the United States from London,  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said President Cesar  Gaviria's administration is subservient to the United States. De  Greiff called several U.S. officials liars and accused President  Gaviria of unnecessarily criticizing him for his fight against  drug traffickers. De Greiff said the president wanted to calm  the U.S. Government's temper by attacking him. The prosecutor  general said of the Colombian Government: They want to make  themselves appear to be subservient to the U.S. Government by  attacking me.    As for the accusations that Colombia is a narcodemocracy, De  Greiff said it is an exaggerated perception and once again  called Senator Kerry and Assistant Attorney General Harris liars.</p>

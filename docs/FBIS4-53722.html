			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin sent a message to President Kim Yong-sam on Saturday to  express his regret over the indefinite postponement of the first  Korea-Russia joint economic committee meeting.    The meeting was put off after Russia abruptly cancelled the  visit to Seoul by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin who  was to represent Russia at the meeting slated for May 20-21.    In the message, Yeltsin said he was very sorry for the  cancellation of Shokhin's visit to Seoul due to Russia's  domestic situation.    Russian Ambssador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze called on Vice  Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong to hand him the message for  delivery to President Kim.    Asking for President Kim's understanding of the "unexpected  sitaution" that kept the Russian delegation from visiting Seoul,  Yeltsin said he was suggesting that the meeting be held in  Moscow at an appropriate time before President Kim's planned  visit to Moscow.    The Russian president also said in the message his country  was looking forward to President Kim's visit to Moscow, which he  said would be very useful to bilateral relations in many aspects.</p>

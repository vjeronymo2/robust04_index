			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Union derecognition exceeds predictions DERECOGNITION of trade unions over the past five years has been far greater than most commentators assume, but has affected less than 100,000 employees, says a paper to be presented to tomorrow's annual Labour Process Conference. The paper says that between August 1988 and March 1993 there have been 304 cases of derecognition, an average annual rate of about 70. The sectors most affected have been newspapers and publishing, ports and shipping, banking and insurance, transport and distribution, chemicals and oil, the health service and the water industry. The paper, by Mr Gregor Gall of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and Dr Sonia McKay of the Labour Research Department, also finds that the spread of derecognition has changed. 'It is no longer a predominantly middle-level managerial or white-collar or non-manufacturing industry phenomenon or one that arises only out of a fall in union membership,' says the paper. The paper says that the three most common reasons for derecognition are low levels of union membership; a move to a single-union agreement and privatisation. The researchers conclude that most employers are not seriously considering a 'full-frontal' derecognition offensive but rather pushing through radical changes within a collective bargaining context.</p>

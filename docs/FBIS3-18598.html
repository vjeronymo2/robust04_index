			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 March], FRG Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel received Somsavat Lengsavat, foreign  minister of the People's Republic of Laos, for an exchange of  views on the economic relations between the two states. This is  the first visit by a foreign minister since the assumption of  diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1958.    Kinkel paid tribute to the economic opening up of the small  Southeast Asian people's republic and promised the continuation  of German development aid, as it also corresponds to the new  Asia concept of German foreign policy. However, framework  conditions for investments must be established by Laos itself.  With an annual per-capita income of $210, Laos is one of the  poorest countries in Asia. Since 1990, Germany has provided  about 80 million German marks in development aid, particularly  in the health sector.</p>

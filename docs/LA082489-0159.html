			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITY RECYCLING PROGRAM IS SPARING THOSE TREES  </P> <P> Fast approaching its second year in operation, Irvine's curbside-recycling  program has collected enough old newspapers to save 95,000 trees this year,  officials said.  </P> <P> Irvine Recycles, which enjoys widespread support among Irvine residents,  collected more than 5,500 tons of recyclable waste this fiscal year. According  to a study released this week, every ton of newspaper collected saves 17 trees  35 feet tall. Residents place glass, certain plastics, aluminum and newspapers  in stacking bins, which are collected outside their homes each week.  </P> <P> City officials say that 71% of the homeowners participate in the recycling  program.  </P> <P> "Our main goal wasn't financial, it was environmental," said MaryAnne  Hetherington-Wysard, management analyst for the program. "It might be costing  us a bit more to recycle these products, but we are simply diverting dumping in  Coyote Canyon dump."  </P> <P> That dump, which serves all of southern Orange County, is estimated to be  nearing capacity. City officials hope that other cities will follow their lead  and adopt similar recycling programs. Officials from Laguna Beach, Anaheim and  Los Angeles have already inquired about the Irvine program, officials said..  </P> <P> At Tuesday night's City Council meeting, Hetherington-Wysard announced plans to  step up promotion of the program to increase response. A six-minute video on  how the system works, designed to persuade other cities to follow suit, was  shown to the council.  </P></p>

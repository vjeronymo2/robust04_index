			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> UTILITY BILLS CAUSE UPROAR IN NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: RESTRUCTURING THE ECONOMY SENT RATES SKYROCKETING, SHOCKING  THE PUBLIC AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS ALIKE.  </P> <P> When Nicaragua's new government yanked subsidies for public services, utility  bills took off and diplomats hit the roof.  </P> <P> But instead of simply refusing to pay, as many Nicaraguans are doing, the  foreign officials organized a protest and their bills were put on hold pending  an investigation.  </P> <P> "We pay the light and water (bills) when they are normal, but not when they are  exaggerated," said Soviet Embassy press attache Vyacheslav Spassky.  </P> <P> A diplomatic source said the Soviets were stunned by an electric bill in July  for $4,000. Under the Sandinistas, who were voted out of office in February,  monthly utility bills rarely exceeded a few hundred dollars.  </P> <P> President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's economic restructuring program passed  the full cost of electric, water, sewer and telephone services to consumers.  </P> <P> Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga recently said the government reduced  its monthly deficit from $28 million in April, when Chamorro took over, to $7  million in September.  </P> <P> Nicaraguans, however, have not quickly adapted to the new prices after a decade  of Sandinista subsidies.  </P> <P> The first effects of the austerity program surfaced in July with food, gas and  utility price increases that jolted people in a country where wages of less  than $100 a month are common.  </P> <P> A government official, who asked that her name not be used, said her mother  received an $800 water bill, based on the official exchange rate.  </P> <P> The black-market rate, once well above the official rate, is now only slightly  better than at the banks.  </P> <P> "This goes beyond ridiculous. It is just incredible, it's astounding, it's,  it's . . . " the exasperated official said.  </P> <P> With electricity, a typical family bill that was $8 a month is now around $117.  </P> <P> The diplomatic protest began in September at a dinner when somebody complained  about soaring utility bills, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stedman Howard.  </P> <P> Soon, all the 42 accredited foreign missions in Managua confronted the Foreign  Ministry, which appointed a committee to look into the complaints and told the  embassies to hold off paying bills until meters and consumption were checked.  </P> <P> Technicians found broken water pipes at the North Korean Embassy that explained  high water bills there, said ministry spokesman David Silva.  </P> <P> But the Libyans would not let technicians in to check out the water meters, and  Cuban officials complained that meter readers never got close enough to take a  reading.  </P> <P> Although Howard declined to say how much the U.S. Embassy was being billed, he  said his home electric bill went from $200 to $780 in one month.  </P> <P> "That's indicative of the general trend," Howard said.  </P></p>

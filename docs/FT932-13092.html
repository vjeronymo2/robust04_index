			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: A calmer horse on a safer course - Horse Trials / Precautions for this year's Badminton event not least to behave himself. This magnificent nine-year-old eventer took Mary Thomson to her first win at Badminton in 1992. The same bold, headstrong beast then ruined her day at the Barcelona Olympics, taking her round the El Montanya cross country course at a speed and style that left the rider feeling shattered and irrelevant. 'It was horrible, a nightmare. I kept thinking why is this happening to me here, at the Olympics?' remembered Mary, as she prepared for the new season. 'He'd always been brave and forward-going but that was very close to bolting  -ugly and horrible. 'Towards the end of the course I was beginning to run out of energy and wasn't sure that I could continue to hold him. I was an absolute jelly when I got off and couldn't stand up but Willy was itching to go round again. 'The irony was that because of the Spanish heat there were an army of vets standing by to attend to any exhausted horses. I can tell you that I needed the medical aid a great deal more than King William.' In the media centre the world's press assumed that Mary and William had taken the slower, safe route at many fences because they were 'riding to orders' from a British team anxious to conserve points. This alleged excess of caution was attacked in many papers the following day, leaving Mary and and her team-mates angry and despondent. With the show-jumping section still to come, they were unlikely to disclose William's exact state of mind to the world but as Mary is now able to point out, taking the 'chicken run' through those fences was more about saving life than points and no one needed to tell her to do it. It was a bitterly disappointing end to a season that had begun so well. Mary Thomson describes 1992 in her book Mary Thomson's Eventing Year (David &amp; Charles, Pounds 17.99). It was a spell that began with a mood dangerously familiar to all top athletes. 'When I won at Windsor a fortnight after Badminton it was my fifth consecutive win at a major three-day event. I was really on a roll, flying. Willy and I didn't seem to be able to do anything wrong,' recalls Mary. 'Winning at Badminton was a dream forever. I'd been second but to win was such a higher gear. There is nothing like actually winning and going across country it gives you the confidence that is so important. You can fill a horse with optimism and bravery if you're feeling totally on top of things.' Thomson recalls the Sunday service at the little Badminton church on the morning after three horses had fallen and had to destroyed in the cross-country phase. It was the worst day in Badminton's history and has caused much heart-searching, not least with Hugh Thomas, the event director and course designer. 'I have to know in my heart that the course was OK and that is why we've had such intensive inquiries into the whole business,' said Thomas, a former top event rider. 'Last year's accidents hurt our image with the public and quite rightly. It damaged peoples' perceptions of what we are about in this sport.' This year around 200,000 spectators will come to Badminton to see 80 of the world's top event riders compete for the Mitsubishi Trophy. Last year after a long spell of dry weather it began to pour with rain around dawn on cross-country day. By late morning the course was extremely slippery, although the technical judge pronounced it fit to ride. 'It was very difficult for the early riders but our investigations have shown that the conditions were only a factor in the first of the three accidents,' said Thomas. 'Once we began to get a certain pressure - not from the competitors - to consider postponement, ironically conditions improved because the early horses had cut the ground up a fair bit. We can't find any explanation at all for the subsequent accidents. One fatality was in the water jump and in all my years in the sport I can't remember such a thing. Water usually cushions a fall.' There have been changes. The take-off area immediately in front of each fence will be roped off and out-of-bounds to the public for a week beforehand. Thousands of human feet can compact the ground and make it potentially dangerous if there is sudden rain. 'One is reluctant to spoil peoples' enjoyment and appreciation of how difficult the whole thing is,' said Thomas. 'But safety has to come first.' His fence repair team will switch their focus to keeping the going safe. 'It is amazing what half-a-dozen shovelfuls of stone-dust can achieve,' said Thomas, who confesses to coming from an era when such precautions would have been thought wimpish. Thomas is a technichal adviser to the International Equestrian Federation. He is aware that in some countries eventing is seen as bordering on cruelty to horses. Thomas is just back from Atlanta and talks with the American Humane Society (the equivalent of the RSPCA) over their concerns relating to the sport. As perhaps the best-known three-day event in the world Badminton cannot afford any more mishaps. But in the short run the most interesting question is who will win? King William has a new 'cherry roller' bit imported from the US which, according to Mary, makes him easier to manage. At Belton last weekend he went beautifully across cross country and jumped a clear round in the show-jumping, his weakest phase. 'If Mary and King William are in the form they were last year they will be nearly unbeatable,' believes Hugh Thomas.</p>

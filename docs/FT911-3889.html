			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Pakistan renews drive for economic liberalisation PAKISTAN yesterday announced more steps in its programme of economic liberalisation aimed at scrapping government controls and launching a drive towards privatisation, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad. Mr Shujaat Hussain, industries minister, said foreign businessmen no longer needed to seek permits to work in Pakistan. They would only need an ordinary visa. Mr Malik Naeem, commerce minister, announced a new export policy, with fresh incentives for Pakistani businessmen. To boost exports, the government would provide two-thirds of the cost of setting up new institutions for improving workers' training, if business associations paid the rest. A new export-import bank providing specialised help for Pakistani exporters was announced. A marketing promotion programme would begin soon to train trade attaches serving abroad. Officials say the government intends to sell off at least one-third of Pakistan's 150-strong public-sector units by the end of this year. The exports drive is aimed at ending Pakistan's Dollars 2bn annual trade deficit.</p>

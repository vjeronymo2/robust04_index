			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Dublin 'concern' on IRA deaths ONE OF the four IRA men shot dead by the Army minutes after an attack on a Northern Ireland police station had been cleared at a London court last year of gun-running charges, it emerged yesterday. Kevin O'Donnell, 21, was arrested in London in May 1990. He later told an Old Bailey jury that he had no knowledge of weapons found in his car and was subsequently acquitted. The Dublin government yesterday expressed concern about the shootings, as Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, predicted an early meeting between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the new Irish premier. An armed IRA gang attacked the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Coalisland station at about 10.35pm on Sunday. Minutes later there was an exchange of gunfire near the town. The RUC said: 'Soldiers in uniform encountered a number of vehicles and armed men at Dernagh crossroads, at a car park, at St Patrick's Roman Catholic church. There was an exchange of gunfire. Four men were killed, two were wounded and are in hospital under police guard. A soldier was wounded and is in hospital.' 'A heavy 12.7mm machine-gun, mounted on a hijacked lorry, was recovered at the scene along with several AK47 rifles,' the RUC added. All those killed are understood to have been members of the IRA's East Tyrone 'brigade'. The unit has lost several members in confrontations with the security forces, including eight who were shot dead at Loughall, South Armagh, nearly five years ago. It is believed that soldiers had been monitoring the 'brigade' for several weeks. The Rev William McCrae, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, supported the 'effective engagement' of terrorists, saying it would save lives. 'I trust this is the commencement of a vigorous and determined security initiative.' Mr Francie Molloy, a Sinn Fein councillor, alleged that the deaths arose from a 'deliberate shoot-to-kill policy' by the Army. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday assured Mr Andrews that the government would continue to treat Northern Ireland as a priority problem. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Lisbon Mr Hurd told his Irish counterpart that Mr Major would continue his involvement in all-party talks on the province. Police yesterday discovered a suspected IRA underground arms bunker in the Irish Republic. About 1,000 rounds of ammunition and five magazines were found in a bunker beneath a cowshed on a farm near the town of Abbeyfeale, on the border of County Kerry and County Limerick. A 17-year-old Protestant man was shot dead last night when a gunman opened fire inside a video club in north Belfast. The attack happened in the Upper Crumlin Road district. The shot man was a member of staff in the video club.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has never intended to veto the development of  Caspian off shore oil deposits, a senior Russian government  official, responsible for the oil and gaz complex told the Oil  Information Agency on Thursday.    In his words, national interests in the Caspian region will  be protected by developing the network of export oil pipe-lines  and by helping Russian companies to consolidate their position  on oil markets.    "Charges that Moscow is striving to dominate or assume some  exceptional rights to develop Caspian oil deposits are ludicrous  and disregard one simple fact: the bulk of the oil extracted on  the shelf will all the same be exported across the territory of  Russia," the official said.    He described as "a campaign coordinated in favour of western  firms" press reports that Russia is demanding the right to veto  the Caspian shelf's development.    The British newspaper Financial Times has reported with  reference to Russian government sources that in a confidential  letter to London Russia's Foreign Ministry made it clear that a  sanction from Moscow is essential for implementing all Caspian  shelf projects.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Convictions a jolt to City 'bad behaviour' - Four defendants found guilty, Six acquitted during year-long trial, Case adds to controversy over prosecution of complex frauds YESTERDAY'S convictions of four of the defendants in the Blue Arrow trial has sent the biggest shock through the City since the Guinness scandal erupted five years ago. Then, the arrest of corporate financiers from two of the City's foremost houses - Morgan Grenfell and Cazenove - prompted a period of intense navel-gazing as financiers and other professionals digested the case's implications: that advisers could be hauled into the dock alongside the companies they advised. The turmoil at Morgan Grenfell after the Guinness scandal broke also brought home how the reputations of financial houses could be called into question. The upheavals at County NatWest and Phillips &amp; Drew after the Blue Arrow scandal repeated the message. Yesterday's verdicts, though, brought home a different message: City advisers can also be convicted. Against the background of a growing belief in the City and legal worlds that complex financial wrongdoing is more a matter for expert regulators than the criminal law, that has come as a shock. The belief that prosecutors would find it difficult to gain convictions of City advisers had been strengthened in the past week by the collapse of trials against three City defendants over the Guinness affair. The successful prosecutions of four of the individual defendants in the Blue Arrow case are unlikely to change the view in the City that complicated financial malpractice should not be tried in the courts. The financial watchdogs set up after the Financial Services Act - which came into effect after the offences in the Blue Arrow case - certainly think they provide the best apparatus for tackling such cases. Mr John Young, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator for London's securities markets, said of the Blue Arrow verdicts: 'It just leaves me feeling that in cases of that sort - those to do with misleading markets, or misusing market information - you need a rapid regulatory approach with quick action which would hurt, including expulsion from the industry and penal fines. It would all be over in six months. That is better than a five-year trudge through the courts.' Long before yesterday's verdicts the financial scandals of the 1980s had had a marked effect on City practice. Corporate financiers agree that specific procedures in rights issues are now far more tightly observed, while Blue Arrow underlined the importance of obtaining proper legal advice. It also brought home the need for greater management control in banks and securities houses. Bankers remain reluctant to speak publicly about the changes that followed Blue Arrow. Two senior investment bankers in different firms agreed, however, that it undoubtedly illustrated the need to get full legal advice on disclosure obligations and tactics used to support clients. Equally importantly, it highlighted the need for good management in an area where, they admitted, aggression had always to be kept under control. Both agreed that in the excitement of a hostile bid, for example, it remained possible to be carried way and place the bank's money and reputation at risk. Blue Arrow has also had more specific effects on practice in rights issues. Procedures surrounding the late acceptance of share applications in issues have tightened considerably as a result. Whereas flexibility used to be shown, and was considered to be in the interests of all concerned, deadlines for receiving acceptances are now adhered to far more rigidly. One of the bankers also pointed to the organisational improvements in large houses to prevent accidental breaches of disclosure requirements. He said that five years ago such practice was somewhat shoddy. Announcements to the market are now more carefully worded. In the 1980s, according to one broker, there was a general acceptance of the need for an element of caveat emptor to be applied to the reading of advisers' announcements. Now there is increased concern about the potential to mislead. Whether this has led to more information being given out to the markets is debatable. The prosecution in the Blue Arrow case of a City solicitor - Mr Alan Keat of Travers Smith Braithwaite, an adviser to County - was unsuccessful, but left many lawyers feeling vulnerable. It has prompted some to reassess their procedures. At the heart of their concern is the possibility that merely by advising and acting for a client, a solicitor might be charged on the basis that he must have known everything his client was doing. Pressure on solicitors to take a more 'pro-active' role in deals - operating increasingly as house lawyers for their clients and required to come up with solutions to enable a deal to succeed - further underlines this concern. Mr John Grieves, head of corporate finance at Freshfields, said there was now an increased willingness to prosecute which must inevitably make solicitors more vigilant. 'Life is a lot more hazardous because there is a tendency to have a go at anyone who has been involved,' he said. His firm's principle of using two partners on all big transactions, particularly hostile bids, had been strengthened to avoid leaving one partner isolated. The solicitor had been helped by a general change in attitude brought about by prosecutions such as Blue Arrow and Guinness and the regulatory structure set up after the Financial Services Act, he said. The changes following Blue Arrow and Guinness have led to big changes in practice. City financiers and lawyers like to project these scandals as part of a different age, characterising them as manifestations of the 1980s bull market. Yet City fraud persists - only its nature has changed. The Maxwell case provides the most striking evidence that the new regulatory system is not infallible, although some insiders claim that the extent of wrongdoing runs far wider. A corporate finance lawyer with one large City practice, who refused to be named, said: 'There are always things to lie and cheat about, only the cases change. I don't think the cycle of bad behaviour is the cycle of boom markets.' The problem now was the lack of information revealed to the market about the financial position some companies were in, he said. If one company failed to announce bad news and no action was taken, then another followed suit. The result: 'Pretty soon, you're on that slippery slope again . . .'</p>

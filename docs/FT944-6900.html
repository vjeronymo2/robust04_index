			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Moscow and Tokyo agree to boost ties Russia and Japan yesterday signed agreements to improve economic ties and postpone Russian trade debts. The economic accords mark another small step towards the normalisation of Japan's strained relations with Russia, seen until recently as a dangerous and unreliable neighbour. Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russian first deputy foreign minister, signed four economic agreements designed to increase trade and restructure a small part of Russia's Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) debt. Japanese officials quoted Mr Soskovets as saying: 'We must build trust on all fronts, through political dialogue, military affairs and regional contact.' He complained, however, that trade with Japan had declined, and called for a new high-level bilateral trade committee, chaired by Mr Soskovets and Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese deputy premier and foreign minister, to speed up agreements on tax, investment protection and transport. Mr Kono said, however, that Russia must put its own economic house in order before foreign investment would come in significant quantities. The agreements allow Russia to extend repayments on Dollars 280m of debt to Japanese companies and the Japanese Export Import Bank over 10 years following a three-year grace period. There was also agreement to export 5m cu m of wood a year from Russia's Far East to Japan; a Japanese promise of Dollars 500m in humanitarian aid; support from Tokyo for Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation and Japanese support for the Russian economic reforms. However, according to the Russian official news agency Tass, the Japanese refused a Russian request for an extra Dollars 130m of credits above the Dollars 400m already promised to aid the reconstruction of four huge plants  -the AZLK car plant in Moscow, the Kamaz truck plant in Naberezhnye Chelny, the Impuls engineering plant in Petersburg and the Yaroslavl synthetics enterprise. The economic agreements continue a process which began with President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo just over a year ago, in which he agreed to open negotiations on the four disputed Kurile islands off northern Japan, seized by Russia in the last days of the second world war. Tokyo agreed, in return, to relax its former policy of making any increase in Russian aid conditional on progress over the islands dispute. Because of Russia's ownership claim, Japan remains the only member of the Group of Seven yet to sign a second world war peace treaty with Moscow. The Kuriles are a popular symbol of both Japanese and Russian national pride. The Kuriles issue remains - according to a Japanese foreign ministry spokesman - 'difficult and long-lasting'. Mr Kono brusquely refused a proposal from Mr Soskovets to discuss economic co-operation on the Kuriles, saying this contradicted the Japanese position that they must be returned. Today, Mr Soskovets is due to meet prime minister Mr Tomiichi Murayama, and other ministers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan  Al Nuhayyan, last night received a telephone call from President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of the sisterly Republic of Yemen. The  Yemeni president briefed President Zayid on the latest Yemeni  developments.    Shaykh Zayid asked the Yemeni brothers to resolve their  differences through reason, logic, and dialogue to serve Yemen  and the Yemeni people.    President Zayid expressed his deep concern over the  continued  fighting in Yemen and appealed to all sides to stop fighting  immediately to end the bloodshed and take the course of dialogue  and understanding in preparation for resuming good offices and  mediations to resolve differences and place the interests of  Yemen and its people above all other considerations.    During the telephone conversation, the president said that  he  was confident that the Yemeni leaders and figures would be able  to solve their differences and effect a brotherly reconciliation  instead of shedding blood, killing, and wasting resources,  something which saddens every Arab and Muslim. Yemen and its  people are dear to us and we harbor great love for them. His  highness said: We appeal to you to fear God in dealing with  Yemen and its people and to resort to reason instead of arms.    His highness warned against aggravating the fighting and the  resulting inability to control the situation and held the Yemeni  leaders responsible. He said: We must give advice and do  whatever we can to steer Yemen away from this painful fate.    His highness has been in constant contact with the leaders  of  fraternal Yemen for the past several days within his highness'  endeavors to follow Yemeni developments.</p>

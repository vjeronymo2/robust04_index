			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The government announced  Tuesday a plan to liberalize imports of 46 marine products over  the next three years which will be submitted to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this week.    Under the plan, the government will liberalize imports of  frozen Alaskan pollack fillets from Jan. 1, 1995, those of  frozen sharks, salted shrimp and three other products from July  1, 1995, those of frozen Alaskan pollack from Jan. 1, 1996,  those of frozen sauries and 15 others from July 1, 1996, and  exports of the remaining 23 items including frozen yellow  corvinas, eels and hair-tails from July 1, 1997. In addition to  the scheme, the government has also decided to advance import  liberalization for angler fish and two others from 1997 to 1995,  the announcement said.    The government has already liberalized imports of 302 of the  348 marine products and has now decided to free up imports of  the remaining 46 products in three stages over the 1995-97  period.    South Korea graduated from the GATT balance-of-payments  clause in October 1989 as its balance of international payments  went into the black, and promised the GATT that it would  liberalize imports of 279 farm and marine products between 1992  and 1997.    The government will liberalize imports of all these products  by July 1, 1997, except for beef and live cattle, agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Ministry officials said.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Britons show up poorly in charity survey Britain's notion of itself as a philanthropic nation that gives generously to charity is challenged by an international study published today. It shows that, while a majority of Britons make donations to charity, the amounts they give do not bear comparison with donations made overseas. A British charity supporter donates an average of only Pounds 2 per month - one-sixth of the amount of a US counterpart, and far lower than Canadian, French or Spanish donors. The survey, the first international comparative study of giving and volunteering, illustrates the seriousness of the dilemma facing the British voluntary sector. It is coming under increasing pressure to provide additional services while the public still finances charities with small change. The British are far more likely to contribute relatively small amounts than donors in any of the other four countries surveyed: 19 per cent of British donors give less than Pounds 1 per month, compared with only 2 per cent in Canada and France, 4 per cent in the US and 8 per cent in Spain. While 11 per cent of British donors are shown by the survey to give more than Pounds 10 per month, they are overshadowed by 28 per cent in Canada, 26 per cent in the US and 21 per cent in Spain. The bright spot in the findings for British charities is that the proportion of the population donating to charity - 65 per cent - was the highest of any of the countries surveyed except Spain, where the results were influenced by large numbers of people buying tickets for charity lotteries. But although only 27 per cent of the French population had made a recent charitable donation when the survey was conducted, the average amount given was Pounds 10.10. One explanation for the disparity may be that street and door-to-door collections remain the most common way of raising money from individuals in Britain. French donors are more likely to respond to advertisements or appeal letters. Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the Charities Aid Foundation which co-ordinated the research, said that while giving to good causes was a strong and established part of the British culture, the results suggested that 'we do not value the role played by charities to the extent that some other countries do'.

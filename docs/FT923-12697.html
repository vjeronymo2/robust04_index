			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: German move hits builders THE BUILDING sectors of the stock market suffered another severe shakeout on news of the rise in Germany's discount rate, and its implications for the rest of Europe. The Bundesbank's move was seen as increasing the agony for a sector already suffering from the effect of prolonged high interest rates, falling house prices and general economic recession. Redland and RMC, the two building materials groups viewed by the market as having the widest exposure to the German market, and especially to the hoped-for rebuilding programme in east Germany, were given the roughest ride, with Redland sliding 19 to 445p and RMC 8 to 518p. Pilkington weak Glass manufacturer Pilkington was another to suffer in the materials sector, after the latest in a series of profits downgrades hit the shares. Analysts have moved estimates for the current-year profits to Pounds 70m from Pounds 100m after talks with the company. Yesterday, another UK broking house was said to have chopped its estimate for this year to Pounds 50m and forecast a halved dividend. The shares, which topped 330p in the summer of 1987, dropped like a stone to close 11 lower at 96p on heavy turnover of 6.2m. GUS strong Solid full-year results from Great Universal Stores sent the shares ahead in busy turnover of 1.2m. The performance of the retail arm was particularly impressive, with the Burberry division recovering well. Mr Ian McDougall at Nomura said: 'This is GUS reminding the market of what it can do.' The 'A' shares, ahead 74 at one stage, closed at 1448p, a rise of 43p on the day. Analysts lifted profits forecasts for 1993 to a range of Pounds 454m to Pounds 470m. County NatWest's Mr John Richards, at the bottom of the range, cautioned that GUS had run into flat trading conditions, as had all the high street retailers, and remained on a 'hold' stance for the stock. Vague hints that one small building or property group was about to go out of business caused another bout of selling. Many housebuilders were under considerable pressure, with Anglia Secure Homes, the sheltered homes group whose shares almost halved on Wednesday, plunging 3 more to 3 1/2 p. McCarthy &amp; Stone, another sheltered homes company, dipped 3 to 36p. Wilson Bowden lost 16 to 340p, Persimmon 12 to 226p and Barratt Homes 4 to 56p. Taylor Woodrow, still suffering from recent downgrades, dipped 4 to 66p. Support from a buy note was not strong enough to lift BAT Industries significantly. The tobacco and financial services conglomerate was up 13 in the morning after consideration of a recommendation by Kleinwort Benson. The house cut its estimate for full-year profits because of the slide in the dollar but believes the stock offers dividend growth, security and improved earnings. The rate news from Germany prompted the shares to slip back and close only 4 up at 774p. An announcement by medical charity Wellcome Trust that part of its forthcoming 330m-share issue in Wellcome would be in the form of a share swap gave an initial boost to the Wellcome share price. The issue is expected to raise around Pounds 2.8bn, which Wellcome Trust has said will be ploughed back into the market in order to diversify equity. BZW Investment Management is to manage a fund worth in excess of Pounds 500m which will in effect be created by institutions offloading blue chip stocks in exchange for Wellcome shares. The stock was up 5 before the announcement of the rise in German discount rate. Then, it fell to close a net penny off at 877p. Good support from one influential UK broking house drove Guardian Royal up 7 to 144p on heavy turnover of 5m. Legal &amp; General advanced 11 to 365p after announcing a change in accounting policy. Lasmo remained under the lash in an othwerwise calm oil sector, as worries about the recent falls in oil prices and the dollar compounded fears about the dividend. Specialists said they expected the group to pay the interim but the final was under scrutiny. Lasmo's interim results are expected on July 29. The shares dropped 12 to 144p and some dealers fear they may test the 100p mark last seen in 1986. Positive recommendations from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and County NatWest helped British Land gain 5 to 193p on 1.5m shares traded. A stock overhang and currency considerations depressed Grand Metropolitan, the shares falling 11 to 457p. ICI, which reacts to strength in the D-Mark, gained 16 to 1168p. The shares also continued to benefit from a positive approach from one agency broker. British Vita, also exposed to Germany, firmed 4 to 254p. Yorkshire Chemicals rallied 15 to 319p ahead of first-half results due in early August. Troubled Worth Investment Trust saw heavy volume overnight as one marketmaker took on 2.8m shares, a 9 per cent stake, at 14 1/4 p and placed the majority at 14 1/2 p in two blocks. The share price remained unchanged at 15p. Disappointing figures from package holiday group Owners Abroad were compounded by admissions of discounting by the company management, indicating that the much-touted industry price war might be taking its toll. The shares retreated heavily but recovered to close only 2 off at 64p. Rival operator Airtours tumbled 10 to 205p. Heavy trade in Forte saw nearly 6m dealt and the stock eased a penny to 162p. Rank Organisation, having fallen more than 20 per cent in the past six weeks after a series of downgrades, rallied 13 to 607p. Textiles and specialist castings manufacturer Hicking Pentecost jumped 11 to 130p after a bullish agm. Associated British Ports tumbled 26 to 320p after the company warned that it expects to make provisions of about Pounds 10m against the value of its property development portfolio. The slide in Alexander Proudfoot continued. At the day's worst, the stock was down 27 following an agency cross of 600,000 shares at 150p. Buying from two company directors helped to stabilise the shares, which were eventually a net 22 off at 172p. A profits upgrade boosted Siebe, which finished 14 to the good at 680p.

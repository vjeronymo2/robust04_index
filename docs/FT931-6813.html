			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Maxwell pensioners suffer setback: A look at the consequences of the social security committee's fears over sub judice rules PENSIONERS reacted with dismay to the decision by the cross-party Commons social security committee to postpone part of its investigation into the theft of Maxwell company pension funds. The committee's move follows advice from the Serious Fraud Office, which warned MPs last month that taking evidence in public from witnesses who might also be called in criminal proceedings could prejudice those trials. Yesterday the committee called on the Commons to consider the impact of its own sub judice rule on select committees' work, by referring the issue to the procedure committee. Since it has played a significant part in keeping up the pressure on the government over the issue and given the Maxwell pensioners a high profile, the campaigners clearly regard the delay to the inquiry as a blow. Mr Ken Trench, the chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said yesterday: 'It now appears that the select committee is being gagged by the call for justice for two or three individuals, and thousands of pensioners are suffering. We feel that the SFO has made a major mistake, and that justice for the Maxwell pensioners is being denied.' Committee members are keen, however, to dispel the idea that the postponement marks the end of their interest in the Maxwell affair. Mr Frank Field, the Labour committee chairman, said the inquiry would resume after relevant criminal proceedings had been completed, even though this would not be for many months. Mr David Shaw, a Tory committee member, emphasised that the MPs still intended to 'make sure the pensioners' interests are being looked after'. The committee spent several meetings discussing whether it could hear evidence privately, but the report concluded the risks of doing so were too great. It said: 'This approach would leave the inquiry open to rumour and speculation, some of it possibly deliberately contrived in order to suggest that the committee was conducting itself in a way which could affect the legal proceedings.' While Mr Field said the committee was relaxed about the decision, the report's call for a review of the operation of the sub judice rule reflects the frustration privately expressed by some committee members. The MPs have contrasted their own position unfavourably with the greater freedom enjoyed by some of their counterparts overseas, such as the congressional committees in the United States. This is the second time the rights and role of the Commons committees, set up in 1979, have been brought into question by the Maxwell inquiry. In March last year the committee said the Commons should consider the prima facie contempt of the House shown by Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell's refusal to answer the committee's questions. Though some MPs feel uneasy at the committee's strong line against the Maxwell brothers, others have relished the way its work has expanded beyond the government's conduct into inquiring into the conduct of the professions involved in the Maxwell affair and trying to track down the missing money. They will not easily relinquish this.</p>

The European Commission was still studying the panel's conclusions, said Mr MacSharry. 'On a limited reading, they're not acceptable to us, therefore there are no conclusions,' he said. He and Mr Madigan did not discuss the oilseed row. In theory, the EC must accept the panel's findings, if there is to be formal settlement.

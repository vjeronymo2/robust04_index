			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has  criticized Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal  for a Eurasian Union. Addressing a congress of the Union of  Officers on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy warned about "the danger for  those who are in favor of the restoration of the Soviet Union if  they support the initiative of President Nursultan Nazarbayev."  A community of states "with the same people -- Nazarbayev  (Uzbekistan President Islam) Karimov, (Georgian leader Eduard)  Shevardnadze, (Moldovan President Mircea) Snegur, and others -  staying in their offices would be the worst that could happen,"  "a trap for many years, from which it would be difficult to  break out," he said.    A "single union state" should be based on the territorial  unification of the former Soviet republics, the merger of their  armed forces, security services and financial systems, and  uniform citizenship, Zhirinovskiy said. Meanwhile, "Russians  living in regions where temporarily somebody else's flag is  flying, have the right to self-determination," he said.</p>

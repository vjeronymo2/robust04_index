			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips up before release of new figures Wall Street Blue chip stocks improved yesterday in anticipation of next week's earnings news, but a second round of benign inflation data failed to lift most share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.52 better at 3,910.47, mostly on the strength of two stocks ' Alcoa and Union Carbide. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.31 at 469.10. On the NYSE, declining issues outnumbered advances by a margin of 11-to-seven in moderate activity. Some 251m shares were exchanged. Other leading indices lost a little ground. The Nasdaq composite was 0.81 lower at 767.08, while the American SE composite dipped 0.07 to 458.50. Stocks essentially picked up where they had left off on Thursday, when morning gains were erased during the late afternoon. Yesterday the early selling suggested that the markets would have difficulty breaking through technical resistance after the powerful rally which commenced at the end of last week. The day's economic news filled in a few more details in the more positive outlook which began to take shape last Friday. The Labor Department said that consumer prices had risen 0.2 per cent in September, as forecast. The Federal Reserve announced that industrial production had stagnated last month, while capacity utilisation - an important indication of future inflation - had slipped from the previous month's level. Bonds, which were strong all week, managed a modest gain on the data. But stocks appeared to have run out of steam, too, as some investors booked profits on the recent advance. The Dow industrials were lifted late in the session by anticipation of strong earnings news from Alcoa, up Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 87. Union Carbide gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 3/4 and Kodak lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 49 1/2. Both companies are expected to release their results next week. In semiconductors, Texas Instruments forged Dollars 1 1/4 ahead to Dollars 68 5/8 after posting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.94 cents a share, a little better than analysts had forecast and well ahead of last year's result. Rubbermaid, the household products company, also posted improved sales and profits but its stock shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 25 7/8. There were a few developments unrelated to earnings which were stirring up stocks. Long Island Lighting jumped Dollars 1 1/8 , or nearly 7 per cent, to Dollars 17 5/8 after Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York, proposed that the state government purchase the utility. A deal would be expected to value the company at Dollars 21.50 a share, but the stock was trading lower than that level because Mr Cuomo faces a fierce challenge in his bid for re-election next month. In pharmaceuticals, McKesson dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 96 1/2 after Eli Lilly extended the waiting period on its tender offer for the company's PCS Health Systems division. The acquisition is under close scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission. Lilly was off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4. On the Nasdaq, shares in Intuit surged Dollars 17 1/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 . The 34 per cent gain came on news that the financial software developer had agreed to be acquired by Microsoft, down Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 15/16. Canada Toronto ended the week on a quiet note, down slightly in light trading yesterday but up overall on the week. The TSE 300 composite index was down 10.95 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 4,332.42, with losers ahead of winners by 404 to 307. Volume of 47.63m shares and value of CDollars 553.7m were down sharply from the previous day's 71.06m shares and CDollars 923.7m. The TSE composite 300 index was up about 42 points on the week. Overall, 10 of the 14 sub-indexes were down, led by real estate, golds, paper and forestry and oil and gas stocks.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Pillar of Raj shaken by vanishing money STANDARD Chartered Bank has just completed a magnificent restoration of its neo-Gothic banking hall in the heart of Bombay. The white marble gleams, and the crystal chandeliers sparkle. But staff have little time to admire their surroundings as they grapple with the bank's biggest financial upset in its 130 years in India. It claims it was defrauded of Rs8.9bn (Pounds 182m), and though it is trying to recover the money, it has provided Pounds 100m for possible losses. Thirteen people have left the bank in India, seven of them dismissed. The bank has accused two of fraud. Mr Parvesh Nat, chief executive for India, is resigning to take moral responsibility. Internal investigations are continuing, and further departures cannot be ruled out. Dislocations in the money markets forced Standard Chartered's London headquarters to pump Dollars 800m (Pounds 450m) into its Indian branches. It says high interest rates and adverse conditions arising from the scandal cost its Indian business Pounds 18m in the first half of 1992. The third-largest foreign bank, and once a pillar of the British Raj, Standard Chartered has an impressive roster of clients, including many of India's largest industrial houses. Only a handful of its 3,000 staff  - at 24 branches in nine cities - are expatriates. But in India as elsewhere, the end of empire deprived Standard Chartered of some of its sense of purpose. Mr Rodney Galpin, the senior Bank of England official brought in as chairman in 1988, sought to reverse the trend with 'Operation Breakout', an effort to introduce a more aggressive approach to business. The bank sought to expand its Bombay merchant banking business under the direction from London of Mr Ranjit Mathrani, who joined in 1988. He ordered the Bombay bankers to concentrate more on profits. Business in new share issues and corporate advice grew rapidly. Profits from merchant banking trebled in the three years to the end of 1991 to about Rs1bn. But the results came at a price. Eighteen people left the merchant banking operations in 1988-90, including the local chief executive and his deputy. Some employees disliked Mr Mathrani's flying visits from London and what they saw as his high-handedness. Others believed the single-minded pursuit of profit led them to take risks which should be avoided. Evidence of the competitive pressure to sail close to the wind came in a budget plan for 1990, dated October 1989, which said weaknesses of the merchant banking division included regulatory constraints 'which other banks ignore and circumvent'. The document, which Mr Mathrani says was written by executives in India, said: 'Opportunities are considerable provided we are focused, have the desire to circumvent constraints, and (are) prepared to deploy capital selectively.' He says this was 'not a recommendation, but an observation'. The strains created by the drive for profit came into the open when Mr Prakash Yardi, then a middle-level risk-control manager, filed a report in September 1990 alleging breaches of official and internal guidelines. A bank inspection team confirmed some of his findings, and procedures were tightened to stop what the bank calls 'weaknesses in the management of the portfolio'. Some Standard Chartered managers had started to invest clients' funds in unsecured commercial loans, without obtaining internal credit approvals. Taking a credit risk in this way was against the bank's internal guidelines. Paying an investor a return above officially-set deposit rates would infringe central bank regulations unless there were clear instructions that the bank should invest the money on the investor's behalf. Legal advice was obtained that management of corporate cash was within the law, and the business was allowed to continue. Mr Mathrani, who in early 1990 was appointed managing director of Chartered WestLB, a merchant banking joint venture formed by Standard Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank, for a time assisted in a transitional role the London executives to whom control had passed. He says: 'Mr Yardi was right in some areas but not necessarily to the level of seriousness that he implied.' He says the total amount of questionable transactions was Rs500m. 'The idea that we set about the process of a mad rush to profitability by breaking the guidelines is absurd.' Meanwhile, recruits hired to generate business were prospering. Among them was Mr R. Kannan, who was hired from Canfina, the fast-growing investment banking arm of Canara Bank, a small but aggressive Indian bank. Mr Kannan, now 42, was one of the most active bankers in Bombay. He was put in charge of security markets investment, reporting to Mr Nat. His operations generated bumper profits, boosted by the rapid growth in securities dealing and the sharp rise in the stock market. In October 1991, the merchant banking operations passed a routine but rigorous internal audit with flying colours. Everything seemed fine as late as mid-April 1992, when the bank's chief treasurer for the Middle East and South Asia division (MESA) visited Bombay. He proclaimed Mr Arvind Mohan Lal, the chief securities dealer, as 'the best dealer we've got in MESA'. But scarcely two weeks later, disaster struck when Mr Lal called on Mr Nat at his luxury Bombay home late one evening and told him of massive losses in securities trading. Mr Nat could not believe his ears and spent a day checking the books himself before telephoning head office in London. Since that day in early May, bank executives have been trying to piece together what happened. They are still not sure because they cannot trace all the missing money or all the documentation. The outline of Standard Chartered's case is expected to be that the deception started in mid-1991 when a sharp rise in Indian interest rates caused a fall in bond prices. Mr Lal suffered a loss of perhaps Rs100m-200m: not enough to hurt the bank, but enough perhaps to damage his career. Mr Lal tried to conceal the loss with the co-operation of Mr Jaideep Pathak, a settlements manager in his department. They turned to brokers to help them hide losses through fictitious deals. The bank believes the deception then snowballed. Money passed in both directions, but chiefly into brokers' accounts where it was probably used for securities investments. The bank charged the two men with fraud and they were dismissed and arrested. Standard Chartered alleges in a formal complaint to the police that at least 13 people were involved in fraud - the two employees, four brokers, and executives at two Indian banks which have since collapsed. Mr David Gardiner, acting chief executive in succession to Mr Nat, insists that the bank was the victim of a fraud. But he admits: 'There was clearly a failure in internal management controls.'</p>

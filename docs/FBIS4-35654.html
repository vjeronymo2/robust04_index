			<p>BFN     [Text] The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan has issued a  statement about what it described as a retreat in the democratic  march.    The statement said that "the manifestations and aspects of  the retreats in the democratic approach include the dissolution  of the House of Representatives before the expiration of its  constitutional term, the amendment of the election law, arrests,  interference in the work of the trade unions, and the  dissolution of many municipal councils."    The statement said that despite the existence of certain  institutions and forms of democratic life, one can see and feel  what the statement described as retreats and setbacks which "do  not conform to the principle of [Islamic] consultation [shura]."    The statement called for reevaluating these practices and  adopting means and mechanisms to strengthen what the statement  called the democratic shura principle and to prevent all forms  of corruption and oppression so that Jordan might enjoy security  and stability.</p>

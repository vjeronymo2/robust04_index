			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGES MIGHT TESTIFY AT BRODERICK TRIAL  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court judge presiding over Elisabeth Anne (Betty)  Broderick's double murder trial ruled Friday that two other local judges could  not be automatically excluded from testifying at the trial simply because they  were on the bench.  </P> <P> But, Judge Thomas J. Whelan said, the two judges, who issued rulings in  Broderick's bitter divorce with her ex-husband, would not be allowed to testify  about any decisions made in the course of the divorce proceedings.  </P> <P> If Judges William J. Howatt Jr. or Anthony C. Joseph were called to testify,  Whelan said, they could testify only about what they knew independently about  Betty Broderick or her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, or what they  perceived as they watched the couple in their courtrooms.  </P> <P> The ruling concluded the first week of Broderick's double murder trial. There  was no testimony Friday in the case.  </P> <P> Broderick, 42, faces two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last Nov. 5 of  her ex-husband and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick. If convicted, she  could be sentenced to life in prison without parole.  </P> <P> Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice lawyer and a former county  bar president.  </P> <P> During and after the bitter divorce, which began when the couple separated in  1985 and took four years, Betty Broderick accused her husband of using his  legal influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual  income.  </P> <P> According to court records, Howatt conducted the divorce trial. Joseph handled  two contempt citations Daniel Broderick brought against Betty Broderick in  connection with the divorce case.  </P> <P> Both Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, the prosecutor in the murder case, and  defense lawyer Jack Earley have issued subpoenas for the two judges to testify  in Betty Broderick's criminal trial, Whelan said Friday. In response to the  subpoenas, the two judges, through a county lawyer, asked Whelan Friday to rule  they were ineligible to testify.  </P> <P> The issuance of a subpoena -- a notice to appear -- does not mean that a person  will actually testify. Further, it was not clear why the judges have been put  on alert since both said in court filings that they did not know Daniel or  Betty Broderick socially.  </P> <P> Whelan ruled before the murder trial began that the propriety of judicial  rulings in the divorce action would not be discussed in the criminal case.  Deputy County Counsel R. Mark Beesley argued Friday that Howatt or Joseph were  flatly ineligible to testify, since they had nothing to talk about besides  divorce case rulings.  </P> <P> Beesley also said that it would be "dangerous" to "put a judge in a position  where the weight of his office might appear to support one party or another."  </P> <P> Whelan, however, said that he could not automatically assume that either judge  had nothing to offer other than the reasoning behind rulings in the divorce  action, and so he refused to rule them ineligible.  </P> <P> Neither Earley nor Wells disclosed Friday why they had issued subpoenas for the  judges.  </P> <P> Before either judge -- or any other judge that might be called in the case --  took the stand, Whelan said Friday he wanted to be told in advance what they  would talk about.  </P> <P> Testimony in the case is due to resume Monday. Wells expects to finish her case  on Monday and Betty Broderick is due to testify in her own defense.  </P></p>

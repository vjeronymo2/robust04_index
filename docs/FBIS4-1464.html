			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 27 Apr (AFP) -- The human rights  organization, Campaign for Democracy [CD], today ordered the  Nigerian Government to put an end to the serious fuel shortage  affecting the country by 29 April, otherwise it will call on the  people to drive away the ruling "clique." "We want to state  clearly and unequivocally that if the fuel crisis is not  resolved by 29 April, by those who orchestrated it, the CD will  call on the Nigerian people to go into the streets to drive the  Abacha clique away," CD pointed out in a communique signed by  its Secretary General Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, a copy of which  was sent to AFP.    Furthermore, CD, a collective of some 40 student and human  rights organizations, described the government's 26 April  ultimatum to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC]  as "hypocritical," given that "the fraud perpetrated within the  NNPC is orchestrated by government officials," the communique  stressed. The government has given a seven-day ultimatum to the  NNPC to restore fuel supply in the country. Nigeria is  currently facing one of the most serious fuel shortages in many  years and a chaotic situation is prevailing in the country. The  CD communique called on the country to get ready for "a great  confrontation...because the decisive moment has come."</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: JBA coming to market via placing with Pounds 53m valuation JBA International is coming to the market by way of a placing which values the Birmingham-based computer software house at Pounds 52.8m. Some 11.9m ordinary shares are being placed at 160p, or 36.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The rest of the stock is held by the management and institutions, although International Business Machines has retained its holding of just over 5 per cent. About Pounds 12.4m is being raised. After expenses and redemption of preference shares, some Pounds 9.6m will be available to the company to help fund its expansion in mainland Europe. The placing is sponsored by Kleinwort Benson which is also underwriting the offer. At the placing price, the p/e based on last year's earnings is 16.3, slightly lower than the sector average. Mr Alan Vickery, chairman, said the offer price was lower than he had anticipated two months ago, but indicated the state of the market place where stocks had not only to reflect quality but also keen pricing. JBA specialises in writing software for IBM's AS/400 midrange computer family; it claims to be the US computer manufacturer's largest business associate in Europe. Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 4.7m when about one third of its Pounds 74.5m turnover came from the US. Mr Vickery said there had been some interest in the placing from US investors.</p>

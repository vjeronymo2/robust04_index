			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Members of the  right-wing groups Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and  Progress of Haiti (FRAPH) and Capois La Mort protested today in  front of the French Embassy in Port-au-Prince the arrival this  Friday in Haiti of a French ship with some 500 tons of food.    France Pierre, who is responsible for the group Capois La  Mort (name of an independence hero), said that along with the  food destined for some 50,000 students "there will also be  French troops arriving to invade the country."    Emmanuel Constant, leader of FRAPH, said there were plans to  conduct demonstrations to prevent the ship's arrival because, in  his opinion, the expiration dates on the food sent by the French  Government has elapsed and "will kill the children."    The French Embassy in Haiti, however, said the food destined  for public and private school students is in good condition and  that they will come with a certificate to prove the quality of  the products purchased on Guadeloupe. In a communique published  on Wednesday, the French mission added that the food shipment is  part of the traditional assistance that several countries have  been providing to Haiti.    Despite the information given by the French Embassy,  right-wing groups continue to voice their opposition to the  ship's arrival. Constant even accused the French Government on  Monday of being "cynical because it is creating hunger in the  country as a supporter of the economic embargo against Haiti but  is now giving alms to clean its conscience."    According to Constant, the real solution is to lift the  embargo so that Haitians "can satisfy their economic needs."  Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the two boards  of directors of the Senate, said that 13 senators will show up  at the Port-au-Prince wharf on Friday to prevent the French  humanitarian aid from being unloaded. "It is an insult to the  nation, the people, and our intelligence that France, after  imposing on us a 30-month embargo which has killed 20,000  children, is now sending us food," said Sansaricq. He added that  the group of senators has the means to prevent the unloading of  the food. Sansaricq blamed Philippe Seltz, in charge of French  affairs in Haiti, for what may happen to the senators who will  show up at the wharf to protest.    Meanwhile, Serge Gilles, leader of the Nationalistic  Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti (Panpra), said that  even though this type of aid is not the most advisable thing it  must be accepted to save the children. Gilles suggested that  from now on the food someone may wish to donate should be  purchased in Haiti.    The arrival of the ship with the food has been supported by  Reynold Georges, leader of the Alliance for the Liberation of  Haiti (Alah). Georges, who has supported the position of FRAPH  and other right-wing organizations close to the military, said  it is necessary to receive the aid to prevent the deaths of  children.    Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Puerto  Rico [as received], said it is difficult to understand the  groups that do not accept humanitarian aid in the country.  Schrager said that France wants to participate in the aid given  to Haiti and feels that the gesture should be appreciated.</p>

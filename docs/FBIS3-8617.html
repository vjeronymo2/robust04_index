Churkin said he had discussed Sunday in Sarajevo with  Bosnian  Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic the possibility of taking  advantage of the recent positive developments between Moslems  and Croats to apply the experience also between Moslems and  Serbs to get them to disengage their forces and perhaps place  heavy weapons under control, FRANCE PRESSE reports.    Serbs, Moslems and Croats have been waging a bitter war in  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April  1992. With U.S. mediation, Bosnian Moslems and Croats signed an  agreement in Washington earlier this month on forming a  federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina which would later form a  confederation with neighbouring Croatia, also a former Yugoslav  republic.    The possibility of the third warring party joining the  federation remains open.    After signing the Washington agreement, Croat and Moslem  military representatives ratified it Saturday in Split and  signed a document on the formation of a joint army.    According to a UPI report, after a one-hour talk with  Izetbegovic, Churkin pointed out that Sarajevo must remain  undivided.    Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, he said, must put aside their  political differences and start working on restoring  electricity, running water, transportation and other services in  Sarajevo.    According to Churkin, the federation between Bosnian Croats  and Moslems is not necessarily contrary to Bosnian Serb  interests and could be a useful element of the overall  settlement of the Bosnian conflict.    According to FRANCE PRESSE, Churkin is due to meet Bosnian  Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic later in the day.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Laskarina Yerasimou] </F>   [Excerpt] During this evening's debate on the Skopje issue  by political party leaders, which was on the agenda of the  Chamber of Deputies, different views were expressed.    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who during his follow-up  address noted wide acceptance of the government's positions,  accepted [Political Spring Chairman] Andonios Samaras' proposal  to convene the Council of Political Leaders under the  chairmanship of President Konstandinos Karamanlis as soon as  conditions are right. Papandreou said that the resumption of a  dialogue on the Skopje issue under the auspices of the United  Nations depends on whether Skopje abolishes all offensive  demands and decides not to choose a name that contains the word  Macedonia or its derivatives. The prime minister was firm on  the name issue and called on the European countries to stand by  Greece, not for solidarity reasons but to maintain stability in  the area.    The differences raised by New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis  Evert regarding the government's foreign policy were minimal.  In reality, Evert expressed faith in the government's  positions. He warned that a possible dissolution of Skopje  would be dangerous. Evert asked for the establishment of a  permanent council on foreign policy, which would meet weekly.    On the contrary, Political Spring Chairman Samaras strongly  attacked the government and official opposition [New Democracy  is the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies].  Samaras mainly criticized [former Prime Minister] Konstandinos  Mitsotakis and the other political leaders for hypocrisy,  inconsistency, and mithridatism [as heard]. He repeated his  proposal for convening the Council of Political Leaders, which  was accepted by the prime minister, and asked the Chamber of  Deputies to adopt a resolution on the name issue, which will be  send to the parliaments of European countries.    The positions of Aleka Papariga, KKE [Greek Communist Party]  general secretary, were radically different. The KKE general  secretary proposed a dialogue with Skopje without raising the  name issue. She said that, if during the dialogue Greek demands  are not satisfied, the issue should be dealt with then.    Former Prime Minister Mitsotakis also intervened in the  discussion and criticized Samaras, calling him young and weak.  Mitsotakis called on the government to return to a dialogue  under the United Nations and not to bilateral talks. He  described the direct dialogue with Skopje as a mistake and  indirectly but clearly favored a composite name [that would  contain the term Macedonia but not by itself]. [passage omitted]</p>

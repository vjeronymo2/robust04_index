			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: President to see Canadian wheat recommendations US President Bill Clinton today receives the International Trade Commission's recommendations on Canadian wheat imports. Each commissioner can produce his own solutions, and they could vary widely. Three of the six members last week found that Canadian wheat imports had 'materially' injured the US farm support programme. They could recommend import curbs through either tariffs or quotas. The other three commissioners - two Republicans and one Democrat - found only an 'adverse impact' on the US wheat programme and could recommend only temporary measures.</p>

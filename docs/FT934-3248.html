			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Henderson issues shares to pay debt Henderson Investment, the majority-controlled investment arm of Henderson Land, has issued HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m) worth of shares to pay part of the HKDollars 3.3bn debt it raised to buy an interest in Miramar Hotel and Investment earlier in the year. The shares were placed at HKDollars 6.90, a discount of around 3.5 per cent to Tuesday's closing price. A total of 291m was issued, equal to 12.8 per cent of the company's existing capital. The placement - originally set at HKDollars 1.5bn - was immediately supplemented with a further HKDollars 503.7m to satisfy excess demand. Mr William Wong, company secretary, said the cash would be used to reduce loans arising from the company's acquisition of 34.8 per cent in Miramar in July. Henderson emerged as a white knight when the hotel was the subject of a hostile takeover by Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific. Mr Wong said that it was a good time to raise cash, with the local stockmarket hitting record highs. The latest cash call by the Henderson group follows two bond issues by Henderson Land, which owns 72.2 per cent of Henderson Investments. The parent company raised USDollars 460m in Euroconvertibles and USDollars 300m in Eurobonds this year. The former are to convert into shares in the company's China property interests, which it plans to spin off in a separate listing. This week's placement is the third largest on the Hong Kong exchange this year, excluding those linked to new listings. Chinese conglomerate Citic Pacific raised HKDollars 7.17bn in January and Hutchison Whampoa, the hong whose interests span container terminals, supermarkets and telecommunications, made a HKDollars 4.57bn cash call in May.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S YOUR HANDBAG, WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?  </P> <P> Other people take their out-of-town guests to Sea World. My wife takes ours to  Kobo. The place is a shrine to California casual, the style they crave back  East but haven't quite perfected in New York or Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Bag the Zoo. We go to El Corral Pottery. All that terra cotta and Mexican  pottery, displayed neatly in front of the store and on miles of shelves inside.  Find that in Providence.  </P> <P> You see, we're from the Northeast. We get a lot of visitors. A lot of repeat  visitors, to be specific. They come in winter, when they can't stand the cold,  and again in summer for a cheap vacation. And when we've done Disneyland, the  Wild Animal Park and the beach, we've got to take them somewhere. Our house is  too small.  </P> <P> So we've perfected the shopping-as-tourism routine. Near our North County home,  that means the little shops of Carlsbad Village and downtown Carlsbad, where  they naturally gravitate to the beach and border stuff that is hard to come by  in their pinstriped environment.  </P> <P> There are actually three Kobos -- two in Del Mar and one in Carlsbad. One Del  Mar store specializes in pricey T-shirts and sweat shirts that we buy for my  younger brother's birthday every year. The other is full of dressier casual  chic that the Easterners are drawn to but never seem to buy. My wife and her  sister spend hours there each summer trying it all on without buying anything.  I know a woman who calls this "clothes bulimia."  </P> <P> But, when it's time to dump the kids on the husbands and flex some serious  plastic, it's Kobo Carlsbad. They have the T-shirts and sweat shirts, the  beachwear and that all-cotton, trendy, summer casual stuff. One visitor who  wears colorless sacks from the clothing equivalent of the Whole Earth Catalog  always leaves looking like Shari Belafonte.  </P> <P> We're lobbying the owners for a sales commission.  </P> <P> El Corral is our ace in the hole. About a week before the guests arrive, we  wander through there and pick out a few things we like. Then we take the  tourists back. They love it and, more important, they always insist on a small  gift to thank us for holding our tongues when their 3-year-old spilled barbecue  sauce on the new carpet. My parents have bought us most of a set of dishes this  way.  </P> <P> We still need the gravy boat. My folks are due in April.  </P></p>

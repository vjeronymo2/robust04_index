			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 20 (TURAN) -- Gudrat Abdulsalimzade, head  of the Committee for Property told at today's press-conference  that the Committee submitted to the Milli Mejlis new draft of  privatization program.    The new draft provides increase of privatisation share of  each civilian of the republic to 120,000 manats. "It has been  done in connection with the last overestimation of the  privatised property", said Abdulsalimzade.    According to the program 8,768 enterprises and objects are  scheduled to be privatized in 1994. It makes 14.8 percent of  all enterprises and objects of the republic, covers 5 percent of  all funds and 3.1 percent of all employees working in the state  section.    Expenses for privatisations will total 400 million manats in  1994, said the Head of the Committee. According to him, "small"  privatization, i.e. privatization of enterprises totalling no  more than 200 people, is to complete in 1995. Middle and part  of large enterprises will be privatized during 1996-1998.    Answering journalists question concerning the delay in the  adoption of the program, even after it was signed by President,  Abdulsalimzade said that there are people in the highest  legislative body and in the ministries and among the leaders of  enterprises, opposing the privatization program.    The high rank employee of the Committee for Property told  TURAN that there are two approaches to this problem in the  highest circles. "The part of them want to organise wholesale  of state property, the others are opposed [to] privatization at  all, referring to the war. "Privatization will not take place  until they come to common decision", said the employee.    Law for privatization was adopted in Azerbaijan on January  7,  1993. Up to today only 5,000 taximotors [taxicabs] are  privatized in the country.</p>

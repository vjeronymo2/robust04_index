			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Revenue staff cuts will carry a cost Sir, Andrew Jack's article, 'A taxman assesses years of change' (February 8), gives a somewhat misleading impression that Inland Revenue staffing has remained much the same during the 1980s. The facts are quite dif-ferent. In 1979 there were 86,000 Inland Revenue employees. That figure is now down to 68,000, with 18,000 having been shed. And the government and the department have plans - as yet unpublished - significantly to reduce staff numbers further during the 1990s by shifting taxation administration on to taxpayers and the private sector through moving towards a US-style self-assessment system. As the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants warns, this will carry a cost - not simply in money terms, but in a changed relationship between the Revenue and the taxpayer. Your readers should know that it is rumoured that last year, for the first time, the Revenue wrote off more than Pounds 1bn of unpaid taxes. While part of that increased write-off without a doubt is attributable to the recession, much in our view is due to the government's unwillingness to employ the number of tax collectors required. It is a strange world in which, while the government has to borrow ever more and contemplate raising taxes to cope with a soaring public sector borrowing requirement, it fails to recover a fair amount of what is due to it already for the want of a relatively small number of staff.

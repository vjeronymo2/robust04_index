			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWELL ENDS UNUSUAL DAY IN USUAL WAY;  </P> <P> DODGERS: RELIEVER SAYS HIS THREE CONSECUTIVE STRIKEOUTS ARE AN ABERRATION THIS  EARLY IN THE SEASON.  </P> <P> In this most unusual of springs, Dodger relief pitcher Jay Howell had the most  unusual of outings Monday. Especially for a guy appearing in only his fourth  game since last September.  </P> <P> Facing the Atlanta Braves in the eighth inning with a 2-1 Dodger lead, he  struck out Lonnie Smith. And struck out Nick Esasky. And struck out Dale  Murphy.  </P> <P> After the Dodgers had won, 2-1, Howell then offered a most unusual explanation.  </P> <P> "It was a fluke, an aberration," Howell said. "It didn't happen. I didn't do  it. It's way too early for something like that."  </P> <P> It was mentioned that in four innings this spring, Howell has allowed no runs  and one hit with five strikeouts.  </P> <P> "I don't care, I'm not anywhere near where I want to be, not even close,"  Howell said. "Must have been because it was hot, the sun was up, the conditions  were just right. . . . I don't know what happened. But that was not me. I've  only been pitching for two weeks.  </P> <P> "Once the season starts, your average pitcher is not going to be like this.  Believe me."  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who improved their spring record to 4-3, hope he is joking. A week  before opening day, they could use some good news from their bullpen.  </P> <P> Howell's projected partner, Jim Gott, was pulled from his scheduled appearance  in a B game against Houston Monday, and is instead scheduled to pitch today in  Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., against the New York Yankees. Gott, recovering from elbow  surgery, said the Dodgers just wanted to allow his arm an extra day of rest  before he tries three innings. Yet he is becoming less of a certainty to begin  opening day with the team.  </P> <P> Baseball's agreement Monday to field 27-man rosters until April 30 has possibly  given jobs -- however temporary -- to pitchers Don Aase and Jim Neidlinger, and  outfielder John Shelby.  </P> <P> While Aase and Shelby are veterans, it would be Neidlinger's first big league  experience. The right-hander, who was 8-6 with a 4.06 ERA for triple-A  Albuquerque last season, was voted the top pitcher in the Venezuelan League  this winter.  </P> <P> In his second spring start Monday, he threw five shutout innings against a  Houston Astros B team. In his first start last week, he allowed no earned runs  in two shutout innings against the New York Mets.  </P> <P> Aase, who the Dodgers feel can be effective in spot relief situations, picked  up the save in Monday's A game 2-1 win against Atlanta with a scoreless inning.  He has still allowed four runs in six spring innings, but Dodger officials are  counting on his 12 years of big-league experience.  </P> <P> Shelby, battling to forget last year's .183 average, is batting .313 this  spring and will appreciate the extra three weeks to continue his battle with  Jose Gonzalez for the fifth outfielder spot.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson is apparently battling to overcome more than just a surgically  repaired knee. On Monday he spoke of a nerve problem in his lower left leg  caused by scar tissue from his Aug. 29 knee surgery.  </P> <P> Despite two cortisone shots this winter, he said a lower part of the leg is  still numb, although he says it will not affect his hitting or running. "It's  uncomfortable, but I can play with it," he said. "Maybe this off-season they  can get in there and fix it."  </P> <P> Gibson took another 150 swings in the batting cage Monday, but still has not  run the bases because of tenderness in his left knee. He will accompany the  team to Los Angeles Wednesday and continue his rehabilitation there, where he  can be near the Dodger doctors. For the first time Monday, he mentioned the  possibility of playing a couple of games in the minor leagues on a  rehabilitation option before coming off the disabled list, which could be as  soon as late April.  </P> <P> "They might want to shoot me out someplace for a couple of games before I come  back ready to go," Gibson said.  </P> <P> Pitchers Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher, scheduled to pitch in the season's  first and second games respectively, will not leave for Los Angeles Wednesday  night with the team. They will stay behind and pitch in a minor league game  Thursday, and fly out afterward.  </P> <P> The Astros won Monday's B game, 4-3, but the more important Dodger news was the  continued health of Kal Daniels, who played five innings.  </P> <P> Although he went 0 for 3 and has still not been tested on the bases, he ran  down a fly ball in left field.  </P> <P> Besides Howell's heroics in the main game against Atlanta in West Palm Beach,  Mike Morgan strengthened his bid for the fifth starting spot by allowing one  run in four runnings.  </P> <P> Juan Samuel had a single to extend his spring hitting streak to six games after  being shut down in the spring opener.  </P> <P> New Dodger pitcher Terry Wells will make his debut today in Ft. Lauderdale  against the New York Yankees. He will follow John Wetteland and Jim Gott, and  precede Mike Hartley.  </P> <P> Even if Anaheim's Billy Bean is sent to triple-A Albuquerque as expected, fans  will get to see him in this weekend's Freeway Series with the Angels, as he  will join four other non-roster players in accompanying the team west from Vero  Beach Wednesday afternoon -- pitchers Don Aase, Jim Neidlinger and Mike Munoz,  and outfielder Mike Huff.  </P></p>

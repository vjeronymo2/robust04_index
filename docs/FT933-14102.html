			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Haitian protesters support Aristide HAITIAN soldiers fired in the air yesterday to break up a protest by scores of youths urging the immediate resignation of military rulers and the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, AP reports from Port-au-Prince. No arrests or casualties were reported from the confrontation, which took place in the vast Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil, where troops massacred scores of Aristide supporters after a military coup in September 1991. The protesters, most of them teenagers or younger, carried photographs of the deposed president and chanted: 'Aristide, the country is for you]' The protest came as Haitian politicians from across the political spectrum were gathering in New York for UN-brokered talks on setting up a democratic government. The talks, which opened yesterday, will address how to bring peace to Haiti, contain political strife, and get parliament back on track so President Aristide can return to power on October 30. The talks, which are expected to last three or four days, are the second stage in a UN-sponsored process outlined under a July 3 agreement signed by Mr Aristide and military chief General Raoul Cedras.</p>

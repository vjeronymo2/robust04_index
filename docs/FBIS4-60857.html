The head of the municipal organs of Ter-Ter city, Sardar  Gamidov, told TURAN that the Armenian Army has occupied several  villages to the north of the Agdamskiy region and is armed with  military hardware and artillery.    The same source reports that this morning the Armenian  troops  continue to advance further into Azeri territory. Presently  fierce fighting is taking place in the villages of Shotlanly,  Shikhlar and Orta-Gervend. Both parties have incurred losses.  Compared with yesterday the Armenian troops advanced 5-7  kilometres further into Azerbaijani territory.    Fighting near the villages of Gyulistan, Talish and  Tap-Karakoyunllu in the Geranboy region continues. Geranboy  region's leadership told TURAN that Armenian units are  transporting additional military hardware as well as forces to  the strategically important heights they had seized earlier.

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> 5,000 GALLONS OF GAS SPILL AT FUEL FACILITY  </P> <P> Almost 5,000 gallons of gasoline were spilled Monday morning at a Mobil Oil  Corp. fuel facility in Anaheim when a shut-off valve malfunctioned, a company  spokesman said.  </P> <P> By late Monday, 3,000 gallons of gasoline had been recovered, said Jim  Carbonetti, public affairs manager for Mobil.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the 5:35 a.m. incident at the gasoline and diesel-fuel  distribution terminal in the 1400 block of North Jefferson Avenue. The spilled  fuel was contained in an overflow dike, and it posed no threat to the  environment, Anaheim Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> At the time of the accident, gasoline was being transferred from a pipeline to  an above-ground storage tank designed to hold more than 50,000 gallons of fuel.  The pipeline originates at a company facility in Vernon, Carbonetti said. He  added that the spill will not affect Mobil's gasoline supply.  </P> <P> Protective berms around the storage tank prevented the fuel from leaving the  immediate area, Carbonetti added.  </P> <P> Firefighters and hazardous-materials crews from the county and the cities of  Anaheim and Orange spent nearly two hours covering the spill with a protective  foam. A private company was called in to "vacuum" the spill, Carbonetti said.  </P> <P> Police closed off nearby Orangethorpe and Tustin avenues to traffic during the  cleanup operation to reduce the possibility of igniting the fumes, a Fire  Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> Mobil's Anaheim distribution facility receives gasoline from company pipelines.  Its storage tanks are used to load tanker trucks that deliver fuel to service  stations. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

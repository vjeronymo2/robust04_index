			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> EX-TEAMSTER CHIEF GUILTY  </P> <P> Former Teamster leader Rudy Tham was convicted of obstructing justice by trying  to get U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar to influence the judge who was  hearing a criminal case against Tham. Aguilar faces a separate trial on the  same conspiracy charge and four other felony counts.  </P> <P> A jury deadlocked in March in a joint trial of Aguilar, Tham and a third man,  reputed ex-mobster Abe Chapman. Tham was convicted of conspiracy and  obstruction of justice stemming from allegations that he sought to have Aguilar  approach U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel in early 1988 and persuade Weigel  to hold a hearing on Tham's bid to overturn his 1980 embezzlement conviction.  Weigel testified that Aguilar spoke to him one or more times about Tham's case  but never tried to influence him.  </P></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Personal View: German M3 boiler builds up steam As German broad money supply (M3) now seems set to exceed its target for the third year in a row, pressure on the Bundesbank is growing to ignore what Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, calls an 'important intermediate indicator'. The Bundesbank itself has been strengthening the hand of critics of monetary targeting by lowering interest rates sharply despite very strong money supply growth in the past six months. Abandoning M3 now as a signpost for monetary policy would be a grave mistake for at least two reasons. First, there is no convincing evidence so far that the long-run relationship between money supply growth and inflation has ceased to exist. Publicly available independent studies, such as those from the Kiel Institute of World Economics and the OECD, have found some evidence for a short-term disturbance in the demand for money in the wake of German unification. But they have failed to reject the hypothesis that the long-run demand for money has remained stable. Second, excessive money supply growth has reflected the partial monetary financing of government debt, which, if continued, could threaten the purchasing power of the D-Mark. In recent months Bundesbank representatives and other observers have attempted to explain the rampant growth of money supply on the basis of portfolio shifts between money and 'monetary capital' (the longer-term liabilities of the credit institutions, excluded from M3). In reality, however, expansion of credit has been driving money supply growth. At the end of 1993, total bank credit amounted to about DM3,800bn, money (M3) to DM1,900bn, and monetary capital to roughly DM2,100bn. With bank credit rising at an annual rate of 10.3 per cent between the end of 1991 and the end of 1993, monetary capital would have had to grow substantially above this rate to neutralise the effects of credit growth on M3. In fact, monetary capital grew at an annual average rate of only 7.7 per cent, so the annual rise of M3 during this period was 8.7 per cent. If the expansion of bank lending had been used to finance investment in future productive capacity, there would have been little reason to worry. However, between the second half of 1990 and the second half of 1993, real investment in machinery and equipment in united Germany declined by about 4 per cent. This suggests that most of the credit was used for housing construction and consumption. An important source of the demand for bank credit was the public sector. Between the end of 1989 and mid-1993, public debt rose by 52 per cent. By the end of 1994, the rise will be more than 115 per cent. The lion's share of this increase was incurred to finance transfers to east Germany. Since the appetite of German domestic savers for government bonds was not sufficient to absorb the new debt, the government exported part of it by selling bonds abroad, and allowed the monetisation of another part. Reflecting foreign purchases of government bonds, the German public sector's external liabilities rose by 115 per cent between the end of 1989 and mid-1993. Reflecting the monetary financing of government debt, bank credit to the public sector rose by 56 per cent between the end of 1989 and February 1994. As a result of the increase in public bank credit, banks' holdings of government bonds rose by 132 per cent during this period. As a result of these factors, M3 increased by 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993, considerably outstripping the rise in real GDP in united Germany of only 19 per cent. Twice this century, after the first and second world wars, the monetisation of government debt has led to hyperinflation in Germany and subsequent monetary upheavals. It is worth remembering that, in both periods, the government authorities undermined and eventually broke the initial resistance of the Reichsbank against monetary financing of government debt. It would be clearly exaggerated to compare the past financial burdens caused by lost wars with those arising in the wake of German unification. Nonetheless, if the central bank helps to finance the rapid accumulation of public debt, the government-financed operation to shore up east Germany since unification has clear potential to create creeping inflation. In such circumstances, ignoring soaring money supply would be like suppressing the information from a pressure gauge of a boiler in which the steam is building up.

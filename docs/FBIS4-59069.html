			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reprot by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Socialist Party Leadership: </F> Media Talk of Aden Siege Deception; North Accused on Shelling  Civilians, Internationalizing War"]    [Text] London -- Dr. Sa'id Yasin Nu'man, chairman of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Secretariat, has denied what he  termed "rumors" about the northern forces' presence on the  approaches to Aden. He stressed that the offensive of the  forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih "has been curbed  on all axes." He added that this compelled them to haphazardly  shell the villages near their positions, destroying more than 30  houses in al-Dali'. More than 80 families have been wounded in  Kirsh. Both areas are in Lahij Governorate.    He said that haphazard bombardment by heavy artillery of  residential areas has led to many casualties among women and  children, who could not escape. And that the element of  surprise has contributed to increasing the number of casualties.  However, Dr. Nu'man declined to disclose any figures about the  losses at the present stage. He said that "the haphazard  bombardment has made it difficult, so the real results will not  be known until later."    The interview, which was conducted over the telephone  between  London and Aden, was also joined by Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah  (Muhsin), member of the YSP Political Bureau and minister of  housing and rural planning. He said that "militias belonging to  the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] are playing a major role in  leading and launching the battle." He said that this falls  "within the framework of qualifying themselves for assuming  power at a later stage. Because they helped to spark off the  crisis militarily. And they want matters in Yemen to proceed  similarly to the way they did in Afghanistan."    Muhsin specifically accused 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, deputy  prime minister and secretary general of the YRG, "of throwing  his party's weight behind the Yemeni president's military  orientation. This orientation has confirmed what President Salih  said to U.S. Envoy Robert Pelletreau, namely that he is fighting  communism."    Muhsin said that "the YRG has a major role inside the  northern political security organ." He expressed his  astonishment at "the sudden emergence of the fundamentalist  scheme." He added that "it now justifies its presence by  controlling key positions."    He said that, "despite the current accord between the  General  People's Congress [GPC] and the YRG, a conflict is expected to  occur between them at a later stage. Because there are  indications in that direction, especially as the GPC faces have  decreased in number in the southern and eastern governorates,  while new YRG faces have begun to emerge and move actively."    Asked whether there is a foreign role in the Yemeni war, Dr.  Nu'man said that "the use of non-Yemeni forces is clear. It  proves that the battle has assumed other dimensions. So we do  not know why they [the north] are turning down Arab efforts to  secure a cease-fire."    To prove what he is saying, Dr. Nu'man added that "it seems  that most of the foreign elements participating in the battle  entered through the YRG, with the exception of the Iraqi role,  which comes within the coordination between Sanaa and Baghdad."    He said that "southern forces have arrested three non-Yemeni  officers in the al-Dali' area: a Sudanese, a Jordanian, and an  Iraqi. They were participating in leading al-Hamzah Brigade  operations. It has been proved that they were there without  their governments' knowledge." He pointed out that they will be  paraded soon on television screens before Arab and foreign  public opinion.    Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah said that northern civilian planes  have been moved to the airport of the Eritrean capital, Asmara.  He added that a military delegation headed by Brigadier General  al-Bashiri, former (northern) chief of staff, visited Eritrea  and returned three days ago. However, he declined to comment on  reports that northern warplanes are using Eritrean airports. He  said: "We know nothing about that or about reports of a secret  visit to Eritrea by the Yemeni president."    On the ongoing fighting between al-'Amaliqah forces and  southern units in Abyan Governorate, Dr. Nu'man said that "the  fighting is continuing. The al-'Amaliqah Brigade went there  immediately after unity, to the areas agreed upon. When the  crisis began, they deployed in the towns and villages near their  positions. But they have now retreated from the positions they  occupied."    He said that "al-'Amaliqah forces' retreat is attributable  to  the refusal of a large number of them to fight in accordance  with the instructions issued to them by the GPC. As a result,  the morale of the other troops has collapsed. But Sanaa  reinforced them with additional troops." He said that they "do  not know why they are fighting. The unity is there and the  document is there, but they [the leaders] are refusing to  implement them."    Dr. Nu'man rejected the reports and statements issued from  Sanaa. He said: "They control communications and are  misleading Arab and foreign media by saying that Aden is under  siege -- which is remote from the truth, because people are  living their life completely normally."</p>

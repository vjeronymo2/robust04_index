			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Halifax forecasts rise in house prices late in year HOUSE PRICES should be on a gently rising trend by the end of the year, even though they are likely to remain weak over the next few months, Halifax Building Society said yesterday in its monthly housing market figures. Halifax said house prices were almost static last month, rising only 0.1 per cent. The slight rise compared with falls of 1.2 per cent in January and 1.1 per cent in February. However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, house prices were still weak last month, falling 0.8 per cent. Prices were generally stronger outside southern England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland were higher than at the same time last year. House prices generally fell 5 per cent in the 12 months to March 1992. Prices in Greater London and the south-east were respectively 8.4 per cent and 7.7 per cent lower than in March last year.</p>

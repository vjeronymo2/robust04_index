			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO DEFRAUDING 3 OF SAVINGS;  </P> <P> CRIME: A FORMER INSURANCE BROKER STOLE MORE THAN $600,000 FROM THREE ELDERLY  PEOPLE. HE FACES UP TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON.  </P> <P> A former insurance broker from Mission Viejo who befriended three elderly  investors, including a 102-year-old man, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday  of defrauding them of more than $600,000 in a sophisticated investment scheme,  federal prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Jacques (Jack) Doigny, 43, who also owned a failed wholesale soccer supply  business in Anaheim, faces up to 30 years in federal prison for masterminding a  plot to bilk the victims of their life savings, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Walsh  said.  </P> <P> Atwater, Calif., residents Peter Ross, 102, and wife Esther, 83, gave Doigny  $230,000 in early 1988 to invest in annuities and relied on him to perform a  variety of secretarial chores, including filing their income tax returns for  them, the victims said.  </P> <P> Roy Aldridge, 75, of Hollywood, a close friend of the Rosses, invested $394,000  with Doigny, Walsh said.  </P> <P> Doigny used the money to support an extravagant lifestyle that included several  European vacations, a motor home and a new house in Mission Viejo, and also to  bolster the Soccer Warehouse, his financially ailing company, Walsh said.  </P> <P> Doigny, a native of Italy who has lived all over Europe and Israel, is being  held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He is to  be sentenced by U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman on Sept. 17.  </P> <P> Doigny had been a fugitive for four months when he was arrested in Tucson in  April. He was using several aliases and had a forged passport at the time,  Walsh said.  </P> <P> In an agreement with prosecutors, Doigny pleaded guilty to three counts of  securities fraud and three counts of mail fraud in exchange for the dropping of  14 other counts, Walsh said.  </P> <P> "I'm so sorry for him," Esther Ross said in a telephone interview. "He really  had a good heart. It was just one of those things that happens to people who  have a love for money. He wanted everything, and he wanted to be the best. That  led to his downfall."  </P> <P> Fortunately, the Rosses recovered all but a few thousand dollars of their  money, Peter Ross said.  </P> <P> Aldridge was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> According to Walsh and the Rosses, here is how the scheme worked:  </P> <P> In early 1988, as an agent with Mutual of Omaha in Los Angeles, Doigny  persuaded the three to invest in annuities. The money from the three was  actually invested a money-market account under their names but with Doigny's  home address. Using Mutual of Omaha letterhead and a software program stolen  from the company, Doigny sent the three fake computerized statements purporting  to show that they were earning interest on their nonexistent annuities.  </P> <P> "They certainly looked like the real thing," Peter Ross said, "but he fooled us  and Roy too."  </P> <P> Doigny, by forging his clients' signatures, repeatedly dipped into the money  market account, using it like a checking account to write checks to himself and  for his troubled business, Walsh said.  </P> <P> "These people he defrauded were particularly vulnerable people," Walsh said.  "Their primary vulnerability was their age. They trusted him."  </P> <P> Soon after he began the scheme, Doigny was fired from Mutual of Omaha on  unrelated allegations involving fraud and theft, Walsh said. Doigny was never  charged with any crime as a result of those allegations.  </P> <P> Doigny did not tell his clients that he had been terminated, continuing his  relationship with them.  </P> <P> Peter Ross later became suspicious, however. He discovered that he and his wife  were victims of fraud when he asked the insurance company about the state of  his annuities. Mutual of Omaha later repaid most of the Rosses' money because  their account had been bonded, Peter Ross said.  </P> <P> After they learned of Doigny's scheme, Mutual of Omaha officials asked Postal  Service inspectors and the U.S. attorney's office to investigate, Walsh said.  </P> <P> Investigators contacted Doigny in November, 1989, but he ignored their order to  appear before them and went to Europe for a month. He returned in December,  took his motor home and fled to Arizona. He was later arrested there and  extradited to California, Walsh said.  </P></p>

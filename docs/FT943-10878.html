			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Moscow backs rebel power bid in Chechnya The opposition forces in the Russian republic of Chechnya in the northern Caucasus say they have taken over power and have received support in principle from the Russian government. However, eyewitness reports from Grozny, the Chechen capital, indicate that General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, appears to be still in control. The declaration of assumption of power by the 'provisional Council of Chechnya' which controls the area of Nadterechnaya - apparently outside Gen Dudayev's reach - was given immediate support by Mr Emil Pain, a member of the Russian presidential council with responsibility for ethnic affairs. Mr Pain said that the Provisional Council's session which declared its control had included more than 2000 delegates from most parts of Chechnya, thus indicating wide support. Mr Pain called on all citizens of Chechnya, including the government, to 'make its choice' - leaving no doubt that the Russian government has made its choice in favour of the Provisional Council. However, the republic's press agency, Chechenpress, said that Mr Umar Avturkhanov, the council's leader, had been accused of treason and that warrants had been issued for his arrest. An office worker in the presidential office told Reuters news agency that everything was calm in the capital. The council's statement said that Gen Dudayev had 'usurped authority' and that all his decrees were invalid. The council would 'immediately begin preparations for general democratic elections, form a government of national revival and ensure the continuity of power pending the election of a legislative body'. The council said the economy 'was on the brink of disaster' and the Dudayev government had turned the republic 'into the main base for organised crime in the North Caucasus'. The aims of the government of national revival include the signing of a treaty with Russia in order to normalise relations. For more than two years, Russia and Chechnya have traded insults; the former, after an early abortive effort to intervene militarily, has been content to play a waiting game until internal opposition was strong enough to challenge President Dudayev. Mr Avturkhanov appeared on Russian television last weekend to assure Russians that Chechnya would be brought back within the constitutional fold but that it should be done without an armed invasion by Russian troops. The Russian press has also stepped up the campaign against Chechnya, with some papers expected today to publish photographs of three headless corpses alleged to be victims of Gen Dudayev's purges. According to a photographer for the daily Sevodnya who saw the corpses, the three were handed over to their 'blood enemies' by the Chechen KGB for private execution.</p>

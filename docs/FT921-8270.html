			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Malaysian power sell-off to raise almost MDollars 3.1bn MALAYSIA begins its largest privatisation and flotation sale in two weeks with Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned power generating and distribution monopoly. The Malaysian government's offer of 23 per cent, or 685m shares, of the group, will draw nearly MDollars 3.1bn (USDollars 1.2bn) from the equity market compared with a total of MDollars 3.8bn raised in rights issues last year. At MDollars 4.50 a share Tenaga is valued at MDollars 13.5bn, compared with a total of about MDollars 150bn in market capitalisation for the existing 300 or so companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. Underwriting the Tenaga sale are 48 of the country's 50 stockbrokers and all its dozen merchant banks. Group pre-tax profit for the year to August is forecast to increase by 54 per cent to MDollars 1.1bn from MDollars 692m last year, and a further 17 per cent to MDollars 1.2bn in 1993-94. Tenaga's shares are priced at about 11 times earnings. In the distribution of the Tenaga sale, Malaysian and foreign investors will be allo- cated 44 per cent of shares available; employees will share about 3 per cent. Government-approved Bumiputra or Malay investors and their investment institutions will be allotted the balance of 360m shares. Tenaga has an installed generating capacity of 5,000 MW and supplies to 3m consumers, half of them in the industrial sector and 30 per cent in commerce. It has assets of MDollars 14.8bn, and plans to invest MDollars 37.7bn for the rest of the decade. Tenaga's sell-off follows the 30 per cent offer for Proton, the state-owned car maker, last month. The sale of 25 per cent of Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly, raised MDollars 2.5bn in 1990, but its share value has since doubled to MDollars 10. Guthrie, a Singapore construction group, is offering Dollars 1.68 a share for a controlling stake in its associate L &amp; M Group Investments. Guthrie intends to place out shares in excess of 51 per cent through Smith New Court Securities, the brokerage, and Nomura Singapore, the merchant bank.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Observer: One man, one vote Nice to see Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of ProShare, add another chairmanship to his growing portfolio. Not only is Macdonald Martin Distilleries the official supplier of malt whisky to the Observer column, but it is one of the dwindling band of companies where some shareholders have limited voting rights. As Maddrell is chairman of a pressure group which champions the cause of little shareholders, Observer will be most upset if he doesn't get rid of this iniquity in time for next year's agm. If he doesn't, Observer may have to take its custom elsewhere.</p>

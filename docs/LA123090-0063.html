			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN IN ROME;  </P> <P> ON NEW YEAR'S EVE IN THE ETERNAL CITY, STAY IN THE BIG PIAZZAS, KEEP TO THE  CURB AND WATCH OUT FOR FALLING OBJECTS  </P> <P> Strolling around the city at the end of the day can be one of the more  enlightening (and potentially dangerous) activities available to the traveler  here. After a hefty spaghetti dinner, a long camminata calms the digestion,  soothes the mind and reveals hitherto unappreciated aspects of the city: For  example, dusk over the river, when the evening sky discloses sun-tinted  mashed-potato clouds above the Tiber bridges.  </P> <P> But looking upward as you walk along Rome's old streets can be a matter of  physical -- as well as spiritual -- survival, particularly on New Year's Eve,  when the local populace tends to hurl cherry bombs and other explosive devices  from their windows and terraces.  </P> <P> Not long ago, objects more substantial than firecrackers were landing in the  streets as householders enthusiastically dumped furniture, crockery and  appliances that had outlived their domestic usefulness.  </P> <P> Historians suggest that Romans first got into the habit of throwing things in a  downward direction when the barbarians tried scaling the imperial walls in  pre-Christian times. The Encyclopedia Britannica advises that New Year's Eve  became a universal festival of destruction and renewal as many as 5,000 years  ago.  </P> <P> No one is sure when Romans first began throwing old furniture, broken  appliances and plumbing out of their dwellings -- mimicking the destruction of  an old, ordered universe by way of making room for the new. It is known that  the ritual tends to lose steam in times of social crisis.  </P> <P> During the last, harsh, deprived days of Fascism, for example, when  replacements and parts for consumer-rejectables such as hair driers and radios  were hard to come by, New Year's Eve was comparatively peaceful.  </P> <P> Romans resumed throwing things out of their windows again at the end of World  War II, and the annual defenestration was still going strong when my wife and I  moved to the Eternal City 22 years ago. My diary of the time records our first  New Year's Eve in the city, in 1968:  </P> <P> "Dec. 31, 10 p.m. -- Collapsed in the living room after the ritual cenone (big  supper), featuring lenticchia (lentils) and cotechino (boiled sausage). A  bottle of Spumante cooling in the frigorifero for the midnight toast.  Neighborhood quiet. Traffic noise vaguely increasing on nearby Via Candia and  Viale Guilio Cesare.  </P> <P> "11 p.m. -- First firecracker cracks. Neighbor's dog, Snoopy, barks in reply.  (Note: When I arrived in Italy, "Peanuts" was the favorite comic strip and most  dogs answered to the name of Snoopy.) Significant increase in firecracker and  traffic noise, some car horns and occasional shouts of strolling revelers.  </P> <P> "11:45 (15 minutes to go) -- From outside in the street below comes the  unmistakable 'clank' of dinnerware encountering pavement. I rouse myself to see  what's going on. Terraces of apartment buildings across street full of Romans  bundled in sweaters and overcoats against the cold. A female citizen lifts a  busted wooden clothes drier over her railing and, with a cautious look down to  see if anyone is walking underneath, lets it go onto empty sidewalk.  </P> <P> "On the terrace adjacent to ours -- as architecture, the typical terrace in  this neighborhood is no big deal, a sort of walled-in box hanging over the  street -- a middle-aged lady and her husband are locked in a struggle for  possession of an old table-top radio. 'Giuseppe, let me have the radio!'  Giuseppe's wife cries. 'You play it all day long! I'm sick of the noise! You  make the house sound like a barbershop. Give it to me! It doesn't work anymore  anyhow!' Taking violent possession of radio, neighbor's wife hurls it into the  street -- cord, antenna and all. Radio free-falls five flights, bounces off our  car.  </P> <P> "When I tell the agitated woman in my halting Italian that the radio has hit my  car, she waves aside my objection. 'You are an American!' she exclaims. 'You  get a car any time you want!' Before I can work out an answer to that -- it's a  complex concept, to be sure, and not an entirely amicable one -- the husband  assures me that his mechanic brother will fix my car come nuova (like new) for  practically nothing. I am disinclined to follow his suggestion that we go  downstairs to examine the damage. I say it's too risky to go into the street  just yet.  </P> <P> "The magic moment arrives -- I open the Spumante and toast the immediate  future. 'Buon Anno!' From one corner of this densely inhabited capital to  another, Rome erupts in full celebration -- skyrockets, Roman candles, cherry  bombs, Chinese firecrackers; car horns blare on the adjacent traffic-infested  thoroughfares; church bells fill the air with clanging cheer; plates, cups, old  brooms and flower pots rain steadily into the street. In the adjacent  apartment, where he has been left alone, presumably to guard the fort, Snoopy  contributes his share of agitated noise to the proceedings."  </P> <P> My last diary entry for Dec. 31, 1968, is an admonishment to myself to find a  garage for the car before this important date comes around again next year.  </P> <P> Outside the apartment house the next morning, I confront an alarming array of  forlornly uninteresting objects. My neighbor's radio has left a modest crimp in  the engine cover of my Citroen DS -- mild damage compared to the casual mayhem  inflicted on other cars parked along the curb. A chipped bathroom sink has  landed with deep emphasis on the roof of an Alfa Giulietta. The back seat of a  Fiat sports convertible on the corner is partially occupied by a dusty old  bidet that has plunged neatly through the canvas roof.  </P> <P> New Year's Eve in Rome hasn't been quite the same in recent years, I'm glad to  say. Through the pervasive auspices of the economic miracle, the motor car has  become an emblematic component of Italian self-esteem ( along with  prohibitively high damage-insurance rates).  </P> <P> In their own self-interest, modern Romans stopped throwing big things into the  car-filled streets 15 years ago or more. But habits die hard, and in many  neighborhoods, junk that is not actually thrown out the window or off the  terrace is moved down by hand during the last night of the year and left on the  sidewalks for the bag people to pick over before the street cleaners arrive in  the early days of the new year.  </P> <P> Superannuated dinnerware still gets the traditional heave-ho in some of the  more exuberantly traditional neighborhoods such as Trastevere (possibly the  oldest inhabited area of Rome, south of the Vatican) and Testaccio (a  working-class neighborhood on the Tiber on Rome's south). Launching  firecrackers into the void and parading slowly around town tooting the car horn  are, today, the principle ways residents (who do not bother to make timely  reservations in the restaurants and nightclubs) celebrate the demise of the old  year.  </P> <P> One hundred and fifty-three emergency calls were made to the police here during  the night of Dec. 31, 1989, to report fires and personal injuries. And  firecracker-related trauma has been on the increase since 1987, possibly  reflecting a rise in enthusiasm for celebrating of this kind. During last New  Year's Eve's festivities, a record 63 Romans checked into local emergency wards  with charred hands and blinded eyes, up 40% over 1988. If the stats are any  indication of what's in store, Jan. 1, 1991, may see new records set in numbers  of burning terraces and torched automobiles.  </P> <P> Suffice it to say, walking home from dinner in Rome is not advisable on New  Year's Eve, although an old umbrella might be useful, opened against the  falling fireworks if not against the flowerpots. And if you do try to make it  back to the hotel, it's just possible you'll find the protection you need lying  in the street.  </P> <P> Waking up on New Year's Day (given that he could get to sleep in the first  place), the inquisitive traveler in Rome should hot-foot it over to the Cavour  Bridge about 11 a.m. for the First Dive (Il Primo Tuffo) of the year, which,  for years, featured a local citizen, the late Spartaco Bandini, the dean of a  handful of extrovert males who inaugurate the New Year with an uninhibited jump  into the Tiber River.  </P> <P> Bandini was 78 years old when he last shed his bathrobe and stepped up on the  wall of Il Ponte Cavour to make what proved to be his farewell 18-meter swan  dive into the cold, cappuccino-colored effluvia below (considered by  environmentalists to be among the more polluted waters in Europe).  </P> <P> But the tradition lives on as other hardy types carry on his work. Usually, a  fire department launch is on duty at the bridge, manned by lifeguards in  underwater diving equipment, in case a diver gets into trouble.  </P> <P> Last Jan. 1, Bandini's semi-nude, three-second flight through the sunny, midday  Roman air seemed to evoke all the old objects that had been surrendered to  gravity at year's end in the past, and which, no doubt, will be surrendered  again in the years to come.  </P></p>

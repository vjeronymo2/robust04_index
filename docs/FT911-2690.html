			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Polish zloty shows the way  -The monetary changes in eastern Europe CONVERTIBILITY of the eastern European currencies into foreign currencies goes with economic reforms like a horse with a carriage: it serves little useful purpose in isolation, but is essential if domestic reform is to be pulled along. As Brigitte Granville remarks in her study of currency convertibility in Poland between 1957 and 1990, 'the real objective is not convertibility per se, but the creation of a free environment for economic agents.' Aiming at currency convertibility while maintaining the centrally planned economy would be folly. If Leviathan is to set prices and quantities, it cannot permit its citizens to undermine its plans via the arbitrage opportunities of foreign commerce. Once the decision to move towards a market economy has been taken, however, a degree of currency convertibility is among the first steps, for three reasons: combined with liberalisation of commercial policy, it forces the introduction of world prices into the domestic economy and curbs domestic monopoly power; it can help control inflation; it encourages import of foreign capital, technology and management. Of these, the first, which demands convertibility on current account, is fundamental. For a small economy, (although, as the Soviet Union has discovered, for larger economies too), a rational pattern of prices is the prices at which it can trade. Only when those prices are the domestic prices will a profit-seeking economy specialise efficiently. With international competition imported via current account convertibility, domestic monopoly power will also be limited. Currency convertibility, again on current account, can also be an element in economic stabilisation. A fixed exchange rate determines the domestic nominal prices of internationally competitive goods at the levels set abroad. In this way, the exchange rate becomes the 'anchor' for stabilisation. Without alternative anchors, particularly domestic monetary policy, the exchange rate is an effective, if sometimes brutal, instrument of disinflation. But domestic monetary policy must follow the lead of the exchange rate, which normally requires the elimination of the budget deficit as well. Finally, convertibility, on capital as well as current account, is an element in facilitating the required import of foreign capital and technology. Not only must foreigners be able to repatriate interest, profits and dividends, all of which relate to the current account of the balance of payments, but they also need to purchase domestic assets with foreign exchange and, in the end, convert it back again when wishing to repatriate their capital. Currency convertibility can be taken further, to embrace all capital and current transactions for all holders of the currency. One argument for such freedom is that otherwise there will be leakage and fraud. Some would argue that freedom on capital account can facilitate external stabilisation as well. But for economies as distorted and as inflation-prone as those of eastern Europe, this must be regarded as doubtful. Indeed, in those circumstances convertibility on capital account can be destabilising. Fortunately, the experience of the advanced industrial countries suggests that freedom on capital account is not a necessary condition for market-led economic development. That is the view of the government of Poland, the country which has taken reform furthest (apart from the unique case of eastern Germany). It has not embraced complete currency convertibility. But it has gone far in that direction. On January 1 1990, the zloty, then subject to hyper-inflation, was devalued by 31.6 per cent and fixed at 9,500 zlotys per US dollar, where it has remained ever since. Domestic enterprises may buy and sell foreign exchange freely at that rate for current purposes, other than for payment of interest, profits and dividends. Residents can buy foreign exchange for current purposes (but not to purchase assets abroad) through officially sanctioned foreign exchange counters. The rate on the latter is, in theory, allowed to float freely; in practice, the authorities have managed to keep the two rates close together since January 1990. Companies with foreign participation are also to enjoy convertibility on both current and capital account, in order to repatriate 100 per cent of profits after tax, salaries of foreign employees and sums due from the sale or liquidation of the company or of equity holdings in the company. How far do these policies go towards meeting the three objectives of currency convertibility? As well as eliminating virtually all quantitative restrictions on trade and reducing tariffs to an average level of only 4 per cent, Poland has gone a long way towards the successful import of global relative prices. That success has been bolstered by the achievement of a trade surplus in convertible currencies in 1990. Poland has also made progress towards price stabilisation, largely because the fixed exchange rate has been backed by a tight budget and monetary policy. Nevertheless, inflation continues to be well above rates in Poland's main trading partners, partly because the exchange rate was initially over-devalued and partly because of the absence of a competitive response from state enterprises. From a monthly peak of 80 per cent in January 1990, inflation was brought down to a trough of 1.8 per cent in August, but has since been running at an annual rate of around 100 per cent. This sets a large question mark against the success of stabilisation. Finally, in spite of the incentives given for the import of private capital and know-how, there has so far been little foreign investment. At the end of 1990, some Dollars 160m had been invested in the joint ventures then in operation. Currency convertibility is an essential component of the free convertibility of money into goods, services and assets that is a market economy. The case of Poland suggests that changes can be introduced rapidly if the government is determined to move on all fronts. But it also suggests that sustaining those changes will be difficult, just as reaping the full benefits will take time. * Convertibility and Exchange Rates in Poland: 1957-1990, RIIA Discussion Papers 33 (Royal Institute of International Affairs, London, 1990).</p>

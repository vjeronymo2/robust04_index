			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PACKER SEEKS BOND'S TV NETWORK  </P> <P> Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer, today launched a $39.8-million bid to  buy back the television network he sold to entrepreneur Alan Bond two years ago  for $750 million.  </P> <P> But Bond's flagship, Bond Corp., said it would not sell out of the Channel Nine  network, despite mounting pressure over its $6.2 billion in debt.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we're just not interested," Bond Corp. director Peter Lucas told  Reuters.  </P> <P> A rejection by Bond Corp., which controls 51.6% of stock in Channel Nine owner  Bond Media, could foil Packer's bid because it is conditional on acceptance by  holders of 90% of Bond Media shares.  </P> <P> But Packer said Bond Media faced collapse unless it obtained more money.  </P> <P> Among the Bond group's debts is $150 million owed to Packer, to be repaid by  March, 1990.  </P></p>

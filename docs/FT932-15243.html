			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox halts trade in raw sugar as volumes plunge TRADING IN London's raw sugar contract was suspended yesterday by the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox). But the search is on for a replacement contract, which it is thought could be launched this summer. Mr Robin Woodhead. Fox chief executive, said a report by Landell Mills Commodities Studies had suggested that no single factor had been behind the sharp decline in the exchange's raw sugar volumes. But moves from sterling to dollars, from floor to screen and back again, and the addition of Cuba as a country of deliverable origin had all done harm. Business switched to the relatively young and very liquid New York market. Last month London raw sugar volume fell to 1,399 lots compared with 4,384 lots in March last year. In January 1991, when trading was switched to screens in a bid to boost volumes, the contract traded 120,176 lots. Sugar trading, which began in London in the late 1880s, will go on in the screen-based white contract - probably the world's most successful screen-traded commodity. But Mr Woodhead reported a groundswell of support from trade and brokerage houses for the exchange to create a new raws contract. Response from the trade in London and New York yesterday was mixed. 'It is essentially the main sugar trade in London who dropped the contract in the first place. Why do they now say they want it continued?' asked one seasoned observer. Changing any contract was always a sure way to lose volume, he said, pointing out that London's virtually untouched cocoa contract was Fox's most successful market. However, another London trader said reports of the death of raw sugar trading in London were greatly exaggerated. He suggested that a new contract  -possibly screen based - would attract arbitrage business with New York. Several US traders pointed out that their companies had stopped using London when it decided to accept Cuban sugar for delivery, as dealing in Cuban sugar was against US law. They would welcome a revived London market, especially in the light of recent renewed interest in sugar.</p>

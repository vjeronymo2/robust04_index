			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Italian Socialist party splits Italy's 100-year-old Socialist party has split, with the majority opting to form a new movement with a different name and symbol. The majority 58 per cent has backed the leadership of former trades unionist Mr Ottaviano Del Turco, who took over the running of the party in May. He has now been given full powers to call a special meeting on January 15 to establish the new movement. The minority is made up of faithful supporters of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former party leader who was obliged to step down in February as a result of his involvement in the corruption scandals. The split followed a stormy meeting held throughout Thursday in a Rome hotel, during which Mr Craxi and Mr Del Turco traded insults. It marks the end of more than three decades in which the Socialists have played a central role in Italian politics; and it is the first time since 1976 that Mr Craxi, once the party's all-powerful boss, has found himself in a minority. The break-up of the party has been expected for sometime in the wake of the discredit caused by the corruption scandals and the divisions arising from the arrogant behaviour of Mr Craxi. Although the party won almost 14 per cent of the vote in the 1992 general elections, at the latest local elections it mustered less than 2 per cent. The Del Turco-led majority is now likely to seek an alliance on the left. To underline the impact of the corruption scandals on the party's demise, Mr Craxi yesterday appeared in court to give evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, who acted as an intermediary for the Socialists in the business world. He admitted that the entire system had been riddled with corruption and that his and other parties had taken illicit contributions. However, he refused to give any details of his personal involvement or to admit he had taken any money for his own use, as he has been accused of doing. Mr Craxi went on to accuse all his political colleagues of hyprocrisy, pretending to ignore the existence of illicit financing of political parties. He also made specific accusations against Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the leader of the Senate and former head of the Republican party, and Mr Georgio Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a former communist, alleging they were fully aware of illicit funding of their parties. He also accused companies such as Fiat and Olivetti of being deeply involved in the system of corruption.</p>

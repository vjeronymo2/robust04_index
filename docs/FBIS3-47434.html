At the same time, it will push ahead with the export of  construction, installation and operational technologies for  nuclear furnaces to Southeast Asia and the development of new  materials for aircraft.    These short- and long-term plans were contained in a  Chongwadae [presidential offices] report submitted yesterday by  Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung on his ministry's  New Year policy programs.    According to Kim, South Korea has now emerged as the world's  10th largest user of nuclear power and it is high time that it  engages in effective "nuclear diplomacy."    Along this line, he said, the "Nuclear Control Center" will  be set up under the umbrella of the Korea Atomic Energy Research  Institute (KAERI) to initiate preparatory measures for  South-North nuclear inspections.    "In an effort to become more responsible in the application  of nuclear technology, the center will concentrate on  formulating new and improved policies," Kim explained.    In the area of research and development, the minister told  President Kim Yong-sam that a total of 322.4 billion won will be  invested into the development of new materials and precision  chemical technologies.    "One of the main areas of emphasis in research is to  localize  technologies which are critical to the enhancement of the  international competitiveness of the domestic agricultural  industry," he elaborated.    The development of new integrated materials for aircraft  will  be tested and put into the commercial market by next year after  necessary testing procedures are completed.    Along with the tangible research, the minister said 221  billion won will be invested until the year 2010 for the  introduction of technologies which are on par with those in the  world's seven most advanced countries.    Under the long-term plan, a total of 10 technologies related  to bioengineering will be developed so as to help the nation  gain a competitive edge in the international market, Kim  observed.    He said his ministry will also focus on encouraging foreign  research organizations to open up operations here so as to  ignite joint research projects with local companies.    On the other hand, 40 of the nation's most qualified  research  personnel will be dispatched abroad to pick up advanced  technologies for domestic application.    At the university level, the ministry will seek to increase  the investment in basic sciences from the 7.6 percent last year  to 12 percent in 1998, introducing such new areas of research as  space technology.    Addressing issues surfacing as a result of the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kim said the financing of research  projects will be overhauled with particular emphasis on  intellectual property rights.    The minister said a greater portion of the budget will be  funnelled into the development of environment-related  technologies such as alternative coolants to chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) to halt further environmental pollution and assist in  efforts to reverse the damage.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F> Annika Savill in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] Yasir 'Arafat returned from talks in Cairo this  weekend threatening to withdraw from the peace process  altogether if the Israelis did not stop what he called their  manoeuvring".    The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation said  he  was prepared to recommend a deadline for a Palestinian  withdrawal from negotiations after Wednesday, the target date  for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. "After 13 April,  I have the right to call upon the Palestinian leadership to make  the decision," he said at a meeting with journalists organised  by the UN in his Tunis home.    Asked if he was really ready to pull out of the best  prospect  yet for his own return to Palestine, he said: "We are not  puppets. They have to respect what had been agreed upon and  signed." He said he had sent messages to the co-sponsors of the  peace process -- the United States and Russia -- as well as to  other permanent members of the UN Security Council and the  European Union asking them to "start all their efforts for an  accurate and honest implementation" of the Declaration of  Principles signed at the White House last September.    Mr. 'Arafat appeared tired but confident in immaculate green  battle fatigues as he received journalists at the, for him,  exceptionally early hour of 8.30pm on Friday. He did not rage;  in a display of relaxed showmanship, he insisted that he was not  optimistic. "I am sorry to say, no. It's very difficult to say  it, but I arrive with my back against the wall now," he  declared, raising his hand against the backdrop of a huge  photograph of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock hanging behind his  desk.    "I offered all the flexibility and effort but the other side  is not responding. I left my team in Cairo under orders to  continue but I do not know if the Israelis will come back to  finalise or to manoeuvre," he said of the talks that reopen  today.    Mr 'Arafat was particularly indignant about two things: The  first, that a week after an agreement signed with Shimon Peres,  Israel's Foreign Minister on 31 March, whereby Israel had agreed  to be "guided by the target dates" in the declaration, Israel  had issued a statement saying merely that the negotiations of  Gaza and Jericho may be finalised by the end of this month.  "May," said Mr 'Arafat. "We were preparing to send an advanced  group of policemen two days ago but the Israelis refused,  putting many excuses.    "But not only that," he added, getting to the bigger bone of  contention. "They suspended our talks in Cairo because there  was a commemoration of the Holocaust in Israel. Why did they  not suspend the negotiation in the economic committee which is  still continuing in Paris? What does this mean?    "I have the right to ask, is there one Israeli government or  two? One government which accepts continuing in Paris, and  another which accepts suspending in Cairo?    "They are not listening to me. They are not listening to  anybody. This is the peace of the braves. We have to be  courageous."    Time and again, Mr 'Arafat recalled the words of the Israeli  Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, last December -- "There are no  sacred dates" -- implicitly contrasting that with the Israeli  decision to leave the talks to attend a Holocaust memorial at  home. "It is unbelievable, believe me, unbelievable." Even  more so because Mr Peres had "accepted to return back the next  day and to send a delegation, and then he gave me these  statements of the delay.    "If it was the first manoeuvring, OK, we could let it pass.  But there has been manoeuvring, manoeuvring, manoeuvring,  manoeuvring. For how long? Not to forget: I was in Washington  in September and nothing has been achieved on the ground. They  are destroying the peace process by this manoeuvring. The whole  credibility of the peace process has been lost."    Asked about calls within his ranks for a less autocratic  style of leadership, Mr 'Arafat declared: "The PLO is one of  the democratic oases in the Middle East." He could not resist a  jibe at criticisms from salon Palestinians such as Edward Said  the academic based in New York: "More democracy, yes, when we  are in our own state. Not when we live in the United States,  away from our people's daily needs."    Mr 'Arafat cautioned that further delays would lead to an  escalation of extremist acts on both sides. On fundamentalism  in general, he issued a covert warning to the US to learn from  past mistakes: "This is part of what happened in Afghanistan.  Do not forget how these fanatic groups were trained, armed and  financed -- and here we are. It is not me who has done it. It  is the American administration. They gave all kinds of support.  Remember? So here we are-the shadow of what was done in  Afghanistan."    This was also an oblique reference to allegations that the  United States' ally, Saudi Arabia, is financing fundamentalist  groups across the Middle East. "If there will be no peace,  there will be complete confusion in this area, in thc most  strategic area in the world -- confusion and Balkanisation."  Asked when he thought he might be able to take up the reins in  Jericho, he said: "I can't give you an answer because, as you  see, I was supposed to be there since last December. But the  Israelis have delayed the peace accord."    Both the West and extremists such as Hamas should take heed,  however: "I am the leader of the Palestinian people, not of  Fatah or Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], or the Popular  Front, or the Arab Front, or any other organisation. I am the  leader of the Palestinian people according to three elections in  the Palestine National Council."    At their Cairo meeting in December, Mr Rabin had promised to  return within 10 days and had still not done so. Mr 'Arafat  recalled the words of Egypt's President, Husni Mubarak: "Next  time I will close one of these villas till the white smoke  appears." Mr 'Afarat concluded: "It seems the Israelis do not  want the white smoke to appear."    "It is my duty now to call upon the co-sponsors, the  international community and the Security Council... to bear  their responsibility and not to leave me alone."</p>

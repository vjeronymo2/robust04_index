			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Former S Korean defence officials to be indicted FOUR former South Korean defence officials are expected to be indicted for allegedly accepting bribes and kickbacks from companies for military contracts, in response to an official investigation. The senior officials, all of whom served under the previous administration of President Roh Tae-woo, include two former defence ministers, Mr Lee Jong-koo and Mr Lee Sang-hoon, a former air force chief of staff, General Han Chu-sok, and a former chief of naval operations, Admiral Kim Chul-woo. The expected arrests are the result of a two-month investigation by the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) into military procurement. The BAI estimated that at least Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.6m) was wasted in corruption and mismanagement of the nation's multibillion dollar Yulgok defence modernisation programme. The investigation has implicated some of the country's leading industrial groups, including Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo. Daewoo is alleged by South Korea's top public prosecutors' office to have given Won170m (Pounds 142,380) in bribes in connection with the procurement of the Lockheed P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. Daewoo Heavy Industries produces wings for the US patrol aircraft. Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry is suspected of bribing officials for a contract to supply components for the domestic K-1 tank, while Samsung Aerospace Industries allegedly paid money to win an order for the supply of helicopter parts. The companies deny they bribed officials for military contracts although Hyundai has reportedly conceded that it gave a 'monetary present' to one of the officials. BAI last week accused 53 senior officers and bureaucrats of being involved in corruption associated with the Yulgok programme. The Ministry of Defence immediately sacked the commanding general of the First Army corps and an assistant defence minister. There are suggestions that the government may only prosecute a few senior defence officials because the new administration of President Kim Young-sam is concerned about further alienating the military. The US and North Korea appeared to have hit problems last night in talks aimed at defusing a potentially dangerous disagreement over Pyongyang's nuclear policy, Reuter reports from Geneva. Only hours after optimistic statements from the two sides and a US announcement that the discussions would be extended to Monday, both emerged from a five-hour session saying they had not yet agreed to meet again although they hoped to. Assistant secretary of state Robert Gallucci, leader of the US side, told reporters at the North Korean mission to the UN European headquarters the delegates had 'long, intensive discussions' and would now consult their governments. The talks concern US demands that North Korea open up two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear reactor north of the capital to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), something the North Koreans have so far refused to do. Washington, worried that North Korea may develop a nuclear weapon and spark a crisis in Asia, has threatened to seek UN sanctions against Pyongyang unless it agrees to IAEA inspections.</p>

GM also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 - ``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the application was published on July 29, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 38660). This notice grants the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Figure 10 of FMVSS No. 108, referenced at S5.1.1.27(a)(3), lists the photometric requirements for center high-mounted stop lamps (CHMSLs). GM produced two different vehicle populations which do not meet the photometric requirements of Figure 10. The first population of vehicles, approximately 23,695 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced between the start of the 1994 model year and November 19, 1993, had their CHMSLs ``framed'' in the rear window by a 27 mm high opening in the blackout paint at the lower edge of the rear window. A vertical shift in the installed position of the rear window, compounded by build variation, caused the painted frame around the CHMSL on each of these vehicles to obscure the photometric performance at the 5D line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second population of vehicles, approximately 65,403 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced between November 19, 1993, and May 4, 1994, has a narrower painted ``frame'' around the CHMSL in the rear window. The painted frame width was reduced due to an engineering change by 5 mm to a width of 22 mm. The shift in installed position and build variation noted above obscured the 5D line on some of these vehicles. Other vehicles within this second population had the 10U line obscured as a result of build variation. In no case were both the 5D and 10U lines obscured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance as discussed below. GM also submitted diagrams and tables in support which are available for review in the NHTSA docket. According to GM:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> GM performed a dimensional analysis on a 51-vehicle sample to determine where the paint opening on the rear glass was in relation to the CHMSL. (Note that no CHMSL could be obscured at both the top and bottom by the paint line.) For those vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the bottom of the lamp, the analysis, which approximates a normal distribution, indicated that 1.5 percent of the entire population of vehicles, or approximately 1,336 vehicles, could experience sufficient obscuration to render the vehicles out of compliance with FMVSS 108, with a 4.6 mm worst case infringement at the bottom of the CHMSL. However, a photometric test conducted on a CHMSL with a 4.6 mm mask at the bottom of the lamp established that for the test points that fell on and below horizontal, i.e., for the points on the H and 5D lines, photometric output exceeded FMVSS 108 requirements by an average of 75 percent. *&blank;*&blank;* Even on the 5D line, all five test points were within 20 percent of FMVSS 108, with the worst performance at 5D&hyph;5R, where the tested value was 23.0 candela, or 82 percent of the 25.0 candela requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for those vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the top of the lamp, the sample suggests that 15 percent of the second population described above, or 9,810 vehicles, could be obscured to the point that they would fail to comply with FMVSS 108, with a worst case infringement at the top of the CHMSL of 4.5 mm. However, a photometric test on a CHMSL with a 4.5 mm mask at the top of the lamp demonstrated that while test values on the 10U line fall below required levels, the lamp provides approximately 75 percent more light output above horizontal (at the 5U and 10U lines combined) than required by FMVSS 108. (Photometric output of the obscured lamp as a whole approximated 33 percent more than FMVSS 108 requirements.) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the extent of the noncompliance for those vehicles obscured at the top of the CHMSL, GM plotted data from a series of photometric tests of 10U-V (the worst performing test point), with varying degrees of obscuration, against performance to the FMVSS 108 requirement. The result approximates a linear function of obscuration versus photometric output, and suggests that subject CHMSLs obscured less than 3.07 mm will fall within 20 percent of the values listed in FMVSS 108 *&blank;*&blank;*. Applying the distribution determined from GM's 51-vehicle sample to that, approximately 76 percent, or 7,456 of the 9,810 vehicles described above, will provide photometric output within 20 percent of the FMVSS 108 requirements at 10U.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As acknowledged in NHTSA's notices granting other similar Petitions for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance, a change in luminous intensity of approximately 25 percent is required before the human eye can detect a difference between two lamps. (See, e.g., Notice granting Petition by Subaru of America (56 Fed. Reg. 59971); and Notice granting Petition by Hella, Inc. (55 Fed. Reg. 37601, at 37602).) Given this, the 7,456 vehicles obscured less than 3.07 mm at the top of the CHMSL, as well as the 1,336 vehicles obscured at the bottom of the lamp, do not compromise motor vehicle safety since the noncompliance is imperceptible to the naked eye and the overall light at the outer zones (H &amp; 5D; 5U &amp; 10U) exceeds the FMVSS requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the degradation in light output for the 2,354 remaining vehicles would likely be discernible in a subjective side-by-side comparison with a conforming lamp, visible light is still emitted at the 10U line. Moreover, GM's photometric analysis indicates that even with a worst case obscuration of the 10U line, the 16 candela required light output at 10U-V is supplied at 8U-V. Given that and the location of the CHMSL on the subject vehicles, these CHMSLs perform their intended function in a manner virtually indistinguishable from CHMSLs on other vehicles that fully comply with FMVSS 108, as demonstrated below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A Blow to the Stomach?: Heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield is offering fellow  pugilists James Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson easy money; easy, that is, if  they can sit through a horror movie. "Blood Salvage," which Holyfield helped  finance and in which he makes an appearance, tells the story of a south Georgia  auto mechanic. The grease monkey also moonlights as a dealer in transplanted  organs, which he extracts from, shall we say, unwilling donors. In newspaper  ads for the movie, which opened Friday in Atlanta, Holyfield says: "This movie  is so scary that I'm willing to donate $10,000 to the charity of their choice  if Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas have the guts to sit through an entire  screening on their own! Are you man enough?" GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

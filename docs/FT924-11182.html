			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble up 18% in first quarter PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday unveiled an 18 per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, reflecting higher sales in overseas markets and favourable exchange rates. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company said its results also benefited from lower costs and improved margins in the US. P&amp;G's recent decision to pull out of its unprofitable 100 per cent fruit juice business muddied earnings comparisons. Excluding a Dollars 200m after-tax reserve for the juice business, P&amp;G turned in net earnings of Dollars 631m, or 89 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 536m, or 76 cents, a year earlier. Including the provision, the company earned Dollars 431m, or 60 cents, in the latest quarter. Sales advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 7.88bn from Dollars 7.21bn. Wall Street reacted to the results by marking Procter &amp; Gamble's shares Dollars 2 1/2 higher at Dollars 53 1/2.</p>

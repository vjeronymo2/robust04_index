			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): Ashanti adds to its board Following the successful Dollars 1.7bn flotation of Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana on the London and Accra stock exchanges in April, Sam Jonah, chief executive, has created two new executive positions intended to make his board look more like the international mining companies it intends to compete with, writes Kenneth Gooding. Colin Smith has been appointed chief operating officer and Mark Keatley becomes chief financial officer. Smith, 57, was formerly a director of James Askew Associates, a mining consultancy. He also held a number of other senior appointments during a 30-year career in the mining industry, inter alia with North Broken Hill, CRA, and Hamersley Iron, all Australian groups. He is already well-known to Ashanti as he carried out an independent engineer's audit for the World Bank's International Finance Corporation when the IFC was poised to back Ashanti's plan to lift its output to more than 1m troy ounces of gold a year. Keatley, 36, is also no stranger to Ashanti; he was responsible over some years for negotiating loan agreements with Ashanti on behalf of the IFC where he has been divisional manager, treasury and financial policy.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: Adventures of 'Boz' - Anthony Curtis enjoys Dickens' early sketches of London life DICKENS' JOURNALISM: VOL. 1 edited by Michael Slater Dent Pounds 30, 580 pages This volume of Dickens' journalism, number one of a proposed four, starts in the 1830s when Dickens was employed as a reporter in the press gallery at Westminster Palace (before the present Houses of Parliament were built). His job was to record the debates for newspaper publication the following day. Grinding work but Dickens, who was barely 20 and who had taught himself shorthand, was highly skilled at it. He soon became known as the king of the gallery and he regarded the discipline he acquired during his time there as the foundation-stone of his literary career. When Dickens was not at Parliament he made space to do some imaginative writing of his own, sketches of London life that were published in The Morning Chronicle and its recently started evening counterpart. He signed these literary pieces with the pseudonym 'Boz' - borrowed from The Vicar of Wakefield, Goldsmith being one of his models. Dickens was therefore two kinds of journalist simultaneously. A fully paid-up member of the NUJ, as it were, writing anonymous reports in the Chronicle, and under his pseudonymous Boz hat, a journalist in the sense that Simenon and Damon Runyon were journalists. All penetrated the mean streets of a capital city, sometimes the affluent streets too, making authentic popular fiction out of the lives and crimes of the people they observed there. This tradition of 'faction' still flourishes. To read this book is to inhabit the aggressive, noisy, teeming world of a rapidly expanding London just before the young Queen Victoria succeeded to the throne. To boost the family budget, the boy Dickens was cooped up for long hours in a warehouse near Hungerford Stairs sticking labels on bottles of blacking. Once he escaped he roamed far and wide throughout the capital and its surrounding villages, his sharp eyes ever on the alert. All he assimilated he then re-cycled in a series of Sketches, Characters and Tales composed by Boz. Michael Slater, the professor of Victorian literature at Birkbeck College, the editor of the edition, describes their complicated publishing history in both periodical and book form. They were an instant success from the moment they were published, a fact that has tended to be obscured by the even more phenomenal success of Pickwick in 1836. Even after that Dickens continued to write Boz pieces to meet the continuing demand for them. Although a narrative element is never far below the surface, it is at descriptive writing that Boz excels. His portraits of the convivial places of public entertainment, Astley's Amphitheatre, Vauxhall Gardens, Greenwich Fair contrast with his depictions of the backstreets around Seven Dials, the sewing women earning a pittance there, and the wretched customers of the pawnbrokers. Boz caught them all with an ironic phrase or two; he applauded resourcefulness in adversity while he ruthlessly punctured the pomposity of the well-off. Even at the height of his later fame Dickens never wholly gave up journalism. He edited periodicals - Bentley's Miscellany and Master Humphrey's Clock - which he filled largely with his own contributions. He helped to found a new newspaper, The Daily Chronicle, and for a while edited it. The subsequent volumes will contain his work of this later period. Meanwhile the edition has got off to an excellent start.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T up 15% to Dollars 3.2bn on strong growth in sales AT&amp;T, the US communications and computer group, yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in underlying net income for 1992, helped by strong fourth-quarter growth in product sales and financial services. The company reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 17.5bn, compared with net income of Dollars 635m, or 48 cents, in the same period of last year, on revenues of Dollars 16.46bn. However, earnings in the 1991 quarter were cut by 14 cents a share because of a reduction in the book value of an Italian investment, against a 3 cents-a-share cut in the latest quarter. The figures were in line with Wall Street expectations, which were pitched around earnings of 78 cents a share. For 1992, net income totalled Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86 a share, on revenues of Dollars 64.9bn. That compared with 1991 earnings of Dollars 522m, or 40 cents. However, excluding charges and one-time gains, the underlying 1991 figures were Dollars 3.24bn, or Dollars 2.51, on revenues of Dollars 63.09bn. AT&amp;T's largest business, telecommunications services, saw long-distance call volumes rise some 5 per cent in the quarter, but revenues were down to Dollars 9.72bn from Dollars 9.79bn. The company said this was due mainly to business customers choosing lower-priced, higher-capacity dedicated lines, as well as adjustments to revenue estimates for previous periods. On Wednesday, MCI, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the US, reported a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter traffic and a 13 per cent revenue increase. AT&amp;T's products businesses saw a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter revenues, from Dollars 4.4bn to Dollars 5.3bn, led by network switching equipment. Consumer products reported record quarterly sales. NCR, the computer company AT&amp;T acquired in 1991, produced operating income of Dollars 94m, up from Dollars 76m, on sales of Dollars 2.15bn, up from Dollars 2bn. The latest figures included results from Teradata, which AT&amp;T acquired early in 1992. The company said NCR continued to report strong orders in the US and Latin America, but other parts of the world remained weak. Financial services revenues rose from Dollars 420m a year ago to Dollars 577m, thanks to the group's Universal credit card and AT&amp;T Capital Corp.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Everything seems to indicate that the internal  conflict Mexico has been experiencing over the past week was the  main reason behind explosions that occurred in Guatemala City on  Sunday evening.    At approximately 2145, two leaflet bombs [bombas  panfleteras]  exploded a few seconds apart near Espana Plaza. One of the  bombs went off at a Mexican restaurant located accross the  street from the plaza and the other at the Mexican Consulate in  this capital. In the incident at the consulate, the bomb was  hurled at the building from 13th Street in Zone 9, between  Reforma Avenue and 7th Avenue. Both explosions caused great  damage, particularly the bomb at the restaurant, as you can see  in this film clip made by the Municipal Firemen's Public  Relations Department.    The link between these incidents and the internal conflict  in  Mexico became evident with the dissemination of leaflets with  phrases such as: Let us back the Zapatists! Viva Bishop Samuel  Ruiz! Long live the Indian movement! Viva Andres Giron!    The other side of the sheet read: Viva Menchu! The sheet  also bore the letterhead of the Peasant Unity Committee [Comite  de Unidad Campesina -- CUP].    A few days ago, a similar attack was carried out in downtown  Mazatenango. Nevertheless, popular organizations are  categorically rejecting any link between Guatemalan popular  groups and the Mexican guerrillas. They say claims of such  links are resulting from a clumsy manipulation of the Mexican  problem.</p>

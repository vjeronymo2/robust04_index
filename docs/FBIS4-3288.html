			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng today delivered a speech at the parliament of  Uzbekistan on Sino-Uzbekistan relations, China's basic policy  towards Central Asia and its position on establishing a new  world order.    During his speech, Li also gave a brief account of China's  reform and open policy, as well as its efforts to build up a  socialist market economy.    "The fundamental purpose of China's economic development is  to improve the quality of the life of the entire Chinese people  both materially and morally," he said.    China remains a developing country and its people are not  better-off yet, he said. "It takes arduous efforts of many  generations for my country to reach the economic level of an  average developed country."    China's development requires a lasting stable domestic  environment and an international environment of long-term peace  and stability as well, especially a good environment in its  neighborhood, he said.    "For a bright future of China and the world at large, China  will make every effort to manage its own affairs well,  unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace,  develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries,  especially the neighboring nations on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, and make a new contribution  to peace, stability and development in Asia and the world as a  whole," he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans D. Sauer: "Foreign Sales </F> Support Duales System: 50 Percent of Packaging From "Yellow Ton"  is Exported"]    [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N,  Duesseldorf--The company Duales System Deutschland GmbH  announced "Sales Quotas Exceeded." But closer inspection reveals  that this result was only possible because of massive exports of  used packaging. Experts are looking for clearer conditions for  sales in Germany from the planned amendment to the packaging  ordinance.    On 1 March the environmental secretaries of the Laender were  given extensive reading materials. Duales System Deutschland  (DSD) presented them for the first time with the bulk flow  documentation for the collection, sorting and sale of  merchandise packaging. In the eyes of DSD managing director  Wolfram Brueck the balance is favorable. Of 7.6 million tons of  used packaging, 4.6 million tons were collected in 1993 through  Duales System and an even 3.9 million tons were sold after  sifting and sorting. According to Brueck, of 970,000 tons of  plastic packages 29 percent were sold, while the packaging  regulations require only 9 percent.    Indeed, the high rate of sales for plastics really is a  surprise. After all, in the previous year problems with plastic  waste had brought Duales System to the verge of disaster. The  Society for Plastics Recycling founded by DSD and by the waste  management sector found a bungled situation: 80,000 tons of  plastic wastes were piling up in the sorting plants with no  processing capabilities to deal with them. The mountain grew at  the rate of 8000 tons a week.    The solution of the riddle: overseas sales. According to DKR  chief executive Michael Scriba, a total of 225,000 tons of  plastic wastes were exported in 1993. About 20,000 tons went to  European Union countries, but the main sales region is Eastern  Europe. Increasingly the Germans are collecting for China: the  IPK for Paper and Plastic Usage GmbH in Sinzheim near  Baden-Baden exported around 72,000 tons to the People's Republic  in 1993. According to agent Dirk Gantzkow, the shipments went  predominantly to a large factory in the city of Nanchang in the  Chinese province of Jiangzi. In 1994 it is hoped to double the  amount exported. "Without export possiblities for plastics  Duales System would no longer exist," as Scriba freely admits.  China is a particularly attractive location for utilization of  plastics for two reasons. Wages are so low that intensive  secondary sorting is possible. In addition, the consumers are  very undemanding about the appearance and condition of plastic  products, so that the sales possibilities for objects in daily  use made of used plastics are practically unlimited.    German and foreign businesses which want to process the DSD  plastics have to be approved by the TUeV (Technical Control  Board). According to Andreas Burkhardt of the TUeV for the  Rhineland, in Cologne, 106 German firms and 107 foreign ones had  been through an initial testing process by the beginning of the  year and had obtained a certificate as DSD plastic users. Today  the DKR has access to TUeV-tested and contractually guaranteed  processing capacities of 510,000 in Germany and abroad. Although  for the moment no bottlenecks are in sight, plastics remain the  problem child for Duales System.    Plastic packaging is a highly developed special product  adapted to the protection and transport of a wide assortment of  materials, but not to a trouble-free reuse. That is why the  recycling costs for plastic are far higher than for other  packaging materials. The leader of the Information Center for  Packaging, Packaging Optimization and Environment at the Berlin  Technical Training College, Dieter Berndt, estimates that only  15 to 20 percent of plastic packaging can be reworked into new  products at a tolerable cost. In this regard, he says that the  high utilization quotas cited by DSD are a questionable success.  "An expensive field experiment is being performed on the  population of the Federal Republic," Berndt criticizes. Berndt's  colleague Marcus Thiele points out a "construction error" in  Duales System itself. The sorting companies in the disposal  economy are not paid according to the results of their work but  according to the quantity put in. Thus there is no incentive to  separate as efficiently as possible.    Theo Becker, the managing director of BFI Disposal  Technology  from the business group RWE Disposal, complains that this is why  the sorters also have no interest in improving the technical  standards of their plants. At present the contents of the Yellow  Sacks are divided roughly by hand at the 600 sorting stations of  the disposal industry into the following categories: foil,  bottles, cups and blisters, and foam packaging. The sizable  residue, 46 percent, is made up of mixed plastics. BFI, in  contrast, offers a technology which can distinguish individual  products such as a certain mouthwash bottle using a multisensor  system which sorts according to form, color, metal content, and  infrared reflection.    Given the current quality of sorted plastic wastes, buyers  can only be found if a socalled utilization contribution is  paid. These additional payments are so attractive that even in  Germany a lively competition for DSD plastics has evolved. "If  all the plans which utilization businesses in the DKR have  proposed so far were to be put into practice, we would need two  million tons of plastic packaging," Scriba notes.    There is no shortage of ideas about how to manufacture  substitute products for wood and concrete in horticulture and  road construction from the problematic mixed plastics. But the  market possibilities are often recklessly overestimated in the  process. "The Federal Republic would have to be transformed into  a plastic Legoland, covered with a thick layer of plastic paving  stones--it would probably float," says Scriba mockingly.    A process used by the Finnish company Suomon Muovikartonki  Oy  for working unsorted and uncleaned plastics into road surfacing  appears very attractive. The shredded waste products are broken  down by heating and used in the manufacture of asphalt, with  bitumen as a binding agent. Five to seven tons of plastic waste  could be incorporated in a road surface measuring 1 km by 8 m.  using this method. The company claims that the plastic-modified  asphalt is more durable than normal road surfaces. The Krefeld  concrete block manufacturer Hans Klausmann likewise hopes to  combine sand and plastics at temperatures from 150 to 200 C  to producing road construction materials. But Heinrich Els, an  expert at the German Asphalt Association, finds the concept of  using road construction as a method of disposal troubling. He  says that asphalt is characterized by the fact that old road  surfaces can be completely reused after appropriate treatment.  "This should not be jeopardized by new additives."    Which way the Green Dot will roll in the future will be  determined in no small measure by political decisions. The  Federal Environmental Agency is working on an amendment to the  packaging ordinance which defines the possibilities for  utilization of used packaging more precisely, but experts  estimate that the amendment will not be passed before the  elections. "The position is rather confused," Kai Fabig,  spokesperson of the environmental agency in Hamburg, agrees. But  packaging technology expert sees positive aspects to the  situation: "Everything is fluid at the moment."</p>

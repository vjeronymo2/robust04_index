Enticements for such opening could include active economic  exchanges where Seoul offered various short- and long-term loans  to North Korea and other forms of financial assistance, the  Foreign Ministry's Institute of Foreign Affairs and National  Security (IFANS) said in a report on the North.    "There is a chance that the United States and North Korea  will solve the North Korean nuclear issue with a guarantee (to  Pyongyang) on normalization of relations and respect for the  existing system," said the IFANS report.    "Seoul should acknowledge this possibility and seek North  Korea's opening at another level," said the report.    Improving relations with the United States is North Korea's  top priority this year, and Pyongyang will also step up  diplomatic exchanges with regional superpowers Japan, China and  Russia, the report predicted.    North Korea, simultaneously, is expected to expand what has  so far been limited economic openness, it said.    "The basic line of South Korea's North Korea policy should  be  strengthening the standing of reform-driven forces within North  Korea so that they can attempt bold changes, as well as offering  cooperation and assistance to effect North Korea's opening,"  IFANS said.</p>

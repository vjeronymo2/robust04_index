			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Credit agencies' future brightens EXPORT credit agencies last year saw an improvement in their vulnerability to dangers of non-payment, for the first time since the 1983 Latin American debt crisis, according to the Berne Union, the umbrella body representing the world's leading agencies. Mr Ragnar Sohlman, president of the Berne Union and chief executive of Exportkreditnamnden, Sweden's export credit agency, said at the end of the group's annual meeting that the overhang from the 1980s' debt crisis 'remains a substantial problem', with most members showing significant cumulative deficits. But closer linkage now being imposed between insurance premiums paid by exporters and the amount of export business covered 'gives some hope for further improvement', he added. Debt restructuring arrangements being made under the auspices of the Paris Club of creditor countries implied 'there will not be full or early recovery of many of the claims paid during the 1980s'. So far, 58 countries have reached such arrangements. New business underwritten in 1992 by the union's 43 members amounted to Dollars 311bn (Pounds 206bn), 6 per cent lower than 1991. Claims fell, while premium income and debt recoveries increased. The most dramatic change was in insurance cover for investments overseas, a type of cover offered by just 21 of the union's members. This leapt by 48 per cent from Dollars 4.8bn in 1991 to Dollars 7.1bn last year. Much of the new cover was given for investments in the newly emerging markets of east and central Europe.</p>

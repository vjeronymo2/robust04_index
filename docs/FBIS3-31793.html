			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- President of the Srpska  republic Radovan Karadzic today called on UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to use his influence on the Security Council and  prevent the adoption of a resolution on UN administration of  Sarajevo before details on that issue have been agreed upon at  the Geneva peace negotiations on Bosnia. At the same time the  Bosnian Serb leader appealed to Butrus-Ghali to speed up these  negotiations.    In a letter to Butrus-Ghali, a copy of which was forwarded  to  TANJUG today, Karadzic recalls that the Bosnian Muslims refused  to talk about the UN administration of Sarajevo at the last  round of Geneva talks. Therefore, according to him, the Serb  side believes that the UN Security Council resolution ought not  to precede negotiations on that issue in Geneva. "Otherwise, a  solution which would be unacceptable for any one side could  create obstacles for the peace process."    Karadzic said that "the peace process in Sarajevo is  proceeding according to plan," and that the Sarajevo model, if  successfully applied in the future, could serve as a useful  model for other parts of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "The cease-fire which is currently in force has been the  most  successful of all those agreed in Sarajevo," the president of  the Srpska republic concluded.</p>

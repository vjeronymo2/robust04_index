			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity Japanese placing raises Pounds 86m Fidelity Japanese Values has raised Pounds 86m during its placing stage. The public offer, which closes on March 8, could bring the fund up to a total Pounds 150m. Ordinary shares in the investment trust are being offered at 100p, with one warrant attached for every five shares. Dealings are expected to start on March 15. Strong institutional demand for the fund illustrates the findings of recent surveys, which have shown that UK fund managers are increasing their weightings in Japan. Fidelity argues that smaller and medium-sized companies, in which the fund will specialise, will be best placed to benefit from any recovery, as well as from deregulation and other changes in the economy. Fidelity is better known for its unit trusts, this being only its second UK investment trust. The group already has a Japanese Smaller Companies unit trust, run by the same fund management team which will manage Japanese Values. It is the seventh best performing Japanese unit trust over five years, but ranks 35 out of 74 in the sector over three years.</p>

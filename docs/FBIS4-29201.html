			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The current regular Diet  session will wind up without an extension on June 29 and a new  electoral map for the House of Representatives will be discussed  in the next session, a key political leader predicted Wednesday  [15 June].    "I do not think there will be an extension of the Diet  term,"  Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of New Party Sakigake [Shinto  Sakigake], told a luncheon at the Japan National Press Club.    Although the government must have wanted to submit an  as-yet-unformulated bill that redraws the electoral map for the  lower house and to extend the 150-day Diet session, it runs  short of time, he said.    "Therefore, there will be no need to extend the Diet term  for  debate on key issues," said Takemura, the chief cabinet  secretary in the last government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    The 15-member Sakigake left the governing coalition in April  due to differences over major policies and political approach  with other coalition partners.    The administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Japan's  first minority government since 1955, once appeared ready to  extend the current Diet session and act upon the redistricting  legislation in a move to avoid a possible no-confidence motion  from the opposition camp.    The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party has made it  clear it plans to bring down the Hata government in a  no-confidence vote. The Social Democratic Party, the  second-largest opposition force, has also threatened to submit  the motion by itself.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Don't Preach to Pakistan About Refugees' </F> Rights"]    [Text] Amnesty International has come out with a report  strongly critical of Paksitan's closing of its borders with  Afghanistan. The human rights organisation feels that there is  no justification for preventing the right of people to seek  asylum, particularly at such a crucial time when renewed fierce  fighting in Kabul has forced thousands to flee to safer areas.  A BBC report on Saturday [22 Jan] painted Pakistan as a villain  in this regard, and even played up differences between the  federal and NWFP governments over the issue. At the same time  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has  also urged Islamabad to reopen the border, saying that the  policy would create difficulties for refugees. Thousands have  been turned back from the Torkhum border, the main entry into  Pakistan for those fleeing the Kabul fighting.    The first impulse is to lash back at these self-righteous  international organisations for preaching to us about refugees  rights, when the western countries of their origin have  themselves repeatedly ignored all such concepts of international  responsibility. Pakistan has a much better track record of  hospitality and sensitivity than any other sovereign nation,  having hosted over three million Afghans for over a decade since  the Afghan war started. Yet when the Russians were thrown out,  and the Cold War came to an end, suddenly everyone lost interest  in Afghanistan, at one time the front line in the war against  communism. More than a million refugees are still in Pakistan,  but international agencies and countries had washed their hands  of the problem much before this latest round of internecine  fighting. Despite repeated requests for aid and rehabilitation  funds, Pakistan has found itself increasingly taking on the  entire burden of a refugee problem for which the blame lies as  much on the West as it does on the former Soviet Union.    Then, there is no reason to criticise Pakistan as if it is  committing some sort of heinous human rights violation. The  stand of the Pakistani government is quite valid that since  fighting has been thus far limited to only Kabul and a few  adjoining areas, there is no reason why refugees cannot be  shifted to other places in Afghanistan which are otherwise  untouched by the fighting. Leaving aside the fact that Afghans  have begun to find it more convenient to jump across the border  than find shelter in other parts of their country, Pakistan has  not left the refugees to fend for themselves -- camps are being  set up inside Afghan territory, and Pakistan has committed a  substantial amount of relief aid to the effort to feed and  shelter the needy refugees. As for the right of asylum, there  is no law that says that a country should open the floodgates in  a situation such as the one Pakistan is faced with. The US  wasn't willing to take on even a few thousand Haitian refugees,  preferring to keep them at sea or forcibly returning them to  their homeland, where chances of persecution were much higher  than in Afghanistan. That was criminal. A decade of experience  with the Afghan refugees has shown us at least this much that  when dealing with the kinds of numbers as in this scenario, it  is hard to distinguish the persecuted from the needy. Perhaps  UNHCR could set up an appropriate office in the refugee camps in  Afghan territory, and then see how many other countries are  willing to accept asylum seekers from among the applicants they  get. With the kinds of laws adopted by many European countries  regarding asylum, it seems unlikely that there will be many.    Instead of preaching to Pakistan about standards of  responsibility that we know better about, AI should concentrate  on urging the West to atone for its crimes against Afghanistan.  When Amnesty accuses the warring parties in Afghanistan of  using civilians as human shields, does it forget that this is  only a natural continuation of the policies of the superpowers  in their quest for global supremacy? Their violations of human  rights are much more significant, yet all Amnesty has to say to  them is: Please try to send some aid, if it's not too much of a  bother. It's for a good cause.    We cannot afford to take on more refuges simply on the  promises of the international agencies, because unless they can  get other countries to pay their share. Pakistan will once  again be left to absorb the costs into its own barely solvent  economy. If the US can get the Gulf states to foot the bill for  such a massively destructive war effort in Iraq, surely there is  something available to use constructively for the Afghans.  Amnesty International would do well to consider human rights on  a macro rather than a micro level. Don't expect Third World  countries to go out of their way if you can't even convince your  own people to start taking responsibility for their doings and  misdoings.    Notwithstanding this aspect of the Afghan Refugees' cases,  our Interior Ministry needs to handle the issue with  sensitivity. Eye witness accounts of arrival at Torkhum suggest  insensitive handling of the policy laid down by Islamabad.  There are reports of crying women and children at the barrier  and of families who fled in such a hurry that they brought their  dead. Some women have given birth waiting on the other side.  The border guards enforced the rule that only those recommended  by the Afghan authorities would be admitted. The Afghans with  all their humanity burnt out by a long exposure to brutalities,  recommended only those who could pay for their recommendation.  The going rate was Rs 500/- [as published] per person.  Pakistan rupee is hard currency in Afghanistan. It is  difficult to suggest any foolproof method of verifying genuine  hardship cases. But a few honest officers posted as assessors  may help.</p>

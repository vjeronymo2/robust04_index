			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FELONY CONVICTION DISCOUNTED;  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER'S RACE TRACK BID CLEARED  </P> <P> A former felony conviction would not block New York Yankees owner George  Steinbrenner from taking ownership of the Canterbury Downs race track in  Minnesota, the chairman of the Minnesota Racing Commission said today.  </P> <P> Ralph Strangis said he posed the question to the state attorney general's  office because Steinbrenner has been invited by Minneapolis investor Carl Pohad  to help underwrite a proposed takeover of the money-losing horse track in  Shakopee.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner's application for a Canterbury horse-racing license when the track  opened several years ago was rejected because Minnesota law bars felons from  holding a license to race horses in the state.  </P> <P> But Steinbrenner, convicted of making illegal campaign contributions to Richard  Nixon in the 1970s, was later pardoned by then-President Ronald Reagan.  Strangis said he wanted to know what state law says about criminal histories  regarding ownership of a pari-mutuel license.  </P> <P> He said he was told by a lawyer in the attorney general's office that state  laws would not hinder Steinbrenner if he were to join Pohad or take an  ownership interest in Canterbury.  </P> <P> "The felony issue would not be a problem for Steinbrenner because the pardon  would expunge it from his record," Strangis said.  </P> <P> A call to Steinbrenner's office in Tampa, Fla., was not immediately returned  today.  </P></p>

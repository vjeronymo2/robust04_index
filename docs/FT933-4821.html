			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Hoover faces probe on transfer of pension funds HOOVER UK, the domestic appliances group which launched a disastrous 'free flights' sales promotion last year, transferred Pounds 28m from its pension scheme in January, a sum sufficient to cover most of the charges incurred in connection with the scheme. The transfer, which netted the company Pounds 16.8m after taxes, was approved when Mr Bill Foust, the former chairman of Hoover Europe, was chairman of the pension scheme. Mr Foust was one of two top Hoover executives sacked in March by US parent company, Maytag, in connection with the flight offer. Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP and chairman of the Commons social security committee, said on the BBC's Watchdog programme yesterday that his committee planned to investigate the transfer. Watchdog said the pension fund's annual report described the transfer as 'a much-needed injection of funds into the company to provide for the growth and development of Hoover that we all want'. But Mr Field called the transfer a 'rip-off for pensioners' and 'an abuse'. Mr Michael Fallon, Hoover's pensions administrator and company secretary, said the scheme voted to extract cash following a valuation from the actuaries which showed a surplus of Pounds 100m at March 31, 1991. 'The actuaries advised us that it would be prudent to distribute Pounds 60m of that to the company and to employees,' he said. The Dollars 28m transfer to the company was allowed under scheme rules and was accompanied by an appropriation of Pounds 32.8m to cover enhanced benefits to current and deferred pensioners, he said. Hoover has made no contributions to the scheme since December 1986. Most of the benefit improvements are to current and deferred pensioners who are only entitled to annual increases of 3 per cent. Those pensions have been uprated to 95 per cent of their original purchasing power. Hoover launched its promotion last year, offering free flights to international destinations to customers who bought any of its products priced at more than Pounds 120. The scheme backfired when the company was deluged by customers who claimed the company had failed to make good its offer.</p>

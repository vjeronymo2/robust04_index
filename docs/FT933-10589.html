			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Asahi Breweries rises to Y8.5bn ASAHI Breweries, a leading Japanese brewer, reported a rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits at the halfway stage, despite a fall in sales. The company posted a 7.4 per cent increase, to Y8.5bn (Dollars 81m), in pre-tax profits for the first six months to June, due to its rationalisation efforts. Sales fell 2.3 per cent to Y349bn. After-tax profits, however, plunged 22.3 per cent to Y2.4bn due to a rise in corporate taxes. In spite of the sharp fall in after-tax profits, Asahi said it would pay an unchanged half-year dividend of Y4 a share. Asahi attributed the fall in sales to the separation of its foods division in July last year. In addition, bad weather and a decline in consumer spending depressed beer sales, which fell 0.7 per cent to Y292.2bn. The bad weather also affected sales of non-alcoholic beverages, which declined 3.8 per cent to Y46.3bn. Revenue from its real estate division dropped 19.6 per cent to Y7.4bn due to the continuing slump in the property market. Wine sales fell 1.6 per cent to Y1.2bn and drug sales 71 per cent to Y991m. For the full year to December, Asahi expects a 3.6 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y14.5bn on a 1.9 per cent increase in sales to Y785bn.</p>

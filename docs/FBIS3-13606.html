			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Iraq Is Here To Stay" ] </F>   [Text] European thinkers were not wrong in describing the  United States as "an extension of the European countryside." In  fact, post-World War II events, especially following the  Communist landslides, have established that U.S. decisionmakers  think with the mentality of a European peasant who has migrated  to a very modern city!    This U.S. resemblance is not meant to refer to the positive,  but rather the negative aspects of rural life, namely,  backwardness, shallowness, and naiveness in thinking and making  decisions. Events of the last half a century confirm that U.S.  foreign policy has been a mixture of excessive barbarity and  selfishness, miscalculation, shortsightedness, impetuousity, and  superficiality in thinking and tackling events, contrary to the  European mentality, whose maturity and cunning is exemplified by  British policy.    Today, U.S. politicians have proved to be no more than  European peasants in control of a high-tech civilization. So as  soon as their rival collpased, they danced joyfully and began  disgorging their evil intentions and criminal plans against all  of mankind, including their own friends. Perhaps, the U.S.  attitude toward the blockade on Iraq is the worst stupidity of  this European peasant, who knows nothing, and so drowns in his  own ignorance. When he is slapped in the face and made to wake  up from his stupor and come back to his senses, he becomes  stubborn again and pursues his own stupidities until his head  collides with a solid wall and bleeds, then he yells and runs  away!    The United States fled from Indochina in shame, despite all  its victory promises and barbarity. It was defeated in Lebanon  by the blowing up of the Marines headquarters, despite all  Reagan's fiery words. The biggest shame was its defeat before  Iraq when it failed to block Iraq's policy, course, and  leadership, despite all the military buildup. As for its defeat  in Somalia, it was proof of the United States' vulnerability and  failure to honor its promises.    We tell waverer and liar Clinton: Wake up, the blockade is  being eroded, even on the official level in the world. If you  do not save the situation and end this blockade, the news will  come as a painful slap in the face to tell you that Iraq's will  power is stronger and that Saddam Husayn is here to stay.</p>

The negotiations on both collective agreements  have failed. The duty to maintain industrial peace resulting  from the collective wage agreement ends on 30 April, but the  duty under the basic wage agreement has already expired. Today,  Wednesday, Professor Dr. Heinrich Reiter, chairman of the FRG  Social Court, will try to mediate in Frankfurt.    The mediation proceedings will be very complicated and  presumably lengthy because a solution has to be found for the  basic wage agreement, the collective wage agreement, and the  employers' employment initiative. An escalation of the  industrial action of the Media Trade Union has to be expected.  The chairman of the district of North Rhine-Westphalia stated  that one is prepared for months of industrial action if no  progress is made in the mediation process. In North  Rhine-Westphalia alone, altogether 52 printing and newspaper  companies were hit by several strikes in the past few weeks.  Almost all major dailies were affected by them. The Media  Trade Union has announced that it wants to involve additional  staff in the industrial action every day.    The Media Trade Union calls for a 5-percent wage increase.  The employers have stated that they are striving neither for a  zero- nor for a minus-wage round. They are prepared to increase  the wages if this is connected with an employment initiative --  that is, a 37-hour week with a corridor for longer and shorter  working hours -- the inclusion of Saturday in the regular  working hours, compensation for overtime by time off without any  premium, and, for two years, a 10-percent wage reduction for  newly employed unemployed who are older than 50 years.    Thus, this wage model is largely oriented according to the  model of the previous wage agreements of this year, whose  precedent the Media Trade Union, however, does not want to  recognize, despite the bad economic situation of the printing  industry. The employers' preparedness for lockouts as an answer  to strike actions of the trade union is regarded as an unknown  wage policy factor in this wage round.</p>

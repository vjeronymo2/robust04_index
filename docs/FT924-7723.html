			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Nestle in discussions for purchase of Clarke Foods NESTLE yesterday confirmed that it was in talks over the possible purchase of Clarke Foods, Britain's second largest ice cream manufacturer which went into receivership last month. If Nestle managed to win Clarke, it would be the Swiss-owned company's first foray into the UK ice cream market. It is not the only bidder, however, with industry sources citing Mars and Grand Metropolitan as possible candidates. The discussions could end as early as next week. Receivers Robson Rhodes were unavailable for comment but they are believed to be considering several options which could affect the final sale price. These could range from a creditors' voluntary agreement to a separate sale of the assets and the brands, which include Lyons Maid. Clarke paid Allied Lyons just Pounds 7.5m of the Pounds 12m agreed price for Lyons Maid last year before it went into receivership with debts of about Pounds 25m. Industry observers said the deal would make sense for Nestle, which has ice cream interests in the US and continental Europe. The highly acquisitive group has invested an average of SFr2bn (Pounds 900m) annually on expansion and restructuring over the past five years. Clarke's state of the art manufacturing plant would be particularly attractive to the likes of Nestle. Delays on the installation of this equipment during the hottest summer months were behind Clarke's collapse. Mr Henry D Clarke, its former chairman, has abandoned his attempts to buy the business back from the receivers.</p>

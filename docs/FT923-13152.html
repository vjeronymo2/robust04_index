			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Matsushita launches Dollars 1bn global issue MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the giant Japanese consumer electronics group, waited until late afternoon in London yesterday before launching its ground-breaking Dollars 1bn global bond issue. The 10-year issue, the first global issue by a corporation, will be priced today to yield 41 to 43 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Some participants in the deal commented the pricing was tighter than anticipated. However, the yield spread was agreed following talks between the borrower, the joint lead-managers, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, and junior participants in the deal. The registered bonds will be sold in the international and US domestic bond markets. Although the World Bank has seen strong European buying of its six global bond issues, the appetite of Euromarket investors for registered, corporate paper remains untested. The late launch suggested the issue was targeted towards US investors. Syndicate officials said yield spreads in the US market were tighter than in the Euromarket, and demand from North America was seen as crucial to underpin the deal. The syndication contained several features unusual in Eurobond issues, including a Dollars 300m 'pot' of bonds from which underwriters can obtain additional paper for clients beyond their initial commitments. Lehman Brothers said it expected an equal distribution between the US and Europe, with Far Eastern investors taking perhaps 20 per cent of the bonds. Matsushita will use the proceeds of the issue to refinance debt relating to the purchase of MCA, the US entertainment group. Matsushita is the second Japanese company to launch a Dollars 1bn bond issue to refinance outstanding debt. In May, Toyota, the motor giant, launched a Dollars 1bn Eurodollar issue to refinance maturing equity-linked finance raised in the late 1980s. The poor performance of the Tokyo stock market this year has made it impossible to raise equity-linked funding on any scale. Moreover, Japanese banks are less willing to increase credit lines as they work to meet capital-to-assets targets set by the Balse committee of central bank regulators. However, bankers said yesterday that Matsushita was one of only a handful of corporations able to raise debt finance from the bond markets on this scale.</p>

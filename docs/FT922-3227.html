			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: In defence of voting restrictions - The business of exploiting German company law ANGLO-SAXON merchant banks are making a living in Germany defending what - on their home patch - would be indefensible. They are helping the management of large German companies fend off would-be predators with the help of mechanisms which restrict shareholders' voting rights. Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant banking subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, is advising Continental, the German tyre company, on how to defend itself against Pirelli as the Italian company tries to remove voting restrictions at its German rival. S. G. Warburg, another London-based investment bank, is advising the Vorstand - management board - of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), one of Germany's largest insurance groups, on how best to deal with the unwelcome attentions of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French state-owned insurer. Although AGF has built up a stake of over 25 per cent in the German group, its voting rights are limited to just 8 per cent due to an arcane part of German corporate law which allows the AMB Vorstand to decide whether shareholders are entitled to vote. The Vorstand's decision not to register AGF's 17 per cent block of shares was upheld last month by the Regional Court of Aachen. The battle over the restrictions at Continental will come to a head at a shareholders' meeting on July 3, when, for the second year running, Pirelli will attempt to remove a rule which restricts voting rights in the German company to 5 per cent, no matter how big a shareholder's stake. In March last year, Pirelli won a similar vote. However, the outcome of that meeting was recently overturned by a Hanover court and the Italian company has decided to launch a second challenge. The rule is naturally irksome to Pirelli, as it owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over another 34 per cent. Merger talks between the two companies broke down in December after 18 acrimonious months. It is thought Pirelli would like to sell its shares for as much as possible, and that the holding would be worth more without the voting restrictions. Continental is not alone in having such a restriction, or Stimmrechtsbeschrankung as it is known in Germany. A study conducted last year by Bank Julius Bar, a Swiss bank, showed that at least 17 large German companies have such a rule in place. Among these are Deutsche Bank; Mannesmann, the engineering company; and BASF and Bayer, two of Germany's big three chemicals groups. The restrictions at AMB are different in that they leave it entirely to the management to decide who should have a vote. The other type of voting restrictions were granted to German companies by their shareholders in the early to mid-1970s. The purpose was explicitly to prevent Middle Eastern countries using the proceeds of high oil prices to buy up German industry. Some feel, however, that these restrictions are anachronistic. They are seen as a way of making sure that German company directors lead comfortable lives, undisturbed by the threat of takeover. Morgan Grenfell and Warburg deny the rules being exploited by their clients are primarily a management protection device. 'It is a method of preventing someone acquiring creeping control of the company without having to pay a proper premium,' argues Mr Piers von Simson of Warburg, referring to the so-called vinkulierte Namensaktien, special shares whose votes can only be entered on the share register at management's discretion. Morgan Grenfell bases its defence on the argument that the restrictions are in the interest of minority share-holders. 'The major problem with the German system from a minority shareholder's point of view,' says Mr Jeremy Lucas of Morgan Grenfell, 'is that there are no rules obliging a predator to extend an offer to all shareholders. Minority shareholders are thus exposed to the danger of having an undesirable and unworkable transaction forced on them by a 40 per cent shareholder.' These arguments are rejected by Pirelli and, more recently, Germany's largest small shareholder organisation. 'Voting right restrictions in general negatively influence the value of shares,' Pirelli said, and are 'therefore detrimental to the interests of all shareholders'. The Dusseldorf-based Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fur Wertpapierbesitz (DSW), with 10,000 small shareholder members, last week published an open letter to the Continental Vorstand, arguing that restrictions acted against the interest of minority shareholders. Shareholder ought to have votes in line with their economic interest in a company. The Julius Bar study says the best way to prevent an unwelcome takeover comes not from voting restrictions, but from good business performance and communications. In the spirit of this, a few insurance companies have shed their vinkulierte Namensaktien. In the meantime, however, German companies and their advisers are making the most of these defences. Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, chief executive of Aachener und Munchner Beteiligungs, yesterday challenged Assurances Generales de France (AGF)  - the big French state-owned insurance company which has amassed a 25 per cent-plus stake in AMB - to come to the negotiating table. He said that despite a war of words between the two companies, AMB was more than willing to enter talks if the French company were ready to present concrete proposals for co-operation. However, AGF was not interested in real co-operation; instead it was engaged in an 'increasingly open takeover attempt' designed to give AGF access to the German insurance market, he said. Under these circumstances, it was appropriate for the AMB management board not to register voting rights attached to a large portion of the AGF stake.</p>

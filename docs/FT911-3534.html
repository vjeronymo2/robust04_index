			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Greenspan hits at banking proposal: Treasury plan 'would encourage foreign banks to move away from the US' MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has strongly criticised US Treasury proposals requiring foreign banks to set up separately capitalised local holding companies if they wish to take advantage of the opening up of US financial services. Mr Greenspan told the Senate banking committee yesterday such a requirement would impose additional costs on foreign banks without obvious benefits. 'It also creates an inducement for foreign banks to conduct their banking operations in less costly environments outside the US and for foreign authorities to threaten reciprocal restrictions for US financial firms abroad.' Under the plan, which has already been attacked by international bankers, any foreign bank engaged in activities other than simple banking would have to close its current American branches and agencies involved in securities and underwriting operations and conduct all of its US banking business through a US subsidiary bank. This would also apply to any expansion into these areas. In spite of reservations on a number of points, Mr Greenspan endorsed the general thrust of the Treasury's wide-ranging bank reform plan, saying it attacked 'the major root causes of the problems in the banking system'. In particular, he said a majority of the Fed board supported the proposed overhaul of deposit insurance, tightening of supervisory procedures, removal of restrictions on interstate branch banking and authorisation of new investment activities for well capitalised bank holding companies. However, the prospects for comprehensive banking reform this year have receded because of a desire, especially on the House banking committee, to concentrate on legislation to bolster the financially strained bank insurance fund. But Mr Greenspan urged Congress to 'avoid only partial solutions by separating into component parts the comprehensive proposals for reform such as those suggested by the Treasury.' He said the Fed board was troubled about the proposal that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could borrow up to Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14.7bn) from Federal Reserve Banks to absorb losses sustained by the bank insurance fund in dealing with failed banks. This would involve the Fed in directly funding the government. Such funding always been severely limited because of concerns about compromising the independent conduct of monetary policy. It would be better, and have an identical financial and economic impact, if the Treasury made the necessary loans, he said. Mr Greenspan also warned against too large an increase in premiums paid by banks to support the insurance fund, which might threaten the soundness and competitiveness of the banking system. He also underlined the Fed's opposition to removing its present supervisory authority over bank holding companies and limiting it to (mainly smaller) state chartered banks.</p>

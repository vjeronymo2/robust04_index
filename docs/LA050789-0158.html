			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROUP BACKS PORTER RANCH PLAN;  </P> <P> CRITICS QUESTION DEVELOPER'S INFLUENCE ON CITIZENS PANEL  </P> <P> As a proposal for a $2-billion development at Porter Ranch approaches a key  hearing Thursday before the Los Angeles Planning Commission, backers of the  project are pointing to its nearly unanimous endorsement by a committee of  citizens who live or work in Northridge or Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Eager to marshal public support, officials of Porter Ranch Development Co. have  suggested that the plan for about 3,000 residences and 7.5 million square feet  of commercial space in the hills above Chatsworth is as much the work of the  citizens panel as of the developer. And City Councilman Hal Bernson, who  appointed the 14-member committee in 1987, described it as "a cross-section of  the community."  </P> <P> But a review of members' backgrounds and interviews with dissident members  raise questions about whether the panel was, in fact, broad-based and  independent of representatives of the developer, who participated in its  meetings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Executive of Consulting Firm  </P> <P> Eleven of the panel members are in business, including four who work in real  estate or land development. One member is an executive of a consulting firm  that worked for the developer on the Porter Ranch project.  </P> <P> The panel includes a former and a current president of the Rock Point  Homeowners Assn. But the president described himself as "somebody that approves  of growth."  </P> <P> By contrast, no member is employed by environmental agencies or groups, nor is  a spokesman for "slow-growth" organizations.  </P> <P> Bernson said the panel included "no-growth" advocates, but declined to name  them. "I don't want to get into personalities," he said.  </P> <P> Although not announced to the public, the committee's meetings were always  attended by several consultants, as well as the developer representatives --  including former City Councilman Robert Wilkinson -- who often commented on or  sought to refute statements by committee members.  </P> <P> "I felt like they, particularly in some meetings, . . . ran the meeting," said  one city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Also attending were  officials from the city planning and transportation departments, which support  the project because of road improvements that the developer is expected to  finance.  </P> <P> The Porter Ranch representatives "sat in on the meetings every night and if  there was ever any discussion among the members," they would "jump up and start  trying to, quote, clear the air or to explain the situation, but it was always  a very lopsided, one-sided viewpoint," complained Faires Ruddell, the only  dissenter from the panel's 13-1 vote in favor of the plan.  </P> <P> "I feel used," said Ruddell, an insurance agent who lives in Simi Valley. It  "was pretty much predetermined what was going to happen."  </P> <P> John Kelly, who resigned from the committee in a dispute with chairman Howard  Green, said: "I can't think of anything that was presented to us that wasn't  from the developer's viewpoint."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needed at Meetings  </P> <P> But other committee members sharply disagreed. They said they needed project  officials at the meetings to answer questions. They denied that they were  overly influenced by the developer's needs and views.  </P> <P> The developer's representatives "were more helpful than they were disruptive,"  said Green, an insurance agent from Chatsworth.  </P> <P> "I'm sure we asked them for their opinions from time to time because they had  the background on the project that we didn't have," said committee member  Robert Whyte, a retired salesman from Chatsworth and president of the Rock  Point homeowner group. "We had to get it from somewhere."  </P> <P> Several committee members said they sometimes had to rebuke the developer  representatives for taking up too much time during the meetings.  </P> <P> "There were many times when we just told them to sit down and observe and be  quiet, so it was not at all a matter of the tail wagging the dog," said Leo  Gendernalik, a Northridge developer and vice chairman of the panel.  </P> <P> Thanks to the committee's work, there will be a long-term plan for development  of the 1,300-acre site, said member Frank Mazzeo of Northridge, an official of  Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.  </P> <P> "There is a benefit to having a 20-year plan," Mazzeo said. Without it,  "helter-skelter development" might result, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Concessions  </P> <P> And members said they secured many concessions from the developer, proving that  they were not unduly influenced.  </P> <P> For example, the developer's plan for 9 million square feet of office and  commercial space was shaved to 7.5 million square feet. The developer also  agreed to provide cultural amenities, such as a theater, under pressure from  the committee, members said.  </P> <P> With development of a scenic tract on the property a foregone conclusion, the  goal was to "squeeze our developer real hard so he can give us the amenities  the community needs," said member Arthur Pfefferman, president of the Donut Inn  chain.  </P> <P> Committee members, who served as unpaid volunteers, said they spent countless  hours reviewing reports and attending dozens of meetings during a 14-month  period.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch representatives have been quick to characterize the plan as one  proposed by citizens, rather than by the developer.  </P> <P> "To call it a developer's plan would be unfair to the citizens who spent 15  months of their lives putting it together," said Paul Clarke, a spokesman for  the development firm.  </P> <P> But Paul Chipello of Northridge, a critic of the proposal, said it should not  be described as "the citizens' plan," but as "the developer's plan that had  been somewhat modified by" the committee.  </P> <P> Moreover, Chipello, who heads a group called PRIDE that is opposed to the  development, said strong community opposition at public hearings earlier this  year shows that the panel was not truly representative of the northwest San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "It's very apparent to anyone that public support . . . is certainly not 13 to  1 in favor of it," he said.  </P> <P> Bernson said he has been using citizens committees over the past 10 years to  involve the public in development decisions. In the case of Porter Ranch,  Bernson said, he supports approval of about 6 million square feet of commercial  space, a 20% cut from the committee's recommendation.  </P> <P> "They have a great deal of clout with me," Bernson said. "I would say that  about 95% of the time I go along with the committees."  </P> <P> One of Bernson's appointees is Frank Wein, an official with Michael Brandman  Associates, a consulting firm that helped prepare the environmental impact  report for Porter Ranch Development. Wein was out of town and could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Several committee members said that they did not know that Wein worked for  Brandman or that Brandman worked on the project. They also said Wein raised  good questions and did not seem to support the project more than other members.  </P> <P> Bernson said he was unaware of Wein's ties to Brandman or of Brandman's  involvement in the project. Clarke, the Porter Ranch spokesman, said Wein was  not directly involved in Brandman's work.  </P> <P> Most of the committee's information came from the developer and from the city,  both supporters of the project.  </P> <P> City departments -- such as fire, and recreation and parks -- gave  presentations at some committee meetings. But the panel did not hear from  environmental agencies, such as the South Coast Air Quality Management  District, according to several committee members.  </P> <P> Although city planners staffed the meetings, the committee did not have  independent technical or legal experts review the developer's plans and data.  </P> <P> Last fall, some panel members discussed whether to require Porter Ranch to make  traffic improvements beyond those the developer thought justified, Kelly said.  At the next meeting, he said, he was handed a legal opinion from the firm's  lawyer contending that such improvements could not be required. The opinion was  written by Daniel P. Garcia, who had recently resigned as president of the City  Planning Commission and had become an attorney for Porter Ranch. Kelly said he  felt "a little intimidated."  </P> <P> The Porter Ranch project, to be built over 20 to 30 years, would be among the  largest in Los Angeles history. It would house about 9,300 residents, employ  27,000 workers, and include office buildings and a shopping mall the size of  Northridge Fashion Center.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development is a partnership of Liberty Building Co. and Shapell  Industries, headed by Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell. He also chairs  the Commission on State Government Organization and Economy, a government  operations watchdog panel better known as the Little Hoover Commission, and is  a big contributor to charitable causes, and state and local election campaigns.  </P> <P> The Times reported in March that Shapell Industries and other building and  consulting firms and individuals connected with the project contributed  $410,000 in campaign funds since 1982 to the mayor and members of the City  Council, which ultimately will decide the project's fate. The largest council  recipient was Bernson, who received $50,380 from them.  </P> <P> Committee members said they do not believe that any member would benefit  directly from the project.  </P> <P> But most committee members believe that the project will raise property values  and benefit business in the area.  </P> <P> "More bodies is going to have to be more business for everyone," said member  Paul Smith of Woodland Hills, who owns a liquor store at Tampa Avenue and  Rinaldi Street, east of the project site.  </P> <P> Gendernalik said the project would enhance local real estate values. "In terms  of how it's laid out, how it's planned . . . it cannot help but do that," he  said.  </P> <P> Gendernalik added: "I'm very excited about the work that the committee has  produced, and I'm anxious to see it take form." No other large development has  been planned "with as much forethought," he said.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's anything like it in the city of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission could make a recommendation to the City Council on  Thursday.  </P> <P> THE COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Howard Green, independent insurance agent, lives in Chatsworth (chairman).  </P> <P> Leo Gendernalik, president of Umbrella Inc., a real estate development firm,  lives in Northridge (vice chairman).  </P> <P> Mary Lee, president of Valley College in Van Nuys, lives in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Frank Mazzeo, employee communications manager for Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.,  lives in Northridge.  </P> <P> Richard Miller, Century 21 real estate agent, lives in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Ray Mulokas, architect and builder, Mulokas-Lentz Construction, lives in  Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Arthur Pfefferman, president of Donut Inn chain, lives in Northridge.  </P> <P> Faires Ruddell, agent for State Farm Insurance, lives in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Victor Sampson, owner of Don Ricardo's restaurants, lives in Northridge.  </P> <P> Paul Smith, owner of Northridge Hills Liquor &amp; Wine Warehouse, lives in  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Guy Swanson, retired salesman, lives in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Gary Washburn, real estate broker with R R Gable real estate firm, lives in  Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Frank Wein, executive with Michael Brandman Associates consulting firm, lives  in Northridge.  </P> <P> Robert Whyte, retired salesman, heads condominium owners association in the  Rock Point area of Chatsworth.  </P></p>

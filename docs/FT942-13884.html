			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Austin Reed buoyed by retail boost Trebled profits in Austin Reed's retail division and a Pounds 2.81m one-off profit on a property sale lifted the clothing group's annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 6.87m. The advance came on turnover 8 per cent up at Pounds 65.4m. The shares, a single class since the enfranchisement of the non-voting shares last summer, rose 22 1/2 p to 199 1/2 p on the announcement. The group was optimistic for the current year, stating that since the January 31 year end its retail sales were ahead 14 per cent. A final dividend of 3.5p is proposed to give a total of 5.5p (5p). The rise reflected a balance between restoring the historic dividend, which peaked at 9.5p in 1990 and 1991 and a desire to rebuild cover towards a target of 2. Earnings, excluding the property profit, were 9.8p (3.1p). Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said that cash generation plus the property sale proceeds cut debt from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 4.1m, and gearing from 20 per cent to 9 per cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.65m to Pounds 991,000. He said since the enfranchisement the group had looked at acquisitions but had found few opportunities. Enfranchisement had expanded the shareholder register and helped the shares. The group concentrated last year on the retail division, Mr Thomson said. Selling area fell 4 per cent, through relocating to smaller shops with a more focused product range, but retail sales rose 12.8 per cent to Pounds 50.7m. Gross margins had risen by 2 percentage points, and the group had managed its stock better to avoid heavy sale markdowns. With no inflation in prices, like-for-like volume had been up 9 per cent. Retail profits rose from Pounds 896,000 to Pounds 3.01m. Licensing profits were up from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.48m, but the gain was due to rises in the dollar and yen against sterling, with volumes flat. Weak export markets left manufacturing profits down from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 536,000.</p>

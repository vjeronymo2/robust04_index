			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Heseltine plans bar on regional pricing at Royal Mail The government is to draw up legally binding contracts to prevent a privatised Royal Mail from introducing regional price differentials. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has told Tory MPs that the green paper on the Post Office will contain the proposed contracts guaranteeing a uniform tariff at an affordable price. But the possibility of BT introducing regional phone pricing has swollen the ranks of Tory backbenchers worried that Mr Heseltine's plan to float 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce could lead to a similar development in mail services. A number of Tory MPs regarded as 'Post Office sceptics', rather than outright opponents of flotation, have warned they would vote against privatisation unless Mr Heseltine gave 'cast iron guarantees' preventing regional pricing. Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, said: 'If there was any suggestion of regional pricing when it come to the Post Office - even if it was a few years ahead - I would be opposed to privatisation.' Another Tory MP privately said the possibility of regional pricing by BT may force the government to amend or even drop its plan to sell a majority stake in Royal Mail and Parcelforce. He said many of his colleagues were very concerned that BT last week flagged regional phone pricing as an option after the introduction of a new charging system next year. Although BT claims to have no immediate plans to introduce regional pricing, the option is attractive as the company confronts stronger competition from rival operators. Mercury, BT's main long-distance competitor, already engages in regional pricing. It is running a promotion in the Cardiff region offering residential customers a third off standard long-distance Mercury tariffs. Some BT executives fear that its ability to compete will be limited unless it can react in like manner. Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, said: 'This is the slippery slope. There are genuine worries being expressed about the effects of privatisation, not for reasons of dogma but simply as a consequence of the introduction of regional price differentials.' At the time of gas privatisation assurances were given that price differentials on a regional basis would not happen, although the government recently agreed that remote regions could be charged more. Assurances were also given at BT's privatisation that national tariffs would remain intact. Union alleges sell-off plot, Page 9</p>

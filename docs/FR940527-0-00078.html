Alascom's Common Carrier Tariff <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. The Final Recommended Decision stated that Alascom should be required to file a common carrier services tariff with two geographic rate zones. To implement this recommendation, we establish filing dates and other requirements. In order to process Alascom's common carrier services tariff by the required effective date, we require that Alascom file its tariff and cost support information <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  120 days before the scheduled effective date for that tariff of January 1, 1996, because a lawful tariff must be on file prior to termination of the JSA. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  The tariff must be revised annually thereafter on the schedule set forth in Section 69.3(a) of the Commission's Rules. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 61.38 (1992). Alascom is required to file in its tariff the minimum quality of service standards that it will employ for the provision of its common carrier services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As recommended by the Final Recommended Decision, the Alascom common carrier services tariff must reflect Alascom's costs after application of the $150 million transition payment. Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at n. 180. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 69.3(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. The Final Recommended Decision did not recommend a rate of return that Alascom should use in computing a revenue requirement for the common carrier service tariff. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  We conclude in this order that for purposes of computing the revenue requirement for Alascom's common carrier tariff, Alascom shall use the authorized interstate rate of return applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) unless Alascom, by clear and convincing evidence, is able to justify a different rate of return for its interstate operations. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the Tentative Recommendation, however, the Alaska Joint Board recommended either the authorized interstate rate of return applicable to local exchange carriers or the intrastate rate of return authorized for switched traffic in Alaska, whichever was lower. Alternatively, Alascom could propose another rate of return with justification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Tentative Recommendation, 8 FCC Rcd at 3692, n.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Other Modifications and Clarifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. AT&amp;T has been providing interstate service to and from Alaska at integrated rates in conjunction with Alascom under the JSA. The Commission requires AT&amp;T to provide interstate MTS service at integrated rates pursuant to the Commission's rate integration policy and sections 201(a) and 4(i) of the Communications Act. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Alaska Joint Board recommended that AT&amp;T be required to provide interstate service to and from Alaska after the JSA is terminated. In this order, we adopt that recommendation and require that after the JSA is terminated, AT&amp;T must provide interstate service at integrated rates to and from Alaska under the same terms and conditions, including service quality, technical standards, and availability, that it provides those services in the Lower 48 states. The Alaska Joint Board did not, however, address AT&amp;T's potential need to request equal access from Alaska LECs. With the termination of the JSA, AT&amp;T will directly provide service to subscribers in Alaska. AT&amp;T does not currently have the same type of access to LECs in Alaska as it did in the Lower 48 when equal access was implemented, since it has been providing service to the customers of Alaskan LECs only through Alascom's facilities. In the Lower 48, because AT&amp;T already had ``equal access'' to the LECs, the Commission required LECs to implement equal access only in response to requests from other interexchange carriers. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  We conclude that, because in Alaska AT&amp;T does not have physical connections to the LECs equivalent to equal access, LECs will have to implement equal access in response to requests from AT&amp;T as well as in response to requests from other interexchange carriers in Alaska. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, AT&amp;T may request equal access from Alaska LECs in order to provide interstate service in Alaska. The ability to request equal access will ensure that AT&amp;T has more flexibility in providing service in Alaska. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The equal access requirements discussed herein are the same equal access requirements that apply to independent telephone companies in the rest of the nation.

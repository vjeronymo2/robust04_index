			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report: "French Concern Will Engage in </F> Prospecting and Production of Oil in Russia"]    [Text] In April the first group of specialists from the  French concern Elf Aquitaine will arrive in Volgograd to perform  work on oil prospecting and production. An agreement on survey  efforts was reached between the administration of the oblast and  the concern as early as 1991. However, implementation of the  project became possible only after the government resolved to  exempt Elf Aquitaine from customs duties on medical [as  published] equipment it imports to Russia. Experts estimate that  there are about 300 million tonnes of oil under the oblast.  According to the terms of the contract, 60 percent of the oil  produced will remain in Russia, and 40 percent will become the  property of the concern.</p>

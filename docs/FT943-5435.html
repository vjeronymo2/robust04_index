			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Skipton flies high Skipton building society's fixed-rate bond, paying 8.25 per cent gross per annum for three years, has entered our Highest Rates table (below) in the week of its launch, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The rate is paid on a minimum deposit of Pounds 2,000 to a maximum of Pounds 250,000. Withdrawals cannot be made until September 30 1996; any made after this date and before the redemption date will be charged a 4 per cent penalty. The Skipton bond pays interest annually. But for those wanting monthly interest, Leeds &amp; Holbeck's three-year Triple Choice bond pays a fixed rate of 8 per cent gross. From November 1, the cheque clearance time for Nationwide FlexAccount customers will be reduced from up to seven working days to three days (cashcard-only FlexAccount cheques will still take seven days, though). Unauthorised overdraft charges will be increased, however. Those who go Pounds 20 into the red will be charged Pounds 10; previously, the fee applied to those with a Pounds 100 unauthorised overdraft. Abbey National has issued a new range of fixed-rate mortgages which are almost 2 percentage points higher than ones withdrawn. The two-year fixed rate is 8.75 per cent (9.3 APR) - higher than the bank's standard variable rate of 7.74 per cent. The previous two-year fixed rate had been 6.94 per cent. The other fixed rates are: three-years at 9.15 per cent (9.7 APR); four years at 9.5 per cent (10.1 APR) and 10 years at 9.99 per cent (10.7 APR). Fees are between Pounds 250 and Pounds 300.</p>

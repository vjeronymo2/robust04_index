			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (3): A winning combination - Strong economic growth and a population keen to raise living standards means this is a market foreigners cannot ignore / Profile of Poland THE packaging on a humble orange ice-lolly sold from an ice-cream van this summer was surprisingly revealing. The ingredients of the lolly - produced at a plant in Germany and clearly intended for the new pan-European market made possible by the disintegration of the iron curtain - were printed in German, French, Dutch, English, Czech, Hungarian and Polish. The package neatly illustrated the degree to which a common European market extending from the Atlantic to the eastern borders of Poland is now a reality for the manufacturers and marketers of consumer goods. But of all the new markets that opened up at the start of this decade, Poland is rapidly becoming the most interesting for both foreign investors and exporters. The first of the post-communist states to embark upon a programme of rapid economic reform in January 1990, Poland could well register Europe's most dynamic economic growth this year and foreign trade will be where most of the growth is generated. The combination of up to 4.5 per cent real economic growth and a 39m-strong population which is determined to achieve western-style living standards as soon as possible lies at the root of Poland's attractiveness. An economic transformation has taken place over the past four years, in spite of frequent changes of government and four unstable coalition governments in as many years. Last month Poles cast their votes decisively in favour of political parties with young, pragmatic leaders but whose roots are in the communist era. This brings the risk of slower growth and higher inflation, but also the possibility of a more stable political base for continuing the market-orientated reforms sweeping the country in recent years. These have raised the living standards of skilled and entrepreneurial Poles but been painful for the nearly 3m unemployed, pensioners and low-paid government sector workers. Future left of centre governments will have to tread a thin line between a greater degree of care for the weak and encouragement for the strong in order to continue creating the new wealth that is needed for future growth. Many of the former bloated state-owned industries have been transformed into leaner, more competitive units eager for imported components to raise the quality of their finished products. But the real force behind Poland's renaissance is the fast-growing private trading and manufacturing sector whose active entrepreneurs are busy seeking new technology, new products and new partners. Contacting these private entrepreneurs and traders is becoming easier. Sophisticated, frequently updated trade directories with full details of Polish companies are now available. The most comprehensive is the General Trade Index and Business Guide published by the Business Foundation Company at Krucza 38/42, Warsaw 00512. This contains full details on a wide range of state and privately-owned companies. The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a large number of western merchant banks, accounting and consultancy firms have also acquired intimate knowledge of the new players. Those that are actively involved in Poland's complex privatisation schemes have accumulated detailed information on 36 industrial sectors selected as ripe for privatisation. The Polish commercial offices in London and other capitals have been upgraded. Since Poland's economic turnaround began in May 1992, industrial production has risen steadily month by month. Over the first half of this year alone manufacturing output was up 12.8 per cent compared with the first six months of 1992, according to a recent study by Salomon Brothers. The rise in output has led to a surge in imports, resulting in a Dollars 1.1bn trade deficit over the first half of this year and forcing the authorities to devalue the zloty by 8 per cent at the end of August. In recent months the government has also raised import tariffs on many products, including cars and some foodstuffs. But many of the imports are connected with rising investment by leading US and European corporations, including a wide range of consumer product companies. The growing market and low labour costs have attracted the leading soap, detergent and personal product manufacturers and fast-food franchisers, led by PepsiCo - which alone has an ambitious Dollars 500m investment plan for fast food and soft drinks - and McDonald's. The car industry is another sector slated for fast growth. The largest single commitment is that of Fiat which is investing Dollars 2bn to build new low-cost models, starting with the Cinquecento, for the regional and wider European market. Fiat is pulling in a plethora of Italian component suppliers while Volkswagen, Peugeot, General Motors and Ford have also set their sights on the Polish market. The attractiveness of Poland as a market for consumer goods has been transformed by a revolution which has shifted the trade and retail sector into private hands. Not just Warsaw and the main cities, but even tiny villages now boast western-style mini-markets and smart new shops. Ambitious plans envisage new east-west and north-south motorways which will reduce costs and underline Poland's strategic position as the main link between Germany and the former Soviet republics. Private, cross-border trade between Poland and the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belorussia and Russia itself is also starting to take off with Poland's resourceful money changers along the border changing virtually worthless roubles or Ukrainian coupons into internally convertible zloties and back again while traders work out ingenious barter deals through which to sell coveted western consumer goods in return for such items as caviar and smuggled gold. In the longer term, Poland will be an increasingly big market for power generation, construction and other infrastructure-building equipment, something well recognised by investors such as Siemens and ABB, with a string of strategic investments behind them.

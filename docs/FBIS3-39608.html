			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Politics Demands Threat Be Carried </F> Out"]    [Text] The Hague -- The West cannot hesitate about carrying  out air strikes if Serbia refuses to place its heavy weapons  under UN control by 0101 (Netherlands time) Monday morning [21  February], said Minister Kooijmans (foreign affairs) and his  colleague Mr. Ter Beek (defense) yesterday in the Second  Chamber, which unanimously supported this government action.    "The threat of air strikes is a political means of applying  pressure. Such a threat is only credible if it is carried out,"  said Kooijmans. According to Ter Beek, the air strikes will be  limited to the area around Sarajevo.  <H5>  Cancelled </H5>   Neither Kooijmans nor Ter Beek said precisely when air  strikes would begin. Ter Beek did cancel a planned working trip  to Norway combined with a visit to the Olympic Games in  Lillehammer. "I would have been back by Monday evening, but the  ultimatum expires on Sunday evening, and I would have not been  very calm there," said Ter Beek just before the beginning of the  debate in the Chamber.    According to Kooijmans, the decision to deploy Netherlands  F-16's in the air strikes was very tough for the government.    "The risks for the troops on the ground and civilian aid  workers cannot be taken lightly." However, Kooijmans seemed to  be only partly in agreement with Chamber members who said that  the ultimatum appeared to be working: "There is insufficient  progress. In addition, the Serb leaders are making  contradictory statements. Milosevic and Karadzic are prepared to  take steps, while some military leaders are not."  <H5>  Guarded </H5>   According to Kooijmans, the West cannot be satisfied with  "monitoring" at a distance, for example with the help of radar.  "That is not sufficient inspection." The heavy weapons taken  over by the United Nations must be guarded by UN men, perhaps in  a central location, before being destroyed.    Mr. De Hoop Schoffer (of the CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal]) called on the government to use the five days left  before the ultimatum expires to exert a maximum amount of  political pressure. He also asked the Second Chamber to be  directly involved in every successive step.    Earlier in the day, Ter Beek stated that the United Nations'  request for extra military personnel for the UN peacekeeping  force in Bosnia was not directed at the Netherlands. The  Netherlands will shortly have some 3,100 military personnel  stationed in or in the area immediately around the former  Yugoslavia.</p>

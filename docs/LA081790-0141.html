			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-TITAN ABBOTT GIVEN TRYOUT WITH THE 49ERS  </P> <P> Former San Diego Chargers and Cal State Fullerton kicker Vince Abbott was given  a tryout by the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday as the team continued to be  concerned about the condition of kicker Mike Cofer.  </P> <P> Cofer has been limited in his work by a pulled muscle in his left hip and is  listed as probable for Monday night's game with Denver.  </P> <P> "Looking at Abbott was just a precautionary measure," said John McVay, director  of football operations. "We had former Minnesota kicker Chuck Nelson in  Wednesday for a tryout and there is a possibility that we might sign one or the  other."  </P> <P> McVay said the team wouldn't have to make up its mind about signing a kicker  until Saturday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Cofer insisted he should be ready to play against the Broncos.  </P> <P> "The muscle feels a lot better today than it has and I think I'll be able to  kick," said Cofer, who missed Saturday night's game against the Raiders.  </P></p>

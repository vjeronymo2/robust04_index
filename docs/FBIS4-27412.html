			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Defense Secretary Renato de Villa  urged opposing sides in the Korean peninsula to exercise  restraint, and called for a moratorium on potentially  destabilizing activities such as fresh arms and troops buildup  and deployment in the South China Sea. He also called on the  Pacific Basin Economic Council to help stabilize security  concerns in the Asia-Pacific region by creating economic  activity.    He was speaking during a defense and security session of the  27th Pacific Basin Economic Council [PBEC] meeting yesterday  afternoon. The PBEC, he said, could help alleviate the situation  in the Peninsula and help North Korea to "enter the mainstream  of the Pacific Basin community" by inviting the North to  participate in PBEC activities. Prospects of greater trade  opportunities and investments can "provide some incentives for  North Korea to respond positively to any PBEC initiative in that  direction."    Mr. de Villa also suggested that the PBEC develop a vital  role in the economic pursuits in the South China Sea where there  is a need for continuing dialogues on the demilitarization of  the area. Maintenance of the status quo is necessary "with  respect to the claims of sovereignty and exploration of possible  modes of cooperation in scientific research, inventory,  exploitation and development of its resources with the  participation of the claimant countries," he added.    Corporate involvement in enhancing the security and  stability  of the region is vital, said Secretary de Villa. Although the  Asia- Pacific region has managed to adapt "rather well" to the  changes in the international community with the end of the Cold  War, it still faces problems of "incalculable impact on peaceful  endeavors amidst the optimism in the economic progress of the  region."</p>

We cannot but say this is indeed a brigandish sophism  completely reversing black and white and is a brazen-faced act,  same as a thief yelling, "Stop thief!"    As has already been known, the United States has completely  reversed [wanjonhi twijibo opko] its promise made to us during  the DPRK-U.S. contact and has urged acceptance of the demand for  full-scope inspections put forward by International Atomic  Energy Agency Secretariat. Moreover, by designating even the  time limit, the United States made a final notice-like threat  and menace [choehu tongchopchogin wihyopkwa hyoppak], stating  that if the demand is not met, the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks will not be held and the road to sanctions will be  advanced.    The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are  scheming to stage by all means large-scale nuclear war  exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  against our Republic, and are accelerating on a full scale the  deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea.    This clearly illustrates that the United States has no  intent  to resolve peacefully the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,  but is pursuing its aim to crush our Republic with strength.</p>

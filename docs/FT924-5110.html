			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Spens is acquitted and savages SFO: 'There have been burglaries, phone taps, harassment and overt threats to me and my colleagues' LORD SPENS, the former managing director of corporate finance at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, yesterday finally won his High Court battle to be acquitted of fraud charges brought against him following his involvement in the Guinness affair. His name cleared, Lord Spens left court to launch a vitriolic attack on the Serious Fraud Office and other government departments, accusing them of acting with 'staggering malevolence' against him and other defendants in the Guinness trials. He is also considering suing Henry Ansbacher and the Bank of England for damages over his dismissal from the bank after details of the Guinness affair first became public. Lord Spens was acquitted of charges of fraud and false accounting which had been left on the file following the collapse of the second Guinness trial last year. The fraud charge related to alleged dishonest concealment of material factors relating to the Guinness takeover of Distillers in 1986. The role of Henry Ansbacher centred on the disputed ownership of 2m Guinness shares worth Pounds 7.6m held by the bank during the takeover battle with Argyll. The trial was abandoned after 73 days when Lord Spens' co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, the former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier, suffered a nervous breakdown while defending himself in court. The trial judge, Mr Justice Henry, refused to acquit Lord Spens and ordered the 'stay', saying he had brought the prosecution on himself. Two High Court judges yesterday ruled that Mr Justice Henry had been wrong to reach this decision since he did not have the power to order the stay. However, they rejected Lord Spens' application for his legal costs, totalling about Pounds 365,000, to be paid from public funds. Lawyers for Lord Spens are considering whether this ruling can be challenged in the House of Lords. Afterwards, Lord Spens launched a salvo of bitter criticism against the SFO, the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Bank of England and the security services for 'leaving no stone unturned' in trying to convict the Guinness defendants. He said: 'There have been burglaries, phone taps, harassment and overt threats to me and my colleagues; interference with witnesses' evidence, public interest immunity certificates and failure to disclose important documents. 'Roger Seelig's health has been destroyed and, but for a fine heart surgeon, I would have been killed off too. 'I intend to take my seat in the House of Lords where I will work, amongst other things, for the radical reform of the Serious Fraud Office, which I consider to be nothing more than a cowboy outfit with a gunslinger mentality.' Lord Spens said the prosecution had a 'disastrous' effect on his personal financial situation, having cost him a total of about Pounds 750,000. He intends to return to work, but conceded this would probably be only on the 'periphery' of the City.</p>

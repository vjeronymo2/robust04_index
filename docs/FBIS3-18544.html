So said  Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson at a news  conference yesterday afternoon.    "It is the most important question of the 20th century that  is now to be the subject of a referendum. It is very important  to allow the democratic process to take the time it needs,"  Ingvar Carlsson said.    He expects that in the early summer the Social Democrats  will  be able to hold an extraordinary party congress on EU membership  and hopes to get a yes to Swedish EU membership at that congress.    "I would view it as a setback if the congress said no,"  Ingvar Carlsson said at yesterday's news conference.    In addition to the the party leader, Mats Hellstrom, the  Social Democrats' spokesman on European questions, took part in  the news conference. Both were very positive toward the outcome  of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day.    "It is a historic agreement," said Social Democratic leader  Ingvar Carlsson, who was satisfied on all points with the  exception of the Swedish membership contribution to the EU  during an initial phasing-in period.    "On that point we had been hoping to make greater progress,  but we think nevertheless that a more or less acceptable result  has been achieved. In all negotiations it is a question of give  and take," Ingvar Carlsson said.    "I do not think that a result from the negotiations under a  Social Democratic government would have been very much different  from the result we have now achieved," he added, assessing that  the prospects after the successes in the negotiations in  Brussels of a Swedish yes to the EU in a future referendum are  increasing.    Both Ingvar Carlsson and Mats Hellstrom praised European  Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel for his input into the  membership negotiations. Carlsson and Hellstrom also said that  they are satisfied that the government took account of the  demands that the Social Democrats voiced during the negotiations.    "The government accepted that the Social Democratic  opposition's demands should have an effect on the Swedish  positions," Mats Hellstrom said.    "It is good that Sweden has been able to unite behind  important national interests."</p>

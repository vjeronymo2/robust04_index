			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Lonrho shares at lowest since 1984 LONRHO'S share price yesterday fell 13 1/2 p to close at 65 1/2 p, its lowest since January 1984, as Phillips &amp; Drew Securities confirmed it was resigning as Lonrho's joint stockbroker in protest at the international trading conglomerate's lack of consultation over its big deals. Phillips &amp; Drew, the main marketmaker in Lonrho shares, was particularly irritated by the group's failure to tell it of its decision to sell a third of its holding in Metropole Hotels to the Libyans for Pounds 177m. The move came as the United Nations Security Council last night ordered sanctions against Libya over its refusal to surrender two men accused of masterminding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Meanwhile, banks with big loans to Lonrho, led by Barclays, Standard Chartered and Lloyds, have become anxious that banks with smaller Lonrho loans might attempt to reduce their exposure. The big banks are not keen to increase their loans to Lonrho to replace any bank facilities that could be withdrawn. 'If a number of peripheral lenders cut their lines, that would cause us a problem,' said one banker. He added that the main lenders had been discussing how to maintain bankers' confidence in Lonrho. It also emerged yesterday that Barclays has the biggest lending exposure to Lonrho, thought to be around Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 100m for Standard Chartered and Pounds 70m for Lloyds. Lonrho's proposed deal with the Libyans caused its second biggest shareholder, US-based Fidelity Research and Management, to voice concern that it might have to sell its 9.8 per cent stake. Fidelity is concerned about what action may be taken by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces a ban against US companies dealing with Libyan-owned or controlled institutions. The UK Department of Trade and Industry has said the UN sanctions would not affect businesses with Libyan investments. Many Lonrho institutional shareholders, which criticised the Libyan deal, said they regretted the resignation of Phillips &amp; Drew. Societe Generale Strauss Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, is to continue to act for the company as sole broker. Lex, Page 24, Markets, Page 44</p>

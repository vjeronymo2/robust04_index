			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Laird Group - Other companies High exposure to France and Germany has held back performance at the manufacturer of car components and industrial products, which makes most of its money overseas. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 37m-Pounds 39m, compared with Pounds 36.9m last time. They also expect a slight rise in the full-year dividend to 10.8p, from 10.5p. The main problem facing the group is its need to reduce its cost base in the face of weak and erratic European car demand.</p>

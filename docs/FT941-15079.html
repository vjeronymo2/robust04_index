			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets This Week: Sterling and dollar to defend gains The key question facing currency markets this week is whether the dollar and sterling will be able to maintain the dramatic gains of recent days against the D-Mark. Rising optimism about the US and UK economies and mounting gloom about Germany's recession pushed sterling three pfennigs, and the dollar two pfennigs, higher. The Anglo-Saxon economies seem set to remain the darlings of the markets but some dealers fear this optimism might have been exaggerated, particularly if this week's US and UK economic news is not as good as last week's. On the D-Mark side, the main focus of attention is the meeting of the Bundesbank council on Thursday. The Bundesbank's refusal to cut rates at its last council meeting initially led the markets to assume rate cuts would occur this time, but opinion has since become more mixed. Germany's recession and improving inflation outlook have left some convinced that there will be a cut. But, the dramatic weakening of the German currency last week, and likely volatility in the German money markets as a result of recent banking reforms left others believing cuts would be delayed. The markets will be watching closely to see how far the Bundesbank is willing to support the D-Mark. Although the Bundesbank's intervention to support the D-Mark last week was only conducted through reserve management, the bank is expected to oppose another dramatic D-Mark slide. The apparent deadlock in the US-Japanese trade talks will leave the yen-dollar rate particularly sensitive to political swings. Some dealers hope Japan's government is moving closer towards introducing the fiscal measures needed to boost the Japanese economy, however the underlying fundamentals remain poor for the yen, and few expect it to stage any significant rally. Meanwhile, the Irish punt has benefited from sterling's recent bull run and is at the top of the ERM grid. As Mr Chris Turner, of BZW points out, this means the gap between the punt and peseta, currently the weakest ERM currency, neared 10 per cent on several occasions last week. With the punt likely to strengthen further, the trend underscores the growing polarisation between the peripheral ERM currencies, in spite of convergence in the centre.</p>

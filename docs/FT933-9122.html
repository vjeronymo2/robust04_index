			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Manufacturing recovery wavers: Business leaders lack confidence in economy despite growing strength of equities EXPECTATIONS about a strong manufacturing recovery have slipped back in several UK regions, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey published yesterday which underlines fears that the economic upturn may be slowing. While indicating that weak export demand from the rest of Europe is holding back growth, the survey said manufacturing order books in six out of the 11 regions had fallen from levels four months ago. The report said the expected drop in export orders across the country had hit especially hard in three regions which up to now had been leading the recovery - Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands and Wales. Companies in three other regions - south-west and north-west England and Northern Ireland - also expect falls in export orders over the next four months. The findings from the survey, conducted jointly with Business Strategies, an economics consultancy, were supported by views from senior UK business executives who said the recovery was far from robust and might not be sustained in the second half of the year. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, said demand in the industrialised world continued to be 'very patchy', echoing a warning on Tuesday by BOC Group, the industrial gases company. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of engineering company Lucas Industries, was 'cautious' about a UK recovery because signs of domestic growth had not been matched elsewhere in Europe. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive of Smiths Industries, the engineering group, said: 'We have yet to see all this talk of improvement reflected in our UK order books.' The survey came on the same day as the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares broke through 3,000 for the first time. Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the report pointed to an upturn, with 'the recovery feeding to more UK regions' in which output expansion had been relatively slack. But 'there was no neat pattern' to the gradual strengthening in demand and output, and the survey indicated that the manufacturing recovery would slow over the next few months. The survey comes after strong manufacturing and export growth helped to lift the UK economy in the early part of the year. With consumer spending growing slowly because of high personal debts, manufacturing is expected to be an important factor in any sustained upturn. The relatively downbeat sentiments from the report were echoed by Mr Simon Duffy, finance director of the Thorn EMI electronics and leisure company, who said the upturn was 'uneven'. For Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, the glass company, Britain was 'just bumping up from the bottom', with a particular question mark over sales prospects in Germany, while Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive of the British Vita plastics company, said: 'I am still looking for the green shoots.' While the report said business optimism among UK manufacturers had strengthened in the past three months, only in Scotland was the rise in confidence greater than that seen in a similar survey in April. The latest poll questioned 1,346 companies between June 25 and July 14. Commercial vehicle sales fall by 10.8%, Page 6</p>

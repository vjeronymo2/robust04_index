What </F> Political Baggage the U.S. President Is Bringing With Him to  Russia"]    [Text] For some time now summits, as these top-level  meetings are traditionally called, have been an inexhaustible  source of inspiration for caricaturists. In fact cartoonists  started mining this vein of gold well before the era of  Gorbachevian perestroyka, back in the days when the Soviet Union  still existed as one of the two superpowers. Our editorial  files contain a copy of the American magazine NEWSWEEK which  carried items about two interlinked events. The magazine  announced the election of RSFSR Supreme Soviet Chairman B.N.  Yeltsin, calling him a "talented demagogue." Alongside this  report, a column of humorous remarks opens with a comment from  Gorbachev which he let drop in a conversation with some  Americans on a Washington street: "I really feel at home here!"    Alas, they were already openly mocking us, enjoying the joke  to the full and rubbing their tummies with glee. But what can  we say now about these so-called summits?!    On the eve of the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting scheduled for  12-15  January, the British newspaper THE TIMES took the liberty of  giving the U.S. President a few practical recommendations. THE  TIMES believes that it is pointless for the West to be soft on  Russia and try to "placate" Yeltsin since "Russia is no longer a  superpower or an equal partner, and Yeltsin," THE TIMES claims,  "is a caricature rather than a politician." Therefore, it says,  Clinton, who is well known for wanting to please everybody,  might not on this occasion demonstrate this trait in his  character because "he should not refuse to be confrontational  toward Russia." Needless to say, THE TIMES reasons, Russia will  not like the U.S. position, particularly on such a sore point as  the enlargement of NATO through the addition of Russia's former  Warsaw Pact partners, the East and Central European countries,  but "in the final analysis that is Russia's business."    We do not know whether Clinton will heed this advice, but  this is what Vice President Al Gore stated the other day on his  behalf: "The United States resolutely supports plans to bring  NATO and East Europe closer together."    The traditional list of questions on the agenda of the  Gorbachev era -- "bread, milk, flour, etc." -- will naturally  still receive emphasis, but the topic of using Western loans to  support reform has long set teeth on edge, and it is now totally  clear that America is at best prepared only to make gestures  involving charitable aid, and even this is limited to gestures  that will yield greater dividends on the purely propaganda level.    House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, the U.S. Moscow  Embassy information bulletin reported, has delivered a very  emotional report entitled "New Partnership: Relations Between  the United States, Russia, and the New Independent States." The  report contains a passage about the congressman's personal  impressions of Moscow, which are capable of wringing tears even  from people with hearts of stone: "...The price of bread has  risen from 10 kopeks to 40 rubles [R], i.e. by 4,000 percent.  Even though shelves in stores are full, by no means everybody  can afford these goods.... On one of the central streets of  Moscow three wretched children with sad faces sat begging --  their dirty, skinny hands in torn gloves stretched toward me  brought to mind the era of Charles Dickens."    We must suppose that attempts will be made to shield Bill  Clinton from this sort of distressing encounter on the Moscow  streets. Moreover, the Missouri Democrat's news about the price  of Russian bread is already relatively stale -- these days,  alas, Russians can only dream about loaves costing R40; they now  cost approximately R300. But if such an encounter were to take  place, how could the U.S. President comfort the child beggars?  THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that Clinton intends not to  increase, but on the contrary to cut aid to foreign states.    Nevertheless we may assume that Clinton will not leave B.N.  Yeltsin without any support whatsoever; Yeltsin is the man whom  the U.S. President once enthusiastically called "our guy!" Many  things have bound Clinton and Yeltsin together closely,  particularly during the past year, marked by bloody events. On  the eve of the U.S. President's visit to Moscow it is  appropriate to remind readers that this trip could have taken  place last year -- immediately after the declaration of special  rule in Russia. At the time the U.S. Government circulated the  transcript of a Clinton news conference held 23 March 1993. Let  us cite some excerpts from this document:    Question. Don't you think your visit to Moscow could drag  the United States too deeply into the power struggle in the  (Russian) capital?    Answer. I would like to go to the meeting with an  "aggressive" and very specific U.S. aid plan....    Question. What policy will the United States opt for if the  Soviet legislators vote to impeach President Yeltsin, which  looks extremely likely? Will you continue to regard Yeltsin as  the legitimately elected leader of Russia?    Answer. Today that is precisely how I see him. He is the  only (nationally) elected figure. The rest take their cue from  a Constitution adopted in the Communist era. Right now I do not  wish to consider other possible responses....    However, additional information about these "other possible  responses" was then supplied on the pages of THE NEW YORK TIMES  by a ranking White House Administration spokesman who wished to  remain anonymous. He implied that the United States would  resolutely support Yeltsin if he assumed emergency powers: "If  Yeltsin suspends the activity of the undemocratic parliament,  this will not necessarily be an undemocratic act." And so in  October the U.S. Administration unconditionally approved of  Yeltsin's order to open fire. At the same time it is still not  entirely clear: Was the administration merely an indirect party  to this command, whereupon the whole world looked on, stunned,  as tanks opened fire on the Russian parliament?! One thing  cannot be doubted: The Russian president is not the only person  whom the events of September-October 1993 will come back to  haunt.    On the eve of Clinton's arrival in Moscow, the British  newspaper THE DAILY TELEGRAPH quoted some spiteful words by  Zhirinovskiy. In response to the U.S. President's refusal to  meet with him in Moscow, the leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party called Clinton a coward and advised him to "stay at home  and play his saxophone."    It is, incidentally, entirely possible that Clinton will  bring his saxophone with him, but the question of what else he  will be carrying in his Moscow baggage remains open at the  present time....</p>

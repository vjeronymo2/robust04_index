			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Unsettled outlook for voting forecasts UK votes cast today in the European elections will not be counted until Sunday night, although the five Commons by-election results may give some indication for those who stay up late. The auguries are bad for the Conservatives, in spite of some hyped suggestions of a late upsurge, but firm forecasts are difficult for four main reasons. Redistribution: Britain has six extra Euro-seats and the boundaries of almost every English and Welsh constituency has changed, complicating comparisons. Turnout: in the 1989 Euro-elections just 35 per cent voted compared to 78 per cent in the 1992 general election. This time the turnout may rise to 40 per cent but the parties and polls disagree on the percentage and on who will stay at home. If Conservatives are as disillusioned as some commentators suggest, this could make an enormous difference. Tactical voting: will Labour voters in the southern seats, where the Liberal Democrats are the main challengers, recognise how best to oust their Tory MEP or will they treasure the right to express true party loyalty, even if it lets the Tories in? Have the Liberal Democrats educated the electorate on tactical voting as they have done so spectacularly in by-elections? Regional voting: the campaign saw the Conservative vote collapse to an all-time low, with Gallup putting Labour 30 points ahead - although ICM cut that to 18 points yesterday. A MORI poll today gives Labour 51 per cent and the Tories 23 per cent. But the movement has been uneven with the Conservatives suffering most in their southern strongholds. It is possible to calculate what would have happened in the new constituencies by comparison with the 1989 Euro-election figures, the 1992 general election results or the local election figures from last month. Each can be misleading as a guide to the movement revealed by today's vote - but probably the 1992 figures are best. Constituency factors will undoubtedly produce local variations. There are 15 constituencies where the notional lead is under 4 per cent, so that anyone wanting to place bets faces a difficult challenge.

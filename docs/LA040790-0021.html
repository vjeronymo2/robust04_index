			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA BOULEVARD SUBWAY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission voted recently to build three  rail lines in Los Angeles County, including one across the eastern San Fernando  Valley, over the next 11 years.  </P> <P> Commissioners also voted to study the option to build the subway under Ventura  Boulevard in lieu of a route along the Southern Pacific Burbank branch.  </P> <P> It is a wise decision considering the following facts:  </P> <P> Ridership. The RTD presently operates 70 buses along Ventura Boulevard carrying  70,000 passengers per day, the second highest ridership sector in the city. The  highest projected ridership of the proposed alternatives is 48,900  average-weekday trips.  </P> <P> Impact on the business community. If a rail line were built along the Southern  Pacific Burbank branch, RTD would be required to take most, if not all, of its  buses out of service along that route, an action that will definitely affect  businesses along the boulevard.  </P> <P> Funding sources available. The RTD is now negotiating multimillion-dollar joint  development ventures at some stations of the first leg of Metro Rail. These  developments will provide revenue sources for the district, and at the same  time will help to offset the cost of construction. This innovative source of  funding would not be possible if the Southern Pacific Burbank branch were  built. Additional cost savings will also result because there will be no need  to purchase the expensive real estate along the right of way.  </P> <P> It is also important to consider that a Ventura Boulevard rail line will  facilitate a bus-rail interface between the north-south bus lines and the  east-west rail line. Finally, by locating a rail system along Ventura  Boulevard, it will place into motion land use patterns directing commercial  development away from existing residential areas, and into designated "urban  centers."  </P> <P> We should therefore reconsider whether the rail tracks should run below Ventura  Boulevard in the commercial core of the Valley or through residential areas  just because there is right of way land available.  </P> <P> NICK PATSAOURAS  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun, Deputy Prime Minister  Ozker Ozgur, and Communal Liberation Party [CLP] leader Mustafa  Akinci have received Felix Bogdanov and Fiotr Dobroserdov,  Russian Foreign Ministry officials, and conferred with them for  some time. The Russian officials visited the Democratic Party,  the Republican Turkish Party, and the CLP headquarters today and  exchanged views on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] with  the party leaders.    In a statement after the meeting, Atun said he explained the  Turkish Cypriot views on the recent developments, adding that he  gave details on the discrepancies between the CBM package  accepted in principle and the current problems that have arisen.  Pointing out that he explained to the Russian officials the  source of the current impasse, Atun stressed that the Turkish  Cypriots expect simultaneous benefits from the package. Noting  that the Turkish Cypriot side is waiting to receive information  on which countries Turkish Cypriot flights taking off from  Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport will be able to land in and on what  kind of documents will be necessary, Atun said that the United  Nations should have a practical solution to this issue. He  added that it was explained to the Russian officials that the  Greek Cypriot side cannot make the Turkish Cypriot side its  legality, adding that this is an entirely different issue.    In reply to a question on whether the Vienna talks on the  CBM's were assessed, Atun said that efforts will continue to  define the differences of views between the two sides.    In a statement during his meeting with the Russian  officials,  Ozgur recalled that Russia is one of the five permanent UN  Security Council members, adding that in that capacity, Russia  is interested in the Cyprus problem. He noted that an  agreement acceptable to both sides regarding the implementation  of the CBM's may be reached through the goodwill of the two  sides.    Speaking after his meeting with the Russian delegation, Atay  Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister, said that the  Turkish Cypriot side is ready to contribute to reestablishing  the balance in the CBM package, which was upset by the 21 March  document, and to continue the talks to achieve that end. He  added that the contacts are aimed at launching this process.    In a statement prior to the meeting, Akinci said his party  has always maintained a positive approach regarding measures  aimed at creating a rapprochement between the two communities on  the island. He added that through mutual goodwill, a solution  can definitely be found. He concluded: Everyone should exert  every effort possible. The greatest duty, however, befalls the  two peoples and their administrators.    Dobroserdov said that Russia, which is one of the five  permanent members of the UN Security Council, takes an interest  in the Cyprus issue and especially in the CBM package, adding  that his presence in Cyprus is aimed at listening to the views  of the parties concerned. Stressing that Russia attaches great  importance to the package, Dobroserdov said: One cannot advance  toward the solution of the actual problem without implementing  the CBM's.    In a statement after his meeting with Atun, Dobroserdov said  that the meeting had been very positive, adding that Atun's  explanations were important in terms of determining the Russian  position.</p>

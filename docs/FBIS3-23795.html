			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosyan by </F> Yerevan YERKIR correspondent Nayiri Badalian, in Yerevan; date  not specified; originally published in the 13 December issue of  Yerevan YERKIR]    [Text] This interview with the president came about  unexpectedly, on the spur of the moment. When our correspondent  asked the president to comment on the Russian elections in the  hallway of the parliament on 12 December she did not receive the  expected comment, but gained a unique opportunity for an  interview, which was surprising to the correspondent herself.    [YERKIR] Mr President, what is your assessment of Armenia's  socioeconomic and political condition?    [Ter Petrosyan] There can be no unequivocal assessment. The  only unequivocal assessment is that this is a transition period,  with all of its contradictions and all the instructive elements  in the process of building a state. The learning applies to the  government as well as businessmen, the heads of state  enterprises, our people, the banks and so forth. This is a  serious issue.    [YERKIR] How long may this process last? In your opinion,  when can this transition period end?    [Ter Petrosyan] In my opinion several decades are necessary.  Of course, it is not necessary that we experience the same  levels of tension and crisis as those we have now throughout  those decades, but what is known as "transition," when it refers  to a radical change from one system to another, must take 20, 30  or 40 years. This is the experience of all countries in the  world.    [YERKIR] And when can the process of decline be halted and  when can stabilization begin?    [Ter Petrosyan] It is hard to say. One can say that things  can be worse than this. Things will be worse than this.    [YERKIR] Can one conclude from your remarks that no plans  are  being made in that direction?    [Ter Petrosyan] No, one cannot conclude that. Plans are made  every day, every second.    [YERKIR] Then what do you think is the cause of the current  situation? Apart from objective causes, what subjective factors  do you see at the root of this situation? Inadequacy of the  government system or those who govern?    [Ter Petrosyan] I can enumerate dozens of factors. First  there is the inadequacy of the legislation. I consider that a  subjective factor, because there are mechanisms to enact laws.  Here both the government and the Supreme Council have their  share of the blame. There is also a lack of professionalism in  general. We are creating a state in new conditions. All of us  are passing through a process of learning, and everyone has a  right to err in that process. That is also subjective. The  president takes decisions, the Supreme Council enacts laws. None  of these can be turned into dogmas. These decisions and laws  must be viewed as dynamic documents. We must be able to react to  them very quickly and correct them as necessary. There is a  certain sluggishness because of these subjective factors.    [YERKIR] Do you observe any mistakes or oversights on your  part?    [Ter Petrosyan] As I said all these subjective factors are  mistakes.    [YERKIR] On your part.    [Ter Petrosyan] I spoke about presidential decisions also.  Why not?    [YERKIR] In terms of working in the legislative domain?    [Ter Petrosyan] Of course. There have been laws, for  example,  whose urgency I did not realize and which I submitted late when  I could have done so sooner. In particular, the package of laws  and decisions about privatization. I still think that we moved  too slowly in that regard.    [YERKIR] What serious deficiencies have you noticed in the  government's work with regard to the socioeconomic situation--if  any, that is?    [Ter Petrosyan] It is impossible to say anything definite. I  can attribute them to learning, inexperience and the current  conditions of getting work done in new circumstances.    [YERKIR] Do you not think that the relative instability of  the domestic political situation is the result of the abnormal  state of relations with the opposition? What steps do you  envisage taking to strengthen those relations?    [Ter Petrosyan] Is the present situation unstable?    [YERKIR] Comparatively. In other words, it could be better  than it is now.    [Ter Petrosyan] It can always be better, but we must compare  our situation with others.    [YERKIR] In any event, what steps would you take to move  closer to the opposition as a first step to improve the domestic  political situation?    [Ter Petrosyan] To move closer to the opposition? I have no  demands from the opposition. I have no complaints about the  opposition. The opposition is doing whatever it thinks is  appropriate. That is why it is the opposition. The opposition  decides on its own what its actions and policies will be. Let me  say one thing: For me there is only one standard of appraisal,  whether it is done by the opposition, the press or the  government, or whether it is with regard to science or human  relations: Objectivity. I have no other standards.    [YERKIR] Can one conclude from what has been said that you  think that relations with the opposition are very normal and  that there is no need for the government and the opposition to  communicate with or to come closer to each other?    [Ter Petrosyan] I would like to emphasize one point further.  When the press, the opposition or the government are striving to  see and seek the truth then we have national harmony. If that  happens they can always communicate with each other. But when  that desire does not exist, one gets bargaining instead of  harmony. Bargaining is not excluded in politics. We are not  opposed to that either. Bargaining does not come about  artificially but is created by life when real political forces  are created. Real political forces have to reckon with each  other, irrespective of whether they like or do not like each  other. They are simply obligated to reckon with each other.    [YERKIR] Do you foresee the creation of a coalition  government as an alternative?    [Ter Petrosyan] Life may mandate that. If life mandates it,  we can have a coalition government, fresh elections or early  elections. At this time life does not force us to do that. By  life I mean political life.    [YERKIR] When is the endorsement of a constitution expected?  Are presidential elections envisaged after that?    [Ter Petrosyan] I am the most interested person in the  endorsement of a constitution as soon as possible, and I am not  backing off from my terms. I have declared my position  repeatedly and I stand on it: Immediately after the endorsement  of a constitution there must be fresh presidential and  parliamentary elections.    [YERKIR] A few days ago, your press secretary, Mr Aram  Abrahamyan, responding to a question about your address  preceding the introduction of new currency, said that your  sources passed erroneous information to you. What do you say  about that?    [Ter Petrosyan] Aram Abrahamyan gave the wrong answer. He  was  simply not careful, because the question itself contained  certain untruths. I do not want to comment on what that question  implied. You can examine the recording carefully.    [YERKIR] I would like you to comment on the problem of the  "brain drain" from Armenia and the state of the intelligentsia.    [Ter Petrosyan] It is no secret that emigration is observed  in such conditions. It is the war.    [YERKIR] However, most of those emigrating are the  scientific  and technical intelligentsia.    [Ter Petrosyan] I do not agree with that. You give me the  numbers. What do you mean by majority? Whatever numbers you  have, please show them to me.    [YERKIR] I must concede that I do not have numbers at my  disposal.    [Ter Petrosyan] Then let me give you the numbers. It is true  that these are not the latest figures; they are four months old.  When there was much talk about the "brain drain" we commissioned  the Academy of Sciences to supply us with official information.  It was determined that 13 members of the Academy left in the  last two years. I repeat, this was the situation four months  ago. I am giving the numbers and I am responsible for them.    [YERKIR] What steps are you taking to improve the social  condition of the intelligentsia, in particular the scientific  and technical intelligentsia?    [Ter Petrosyan] I do not separate the condition of our  intelligentsia from that of our people, that is, our entire  population.    [YERKIR] I mean, does the intelligentsia fall into the list  of socially insecure classes for whom measures will be taken by  your upcoming decree on indexation?    [Ter Petrosyan] If you paid any attention, in the most  recent  decrees on indexation, we tried to put in place a differentiated  approach with respect to people who work in science, education  and health care. I agree with the principle that a  differentiated approach should be taken on the indexation issue,  and in the future we must try to deepen gradually the  implementation of that principle. The intelligentsia is included  in the groups targeted for indexation. What I am saying is not  speculation. This has been put into practice in the latest  decrees.    [YERKIR] Thank you.</p>

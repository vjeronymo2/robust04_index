			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Blair hedges approval of ideas Mr Tony Blair yesterday committed Labour to a radical shake-up of the welfare state as he signalled approval for the broad thrust of the ideas tabled by the Social Justice Commission. Mindful of Conservative charges that he favoured expensive new spending proposals, and of divisions in his own party over the future of welfare, Mr Blair insisted that the commission's report was not a blueprint for Labour's manifesto. He made it clear that he was more enthusiastic about some of its recommendations than others. But echoing some the central themes of its recommendations, Mr Blair said that Labour would build a 'second generation' welfare system, directed above all at attacking 'the insecurity of middle income Britain and poverty of low income Britain'. His comments came as senior Labour figures said that the report provided the party with the rationale to drop previous costly spending pledges on pensions and child benefits which had reinforced its reputation for 'tax-and-spend'. Dismissing the idea that modern welfare could be based on the right's reliance on market forces or on the left's past attachment to higher benefit spending, Mr Blair set out a series of guiding principles for the new approach: 'Giving people a hand up rather than a handout', involving provision of services such as childcare and training as well as income support and unemployment benefits. Adapting to the changing patterns of family life rather than being tied to the concept of the 'nuclear family' which had guided the Beveridge report. Recognising that citizenship involved responsibilities as well as rights and abandoning commands 'from government on high' in favour of local decisions and public/ private partnerships. Turning to the specific proposals in the report, Mr Blair singled out its plans for a minimum pension guarantee for the elderly poor as an idea worth pursuing. He indicated his backing in principle for taxation of the child benefit received by households liable to the top rate of income tax and welcomed the suggestion for a new citizen's service scheme for young people. He gave broad support to the report's 'welfare-to-work' shake-up of the benefit system but suggested that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, would improve on the specific measures. Mr Blair made it clear, however, that he was far less convinced by the recommendation for a graduate tax to fund the expansion of higher education. He said there was a risk that it would deter young people from poorer backgrounds from going into higher education.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: 'Rusty' Gatt talks run against the clock TRADE negotiators in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks are casting doubt on the feasibility of concluding a 'political' package by the end of the year as had been hoped. However, they remain determined to finish the round before March when the US administration's negotiating mandate runs out. Little progress has been made since the Uruguay Round resumed in Geneva on November 26, following the deal on farm trade between the US and the European Community. The US, EC and Japan have complained that trading partners have not shown the necessary sense of urgency. 'We have some difficulty putting the machine in motion; perhaps it has become too rusty,' said a senior EC official. 'It is looking increasingly difficult. A lot of issues are not close to being resolved,' a top US negotiator confirmed. The Geneva talks have been in abeyance for nearly a year while the two giant traders bargained over farm subsidies. The US and EC have also yet to present draft tariff schedules reflecting their November accord, without which the hard bargaining on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to goods imports cannot begin in earnest. The EC schedule is due next Tuesday. Negotiators agreed to seek a 'political' conclusion to the round by Christmas - that is, to complete the package of fair trade rules covering 15 broad trade sectors and decide on 'the overall shape, content and value' of specific trade liberalisation commitments for goods and services. This would be followed by a few weeks of 'tidying-up' work. However, none of the remaining problems has been resolved. Battles lie ahead over Japanese rice and some other farm issues. In services, where the EC yesterday presented a revised liberalisation offer, negotiators disagree on such key sectors as maritime transport, audiovisual services, telecommunications and financial services. The US is unhappy with draft proposals to create a Multilateral Trade Organisation which would absorb the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the proposed sister bodies on services and intellectual property.</p>

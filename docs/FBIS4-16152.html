			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 13 April, TASS -- We are greatly concerned over  the fact that NATO had to launch air strikes against Bosnian  Serb positions and view them as the last resort. However, we  understand that NATO was forced to resort to this drastic  measure, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a  briefing on Wednesday.    "We are above all concerned over the failed attempts to  solve  the conflict in this region by political means," he noted. "We  believe there is a possibility of going ahead with political  dialogue, which successfully got under way in  Bosnia-Herzegovina," the foreign minister stressed. "In my  opinion, a positive solution to it is quite possible. We see to  it that the situation remain under control, since a lot of U.N.  peacekeeping forces are deployed in this region, including our  Ukrainian battalion. I think we are doing our utmost to prevent  any unpredictable developments there, the more so as the  situation is under control of U.N. troops and NATO forces. I  believe the conflict will be avoided," Zlenko emphasised.</p>

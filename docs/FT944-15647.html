			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Election boost poses dilemma for east German party: The PDS must decide whether to widen its horizons Leaders of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to east Germany's former Communist party, had much to smile about yesterday. They had won four constituencies in east Berlin, gained 4.4 per cent of the national vote, and will have 30 deputies in lower house of parliament, the Bundestag. 'Against all the odds, including the anti-PDS propaganda in the media, we have proved we are a genuine left-wing party for the east Germans,' said Mr Gregor Gysi, its charismatic parliamentary leader. Ironically, however, the very success has exposed the party's weaknesses as it tries to define its role in the Bundestag, and what kind of party it wants to become. Ms Christa Luft, economics minister in the last Communist government in East Germany who was elected for the PDS in east Berlin, said she would lobby hard for east German interests. 'We have to have a new policy for the east German Mittelstand (small and medium-sized companies). They require capital and financial assistance.' Mr Manfred Muller, a former banker who was also elected, wants a new housing policy for the east Germans. But Mr Gysi admitted it was too early to say what impact the PDS would have on the Bundestag. One thing seems certain, however. The PDS will be working closely with the Greens and the Social Democrats to promote east German interests, and to dispel the persistent image in western Germany that it is at heart either still communist, or merely an ephemeral 'protest' one. To achieve the latter, the PDS knows it has to confront three issues: its membership structure; whether it will remain a regionally-based party for the east Germans, akin to Bavaria's Christian Social Union; and if it can isolate the Communist Platform, its influential Leninist faction. The party's voting structure is already changing. Although 90 per cent of members are former communists, this does not reflect its vote Mr Andre Brie, the campaign manager, and Infas, the independent polling organisation, have shown that more than 20 per cent of PDS voters are under 25 - too young to have any meaningful communist background. However, more than 30 per cent are unemployed. 'This vote will erode over time,' said Mr Brie, adding that it would be strategically unwise for the party to rely on this protest vote. 'When the economy picks up, peoples' voting habits will change.' The PDS will thus have to decide if it will remain a party for east Germans in the expectation that they will retain an identity, and interests, separate from west Germans', or should move into the western states - the party has already captured 5 per cent of the vote in the radical Kreuzberg district of west Berlin. 'We want to get a foot in the west and be seen as the alternative left-wing party,' said Mr Lothar Bisky, PDS leader. That carries a risk. Were the PDS to go nationwide, it could split the left-wing vote in the west - to the advantage of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. But these problems pale in comparison to the task the party faces in shaking off its communist legacy so that it can move towards becoming, at least in east Germany, a genuine east German social democratic party. If it wants to woo SPD votes in the east, and later in the west, it knows it must expel the Communist Platform. Achieving this would remove the charge that the PDS is a mere front for communists. East Germany's SPD state and local governments might also find it ideologically more acceptable to work with. A 'purge', though, would deprive the party of a vital and disciplined grassroots element which helped increase its influence in all five east German states. 'But it is a showdown we have to have,' said Mr Bisky. 'And we have to address these issues very soon.'</p>

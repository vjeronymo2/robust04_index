			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report for Gwen Lister] </F>   [Text] Deputy Justice minister, Vekuii Rukoro, is out of  the Cabinet. Rukoro is reported to have received a letter which  instructed him not to return to cabinet meetings and to return  all cabinet documents in his possession. The letter was signed  by Peingondjabi Shipoh.    It is further reported that the reason given for his ousting  is that he was no longer a leader of a political party. It was  apparently by virtue of his former position as leader of SWANU  [South-West Africa National Union] that he held a cabinet post.    However, his ousting comes rather belatedly since Rukoro  resigned as SWANU leader in September last year. However,  sources indicate that Rukoro may have fallen out of favour for  reportedly raising criticism in Cabinet on Tuesday [25 January]  about the lack of Government action in the controversial case of  Justice Minister Ngarikutuke Tjiriange and Home Affairs deputy  minister Nangolo Ithete, whose ostrich business has been  implicated in alleged illegal ostrich dealing. Tjiriange is  Rukoro's direct superior, and Rukoro was apparently told to  `drop the subject.'    The letter to Rukoro from cabinet ordered him not to attend  future meetings and to return all documentation, which he is  reported to have done already. At the time of going to press  last night, repeated efforts to contact the deputy minister for  comment, were unsuccessful. At this stage it is not known  whether Rukoro's deputy minister post is in jeopardy as well.</p>

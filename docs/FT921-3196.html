			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Specialist Computer lifts stake in NMW to 24.2% Specialist Computer Holdings (SCH), a privately-held computer dealership and distributor, confirmed that it had increased to 24.2 per cent its stake in NMW Computers, the leading processor of stock exchange transactions, writes Alan Cane. Mr Peter Rigby, SCH chairman, said that he had been interested in NMW for some time, but had no immediate intention of launching a full bid for the company. He believed, however, that the pattern of NMW's shareholding - with many small investors - had prevented the company maximising its potential. He thought it likely SCH would be seeking representation on NMW's board.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> The Times Poll and the article by George Skelton ("Most Americans Think  Abortion Is Immoral," Part I, March 19) reveals the extent to which Americans  have lost their way.  </P> <P> The first paragraph was a corker! "Most Americans consider abortion to be  immoral -- in fact, 'murder.' But they also believe deeply that each woman  should be allowed to decide for herself whether or not to have an abortion."  </P> <P> Do those two ideas in tandem not show a paralysis of analysis or what?  </P> <P> We have all observed the popular practice of settling all issues so that  everyone's brand of nonsense and evil is accommodated -- but this is not  necessarily about the issue of abortion, but about the ability to keep our  thinking straight.  </P> <P> ROBERT GRIFFIN  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

Waiver is requested from the test procedures for measuring the Energy Consumption of Furnaces found in Appendix N of Subpart B to Part 430, specifically the section requiring a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and start-up of the circulating air blower. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York International requests a waiver from the specified 1.5 minute delay, and seeks authorization in its furnace efficiency test procedures and calculations to utilize a fixed timing control that will energize the circulating air blower 30 seconds after the gas valve opens. A control of this type with a fixed 30 second blower on-time will be utilized in our P2LN and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current test procedure does not credit York for additional energy savings that occur when a shorter blower on-time is utilized. Test data for these furnaces with a 30 second delay indicate that the overall furnace AFUE will increase approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to the same furnace when tested with the 1.5 minute delay. Copies of the confidential test data conforming these energy savings will be forwarded to you upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York International is confident that this waiver will be granted, as similar waivers have been granted in the past to Coleman Company, Magic Chef Company, Rheem Manufacturing, the Trane Company, Carrier Corporation, Lennox Industries, Amana Refrigeration, Goodman Manufacturing Company and others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael B.

Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic impact or competitive disadvantage York will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, York's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York shall be permitted to test its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82 with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company. This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the application is incorrect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Christine A.

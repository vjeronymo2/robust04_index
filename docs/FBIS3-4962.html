			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nagoya, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's largest auto  manufacturer Toyota Motor Corp. will probably announce a  vountary target of purchasing a six billion dollar U.S.-made  auto parts in fiscal 1996, industrial sources said Thursday [3  March].    Other automakers are likely to follow suit in an apparent  effort to break an impasse in trade talks between Japan and the  United States, the sources added.    Japan's 11 auto makers pledged to buy U.S. auto parts worth  19 billion dollars in fiscal 1994 as part of efforts to reduce  Japan's huge trade surplus when then U.S. President Gerge Bush  visited Tokyo in 1992.    Earlier in the day, Toyota Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda showed  a  positive stance on setting a voluntary target for imports of  U.S. auto parts.    Toyoda suggested at a news conference that the Japanese side  could propose the voluntary target on condition that the U.S.  does not take a retaliatory measure if Japanese automakers fail  to realize such an objective.    Toyoda said the auto manufacturers of Japan and the U.S. are  on good terms, adding it is better to set a voluntary target  than to damage the relations between them.    The economic relations between Japan and the U.S. have been  strained since February 11 when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a  U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to gauge the openness  of Japanese markets to American products.    The bilateral trade negotiations have centered on four  fields  -- autos and auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications  products and insurance services.    On Wednesday, Clinton indicated that he will soon revive the  super 301 provision of the 1988 omnibus trade act, which would  allow for retaliatory measures against countries deemed to be  engaging in unfair trade practices.    Toyoda has been named new chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren) to replace Gaishi Hiraiwa,  chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co.</p>

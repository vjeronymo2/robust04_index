			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT ALLEGING PLUTONIUM DANGER WILL SEEK TO BLOCK SHUTTLE LAUNCH  </P> <P> NASA's long-delayed shuttle launch of the Galileo mission to Jupiter, already  several years behind schedule because of the Challenger disaster, now faces a  legal battle that could jeopardize next month's scheduled launch.  </P> <P> A Washington-based public interest law firm, the Christic Institute, and  several other organizations plan to file suit today in Washington in an effort  to block the launch. The suit -- which climaxes several months of growing  concern over the safety of the launch -- will argue that the launch will  endanger the public because an accident could release 48 pounds of highly  radioactive plutonium 238 carried aboard Galileo.  </P> <P> The plutonium is used to generate electric power to run Galileo's many  components.  </P> <P> "We thought it was a terrible idea" to launch the shuttle Atlantis with Galileo  and its radioactive generators in its cargo bay, said Lanny Sinkin, an attorney  with the institute. National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials  have said the plutonium is packaged in such a way that even an explosion like  the one that destroyed Challenger would not likely release significant amounts  of the deadly substance, but Sinkin believes the risk is just too great.  </P> <P> The battle promises to be a bitter one, and it has even divided the community  that would normally be expected to stand united against a launch carrying  radioactive materials.  </P> <P> "After going through mountains of material and soul-searching, I am comfortable  with the launch," said Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst with the  Federation of American Scientists. Aftergood, who has led the fight to block  the use of orbiting nuclear reactors, has personally watched some of the many  tests that NASA has used to evaluate the safety of the generators. He said he  is "persuaded that the safety risks are small and the scientific payoffs are  large."  </P> <P> "I hope to see it go forward," he said.  </P> <P> "We believe it is safe or we wouldn't propose to launch," said John Casani,  longtime manager of the Galileo program and now a top executive with NASA's Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Donald Williams, who will command the Atlantis, said he isn't worried.  </P> <P> "We really have looked at this quite a lot, and I'm convinced in my own mind  that it's absolutely safe to fly," Williams said at a recent Florida press  conference.  </P> <P> Others, however, are not convinced.  </P> <P> "After the Challenger explosion, Chernobyl and the Valdez accident, we have  learned that technology can go terribly wrong," Bruce Gagnon of the Florida  Coalition for Peace and Justice said. The coalition is expected to be a party  to the suit.  </P> <P> The suit will challenge the adequacy of NASA's environmental impact report,  which declares the risk minimal. A federal interagency panel, however, does not  rule out the possibility that some cancer deaths could occur if the plutonium  is somehow pulverized and released into the environment.  </P> <P> The Atlantis is scheduled for launch Oct. 12. If the suit delays the launch  past Nov. 24, the mission will have to be postponed for 18 months because it  will be that long before the planets are aligned in a way that would make the  encounter possible.  </P> <P> Earlier this month the White House Office of Science and Technology formally  approved the launch, setting the stage for the coming legal skirmish.  </P> <P> NASA's opposition has been motivated partly by the space agency's lack of  credibility in the field of risk-benefit analysis, as demonstrated by the  Challenger disaster, and partly by defection by some respected members of the  space community. Richard Cuddihy, a radiation expert and a member of the panel  that recommended that the White House give its required approval for the  launch, has filed a minority report claiming that the launch "puts a large  number of people at risk."  </P> <P> "Our real bottom line is, go find an alternative to the plutonium," Sinkin  said.  </P> <P> But NASA and independent experts contend that there is no alternative. Galileo,  like 22 other space probes launched with radioactive generators, will operate  in areas so far from the sun that solar energy is not practicable.  </P> <P> Galileo will have two "radioisotope thermoelectric generators," each powered by  24 pounds of plutonium 238. As it decays, the plutonium gives off heat that is  converted directly to electricity.  </P> <P> The same type of power plant was used aboard the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which  recently capped a 12-year tour of four outer planets last month when it zipped  past Neptune.  </P> <P> But unlike all the other space probes with nuclear generators, Galileo is to be  the first launched by the shuttle. The fight to block the launch is fueled  largely by memories of the Challenger fireball over the Florida coast four  years ago.  </P> <P> Although 22 spacecraft using a total of 38 radioisotope generators have been  launched, the record is not without its blemishes.  </P> <P> A U.S. navigational satellite failed to reach orbit April 21, 1964, and its  power supply disintegrated in the atmosphere "as it was designed to do in case  of re-entry," Aftergood noted in a position paper on Galileo. The accident  "tripled the worldwide inventory" of plutonium 238 and "increased the total  world environmental burden from all plutonium isotopes by about 4%." A federal  report predicted that six fatal cancers would develop as a result of that  accident.  </P> <P> NASA maintains, however, that it has taken great precautions with the Galileo  probe, significantly reducing any risk to the public.  </P> <P> Plutonium is most dangerous when it is in the form of a fine powder because it  is most harmful when it is inhaled. Once inhaled, a single particle can produce  fatal cancer by irradiating nearby cells.  </P> <P> To reduce that danger, the plutonium carried aboard Galileo is in 72 solid fuel  pellets encased in metal. The fuel itself is in a ceramic form, so even if the  generator is destroyed the debris should consist mainly of larger particles  that if ingested by humans will tend to be excreted, safety officials maintain.  </P> <P> On behalf of the space agency, the federal Department of Energy has subjected  generators to pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square inch, although the  maximum explosion in the Challenger has been estimated at 400 pounds per square  inch, and the coating that surrounds the pellets remained intact, according to  the agency.  </P> <P> The generators have been shot with bullets made of material that would simulate  fragments from various shuttle components. They have been exposed to intense  fire for up to 10 minutes and slammed into steel and concrete.  </P> <P> The tests show that under some circumstances, some fuel would be released, so  the space agency's own findings do not rule out the possibility of some hazard  in the event of a major accident. NASA has maintained that the risk is  extremely low, and even an explosion on the launch pad would release only  enough radiation to cause "0.7 fatalities."  </P> <P> However, a federal Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel found NASA's  estimates too low and concluded that a launch accident could result in 80 fatal  cancers.  </P> <P> But the greatest risk could come months after a successful launch.  </P> <P> The space probe's solid-fuel rocket propulsion system is not powerful enough  for Galileo to fly directly to Jupiter, so the spacecraft will fly first to  Venus and then pass by the Earth twice, using the two planets' gravitational  fields to boost its speed so that it can venture far out into the solar system.  </P> <P> The second near-Earth encounter will bring the probe within 200 miles of the  surface, and if the craft should somehow re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and  break up in a fireball, more plutonium could be released in a more hazardous  powdery form than even a massive explosion on the launch pad.  </P> <P> The interagency panel estimated that an accidental re-entry into the Earth's  atmosphere could produce from zero to 2,000 cancer fatalities.  </P></p>

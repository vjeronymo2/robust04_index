			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The best judges: Hugo Dixon argues that beneficiaries should control their pension schemes Who should control Britain's occupational pension schemes, employers or the schemes' beneficiaries? This question is one of the central tasks facing the Goode Committee, which was set up by the government to review pension law following the Maxwell fraud and is due to report in the autumn. How the question is answered will have wide ramifications not only for people's pensions but also for their careers. Presently, control of schemes and their estimated Pounds 500bn in assets lies with employers. They decide contribution and benefit rates, appoint trustees, determine investment policy and retain the right to wind up schemes. Current and prospective pensioners - the 'members' - have little or no say over how schemes are run, despite saving large proportions of their income through the schemes. The debate on occupational pension reform has concentrated on devising measures to prevent fraud and compensate its victims. While this is essential, a bold reform would also transfer control of schemes to their members who would then elect trustees and vote on how schemes should be run. The case for doing so is strong. At present, most schemes operate on a 'final salary' basis - meaning members' pensions are based on the size of their final salaries and the number of years worked for the company. Companies underwrite the schemes, topping them up when investment returns are bad and stopping contributions when performance is good. Such a system would be suitable if people spent their whole working lives with a single company. But this is increasingly rare, as people move jobs to develop their careers, take periods out of work to bring up children, lose their jobs through redundancy, switch to part-time work or are forced into early retirement. And, unless people remain as full-time employees with a single company all their working lives, their pensions can be substantially reduced under final salary schemes. Democratic control of schemes by their members would lead to a more flexible and equitable way of determining the size of pensions, if only because employers would no longer be willing to underwrite schemes which they did not control. Instead of making variable contributions according to whether schemes were in surplus or deficit, companies would probably move to contributing fixed proportions of employees' salaries. As a result, pensions would be related to the size of individual contributions ' as is now the case with personal pension schemes ' rather than salaries. Such a move would give members greater freedom to tailor their pensions to suit their individual circumstances. For example, they would be able to vary contributions according to what they could afford at different periods in their lives and to stay in schemes if they moved jobs, were made redundant or took career breaks. Relating pensions to the size of contributions would also be fairer. Those who left companies before official retirement ages would no longer subsidise those who stayed the full course, in particular top executives whose pensions are sometimes artificially boosted by large salary increases immediately before retirement. A further advantage of transferring power to members would be to eliminate the conflict of interest between an employer's role as custodian of members' interests and its duty to promote shareholder value. Conflicts do not only exist in extreme cases such as the Maxwell fraud. The wide discretion companies possess over managing schemes ensures there are many legal ways of running schemes to enrich shareholders rather than the schemes' beneficiaries. Companies can, for example, claw back surpluses, use schemes to finance redundancy programmes or fail to increase pensions in line with inflation. Transferring power to members would not end all conflicts of interest. For example, those nearing retirement might prefer low-risk investment strategies to be adopted, while younger members might want riskier but potentially more rewarding approaches. But at least such conflicts, currently decided behind closed doors, would be debated openly in a more democratic system. Employers might even welcome a dilution of their control. Given that many are having to start making contributions again now that most pension fund surpluses have shrunk, companies might embrace the opportunity to limit their liabilities by moving to a system of fixed contrib-utions. But the pensions industry would resist transferring control of schemes to members. It would be quick to point out the uncertainties such a democratic revolution would introduce for employees. In particular, without employers underwriting schemes, pensions could be at the mercy of day-to-day stock market fluctuations. Employers' willingness to cushion the effect of market fluctuations is an attractive feature of the current system. But employers' fears that transferring control to members would expose them to huge risks are alarmist. There are many ways of hedging, insuring and pooling risks, while financial markets are continually adept at devising new ones. Strategies to limit risk would clearly not provide members with total protection in the event of extreme movements in financial markets. But it would be disingenuous to pretend that the current system provides members with copper-bottomed guarantees either, as Maxwell pensioners know only too well. In any case, the argument for democratic control of pension schemes ' as with democratic reform in any field ' is not that it would eliminate risk. It is rather that people should be free to decide for themselves how their pensions should be managed because they are ultimately the best judges of what is in their interests.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Marketing must develop a 'local feel' Growing differences in the performance of local economies should be reflected in the marketing strategies of businesses, the Henley Centre says. There remain opportunities to achieve economies of scale for businesses through 'pan-national' production, distribution and marketing. But the Henley Centre warns that important local differences in consumer behaviour have implications for companies marketing many types of goods and services. Some southern localities have high proportions of 'empty-nesters' - people with no dependants and little or no mortgage to pay. Many have large disposable incomes and are sitting on high levels of equity in their homes, and will be targets for the financial services industry. Areas with high levels of negative equity will be much less attractive markets for many businesses, such as credit-related companies that wish to minimise debt problems. Businesses locating retail outlets and leisure services need to identify the most promising areas if they are to maximise the return on their investment, the report says. The Henley Centre says that media products, retailing and leisure services are businesses that need a 'local feel' in marketing strategies. For financial services and retailers dependent on the housing market, successful marketing may require different product design and pricing approaches. Monitoring local performance can also help companies identify successful products and anticipate their decline. Areas of the fastest growth are usually first to buy new products and also the first markets to decline as products reach the end of their life-cycle.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Between 20, 21, and 22 January 1994, leaders of the  communist Vietnamese's puppets gathered 200 puppet soldiers of  the communist Vietnamese from Division 7, which is in charge of  defending Phnom Penh. Among the 200 soldiers were 80 Vietnamese  who acted as the spearhead. These 80 men are Cambodian-speaking  Vietnamese; some talk in Cambodian with an accent when  communicating with their colleagues on the battlefield. These  200 form the core of the troops in other divisions who have been  beaten, killed, or wounded on Route 68 east of Samraong and west  of Samraong battlefields, such as Division 11, 9, 3, the new  Division 7, and units from the 4th Military Region. All these  troops are under the command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long  Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, and a dozen other, so-called generals.    However, once again the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea, in cooperation with the people, have smashed their  offensive. In particular on 20 January, our national army  scored a direct hit against the frontline command post of the  communist Vietnamese's puppets with Long Sopheap and Prum Samen  as commanding generals. We killed 47 communist Vietnamese  puppets, whose bodies were left on the spot, and wounded some  others. We destroyed four armored vehicles, three tanks, six  military trucks, and a large quantity of military materiel.    Among those killed or wounded were Prum Samen, some  generals,  and many colonels and majors who were meeting and drinking  alcohol. Now Long Sopheap's position is being surrounded and  attacked by us; he is looking for a way to escape. The  remaining soldiers have been routed and have fled to the west of  Route 69.    In three days -- 20, 21, and 22 January -- troops of the  communist Vietnamese panicked and fled in units, in groups of 10  or 20 at a time, four or five groups a day. Only the special  units composed of Vietnamese soldiers speaking Cambodian with an  accent remain. Fifty percent of these special units have been  killed or wounded; they are either being killed or wounded, or  they are fleeing. These fleeing soldiers say that they are not  staying to fight; they are afraid of death because this is a  place of death. If the commanders want to fight, let them do the  fighting themselves.</p>

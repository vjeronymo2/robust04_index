			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOUR DE FRANCE;  </P> <P> LEMOND GAINS GROUND, BUT TEAMMATE HOLDS LEAD  </P> <P> Greg LeMond's strength in the mountains was evident in the 11th stage of the  Tour de France Wednesday, but most attention was focused on his Z teammate,  Ronan Pensec of France.  </P> <P> Pensec's surprising performance in the most difficult of the Tour's 21 stages  might be enough to lead him to his first championship.  </P> <P> LeMond finished second to Gianni Bugno of Italy in a dramatic sprint at the  summit of l'Alpe d'Huez. Both riders finished the 114-mile stage in 5 hours 37  minutes 51 seconds.  </P> <P> But Pensec, who became the race's overall leader Tuesday, lost only 48 seconds  to LeMond by finishing 10th.  </P> <P> Asked if such a finish will lead to victory, Pensec said: "Maybe. But there's  still the time trial tomorrow. After that we will see."  </P> <P> LeMond, who moved into third place overall, 9:04 behind Pensec, hoped to narrow  the deficit by much more.  </P> <P> Today's 21-mile individual time trial in the mountains from Fontaine to  Villard-de-Lans could determine LeMond's fate.  </P> <P> "If Pensec doesn't lose much time in the trial, then it will be too much for  LeMond to make up," said George Taylor, a New York cycling expert. "LeMond has  to wait until Pensec falls apart, which is very unlikely. Since both are on the  same team, LeMond would not be given the permission to attack on his own."  </P> <P> LeMond admitted his chances have been lessened.  </P> <P> "I was very surprised by Pensec," he said. "I didn't think he would be so  close. I will just be helping him win the Tour from now on. I'm the backup if  things go wrong."  </P> <P> LeMond launched into the final sprint and appeared to have it won until Bugno  counterattacked in the final yards.  </P> <P> LeMond, who hurt his wrist when he fell at a food station earlier in the day,  had difficulty preparing for the final sprint.  </P> <P> "I had trouble braking and I went wide around the final curve," said LeMond,  who won the Tour in 1986 and 1989. "That may have cost me the stage."  </P> <P> LeMond was leading when he almost went into a barrier going into the final  straightaway. Although he stayed ahead of Bugno for the moment, he lost  momentum and Bugno came on at the finish.  </P> <P> The hopes of one race favorite -- Raul Alcala of Mexico -- were dashed when he  lost 5:41 on the leaders to drop to eighth overall, 11:55 behind.  </P> <P> Pensec's closest challenger is Claudio Chiapucci of Italy, 1:28 behind.  </P> <P> Steve Bauer of Canada, Tour leader for the first 10 days, dropped to 32nd  overall, 22:18 back.  </P> <P> Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo., moved from 26th to ninth overall by finishing  seventh.  </P></p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Row over Egyptian veil decree Egypt's education minister has come under intense fire from Islamic conservatives and roused the country's religious authorities because of a decree aimed at limiting wearing of the veil among schoolgirls, Mark Nicholson reports from Cairo. Mr Hussein Kamel Bahaeddin issued a ruling last week that girls could wear the hair-covering veil, the mark of female Islamic piety, only if they presented a letter of permission from their parents. He said the move was to prevent 'extremist' teachers from imposing the wearing of the veil, or 'hejab'. He cited cases of girls being 'badly beaten' by teachers for not covering their hair. Mr Bahaeddin's action appeared to be part of a government campaign to counter what it fears to be the growing influence of radical Islam in Egypt's classrooms, within a wider attempt to limit the appeal and spread of Islamic militancy.

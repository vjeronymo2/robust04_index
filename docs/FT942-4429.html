			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong selling drives down computer issues Wall Street US stocks were mired in negative territory yesterday as a fresh upturn on the bond market turned sour and technology issues tumbled, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 6.46 easier at 3,749.45, having recovered somewhat from a 20-point deficit during the afternoon. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.15 at 457.06. New York SE volume was a moderate 256m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 1.74 at 440.75, but slumping computer stocks sent the Nasdaq composite down 9.51, or 1.3 per cent, to 729.79. It was yet another day without economic guidance from Washington, but remarks by three senior officials helped to fill the void. Earlier in the day, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said inflation was 'clearly restrained', a comment which brought moderate gains to the US Treasury market. In stocks, however, neither his pronouncement nor the response it elicited had much impact. But Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, created a minor stir. In Paris, he said trade sanctions against Japan remained an option for Washington, although the administration had no current plans to use them. His statement triggered a fresh decline in the value of the dollar against the yen, and coincided with a 10-point setback in the Dow industrials by 11am. But stocks worked their way back to just below their opening levels as the afternoon session commenced. Later, remarks by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City led to a late swoon in share prices. He said the US was nearing the point of 'full employment', an observation which reignited inflationary fears. A subsequent slide by bonds tripped computer-guided sell programs, but many equities fought back for a second time. Foodmaker was among the most active as a block of stock worth about 5 per cent of the fast-food operator was sold. Its share price dropped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 5 1/2 soon after the sale, which the company said may have been initiated by Tiger Management, a big institutional investor. Computer stocks were facing strong selling pressure. Their setback was linked to a warning by Merisel, a computer products wholesaler. It said its earnings outlook had been clouded by an expected slowdown in the US computer market. The stock plunged Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 10 on the announcement. Semiconductor issues were hit hard by the forecast. On the Big Board, Texas Instruments lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/4 . On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 76 1/4 . Compaq was garnering lots of unwelcome attention. The stock dropped a further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 , after shedding Dollars 1 1/4 in the previous session. IBM dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 3/4 and Apple shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 . Among the more widely held Nasdaq issues, Lotus fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 54, Microsoft receded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52 and Cyrix weakened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2 . Canada Toronto finished sharply lower in moderate trading after nervous investors had followed the lead of declining New York equities. The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 50.8 to 4,201.3 and falls led advances by 499 to 228. Volume came to 55.2m shares. The conglomerates group retreated 2.3 per cent. Venezuela A technical correction wiped out a part of the recent strong gains on the Caracas stock exchange, with the Merinvest composite index shedding 3.7 per cent to 146.99. The impact of the downturn was mixed, with benchmark Electricidad de Caracas down 6.00 bolivars, less than 2 per cent, at 406 bolivars, while steel company Sivensa and textile group Mantex, both of which had performed strongly on Tuesday, eased 8 bolivars and 3 bolivars to 57 bolivars and 30 bolivars respectively. Brokers attributed the falls to a technical adjustment following last week's rally. Volume was up from Tuesday's level, with some 2m shares changing hands in Electricidad de Caracas.</p>

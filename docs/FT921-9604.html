			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Deterioration in property market due to a hung parliament A HUNG parliament would result in a deterioration in the property market, according to a poll of banks and financial institutions, Vanessa Houlder writes. Many lenders also felt that a Labour government would impede recovery, according to the survey by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Thames Polytechnic. Of the lenders surveyed, 58 per cent expected the market to deteriorate if there was a hung parliament, 41 per cent thought that would be the case if there was a Labour victory and 4 per cent saw a deterioration under the Conservatives. The expected timing of a recovery was up to three years. Property Lending Survey 1992, Chesterton Financial Services, 54 Brook St, London W1A 2BU. Free.</p>

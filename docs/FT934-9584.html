			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Management: Here, there and everywhere - The lives of 3M's managers have been transformed by a Europe-wide reorganisation Until last Easter Claire-Noelle Bigay worked solely within France, as a national marketing executive for two lines of medical products from 3M, the US multinational which makes things as diverse as computer discs, video tape, road signs and Post-it notes. Now the 29-year-old Bigay spends more than a third of her time travelling outside France as one of six members of the new European 'core team' for one of those product lines, surgical tape. Her immediate colleagues are two Britons in the UK, a Dutch woman in Germany and a Belgian and an Italian both based in Brussels - the latter is the team 'co-ordinator'. They all communicate in English. Apart from dashing around France, where Bigay still spends two-thirds of her time, mostly in direct contact with local customers, the country she visits most is Germany, where she has a second European responsibility: transferring to her local German counterpart her product expertise. Her German is as fluent as her English. Bigay is one of about 1,000 managers at almost every level within 3M in Europe, many of them in their late 20s and 30s, whose lives have been transformed this year. As part of a radical reshaping of the company's European organisation, they have been given permanent and/or project responsibilities across national borders. The reorganisation, which took effect in January, has several unusual characteristics. These make it more far-reaching yet also more subtle than the ways in which most other multinationals are adapting themselves to the emergence of cross-border customers and distributors, the consequent need for faster European decision-making and other aspects of the slowly emerging 'single market'. Unlike other companies which have pulled back from their initial enthusiasm for spawning 'Euromanagers' able to operate with ease across national boundaries, 3M is breeding them like rabbits. This is in character with the internationalism of its top management. 'For a US company, 3M has done a remarkable amount since the 1970s to make international experience a key to top careers,' says Christopher Bartlett, an Australian-born professor at the Harvard Business School. Bartlett's writings with Insead's Sumantra Ghoshal on 'transnational' organisations had a direct influence on the shape of 3M's new European structure. The reorganisation consists of two main steps. 3M has taken them together, whereas most other companies have done so in sequence, sometimes over a decade. First, in the interests of greater cross-border effectiveness and faster decision-making, 3M has shifted most strategic and operational responsibility away from its national subsidiaries (the geographic side of its organisation), and centralised it in the hands of 19 product divisions, each with Europe-wide responsibility. It calls these European 'Business Centres' to distinguish them from their counterpart 'groups' and 'divisions' in the US. But each European and American entity reports to the same global boss - all but one of them based in the US. Second, the residual geographic responsibilities - now confined primarily to support services such as staff development, logistics, information technology and finance - have been shifted from the smaller countries to several of 10 new European 'regions'. Three cover France, Germany and Italy, but the Nordic, Iberian and central European countries are now combined, as are the UK and Ireland. Unlike many other companies which have made such a change, 3M has given the regional heads equal rank to the EBC managing directors. It is also retaining full-time country managers in most countries. The purpose is to ensure that 3M's geographic managers not only represent the company in their local communities but - a point 3M stresses - they retain enough persuasive power with the EBCs to ensure that these continue to be responsive to national differences. The risk for any type of Euro-organisation is that it will lose touch with local customers. As Livio DeSimone, 3M's Italian-American chairman and chief executive, says: 'You need the right blend of global direction and local responsiveness.' Thanks to a lengthy period of cross-border consensus-building since 1982, the change has been accomplished remarkably quickly. 3M originally planned to create the EBCs gradually over three or five years. But because of the enthusiasm of the EBC heads and their wish to secure the best possible teams and minimise the insecurity of less senior staff, it was completed in only 14 months. Many companies lay false claim to the fashionable 'transnational' label when almost all their international divisions are still based in the same country. But 3M has spread its EBCs across five: Belgium (where its long-standing European head office is based), Britain, France, Germany and Italy. This principle of dispersal has also been applied within many EBCs, and inside the 33 smaller European Business Units beneath them, by locating the members of each management team not all on one site, but across Europe. Thus the tapes and adhesives EBC is based in Belgium under a Frenchman, with two of his four immediate subordinates located in France and Germany. This arrangement has minimised the need for costly and disruptive staff relocations across Europe. Doug Hanson, 3M's vice-president for Europe, says that fewer than 40 managers have had to relocate. The intention was always to distribute the EBCs around Europe, in order to use 3M's existing sites and resources. But he says: 'We originally thought we wanted everyone within an EBC located together.' That would have involved massive relocation. 'After discussion, we decided that with modern communications and people's wish to stay in their home country, this wasn't necessary.' The location of each EBC and its constituent business units was decided on the basis of 'where it made most sense', insists Hanson, rather than through internal political wrangling or even-handed 'corporate citizenship' towards each main country. This is less implausible than it sounds, since 3M already had a reasonably balanced pattern of sites across Europe, including production bases for the whole region designated in the 1960s. 'Where we had a big manufacturing site, we located the EBC there,' says Harry Hammerly, Hanson's boss, who now oversees all international operations and corporate services from 3M's headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota. Thus chemicals went to Antwerp, printing products to Italy, traffic signs and safety products to Brussels and computer discs to France. 'We were very careful not to locate an EBC in a country because the right leader for it was of that nationality,' Hammerly adds. EBCs in several countries are run by people of other nationalities, including a Briton in Germany, an Italian in France and a German in Italy. The main exception to this pattern was with abrasives, where Hanson says the relative size of existing operations made the EBC's location 'a toss-up' between France, Germany and the UK - which won, under the best man for the job, a Briton. But 'he has been careful not to select Brits to shore himself up', says Hanson. Two of the three business units beneath the abrasives boss are outside the UK, in France and Germany. As Hanson says, this type of 'network', is by definition 'less tidy and controllable than traditional forms of organisation'. It also requires new approaches to co-operation and teamwork. A second article will examine how 3M managers are adapting to the new organisation.</p>

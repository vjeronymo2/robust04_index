			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC OFFICIAL RESISTANCE;  </P> <P> RANK 'N' ROLL;  </P> <P> THE BAND TAKES ITS NAME FROM ONE IN A SALVADORAN VILLAGE THAT PLAYED ON AS THE  ARTILLERY SHELLS CAME IN.  </P> <P> How many bands can you name in which every player has a military rank? Heavy on  the brass, all four of the members of Santa Barbara's Official Resistance are  officers. Colonel Vince Dirt is the singer, Colonel Doug Gutner is the guitar  player, Major J.D. Aster plays bass while Captain Bart Tompkins beats out that  rhythm on the drums. This group is prepared to be the official soundtrack for  our boys in the desert.  </P> <P> "It's not really a military thing, but more a brotherhood thing," said Dirt in  a recent interview. "They're just nicknames."  </P> <P> A good deal of rock 'n' roll success has to do with "the look." Talent is fine,  but that's incidental. Elvis invented "the look." Poison and a zillion of those  metal bands have "the look." Milli Vanilli had "the look," if little else.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara's hard-rocking quartet, Official Resistance, has not only "the  look" but also the attitude. Swaggering frontman Dirt has lots of tattoos and  often strips down to the waist and gives his impression of The Illustrated Man.  Gutner, on guitar, also strips to the waist, becoming the blond guitar god. And  by the time half the first song is over, five or six young, single females are  usually dancing in front of the stage -- a sure sign of rock 'n' roll success.  </P> <P> Official Resistance? What's there to resist in Santa Barbara? Is your espresso  cold? Is the weather too perfect?  </P> <P> "We're resisting anything worth resisting," Dirt said, "especially  unintelligence. We got the name from this PBS special on El Salvador. Anyway,  there was this band called Official Resistance in this Salvadoran village  playing away while the village was being shelled -- like everything was blowing  up everywhere -- but the band just kept on playing. We just took the name."  </P> <P> The band has been around since 1988 and plays several times per month at the  usual locations in Ventura and Santa Barbara. Its tape, "Resist This!," is  selling well, and its second tape should be ready next month.  </P> <P> "We play in Santa Barbara at Felix's, Joseppi's, Zelo's, the Carnaval Club,  both Alex's and in Ventura at Charlie's and Club Soda," Dirt said. "We are one  of only about 10 local bands that play more than twice a month."  </P> <P> Three-fourths of the band is made up of Santa Barbara locals. Gutner grew up in  Venezuela, where his parents worked for the embassy.  </P> <P> "I went to Dos Pueblos High School with J.D.," Dirt said. "After high school,  J.D. went back to Boston to study drama, while I just hung out in Santa  Barbara. When he came back, we hooked up, then we met Doug at a party and  started playing as the Larva. Then we put an ad in the paper for a drummer.  Bart was the 13th drummer to try out and he got the job. We've been Official  Resistance since September, 1988."  </P> <P> Official Resistance is a hard rock band with no R.E.M. or Kenny Loggins covers.  They have 35 or 40 original songs, most fast and loud. The covers they perform  are of the hard-edged variety by artists such as the Stones, Iggy Pop and U2.  "Our music is just basic rock 'n' roll music," Dirt said.  </P> <P> Not a scooby-doo/the sky is blue/I love you band, Official Resistance writes  real lyrics about the Big Issues -- ignorance, the mistreatment of old people,  democracy in Central America, drug abuse, complacency, things like that. The  band has played benefits in Santa Barbara for Salvadoran relief funds, animal  rights, voter registration and Toys for Tots, not to mention an acoustic set at  a retirement home.  </P> <P> "The voter registration show was pretty bizarre," Dirt said. "We were playing  on the steps of the courthouse, and Lagomarsino was hanging out in front of our  giant Official Resistance banner. It would've been a great picture. I think we  were the only ones there who were registered to vote."  </P> <P> The band has the traditional goals in mind: more gigs, more money, and of  course, the big-label deal. "We'd just like to reach more people and try to do  some moral good in the world. . . . But it's tough -- there's a lot of apathy  out there. It's only entertainment, and we're just a rock 'n' roll band."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> Official Resistance will perform at 9 p.m. Tuesday at Alex's Cantina, 633 State  St., Santa Barbara, For more information, call 966-0032.  </P></p>

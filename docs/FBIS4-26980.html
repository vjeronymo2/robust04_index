			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Legislators are  examining a draft arbitration law designed to facilitate the  settlement of economic disputes.    The draft was submitted to the eighth session of the eighth  npc standing committee for deliberation today.    It provides for a new system under which arbitration and  administrative organs shall function separately and arbitration  be undertaken on a voluntary basis.    The parties in a dispute may seek a settlement either from  an  arbitration office or a court, but shall not resort to both  simultaneously. The ruling passed by the first round of  arbitration shall be final.    Chairman Gu Rangran of the NPC Standing Committee's  Legislative Affairs Committee explained that the draft law  applies to contract and other economic disputes, not to civil  disputes normally handled by administrative organs, such as  marriage, inheritance or adoption disputes.    Gu added that there will be legislation specially for  settling labor disputes, which are different from other types of  economic disputes.    The existing system calls for submitting an arbitration  decision to the higher arbitration authorities or a court for  examination before it becomes final.    After the draft becomes law, he said, this practice will be  abolished. In its place will be a new system under which an  arbitration decision is passed either by an arbitration office  or by a court.    The agreement reached between the parties through the first  round of arbitration is final, and the court will reject any  lawsuit from any party should disagreements arise on the  agreement.    The rule applies to arbitration rulings as well. Once such a  ruling is passed, appeals for a re-examination by either an  arbitration office or a court will be rejected.    The principle of voluntary arbitration means that an  arbitration agreement shall be reached out of the free will of  the parties involved, and that the parties shall negotiate to  decide where to have their dispute settled and by what  arbitrator.    Under the draft law, arbitration offices are independent  legal bodies, not affiliated to any administrative organ.  Arbitration offices throughout the country shall have the same  status.    That means there will be no "higher" or "lower" arbitration  offices, nor will there be a division of labor between  arbitration offices according to the division of administrative  regions.    Courts do not interfere with the work of the arbitration  offices, but exercises a sort of supervision either by refusing  to have an arbitration ruling executed or by cancelling the  ruling.    According to Gu, the drafting of the law began in August  1991.</p>

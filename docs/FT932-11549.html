			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Asian bank caught in capital squeeze A YEAR ago in Hong Kong, Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, president of the Asian Development Bank, called on member countries to double the bank's capital as an 'urgent priority' to some Dollars 48bn (Pounds 31bn). He pleaded with members, particularly the recalcitrant US, to agree to the capital increase by the end of 1992. His pleas went unheeded. This year he will be making the same request with even greater fervour at the ADB annual meeting starting in Manila today. If the ADB's 52 members fail to reach agreement by the end of this year  - a conclusion at the meeting this week is considered highly unlikely - new lending could be sharply reduced some time in 1994 and limited to the amount of loan repayments trickling back to the ADB. The bank borrows money on international markets against its subscribed capital of Dollars 23bn to finance projects in the poorer member countries, and would find it easy to borrow more. But its own rules do not allow it to commit itself to lending more than the sum of its subscribed capital and reserves, currently about Dollars 27bn; it has outstanding loan commitments of more than Dollars 23bn already. Last year the ADB lent nearly Dollars 4bn, excluding soft loans which are administered separately, and faces increased demand for financing from China, India and other borrowing members, not to mention the six Asian republics of the former Soviet Union which are expected to join soon. 'We are now bank to half the world, population-wise, and it also happens that the two largest countries in the world started borrowing from us comparatively recently,' said one senior ADB official yesterday. India and China both began borrowing from the ADB in the second half of the 1980s and together account for 28 per cent of total loans. Indonesia has taken another 33 per cent. One problem facing the ADB is that the previous US administration of Mr George Bush adopted a hard line in negotiations with other ADB shareholders  -demanding that the bank make policy changes and lend more to the private sector - while President Clinton's new team is incomplete and has yet to make its views clear on the proposed capital increase for the five years to 1998. The US and Japan are the ADB's two largest shareholders, with about 16 per cent each, but the actual amount that Washington would have to pay if the subscribed capital was doubled would only be of the order of Dollars 200m, spread over the five years. This is because as little as 3 per cent of the new capital is likely to be paid in. The rest would be 'callable' in an emergency, and so far no multilateral financial institution has ever had to use its callable capital. The US administration, however, would be obliged to mention the daunting contingent liability sum when it seeks to appropriate funds through Congress.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Malik-Noor stays on Regina board Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor yesterday re-emerged as King bee at Regina, the royal jelly company, following a long and acrimonious meeting where accusations were traded between the former chairman and the current board. The board spent up to Pounds 75,000 attempting to repel Mr Malik-Noor's attempts to return to the leaking corporate ship, but he won support from 53 cent of shares voted. Mr Malik-Noor also secured the appointment of two associates, Mr Guy Neely and Mr Cecil Phillips, as non-executive directors, on a similar level of votes. Mr Malik-Noor, the largest shareholder, claimed 40 per cent support from the start. The rift between Mr Malik-Noor and the current board allegedly started over pay. Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance director, lost ground in their attempts to discredit Mr Malik-Noor, due to their attempts to push through significant pay rises and bonuses despite Regina's losses. Mr Malik-Noor was criticised for costs he imposed on the company, including the services of Maj Ron Ferguson, father of the Duchess of York, for the Regina-sponsored World Polo championships. Mr Malik-Noor is reinstated as a non-executive director. He is proposing an extraordinary meeting for May 19 to remove Mr Geoghegan and Mr Shakesby from the board. It is unclear what he has reinherited. At yesterday's meeting, Mr Shakesby admitted that in 1991, when Mr Malik-Noor provided Pounds 1.5m in debt and equity funding, approaches to several banks for outside finance were unsuccessful. The sums injected by Mr Malik-Noor have been absorbed by the company's losses in the intervening period. With negative shareholders funds and no sign of a turnround Regina is no glittering prize. However, three groups of individuals still wanted control. Ms Irene Stein, the founder who was ousted in a coup in 1989, said at yesterday's meeting that she had 'what it takes to make this company work'. Mr Geoghegan also stated that if he survived the battle, he intended to take a significant stake in Regina. The list of royal jelly users includes Ms Barbara Cartland and Millwall football team, but Mr Malik-Noor is hoping that profits will come from its push into east Asia.</p>

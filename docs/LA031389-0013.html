			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS BILLS  </P> <P> The eight-bill ethics package jointly proposed by the Fair Political Practices  Commission and Ted Lempert, the young Democratic assemblyman from San Mateo  (Part I, Feb. 23), is a welcome reform plan that Southern Californians should  endorse. The FPPC figures on gifts and honorariums collected by the Legislature  are overwhelming -- $3.2 million worth of gifts and honorariums for 120  legislators in just three years -- and only underscore the importance of the  ethics bills Lempert and the FPPC are trying to enact.  </P> <P> It is not surprising that the California Legislature, awash in all this  special-interest money, has such a hard time addressing the state's pressing  concerns. What is amazing is that we've had to wait this long for someone like  Lempert to raise the banner of reform. Is the answer young blood?  </P> <P> NANCY L. PERLOFF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

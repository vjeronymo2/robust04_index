			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Non-executive director The appointment of Sir Ewen Fergusson, Britain's ambassador to France until last year, to the board of British Telecom as a non-executive director, is more than just another lucrative pension for a retired senior diplomat. High on the list of BT's current ambitions is to break into the closed world of Europe's state-owned posts and telecommunications monopolies. Britain has long been banging on the Brussels door to get the liberalisation process moving. This week it appears to have got a commitment that most of the Community's telephone calls will be open to competition by 1998. So BT will soon need all the 'gen' it can get on the European scene, not least in France, where neither the government nor the telecoms monopoly is likely to put on much of a welcoming party for the British.</p>

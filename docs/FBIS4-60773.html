			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga May 1 TASS -- "Russian President Boris Yeltsin  might visit Latvia, the time of the visit will be agreed upon,"  said Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, addressing a news  conference devoted to the results of his visit to Moscow.  Gulmanis highly assessed the results of his visit, saying that  the Present Russian leadership conducts a favorable policy  towards Latvia.    On Saturday, Russian president Boris Yeltsin said in the  Kremlin after signing Russo-Latvian documents that a package of  bilateral agreements is expected to be signed during Viktor  Chernomyrdin's visit to Latvia.    During the talks between Russian and Latvian officials held  at the top level, the sides signed an agreement on the order of  withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian territory, an  agreement on legal status of the Russian radar station in  Scrunda, an agreement on social welfare for Russian servicemen  and their families and retired servicemen on the Latvian  territory.    Participants in the news conference held today and attended  by Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs pointed out that the  talks in the Kremlin were held an a cordial and frank  atmosphere. "When the dialogue began, we dropped all  apprehensions about possible pressure from Russia. The dialogue  was held in a free, easy and democratic form," Ulmanis said.    Dwelling on the main subject of the Moscow talks, Ulmanis  pointed out that "after Grachev said that Russia intends to  withdraw its troops much earlier than August 31, I became sure  that the Russian army would go soon." " We shall be able to step  up the process rather than merely monitor it as it was before"  Ulmanis said. "If we manage to lay a foundation to mutual  confidence on the basis of the signed documents, the relations  between the two countries will soon enter a new historic stage,"  the Latvian president said.    A similar opinion was expressed by Valdis Birkavs, who  emphasised that Latvia needs " long-term, advantageous economic  ties with Russia." Therefore, Birkavs said that an agreement on  granting Latvia a most-favoured nation status in trade with  Russia is one of the most important achievements of the visit.    Before the visit to Moscow began, Ulmanis, in an interview  with ITAR-TASS, welcomed the development of mutually  advantageous ties with Russia. He pointed out that not only "a  window to Europe", but "doors" must be left open through Baltic  ports. The sincerity of the Latvian president arises no doubt,  since thanks to his energetic efforts a Russo-Latvian conflict  over the arrest of two Russian generals was prevented.  According to the Latvian president, this incident "made the  Latvian leadership look at itself from a critical point of view."    During the Moscow meeting the Russian and Latvian presidents  showed tact and respect for each other. The Russian side took  into account the Latvian president's request to return to Latvia  the remains of the former Latvian President Karlis Ulmanis who  was interned by the Stalinist regime in the 1940s and buried in  former Soviet Turkmenistan. The now Latvian president is a  grand nephew of Karlis Ulmanis and he believes that his destiny  is to establish peace and accord in society.    Ulmanis is the fifth consecutive Latvian president and the  first president after Latvia regained its independence. He is  married and has two children. He enjoys great popularity as a  politician and invariably ranks first in popularity in public  opinion polls.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BATTLING FOR A BOULEVARD'S SOUL;  </P> <P> MINI-BOOM: A FAMILIAR LAND-USE FIGHT IS BEING WAGED BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS  DEFENDING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEVELOPERS DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE  CITYSCAPE.  </P> <P> A burst of towering steel, marble and smoked glass is rising along Sepulveda  Boulevard in Van Nuys, quickly transforming the broad thoroughfare from a  hodgepodge commercial and industrial district into a slick business center.  </P> <P> The two-mile-long mini-boom includes more than 1.5 million square feet of  office and commercial space either under construction or on the drawing board.  And it has been hailed and decried -- depending on one's perspective -- as a  new northern tributary of the San Fernando Valley's glitzy Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> "It's perfectly located, it's right on top of the San Diego Freeway, near  Sherman Oaks, Encino and the Galleria," said John Battle, executive vice  president of Beitler Commercial Realty Services, echoing the enthusiasm of  other business leaders and developers. "It's a good alternative to Ventura  Boulevard."  </P> <P> But Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., countered: "We  don't want Sepulveda to turn into another Ventura Boulevard. We don't want the  traffic, the high density. The community can't handle it all."  </P> <P> The disparate views have provoked a familiar land-use battle in which  homeowners, intent on preserving the quality of life in their communities by  limiting growth, are pitted against developers, determined to change the  cityscape in the name of progress.  </P> <P> In one case, the developer of the largest project is negotiating with a group  of Van Nuys homeowners demanding traffic and aesthetic improvements to relieve  the impact of the sprawling seven-building development proposed for their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Other homeowner groups are voicing broader and stronger objections to the  growth along Sepulveda, especially between Ventura and Victory boulevards.  </P> <P> A cadre of homeowner associations in Van Nuys, Reseda and Encino are calling on  Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, to initiate an immediate  building moratorium until a detailed, long-term planning strategy for the  boulevard can be drafted. But Braude is not prepared to delve into such a plan  at this time.  </P> <P> The conflict over the future of Sepulveda Boulevard is the latest example in  the Valley of how community plans -- legal documents that guide future  development drafted by the Los Angeles Planning Department in the early and  mid-1970s -- can be sorely out of touch with the rapidly changing and diverse  interests of a community.  </P> <P> For instance, the Van Nuys-North Sherman Oaks Community Plan, which includes  Sepulveda Boulevard, allows for industrial uses such as metal manufacturing and  auto reconditioning and storage yards along a half-mile swath centered on  Oxnard Street. The industrially designated parcels are directly across the  street from single-family homes in some blocks.  </P> <P> It is the industrially zoned plots that have become the prime sites for the  intense office development. City zoning laws permit such construction in most  industrial zones because it is considered to be less intrusive development.  Homeowners contend that industrial zoning is an obsolete land-use designation  for the heart of the Valley and complain that controls to regulate commercial  development in those zones are weak.  </P> <P> Apartment and office buildings along Sepulveda can rise as high as six stories  in some areas and are limited to three stories in others. Such buildings may be  small by Ventura Boulevard standards, but Sepulveda has become increasingly  attractive to developers for a number of other reasons.  </P> <P> Developers have turned northward in the past two years as building restrictions  have tightened on prestigious -- and more expensive -- Ventura Boulevard. After  more than three years of often bitter debate, a detailed zoning blueprint along  Ventura, called a specific plan, is headed for city council review next fall.  Among other items, the plan limits commercial construction to an additional 8.6  million square feet.  </P> <P> Land prices along Sepulveda generally run between $35 and $50 a square foot,  about half the $100 per square foot commanded on Ventura Boulevard, according  to developers and real estate agents.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons Sepulveda is taking off is because all the other prime  corridors in the Valley are shutting down as a result of specific plans or  expensive land," said Larry J. Kosmont, president of Kosmont and Associates in  Burbank, a real estate and development consulting firm.  </P> <P> "It's logical and makes clear sense for developers to turn to Sepulveda. It's a  major artery, a wide street and there is no specific plan," Kosmont said. "It's  what I call 'a developer no-brainer.' "  </P> <P> The danger, however, Kosmont and others said, is that without stricter controls  and long-term planning along the Sepulveda corridor, the cumulative impact of  each project will create a traffic nightmare even worse than the current  peak-hour crisis.  </P> <P> Already six Sepulveda intersections -- nearly every major cross street between  Victory and Ventura boulevards -- are rated "F" by the city Department of  Transportation because of severe traffic.  </P> <P> The congestion and development troubles on Sepulveda could get worse if the  $1.3-billion Valley Metro Rail extension is built. The proposed line, approved  in March by county transit officials, would extend from North Hollywood to Van  Nuys and is slated to end at ground level roughly at the site of the Sepulveda  Drive-In Theater, between Erwin and Oxnard streets.  </P> <P> The theater land is also the site of the largest project to be proposed to date  along Sepulveda, a cluster of seven mid-rise office buildings -- dubbed the  "Sepulveda Concourse" -- that could bring about 750,000 square feet of office  space to the boulevard.  </P> <P> "There is an urgent need for a specific plan to deal with development that is  hemorrhaging onto Sepulveda Boulevard," said Gerald Silver, president of  Homeowners of Encino, who also called for immediate building controls while  long-term plans are drafted. "If we don't, we will wind up with the kind of  problems we now have on Ventura."  </P> <P> Braude believes that imposing a building moratorium along Sepulveda would be  premature because recent rezoning throughout Van Nuys reduced allowable  densities in some areas and placed height limits along Sepulveda Boulevard,  said Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief planning deputy.  </P> <P> "Right now we are concentrating on Ventura Boulevard. If we succeed in getting  that through council we would like to look elsewhere," Miscikowski said.  </P> <P> Further distracting city planners and some community leaders is the preparation  of a specific plan for Van Nuys Boulevard, the neglected cousin of Sepulveda  and Ventura. That plan, which calls for revitalizing Van Nuys Boulevard into a  modern business and administrative center, is nearing completion.  </P> <P> "Clearly, we can't throw too much into the hopper," Miscikowski said.  </P> <P> Braude is also satisfied that city policy calling for environmental reviews of  major projects will enable him to examine the impact of pending developments  along Sepulveda Boulevard whether or not there is a moratorium.  </P> <P> "Projects are not just given a green light," Miscikowski said. "The  environmental review gives us the ability to look at the project and enables us  to better serve the needs of the community."  </P> <P> Homeowners contend that the cumulative impact of these projects has not been  assessed by city planners and the mini-boom is creating a regional business  center.  </P> <P> At least six major office complexes and retail centers have been recently  completed, are under construction or on the drawing board along the Sepulveda  corridor in Van Nuys, according to city building records.  </P> <P> The largest project under construction is the six-story, 146,000-square-foot  Tri Center Plaza being built by Woodland Hills-based Saunders Development Corp.  on the southeast corner of Oxnard Street and Sepulveda.  </P> <P> But the development that has ignited the most community concern is the  Sepulveda Concourse, which will be developed by National Prudential Inc. of  Century City. The project covers more than 12 acres and plans show that it  would include seven four- to six-story buildings and two parking garages with  2,609 spaces.  </P> <P> Robert J. Abernethy, a former Los Angeles planning commissioner, is a partner  in the development.  </P> <P> Because the site is zoned for industrial uses, the developer does not need a  zoning change to build offices and must only seek approval from the Building  and Safety Department and the Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> A traffic study contracted by a consultant hired by the developer showed that  the project would attract about 3,800 cars a day. The additional traffic along  the boulevard could be mitigated if the developer made several street  improvements, including traffic signal synchronization, the study stated.  </P> <P> "It may not mean that traffic gets better, but as a result of our project it  will not get worse," said George J. Mihlsten, an attorney for the developer.  </P> <P> On March 13, the two city agencies approved the project, declaring that it  would have no significant impact on traffic or the surrounding area. After a  public comment period the developer would be clear to take out building  permits.  </P> <P> The public notice that the project would have no negative impact on the  environment caught the eye of a Van Nuys homeowner. The scramble began.  Homeowners petitioned for and were granted an extension to review and raise  concerns about the agencies' positive declaration. Braude intervened and called  for more detailed environmental reviews.  </P> <P> Last month Abernethy asked city building officials to put the project on hold  to allow the developer to meet with the community, particularly representatives  of the 189-home neighborhood adjacent to the project.  </P> <P> Residents want the project scaled back to two-story buildings and would like  brick and wood building materials instead of glass and steel. They want lush  landscaping to screen the development and traffic controls to prohibit  shortcutting through their quiet streets.  </P> <P> "We are going to put together some responses and we will continue our dialogue  with the community," Mihlsten said. "We will try and come up with a series of  protection measures." But the developer has not formally responded to requests  from neighborhood representatives.  </P> <P> Representatives from other groups said the Concourse project, which they are  pleased to have caught before it was too late, is a prime example of the  immediate need for tougher building controls along Sepulveda. They said they  will begin a petition drive to urge Braude to call for further studies.  </P> <P> "We don't want to be a day late and a dollar short," said Rob Glushon,  president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "I don't want to say it's too  late now, but a lot of damage has already been done."  </P></p>

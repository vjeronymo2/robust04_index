			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: Television An astonishing 2 per cent of Americans - that is three times the population of Birmingham - claim to have been abducted by aliens, and they can't all be mad. Psychologist Susan Blackmore investigates them for Horizon (Monday 8.00-8.50pm, BBC2) and finds enough similarity between their accounts of being taken away by little grey men to intrigue her - and us. Is it a variation of false memory syndrome, or is there a more obvious physical cause? The programme takes the matter seriously and thus raises a few unintentional laughs, but remains completely absorbing. Channel Tunnel investors may well be chuckling tonight as Panorama (9.30-10.10pm, BBC1) asks if there is an inherrent flaw in roll-on, roll-off ferries. When The Estonia went down in the Baltic sea, it was the second major disaster involving such vessels in seven years. In both cases large numbers of lives were lost. Are warnings being ignored? Is cost a more pressing consideration than safety at sea? Matthew Parris sets out to puncture PR puffery. In Bad Ideas Of the Twentieth Century (Tuesday 9.00-9.45, C4), the former MP argues that whether directed towards good or bad ends, PR always ends up sullying the individuals concerned. High Interest (Sunday 5.10-6.00pm C4) lives up to its title with a frank profile of George Soros, the financier whose dealings contributed to Britain's exit from the ERM. Soros has annual earnings as high as Sainsbury's profits, but gives half of them to charity, not all of which is gratefully received. He talks about his strategy, his losses and his do-gooding with disarming honesty. Kruschev was as subtle a strategist as the Red Queen and her impulsive beheadings. Timewatch (Sunday, 9.00-10.00pm, BBC2) reveals how he would take a revolver with him to meetings in case argument didn't work. The man was so feared that Brezhnev, after giving orders to have him killed, lost his nerve and sobbed. This fascinating profile, which traces Krushchev's rise from peasent to potentate, has some extraordinary stories, including the blackly comic one of how Stalin's body was removed from its place next to Lenin's in the dead of night.</p>

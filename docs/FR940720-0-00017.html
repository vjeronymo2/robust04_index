			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This distribution results in an additional charge (surcharge) of approximately $273,000 per operating power reactor; $55,770 for each HEU, LEU, UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and each other fuel facility license; $1,670 for each materials license in a category that generates a significant amount of low level waste; and $170 for other materials licenses. When added to the base annual fee of approximately $2.8 million per reactor, this will result in an annual fee of approximately $3.1 million per operating power reactor. The total fuel facility annual fee will be between approximately $1.2 million and $3.2 million. The total annual fee for materials licenses will vary depending on the fee category(ies) assigned to the license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional charges not directly or solely attributable to a specific class of NRC licensees and costs not recovered from all NRC licensees on the basis of previous Commission policy decisions will be recovered from the designated classes of licensees previously identified. A further discussion and breakdown of the specific costs by major classes of licensees are shown in section IV of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following analysis of those sections that are affected under this final rule provides additional explanatory information. All references are to title 10, chapter I, Code of Federal Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Part 170  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 170.3&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is amended to revise the definition of special projects. This change is based on NRC's experience during the past three years in implementing the 100 percent fee recovery program and the fee policy review required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The NRC believes that the costs for some requests or reports being filed with NRC are more appropriately captured in the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees instead of assessing specific fees under 10 CFR part 170. Therefore, the definition in &sect;170.3, as well as the footnotes in &sect;&sect;170.21 and 170.31, are amended to indicate that 10 CFR part 170 fees will not be assessed for requests/reports which have been submitted to the NRC:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter, or does not involve an unreviewed safety issue;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety, safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist the NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement, generic letter, or bulletin; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting generic regulatory improvements or efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The terms ``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'', and ``unreviewed safety issue'' as used in item 1 are further explained as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Alternate method'' is a method that deviates significantly (i.e., more than necessary for plant-specific or generic program development) from the method proposed in the Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Reanalysis'' is an analysis of an alternate method but not a review of changes to a method which is consistent with that proposed by the Generic Letter or Bulletin. These types of ``consistent'' changes could be revisions submitted pursuant to an NRC staff request for additional information or modification, or changes necessary for plant-specific or generic implementation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Unreviewed safety issue'' is a safety issue unrelated to the safety issue identified in the generic communication that arises from proposal of an alternate method and will require reanalysis by the NRC staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 170.11&blank;Exemptions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(9) of this section is established to provide an exemption from fees for State-owned research reactors that meet certain technical design criteria and are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes. Currently, Federal agencies are exempt from payment of 10 CFR part 170 fees under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA). The proposed rule would have amended only 10 CFR part 171. The NRC believes however, that this change to 10 CFR part 170 is consistent with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from fees if they meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes. There is currently one research reactor, owned by the Rhode Island Atomic Energy Commission, that will be exempt under this amendment to &sect;170.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

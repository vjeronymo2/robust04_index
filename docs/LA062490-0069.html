			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO KEEP HEAT ON;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM WAS WINNING WAR ON CRIME IN JEFFREY-LYNNE -- NOW IS NO TIME TO RETREAT  </P> <P> A six-month pilot program to step up law enforcement in Anaheim's troubled  Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood -- known by its residents as "Tijuanita," or Little  Tijuana -- ended this spring. Some say that the concentrated foot patrols and  mobile units made a lasting difference.  </P> <P> Others fear that the old criminal activity, which had dipped during the pilot  project, is creeping back.  </P> <P> The problem is that Anaheim says it can't afford to keep up the special level  of policing in one area. It's reassigning the unit of five officers to target  10 neighborhoods that have high crime rates, including Jeffrey-Lynne. But the  success of the Jeffrey-Lynne project makes it clear just how valuable such a  concentration of effort was for the community. At the risk of losing all  progress, there's really no turning back. There may be some middle ground  possible -- say, fewer officers than before but better organized and trained  neighborhood watch groups to work with police.  </P> <P> Jeffrey-Lynne -- a five-square-block area near the Disneyland Hotel -- was  chosen for the pilot program because it's one of Anaheim's worst crime and  poverty pockets. Families were crowded into run-down apartments amid  drug-dealing, prostitution and other criminal activity.  </P> <P> The community policing unit put residents, many of whom were without telephones  or were afraid, within easy reach of police help. At the same time the policing  program was launched, the city boosted other services. Building inspectors  found 5,000 code violations and ordered landlords to make repairs. A social  services office was opened.  </P> <P> As a result of the city's effort, residents felt safer. A police officer  driving through in a patrol car reported that people waved, a sign residents  who were once suspicious of police now welcome them.  </P> <P> It's also a sign for the city. It should find a way to continue its successful  community policing program in Jeffrey-Lynne.  </P></p>

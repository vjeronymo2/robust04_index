			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Banesto group drops to Pta2.8bn CORPORACION Banesto, the holding company for the industrial assets owned by Banesto, the large Spanish bank, suffered a fall in first-half profits to Pta2.8bn (Dollars 31m) from Pta19bn in the corresponding period last year. The result in 1991 was lifted by income of Pta12.8bn from extraordinary items, most from the sale of its oil refining and distribution subsidiary to BP. Extraordinary income in the 1992 first half was Pta2.8bn. Analysts said this year's first-half figures indicated a strong second quarter by Corporacion Banesto. In the first quarter it lost Pta4.6bn. They suggested that Corporacion Banesto could be close to achieving its 1991 net profit of Pta4.5bn. Banco Central Hispano, Spain's biggest banking group, raised its consolidated first-half group profits by 9.1 per cent to Pta36.4bn. Profits from trading were down 6.7 per cent to Pta66.5bn but income from extraordinary items rose 47 per cent to Pta31.4bn.</p>

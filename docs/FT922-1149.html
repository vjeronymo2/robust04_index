			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (8): Weaker firms under pressure - Brokers have reduced commissions as business wanes SPAIN'S BROKING houses have received a double punch. The bolsa is decidedly bearish, and as the cake gets smaller they are going to make earn even less than before from whatever business comes their way, writes Tom Burns. At the begining of this year, fixed commissions that stood at 0.25 per cent of all market transactions were abolished. The price liberalisation was one of the final moves in the overhaul of the Spanish markets that commenced in the late 1980s, and it could not have come at a worse time for the brokers. In the battle to obtain the diminishing business, the broking houses have reduced commissions by half to 0.12 per cent on major orders, and to even less for the really big ones. BBV Interactivos, the largest of the broking houses and owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, estimates that the commissions war could lower earnings on arbitrage for the sector this year by up to 40 per cent. This is good news for firms such as Carnegie Espana, which are not members of the stockmarket. 'The market is overbroked and we have a lot of bargaining power to barter down the prices,' says Mr Diego Prado, one of Carnegie's partners in Spain. But for bolsa members the prospect is ironic. Reduced takings have come at a time when the remaining main planks that make for a successful stockmarket platform have been eased into place. In April, for example, a new body called the Servicio de Compensacion y Liquidacion (SCVL), was unveiled by the Stock Market Commission, to serve as a securities settlement and clearing service. When the service becomes fully operational in the autumn, it is expected to reduce settlement from up to two weeks to five working days. The aim of the SCVL system is to have the purchaser receive securities on the day of payment. In the meantime, ratings agencies have arrived in Spain, and the snowball success of mutual funds points to the possibility of increased trading volume should there be a market rally. None of this, however, cheers the broking houses as they reel from the double punch. For the first time since the Sociedades de Valores y Bolsa (SVB), as the broking houses are known in Spain, came into being more than three years ago, in the wake of the bolsa reform, the sector's weaker members are under real pressure. Officials at the Madrid stockmarket believe that the present 54-strong SVB community will be reduced to no more than 30. With few exceptions the main bolsa houses are linked to the big banks, and some 20, which have remained independent, have market shares of less than 1 per cent. Such a reduction had been forecast back in 1989, when the SVBs replaced the individual brokers or agentes de cambio y bolsa, who, in the old pre-computerisation and pre-continuous trading days, used to operate on the floor of the market. Against the odds, the small fish survived, but with the commissions war now raging in earnest the crunch time cannot be delayed for long. An SVB shake-out will be looked upon with interest by foreign institutions, which have been eyeing the bolsa for some time with a view to starting up operations. The crunch coincides with the lifting of all restrictions on foreign institutions trading actively on the bolsa. Warburgs is one of the major brokers that is usually cited as a prospective Madrid market player, and there are believed to be five applications for membership pending at the stock market commission. Under the previous rulings, such prospective members, whether domestic or foreign, would have been obliged to buy into partnerships with the existing agentes de cambio y bolsa. Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale were two institutions that chose the partnership course. It is an open question whether the advantages these French firms gained by arriving early and acquiring a market share have outweighed the cost involved. A problem they face, in common with virtually all the established broking houses, is an excess of personnel, some of which remains rooted in the traditional public notary role of the former agentes system.</p>

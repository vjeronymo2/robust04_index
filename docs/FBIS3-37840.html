			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed INFORM-KURANTY comment: "They Sold America </F> for 1.5 Million"]    [Text] Russia has been "driven into" a fresh scandal. Yet  another "sweet couple" has been uncovered way across the  Atlantic -- a high-ranking CIA man and his Colombian wife who  provided the USSR and later Russia with information of interest  to the KGB-Foreign Intelligence Service for regular remuneration.    The Clinton administration has naturally become very upset  at  Russia which, poor as it is, so unproductively spent $1.5  million to buy the informers. Therefore, they in Washington are  demanding that all persons having a hand in such an operation  --that is, intelligence operatives -- should of their own  accord, with no additional prompting, leave the United States.  Otherwise, they say, we will take some measures. It is not  ruled out that after such an affront, the Russian special  services will announce the detention of an American informer.  Traditions should be kept up.</p>

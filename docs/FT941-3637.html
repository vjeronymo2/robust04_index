			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: ITT plans educational services sale ITT, the US conglomerate, took a further step towards narrowing its range of activities as it announced a flotation for its ITT Educational Services subsidiary. The company said it planned to sell 19.9 per cent of the unit's shares, in a move which analysts said would probably precede a full disposal. The partial sale would be likely to put a higher value on the business than that accorded it by ITT shareholders, said Mr Gary Schneider, an analyst at Bear Stearns, the New York securities house. It would prepare the unit for an eventual disposal by ITT, he said. The educational services business has more than 20,000 full-time students attending technical institutes in the US, and accounted for about Dollars 150m of revenues in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available. The planned partial sale follows ITT's completion last month of the spin-off of Rayonier, a forestry products company with annual sales of about Dollars 1bn.</p>

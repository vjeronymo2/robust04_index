			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F> 3768): "It Is Better for Clinton To Be More Realistic"]    [Text] U.S. President Clinton has to make a decision on  China's MFN trading status in about two weeks. Clinton has  vigorously advocated applying trade sanctions against China,  saying China must make "comprehensive and substantial  improvement" in seven respects before its MFN trading status can  be renewed in 1994, but people in various circles, both in and  out of government, are more and more aware that suspending  China's MFN trading status is not in the interests of both China  and the United States. How will Clinton weigh the pros and cons?  <H5>  Changeable Policy Toward China </H5>   In fact, the disadvantages of suspending China's MFN trading  status are quite clear. It can be seen from the debate and  practice of various sectors of society that the U.S. and China  have a common interest in the economic, political, security  fields, and many others, despite their different ideologies.  For these reasons, the U.S. has modified its policies toward  China since last fall to increase high-level contacts between  the two countries. Clinton held talks with PRC President Jiang  Zemin when they both attended the APEC forum held in Seattle.    However, in the months following the summit, U.S. policies  toward China and Asia were changeable, indicating that the  Clinton administration lacked foresight and sagacity in  formulating its foreign policy and that there were differences  of opinion within the administration. In a recent leaked  memorandum to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Winston  Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, expressed his  opinions over policy toward China. Later, it was rumored that  Christopher may resign to take responsibility for the  much-criticized U.S. foreign policy.  <H5>  Clinton Must Save Face </H5>   Developments over the last few weeks show that there has  been  a marked change in Congress, which has adopted an uncompromising  attitude toward China in the past. THE WASHINGTON POST said in  an editorial a few days ago that "Congress this year hardly  intends to urge" Clinton to apply trade sanctions against China.    Another development which warrants attention is that quite a  number of people are trying to design means by which Clinton can  back down with good grace. A U.S. newspaper quoted a senior  researcher from the International Institute for Strategy Studies  saying that "the urgent task is how to save face for the  president." Another newspaper report said that Clinton's senior  advisers are working hard to design "a decent withdrawal."    A few days ago Banit [ba ni te 1572 1441 3676], former U.S.  deputy assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, and Geolick  [zuo li ke 0146 0448 0344], a former deputy secretary of state  and White House chief of staff, published newspaper articles  devising retreating tactics for Clinton. These included: 1)  Using the term "people's livelihood," which includes human  rights, instead of "human rights" when addressing China problems  to enable the two countries to find more common ground; 2)  issuing a public statement that China is beginning its journey  to prosperity, that allowing China to join regional and global  economic and security systems is in the U.S. interest, and that  U.S. policy toward China is far above its economic interests;  and 3) publicly expressing that the best way to raise the  Chinese people's living standards is to allow China to continue  opening to the outside world rather than isolating it.  <H5>  Controversy Between Ideal and Reality </H5>   THE WASHINGTON POST was more straightforward. It believes  that Clinton can keep calling on China to improve its human  rights situation if only he changes tactics.    In his 900-page book "Diplomacy," which has attracted  attention world wide, former U.S. secretary of state Henry  Kissinger, who is famous for breaking diplomatic stalemates,  said that U.S. foreign policy has always exhibited a conflict  between moral concerns and state interests. The idealists  believe the state's driving force comes from disseminating U.S.  values, while realists place state interests above everything  else. He maintains that it is more undesirable to export U.S.  values as the Cold War is over.    It is more advisable for Clinton to be more realistic.  American people are more and more interested in taking good  care of things at home. In fact, Clinton won the presidential  election campaign by advocating "taking greater care of domestic  affairs."</p>

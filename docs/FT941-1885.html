			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Thomson consumer arm returns to black Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the French company that is one of the world's largest television manufacturers, last year came back into the black at the operating level after three years of losses, with an operating profit of FFr155m (Dollars 26.3m) against a FFr335m deficit in 1992. However, the company, a subsidiary of Thomson, the state-controlled electronics group, remained in the red overall due to restructuring costs and heavy debt. It made a net loss of FFr973m during 1993 compared with a heavier deficit of FFr1.77bn in the previous year. Mr Alain Prestat, chairman, described the return to operating profits as proof that the negative trend at TCE had become positive. He said it would take another 18 months for the group to become profitable at the net level. 'This time last year people said we were in a make-or-break situation,' he added. 'These results show that we've made it.' TCE, which owns a string of consumer electronics brands in Europe and North America including RCA, Telefunken and Ferguson, has been restructured since the arrival of Mr Prestat, 41, as chairman from his former role as a civil servant. Mr Prestat has cut costs and restructured TCE's operations. The number of employees was reduced by 10 per cent to about 49,000 last year. He has redesigned the group's products and has hired Mr Philippe Starck, the French designer, as artistic director. The group increased sales by 10 per cent to FFr33.48bn in 1993 from FFr30.55bn in 1992. Mr Prestat hoped to increase sales by another 10 per cent this year. TCE is still struggling with heavy borrowings valued at FFr10.3bn at the end of 1993, against FFr10.7bn a year previously. 'Of course I'd like to see a lower level of debt, but that's a matter for our shareholder (the French government),' said Mr Prestat.</p>

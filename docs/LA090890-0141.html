			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> DISTRICT, RESIDENTS REACH ACCORD ON LOT  </P> <P> Capistrano Unified School District officials expect to forge ahead with  construction of a parking lot at Capistrano Valley High School after finalizing  a tentative settlement reached with residents who had obtained an injunction to  stop work on the lot.  </P> <P> Residents of the Village San Juan housing complex first complained about the  project after a grove of eucalyptus trees was torn out during grading.  </P> <P> The Village San Juan Homeowners' Assn. then obtained a temporary injunction  against the school district, claiming it had been improperly notified of the  lot's construction.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School is on Via Escolar in Mission Viejo but its  neighbor, the Village San Juan housing complex, is just over the city border in  San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> District officials had placed a notice of the project in a newspaper not  available in San Juan Capistrano and did not inform the homeowners association  about the project. However, a sign placed at the project site met notification  guidelines set by the state, according to school district spokeswoman  Jacqueline Cerra.  </P> <P> As part of the out-of-court settlement, school district officials have pledged  to re-landscape the hillside lot and install gates, fencing and speed bumps.  The injunction will remain in effect until next week, when both sides hope to  reach a final settlement, Cerra said. Construction will resume after the  settlement is signed.  </P> <P> Although student parking has never been a problem in Village San Juan,  residents said, students have parked in neighborhoods in Mission Viejo and  along Via Escolar when the main school parking lot is filled.

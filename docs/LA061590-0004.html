			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ADMINISTRATION'S THREAT TO CUT OFF TALKS WITH ARAFAT  </P> <P> At last, in your editorial, you seem to be coming to grips with the thought  that there may be no justification for the United States to continue  negotiating with the PLO. If Yasser Arafat does control the terrorist  organization and its affiliates, then he is responsible for the recent attack  by the Palestine Liberation Front, one of the PLO's affiliates, on the Israeli  coast.  </P> <P> If he cannot control these territories, there is no purpose in negotiating with  him because he will not be able to enforce any commitment he may make.  </P> <P> Arafat insists that he did not know about the terrorist operation, but this  hardly seems possible since the planning and training for it went on, according  to Abul Abbas, the terrorist leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front, for  two full years. This is unbelievable. In any event, the goal of the raid,  according to one of the captured terrorists, was "to kill civilians in the  (Sheraton) hotel area of Tel Aviv. . . . We were supposed to land and kill  anyone we came across."  </P> <P> The Israeli government has already supplied our State Department with  documented evidence about more than a thousand terrorist attacks against Israel  since Arafat's pledge in December, 1988, that the PLO was ending such attacks.  Should it not be clear by now, even to Secretary of State James Baker, that  Arafat is an unconscionable liar and cannot be considered a credible  negotiating partner?  </P> <P> You say that whether the acts of the PLO "justify an end to the U.S. dialogue  with the PLO remains to be determined." But every relevant fact indicates that  the terrorist PLO has not given up its aim of destroying Israel. Isn't that the  bottom line?  </P> <P> SOL MODELL  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

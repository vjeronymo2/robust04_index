			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / US plans to reduce shark fishing in the Atlantic The US plans to reduce shark fishing in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, to try to preserve species threatened by a rising demand for shark-fin soup, George Graham writes from Washington. The US National Marine Fisheries Service plans to impose commercial fishing quotas for 29 species of coastal shark, including the tiger shark, the great white shark and the hammerhead. Ten species of pelagic shark will also be protected, with particular safeguards placed around the mako shark, much sought after for its meat. Makos less than 66 inches long may not be killed. US officials said overfishing had threatened the survival of some species, although none were yet listed as endangered.</p>

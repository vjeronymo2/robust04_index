			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Clinton victory in key state polls: Arkansas governor strengthens bid as Democratic candidate for presidency GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas took a giant stride yesterday towards becoming the Democratic party's nominee for the US presidential election in November. He convincingly beat his main challenger, Mr Paul Tsongas, in the critical primary election in Florida and immediately capped that with a clean sweep of six other southern states. Mr Tsongas won his home state of Massachusetts and neighbouring Rhode Island, and was narrowly ahead in the caucuses of party voters in Delaware. But Mr Clinton's march through Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Missouri and Tennessee, as well as Florida, has given him great momentum for the important northern primaries in Illinois and Michigan next week. On the Republican side, the story of the string of 'Super Tuesday' elections was much as it has been all year. President George Bush swept all eight states where Republicans voted, some by very wide margins, but he could not completely shake off Mr Pat Buchanan, his rightwing opponent. In Florida, Mr Buchanan was pulling a third of the vote and even in the president's home state of Texas, as well as in Tennessee and Oklahoma - in all of which Mr Buchanan had barely campaigned - the anti-Bush vote, mostly for Mr Buchanan, was running at over a quarter. For the Democrats, Florida was always the litmus test and Mr Tsongas's best, perhaps only, chance of an upset, since the other six southern states voting yesterday actually have borders with Mr Clinton's Arkansas. But, with a third of the Florida vote counted, Mr Clinton was winning nearly 51 per cent, against 32 per cent for Mr Tsongas and 15 per cent for Jerry Brown, the former governor of California. The Clinton strategy had always been based on a strong 'Super Tuesday' showing. But, pressed by Mr Tsongas, he had recourse for the first time to some negative advertising in Florida. Exit polls showed that two were particularly effective - the charges that his opponent would raise petrol taxes and possibly cut social security benefits. Mr Tsongas, who responded in kind, confessed last night he had been 'knocked off stride' by the Clinton onslaught. But polling also showed that Mr Clinton's support was deep and wide. In Florida and other southern states, he was easily the most popular among all ethnic, age and demographic groups. His share of the black vote even rivalled that achieved by the Rev Jesse Jackson four years ago, though many fewer blacks voted this time. Nevertheless Mr Tsongas was bloody but unbowed last night, promising a crowd of supporters in Massachusetts: 'I will be the Democratic president.' He and Mr Brown can continue fighting for some time since Mr Clinton is still a long way short of the 2,145 convention delegates he needs for the Democratic nomination. Democratic party rules apportion delegates according to complex formulae based in part on shares of the popular vote, plus an allotment given to state party leaders. It is possible Mr Clinton will not wrap up the nomination until the June, which gives his opponents hope, as long as they can still afford to fight against him. The Republicans generally award delegates on a state winner-take-all basis, meaning Mr Bush should be home and dry long before then. The White House claimed last night that 'for all practical purposes, he has won the nomination'. But there is no sign of a Buchanan withdrawal, in spite of calls yesterday by a cabal of Republican congressmen in the White House that he do so. Threat to Bush, Page 6</p>

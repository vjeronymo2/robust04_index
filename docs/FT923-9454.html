			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: FHI plans product line rationalisation FUJI Heavy Industries (FHI), the Japanese carmaker, is to eliminate almost half its Subaru model variations, in the most sweeping rationalisation of product lines which Japan's economic downturn has yet forced on its crowded automotive sector. The move is part of a 30-month programme announced yesterday by FHI under which it plans to return to pre-tax profits of Y4bn (Dollars 31.4m) in the current year to March - double its previous forecast - and Y26bn by 1994-95. The company incurred parent pre-tax losses of Y4.1bn last year, its second year in the red. Mr Isamu Kawai, president, expects to resume dividends during the rationalisation programme. FHI last made a payout, of Y6 per share, in 1989-90. In common with larger Japanese carmakers such as Nissan, which holds 4 per cent of FHI, it offers a large range of model variants, numbering about 400. These are to be shrunk to nearer 200, while costs will be cut through a greater standardising of components. The move may trigger similar announcements elsewhere. All Japan's nine carmakers are studying using parts common to different models and in some cases, for simpler items such as bolts, even co-ordinating procurement with rivals. ranges. As a result of the measures, domestic sales of Subaru, known for minicars and four-wheel-drive vehicles, are forecast to rise to 377,000 units by the year to March 1995 from 360,000 this year. Export sales are expected to remain flat at just above 200,000. The economic slowdown, which pulled Japan's domestic car sales lower by 6.5 per cent last year, shows few signs of easing. Figures this week from the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association show a 6.9 per cent drop in new registrations in July from a year earlier.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA OPPOSITION PACT  </P> <P> Fourteen Nicaraguan opposition parties announced that they have agreed to  present joint candidates and a single program to run against the ruling  Sandinista Front in elections next February. The decision was a breakthrough  for the Opposition National Union, a loose coalition of 14 parties ranging from  left to right. "The parties have agreed to accept a united program for a  government of national salvation and joint candidates for president, vice  president, legislators and mayors," Luis Sanchez Sancho of the Socialist Party  told a news conference attended by the leaders of all opposition parties.  Opinion polls have indicated that the opposition stands little chance of  beating the Sandinistas in the elections unless it unites behind joint  candidates.  </P></p>

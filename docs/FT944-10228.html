			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification System Following a partial review of the Financials Economic Group of the Industry Classification System, the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has agreed to refine and update the current system to reflect the changing nature of many companies currently classified in these sectors. The following improvements will be implemented on December 31 1994: Banking Sectors - The two current banking sectors are to be renamed Banks, Retail and Banks, Merchant and redefined. This will provide a clearer distinction between retail and merchant banks. Fund Managers &amp; Stockbrokers - A new sub-sector within the Other Financial industry sector will be introduced, drawing together all fund managers and stockbrokers into one distinct sub-sector. Discount houses - This sub-sector will be discontinued and the companies previously classified as discount houses classified elsewhere. Investment Trusts - The Investment Trusts sector had grown very large and included a variety of different trusts. Consequently, the Classification Committee, working in conjunction with the Association of Investment Trust Companies, have divided the old Investment Trusts sector into six new sub-sectors: UK General, European, International, Geographic Specialists, Venture &amp; Development Capital, and Split Capital Funds. 'The business world is constantly changing and these on-going improvements to the Industry Classification System help to ensure that it is always up-to-date and relevant', commented Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, chairman of the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee. 'The Investment Trust sector had grown as new trusts were launched and dividing it into six new sub-sectors will result in more homogenous groupings. I'm sure that this and our improvements to the definition and segmentation of the bank and financial sectors will be welcomed by investors'. Details of the changes to individual stocks will be published after the next meeting of the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee on December 5 1994.</p>

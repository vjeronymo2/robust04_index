			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / UN backs further raids to defend safe areas United Nations secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali has given UN peacekeepers 'carte blanche' to make further use of air power to protect Bosnian safe areas, his spokeswoman said after the raids. Mr Boutros Ghali's spokeswoman, Ms Therese Gastaut, said: 'The secretary-general would like to make it very clear that he will not hesitate to use close air support again to protect the UN-designated safe areas.' The raids won swift endorsement from Nato governments as a way to further efforts to find a comprehensive peace in Bosnia. However, the Bosnian ambassador to the US said the raids were 'too little, too late' in response to the sustained Serb attack on the Gorazde enclave. There was no official reaction from Moscow, which has cautioned Nato strongly against enforcing UN policy in Bosnia. Ms Gastaut said the decision to ask Nato for air support had been taken by Mr Yasushi Akashi - Mr Boutros Ghali's special representative in former Yugoslavia and head of UN peacekeeping operations there - after consultations earlier on Sunday with Mr Boutros Ghali. Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador to the UN, told CNN news that the attack was more of a message than a real response to the Serb advance on Gorazde. He called for the Serb troops to be withdrawn to lines previously agreed with the UN. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, acknowledged reports of a direct hit on the headquarters of the Serbian troops attacking the town. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was informed of the air strikes minutes before they took place. Downing Street later said: 'This is the sort of action that Nato always said might be necessary. It did not need his (Mr Major's) approval since the actions have been sanctioned by UN resolutions.' The German government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, said Bonn hoped the air strikes would advance the Bosnian peace process. He said: 'The attackers of Gorazde have no one to blame but themselves for this answer from Nato.'</p>

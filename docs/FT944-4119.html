			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Akzo-Nobel arm merges with US rival Akzo-Nobel, the Dutch/Swedish chemicals company, is to merge its rubber chemicals division with that of US rival Monsanto. The new company, forecast by Akzo to have sales of Dollars 600m in 1995, will be based in northern Belgium. It will initially employ 1,400, but job losses 'cannot be ruled out', Akzo said. The merger is the result of overcapacity among suppliers, consolidation among the sector's customers - for example in tyre manufacture - and aims to improve performance in a slow growth industry. The 50-50 joint venture is scheduled to begin operations in January. Its products will largely be additives that improve the performance of rubber, such as helping car tyres withstand cold. The two companies have complementary product lines. Akzo would not say whether the transaction included a cash element. It said the joint venture would be 'in the top three' in its sector by turnover. Competitors include Bayer, the German chemicals company.</p>

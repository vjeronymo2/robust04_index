Smith: "The Council does  not have information on contraband trade in nuclear material,  but it shares the concerns of the honourable member of the  European Parliament regarding the consequences of fraudulent  traffic into the European Union of nuclear and/or radioactive  material from the Central and East European countries and the  former Soviet Union. In this context, the Commission is  currently preparing a communication to the Council which should  make it possible to get a better idea of the scope of this  problem as well as action which could be taken at Community  level in terms of information."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report under the "Social Focus" rubric: "All </F> the Same, the Prospects for the Harvest Are Unenviable"]    [Text] The other day I bought a pack of garlic from a  nearby vegetable store. Removing the plastic wrapper at home, I  discovered large, completely unspoilt bulbs. Where was this  garlic from? From Argentina, my friends!    Well then, we have entered the world market with such speed  that we can no longer produce anything. You see "Snickers"  wherever you go: Have some -- no thanks....    And how do matters stand with our own agricultural output?  To put it mildly, not very well. According to Russian  Federation State Committee for Statistics figures, as of 25  April 2.3 million hectares (15 percent of the area sown) of  winter crops on Russian Federation farms had perished. This  includes 2.1 million hectares (15 percent) of grain crops.    And where have the winter crops perished? On our most  fertile lands! In Voronezh Oblast half of all crops have  perished. In Volgograd and Astrakhan Oblasts -- a third. In  Krasnodar Kray -- 27 percent.    I asked the leading experts: What is the cause of this  disaster? No one could give me satisfactory explanations.  Unforeseen weather conditions, they suggested: There was a  sharp frost, but there had been no snow.... The there are the  mysterious subsoil waters, which suddenly changed their course.    OK. What about the spring crops? As is the custom, they  have caught up and overtaken. Spring crops (as of 25 April)  have been sown on an area of 5.2 million hectares. Of these  cereal crops account for 3.7 million. Last year the  corresponding figures were 4.0 million and 2.8 million hectares.    And more sugar beet has been sown than last year as well --  231,000 hectares, and more sunflower seed -- 260,000 hectares.  (Last year the corresponding figures were 197,000 and 92,000  hectares.) Add to this an increase of one-third in the area  under potatoes and vegetables.    The figures do inspire some optimism. But here is how they  are assessed by the experts from the Russian Federation  Government Economic Conditions Center, which cannot be accused  of prejudice. In their opinion, a 10-percent reduction in the  output of eggs can be expected in the first half of this year  compared with the same period last year, together with  reductions in the production of meat and milk of 20 and 31  percent respectively. The overwhelming majority of Russians  will find it hard in such conditions to survive until the  promised lavish harvest.    And will it be so lavish anyway? After all, it is not enough  to grow a crop -- it must also be gathered, stored, and  processed. Yet storage and processing capacity is hardly  increasing at all. So the prospects for the new harvest will  hardly be enviable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Liberals To Oppose Defense Cuts"] </F>   [Text] The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  has great difficulty in accepting cuts of 300 million guilders  [G] in the defense budget, a legacy of the present government.  The VVD wants to reduce these cutbacks to zero. The PvdA  [Labor Party] on the other hand wants to see even more defense  cuts, of as much as G1.4 billion in all.    The three party leaders who are negotiating to form a  "purple" coalition government comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and  D66 [Democrats 66] are today to discuss defense policy.    In the election program, the Liberals position was that  defense should be spared any cutbacks. But, since the present  government is leaving behind it a "hole" of G5 billion, the VVD  may also be unable to escape defense cuts.    In the election campaign, the VVD referred to this legacy of  the present government as "[outgoing Finance Minister] Kok's  hole." On calculating the cost of the election programs of all  parties, the Central Planning Bureau concluded that all  ministries would have to contribute to the G5 billion shortfall.  The VVD later regretted that this "cheese-slicing method" also  involved defense.    D66 also ran an election campaign in which defense was to be  spared any cuts. But the Democrats have now reconciled  themselves to a maximum of G600 million being cut from the  defense budget.    The only conclusion reached by talks on public health,  pursued by the three party leaders yesterday, is that there are  to be no major changes to the system. PvdA leader Kok reported  that the negotiators agreed that a "practical, businesslike  approach" must be adopted to achieve costs management in the  health sector.    Kok said that "no negotiating took place yesterday."  Instead,  the negotiators drew up a list of "major questions" to which the  public health experts from the three parties must find an answer.</p>

Ariwibowo told the press after a meeting with President  Suharto here on Saturday that the country's textile and textile  product exports for all of last year were valued at 5.8995  billion US dollars, an increase of 0.01 percent from the  previous year's figure.    Compared with other export commodities such as wood and  rubber, of which exports increased by 37 percent and 148 percent  respectively, the growth rate of textile and textile product  exports was very low, the minister said.    The oversupply of products had caused consumers to buy  products which had been already stored at warehouses as  merchandise, leading to slow trade in new products, he said. He  also attributed the slow growth rate of Indonesia's textile and  textile product exports to the entry of China's textile to the  United States, the appreciation of Japanese yen against the US  dollars besides the emergency of new textile exporting countries.    To boost the growth rate of textile and textile product  exports, which currently become one of the prime foreign  exchange earners, the government and textile producers should  take various steps, including making immediate adjustments to  new developments occurring in the world market.    Tunky also reported to the head of state on the development  of domestic electronic industries. According to the minister,  the export of electronic goods in 1993 reached a record high of  1.1 billion US dollars but the import of electronic components  increased to 800 million US dollars in the same year. The  electronic components included cathode ray tubes, special  components of radios and tape recorders as well as capacitors,  he said.    He said the government should encourage foreign electronic  component manufacturers to relocate their plants in Indonesia as  part of efforts to keep down the import of electronic  components. The relocation of the electronic component  industries in Indonesia would be successful if their products  were bought by export-oriented companies, he said.</p>

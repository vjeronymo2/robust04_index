			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez has said he  thinks the Guatemalan peace dialogue will not be altered by the  situation in Mexico's state of Chiapas.    [Begin recording] [Enriquez] If reports originating in  Mexico  and others produced here in Guatemala confirm the participation  of the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], there  will undoubtedly be some repercussions in the peace talks.    [Reporter] Do you know whether those who were arrested have  links to the URNG [words indistinct]?    [Enriquez] We do not have any specific information yet. We  know there were arrests; as you know, newspapers on the morning  of 5 January reported that. We do not have any official  reports. As soon as we have official information, including  names, we will let you know. As of now, all I know is what I  read in the newspapers. Perhaps on the afternoon of 6 January we  will have more concrete and official reports. At that time it  is possible that the Foreign Ministry will release information  to you; if not, I will do so as soon as information is available  to me. At this time, the information we have we learned from  the newspapers.    [Reporter] News dispatches from Mexico say the Guatemalan  Army has reinforced the border. Is this true?    [Enriquez] We have not bolstered security along the border.  On the morning of 5 January I told you that the Guatemalan  Army's largest military presence had already been the one along  the Mexican border. We have not increased it. If security  there is reinforced, it is because three subversive groups are  still present there -- the ORPA [Revolutionary Organization of  the People in Arms], the EGP [Poor People's Guerrilla Army], and  the FAR [Rebel Armed Forces]. This is the border where we have  stationed the most units. [end recording]</p>

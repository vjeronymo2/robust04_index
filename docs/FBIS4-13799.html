			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas: We Will Continue Operations </F> Against Israel Until the Liberation of Palestine From the Sea to  the River"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- In two statements, one dated 20  April and the other 21 April 1994, the Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) emphasized that its political program does not  include "forfeiting a single inch of Palestine" nor does it  include "recognition of the Zionist entity's right to exist on  our territory."    The first statement was an "explanation" of the statements  made by the chairman of Hamas' Political Bureau and carried by  some media recently. The second, a more detailed statement,  declared that Hamas' military operations will continue "against  the occupying enemy...until the liberation of all our usurped  Palestinian territory from the sea to the river."    Following is the text of the statement issued by Hamas'  Political Bureau on 21 April 1994 under the heading "An  Important Statement Issued by Hamas' Political Bureau on the  Latest Developments":    "In the light of the political concept proposed by Hamas and  in the light of the various official and media reactions to that  and the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state, enemy  government officials, and officials of other states, Hamas  reaffirms the following:    "1. Escalation of the valiant popular resistance, jihad, and  military operations against the occupying enemy will continue as  long as there is Zionist occupation of our blessed Palestinian  territory...and until the liberation of all our usurped  Palestinian territory from the sea to the river.    "2. Hamas believes that the current so-called settlement  negotiations between the PLO leadership and the Zionist enemy  will fail because they are based on the perpetuation of  injustice, aggression, and occupation, are held in an atmosphere  of Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Palestinian and  Arab weakness, reflect submission and capitulation to Zionist  and American terms and diktat, and run contrary to the will of  our patient masses and their struggling forces. Hamas also  reaffirms its clear position rejecting the feeble autonomy.    "3. Hamas outlined its political concept in a statement  issued by its Political Bureau and in statements made by the  chairman of its Political Bureau. It was crystal clear, leaving  no room for confusion or speculation. Some information media  reported it ambiguously and partially, giving the impression  that there has been some change in Hamas' policy, programs, and  concept of the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even  went too far by trying to interpret Hamas' views to mean that  Hamas was offering an initiative for peace with the occupying  Zionists or that its views meant recognition of the usurping  Zionist enemy, and other such erroneous claims and  interpretations.    "4. The Hamas political concept proposed to our people and  their struggling forces calls for the following:    "A. Unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation  forces from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem.    "B. Dismantling and removal of the settlements and  evacuation of the settlers from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,  and Jerusalem.    "C. Holding free general elections for the Palestinian  people inside and outside [the occupied territory] to elect the  people's true leadership and representatives. That elected  legitimate leadership would be the only party authorized to  express the will and aspirations of our people and to decide all  the subsequent steps in our conflict with the occupation.    "5. Hamas explained, through statements by the chairman of  its Political Bureau, that if, after the general elections to  choose our people's leadership, Hamas and its known political  program win the confidence of our Palestinian people, then Hamas  will express the will of the people and will seek to implement  its program for the mobilization of our people's resources,  forces, and capabilities and to unite their ranks for the  liberation of their territory and holy places. If the election  results prove to be different, then Hamas will respect the view  of the majority but will adhere to its constant principles and  program and work for their fulfillment, and it will express its  views most freely and strongly.    "6. The aforementioned statements and declarations did not  include what some tried to claim was a Hamas recognition of the  usurping Zionist entity nor did they include acceptance of  Security Council Resolution 242 or abandonment of Hamas'  programs and constant genuine Islamic principles which regard  Palestine as an Islamic territory which must not be given up,  forfeited, or subjected to bargaining."</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRAUTHAMMER ON RAP MUSIC  </P> <P> Krauthammer's column is an accurate expose of the messages of Western culture  and its media of today. I do believe that there is a light at the end of the  long, dark, undeniable tunnel he describes. That light flickers in each one of  us in the very undeniableness of the problem. The only way to treat culture's  pathology is to treat the multiple components of that culture. We are beginning  to see the enemy and it is us!  </P> <P> Adults of today are feeling the pain and emptiness of our microchip and luxury  dip, instant gratification society. Expression of grief and making amends for  grief caused are beginning to emerge from the dark tunnel of "looking good" and  "having it all."  </P> <P> As more and more of us become willing to look at our own individual parts in  our culture's pathology, we become able to begin healing that part which is  ours. As small parts begin healing, larger parts such as relationships begin to  change, and perhaps heal. Relationships build families that then have to adjust  to the healing of the fundamental relationship. And then a family learning to  be caring, expressive and dynamic goes out to work, shop, school and maybe even  the polls. Caring people who value life, who recognize the value of other's  lives, can be the route to entertainment selling when it's about dreams of  happiness and wholeness, love and caring and growth and adventure.  </P> <P> We do have free will, and that will is expressed in what we make our culture.  We won't change Western society overnight, any more than we got to this  violent, destructive, object-focused version of it overnight. But amid the  darkness of this seemingly endless tunnel, I do see some evidence of a route to  emergence.  </P> <P> KRISTEN K.A.

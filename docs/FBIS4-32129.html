			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received a communique faxed to us from the  headquarters of the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR]  announcing that during an extraordinary session of the PDAR  Executive Bureau they decided that the PDAR parliament faction  would initiate the procedure of withdrawing the confidence  granted to the government by means of a no-confidence motion.  The communique is signed by PDAR Chairman Victor Surdu.    Another faxed message, which is signed by the PDAR  parliament  faction, addresses the following request to members of the  Senate and the Chamber of Deputies:    In accordance with Article 112 of Romania's Constitution,  the  PDAR parliament faction initiates the procedure of withdrawing  the confidence granted to the government by means of a  no-confidence motion.    Considering the reasons detailed in the censure motion,  which  presents the current grave situation in agriculture as a  consequence of the government's inadequate activity, we express  our conviction that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies members  of other parliament factions, who have not forgotten those who  voted for them, who are as concerned as we are over this  situation, and who wish to solve the problems, will second our  motion and sign the signature list initiated by our parliament  faction, which, for the time being, is too small to accumulate  the number of signatures necessary to meet constitutional  stipulations.</p>

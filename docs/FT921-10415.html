			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Few issues emerge in sluggish market THE HEAVY inventory of unplaced paper which is weighing on underwriters' books contributed to the prevailing torpor in the Eurobond market, where only a handful of new issues emerged yesterday. The dollar sector remains the worst afflicted, due to the huge volume of aggressively priced paper launched last month, much of which remains unplaced. Dealers say there is little investor interest in these recent deals, many of which are trading at spreads 10 basis points wider than at launch. The fear of causing a further widening of these spreads may be holding back further issuance. In the D-Mark sector, where the market is also becoming rather clogged after heavy volume, Total, the French oil company, launched a DM200m 10-year deal via Deutsche Bank. Meanwhile, Denmark's Ecu1bn domestic issue will not emerge for several weeks, because technical details involving the structure of the issue still have to be resolved. The deal, has been mandated to Den Danske Bank and Unibank. The bonds will be listed in Copenhagen and will clear through the Danish domestic clearing system, but a Danish central bank official said the structure will be designed to ensure they can be cleared through Euroclear and Cedel, the European clearing houses.</p>

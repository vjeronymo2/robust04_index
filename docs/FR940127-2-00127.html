			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of the shares as described above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions. Applicants believe that the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load were imposed at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility that he or she will have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that the imposition of the CDSC permits the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants also request an amendment to the Existing Order, which granted an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), 18(i), to permit applicants to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. The amendment to the Existing Order would permit applicants to add a conversion feature as a difference between classes of shares. Applicants believe that the conversion feature is equitable and will not discriminate against any group of shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> All capitalized terms have the same meaning as in the Existing Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely to one or more of the following: (a) The impact of certain Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following (i) transfer agent fee identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) trustees' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (vii) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan and/or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan with respect to such class; (c) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's Shareholder Services Plan and/or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, except as provided in conditions 16 and 17; (d) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; and (f) the fact that certain classes will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The trustees of the Funds, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of different classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System'') prior to the implementation of that system by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Trusts including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trusts. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Funds to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trusts, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's distributor and adviser will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a material conflict arises that the trustees determine cannot be eliminated, the Fund's distributor and adviser, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

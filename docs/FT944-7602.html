			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Brazil refineries hit by oil workers' stoppage Brazil's oil workers went on strike yesterday over a long-running wage claim which the accident-prone government of outgoing President Itamar Franco seems increasingly incapable of solving. Most of the country's 10 main refineries, including the three biggest, were reported to be affected by the stoppage which union officials said would be stepped up over the coming days. With diesel and some household fuel stocks low because of recent heavy demand, Brazil could face shortages of these products if the strikes last more than a few weeks. In an apparent bid to shore up stocks, the government last night announced a 15 per cent tax on all petroleum and chemical exports. Import tariffs on these goods would also be lowered from 20 per cent to 2 per cent. Brazil is a net oil importer, with most of its supplies coming from Saudi Arabia and Argentina, but the country does sell some refined products to the US. The oil workers first went on strike for a week at the end of September over a 108 per cent pay claim and other demands. Mr Franco intervened and agreed to most of the workers' claims without consulting their employer, the state-owned oil monopoly Petrobras. The president's accord would have cost Petrobras more than Dollars 400m, which the company says it cannot afford, and could have prompted high wage claims throughout the public sector and undermined Brazil's new currency, the Real. When this was explained to the president, he cancelled the accord. However, initial approval by the president and the energy ministry has considerably strengthened the resolve of the workforce. They say they will not accept anything but reinstatement of the original accord and have rejected a labour tribunal ruling that they should only receive a 13 per cent rise. Brazil's inflation rate, as measured by the government's main IPC-r index, jumped to 3.27 per cent in the month to mid-November, against only 1.86 per cent in the previous four-week period. The increase, which is higher than expected, will add to the government's problems. According to law, salaries have to be increased in line with the index, which has now risen nearly 20 per cent since the Real currency was launched in July.</p>

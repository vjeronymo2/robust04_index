The  first phase of maintenance of the plant in Nuevitas will be  conducted on unit No. 5, mainly in order to increase boiler  efficiency. The workers at the plant, Cuba's second in  generating capacity, plan to complete partial maintenance of the  fifth of its six generating units in less than 25 days. Workers  are preparing with minimum resources to begin an uninterrupted  24-hour schedule in what has already been described as a feat of  labor. Engineer Mario Mederos, director, stressed that this  experience will make it possible later to perform complex  maintenance on unit No. 6, which also produces 125 megawatts per  hour.    The recent workers parliament meeting in the plant prompted  an analysis of measures to reduce absenteeism, increase  technological discipline, and promote individual incentives for  work results.</p>

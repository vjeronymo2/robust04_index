			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: China Resources steps from the shadows - A look at the 1997 ambitions of a large but quiet mainland conglomerate As mainland companies jockey for control and influence in Hong Kong in the lead-up to 1997, China Resources is emerging as a strong candidate to fill any corporate power vacuum that might be left after the hand-over. For a group which has been in Hong Kong for 45 years, China Resources' profile has been virtually invisible. And this is despite its 10,000 employees and a handful of monopoly trading businesses. It is now making a determined effort to compete more openly. The group has a spread of businesses similar to that of the giant Jardine Matheson group, covering trading, retailing, property development, hotels and infrastructure. It also has investments in energy and transportation. Mr Frank Ning, managing director of China Resources Enterprises (CRE), the group's main stock market-listed arm, said the parent company had assets of HKDollars 45bn (USDollars 5.8bn) and achieved group turnover of HKDollars 60bn last year. China Resources' current focus is on developing an efficient and competitive listed empire, to help complete its evolution from over-staffed bureaucracy to powerful corporate entity. Mr Ning admits: 'Before we didn't have to operate like a company, we operated like a government department. We must try to adapt ourselves to the new environment, otherwise the bureaucracy will kill this company.' China Resources is owned by the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade, and its former role was as a tool of China's economic policy. However, Mr Ning claims the group is now more independent of its parent than many other listed Chinese companies. It may not be easy for the group to adapt. 'It is a different working environment. You can call it freedom, or you can call it pressure,' said the 35-year old Mr Ning, one of the numerous US-educated mainlanders emerging on Hong Kong's corporate scene. CRE came into being when China Resources purchased a minority stake in Winland Investment, a shell company, in 1986. Over the past 12 months, following the rapid injection of China Resources' existing Hong Kong businesses, CRE's stock market capitalisation has jumped from HKDollars 300m to HKDollars 3.2bn. The group has one significant advantage over the other key Chinese investor in Hong Kong, Citic Pacific. It has long-term experience of operating businesses and building assets, rather than just trading investments. The three businesses China Resources is currently considering selling to its listed company are: Ng Fung Hong, the monopoly importer of livestock from China; China Resources Petroleum, the monopoly importer of petroleum products; and the group's retail operations, which have a substantial percentage of the market for Chinese arts and crafts. These have all been built up with the support of the state, and are now so strongly established that competition would be prohibitively expensive. The group should therefore benefit from the loosening of government controls, even though they come at the cost of guaranteed monopolistic privileges. However, it is not the existing businesses which are attracting investors to CRE, or any other so-called 'red-chip', mainland-controlled companies. It is the anticipation of political leverage after 1997. These companies already have undoubted advantages when it comes to investing in China. Although China Resources has ploughed back USDollars 500m into the domestic economy, in the past it has had little choice over where the money went. Now, however, it can use its Beijing connections to command quality deals. Brokers expect the same could become true in Hong Kong. Mr Clive Weedon, research director of Nomura Securities, argues: 'The new Chinese hongs will be able to use their mainland pedigree to win infrastructural and property deals from a post-1997 government.' This influence has already been demonstrated in their ability to take on influential shareholders - Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong group owns 8 per cent of CRE, while the Kwok family's Sun Hung Kai Properties owns 10 per cent - and to do business with the territory's leading tycoons. The group purchased 50 per cent of the Hong Kong Chinese Bank from the Indonesian Lippo Group. It has acquired 10 per cent of the colony's leading port operator, Hong Kong International Terminals, and a 51 per cent stake in a 6.7m sq ft property development with Mr Li Ka-shing. In a city where connections are crucial, this is an advantage. However, the strength - and real test - of this advantage will ultimately depend on an ability to run these businesses as successfully along the lines of the established houses of Jardine, Swire, Hutchison and World.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELD FOR 2 YEARS, ITALIAN KIDNAP VICTIM ESCAPES  </P> <P> A 20-year-old man who spent two years in the hands of kidnapers returned home  Wednesday to a grateful mother and a cheering crowd of neighbors.  </P> <P> Hundreds of honking cars jammed the streets of Pavia, 20 miles south of Milan,  where Ceasare Casella was reunited with his parents, ending one of Italy's  longest and most dramatic kidnapings for ransom.  </P> <P> Casella escaped Tuesday when his kidnapers, apparently panicked when they  learned that police patrols were nearby, left him chained to a pole at a  mountain stream near a southern village.  </P> <P> National police and paratroopers found Casella around 10 p.m. Tuesday after he  knocked on the door of a cottage outside the Aspromonte village of Careri to  seek help.  </P> <P> Casella told police he managed to uproot the pole he had been chained to and  escape with the chains still around his neck and wrists.  </P> <P> Police brought Casella to Pavia early Wednesday morning in a motorcade after he  was flown from southern Italy to Milan aboard an air force DC-9.  </P> <P> He was hugged and kissed by his mother, Angela, who last June provoked a  national outcry when she spent 10 days touring the villages of the  bandit-ridden Aspromonte region, on the toe of Italy, demanding the release of  her son.  </P> <P> The bandits seized Casella outside his home in Pavia on Jan. 18, 1988, and took  him to a hide-out in the Aspromonte area. His father, auto salesman Luigi  Casella, had paid $800,000 to the bandits on Aug. 15, 1988. But the kidnapers  then demanded $4 million more.  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Surveys find no rise in house prices HOUSE PRICES have contin-ued to stagnate although sales have increased since interest rates began to fall in February, according to surveys published yesterday by Britain's two largest building societies, Andrew Taylor writes. According to Halifax, the country's biggest society, house prices rose by 0.2 per cent last month. After stripping out seasonal factors, prices fell by 0.5 per cent. Nationwide showed a 0.6 per cent fall in prices last month in spite of 'signs of an increased level of activity in the housing market'. Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's retail operations director, said: 'The last few months have given us evidence that the housing market is stabilising. From this base we can expect a modest recovery, but not the sort of boom that occurred in the late 1980s.' Both societies said they expected prices to rise by up to 5 per cent this year as sales increased on the back of lower interest rates.</p>

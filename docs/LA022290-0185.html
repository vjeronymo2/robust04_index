			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY GOT HIM TO GEORGETOWN  </P> <P> Sometimes it pays to have a nosy neighbor.  </P> <P> When Anthony Allen was becoming a high school standout in Port Arthur, Tex., a  neighbor, James Washington, decided to become involved in planning his college  career -- without telling Allen.  </P> <P> Washington, 69, told Steve Berkowitz of the Washington Post:  </P> <P> "I used to look at the games on TV, and the announcers would say how many of  Georgetown's players completed their educations.  </P> <P> "I was trying to get (Allen) recognized by a school that would make sure he  would come out with a degree.  </P> <P> "Starting when he was a junior, whenever I saw something in the newspaper I  thought might be of interest, I'd cut it out and send it to Coach (John)  Thompson. Then, when Anthony was a senior, I sent him a letter."  </P> <P> Allen went on to become Texas high school player of the year and was already  high on Thompson's recruiting list. Now, with some assistance from Washington,  he plays for the Hoyas.  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Feb. 22, 1969, who became the first female jockey to win a race  at an American thoroughbred track?  </P> <P> Claims to fame: Said ABC's Al Michaels, who broadcast the United States' hockey  upset of the Soviet Union 10 years ago in the Olympics at Lake Placid, N.Y.,  and the San Francisco earthquake during the World Series last fall: "To me,  it's an incredible irony that I built my career around baseball, everything  I've done in my career is spun off of baseball, but what I'm known for is  hockey and an earthquake."  </P> <P> Street smarts: Joe Walton, fired after seven years as the New York Jets' coach  and hired Friday as the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive coordinator, on signing  quarterback Tony Eason during the 1989 season:  </P> <P> "Any guy coming off the street would have trouble learning a new offense.  Unfortunately, we had to bring a lot of guys off the street because we had a  lot of injuries. One reason you're on the street is possibly (because) you  don't learn things too well."  </P> <P> Night vision: Illinois assistant basketball coach Jimmy Collins says the NCAA  recruiting allegations against him by LaPhonso Ellis, a sophomore at Notre  Dame, are giving him nightmares.  </P> <P> "LaPhonso was right in front of me, laughing in my face, and all of his teeth  were gold," Collins said. "I was so mad, I jumped out of bed and paced the  room. My wife said, 'Calm down, calm down -- it was only a dream.' "  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Barbara Jo Rubin, who rode Cohesian to a neck victory over Reely  Beeg in the ninth race at Charles Town, W.Va.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, on former champion Mike Tyson:  "If he's going to be a champ, be a champ in defeat as well. He took off his  trunks and put on a diaper." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

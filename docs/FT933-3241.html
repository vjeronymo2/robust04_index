			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Victory for Glaxo on asthma drug in US GLAXO, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical group, will continue not to face generic competition in the US against its second best-selling drug, Ventolin, following a meeting of two Food and Drug Administration advisory committees yesterday. The committees, covering pulmonary and oncology affairs, and generic products, concluded they could not yet agree a way for generic companies to produce versions of off-patent asthma treatments delivered through inhalers. Although Ventolin is off-patent in the US, there is no method for generics groups to manufacture a device that delivers the correct dosage into the lungs. The two bodies were concerned about both the safety and efficacy of generic inhaled asthma products. They decided further work was required to create the protocols for generic devices to be licensed. The decision is positive for Glaxo, and Schering-Plough of the US, whose drug Proventil was also being considered.</p>

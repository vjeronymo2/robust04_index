			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Showing tonight, a picture of chaos: The French government's television deregulation drive is in deep trouble At six o'clock this evening, the deadline for rescue bids for the ailing French television channel La Cinq, Mr Hubert Lafont, the company's administrator, will thumb through the dossiers on his desk to see whether a rescuer has emerged to keep the station going. On New Year's Eve, Hachette, the indebted media group which ran La Cinq and is one of its biggest shareholders, told the staff that the channel was filing for bankruptcy. La Cinq is the first serious casualty of the French government's TV deregulation drive. Its plight bears testimony to the problems of the rest of French TV. Only one of the five commercial TV channels is making money. The rest are in the red, as is the struggling cable sector. This has provoked demands for reform of the whole broadcasting system. The prospects are far from reassuring. The slowdown in the economy, which has already depressed the FFr14bn (Pounds 1.43bn) TV advertising market, is expected to worsen. The independent contractors which provide production facilities for the main channels are threatened by bad debts after La Cinq's collapse. This gloomy picture is very different from that painted in the early 1980s, when France's socialist government announced its plans for TV deregulation. It believed its proposals, which were heavily criticised inside and outside France at the time, would be a model of a modern media policy - cultural dirigisme in a mixed economy. The aim was to foster plurality by bringing private capital into the then state-owned TV system to launch new channels, thereby offering more choice. But deregulation went only so far. The government was worried that France might follow the example set by Italy where deregulation had heralded an era of dozens of uncontrolled - and uncontrollable - private channels pumping out soft pornography. It was also anxious to prevent the new stations from filling their schedules with cheap US series; private channels would then be forced to buy French programmes and thereby promote the development of independent producers and facilities. As a safeguard, the government retained its right to intervene by imposing restrictions on ownership, programming and advertising. As expected, deregulation prompted an increase in the number of competitors in the domestic broadcasting market. At the start of the 1980s there were three state-owned channels, TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3; were three new private stations - Canal Plus, La Cinq and M6 - and a privatised TF1, run by the Bouygues construction company, as well as the two remaining state channels. But instead of the virtuous combination of cultural diversity and commercial buoyancy envisaged by the government, French TV is in chaos. The supposedly pluralist system is dominated by one channel - TF1 - which has thrived in the private sector and now commands more than 40 per cent of the French TV audience and 50 per cent of the advertising market. The power of TF1 has left the other stations scrabbling for advertising revenue. A2 and FR3 are in the red; although state owned, they are partly financed by advertising and have been affected by the economic slowdown. M6 is still struggling to break even. TF1 apart, the only successful station is Canal Plus which, as a pay-TV channel, makes most of its money from subscriptions, not advertising. The other channels are locked in a vicious circle; their viewing figures are not high enough to attract advertising away from TF1 and, as a result, they do not have enough money to invest in the new programmes they need to increase their audiences. The worst case of all is La Cinq, which tried - and failed - to compete directly with TF1. In the past year or so its finances have been so strained that it has resorted to broadcasting cheap pornography, to the horror of the regulatory authorities. La Cinq made a loss of more than FFr1.1bn last year, slightly more than its overall turnover. 'The crux of the problem is that there are too many channels chasing too little revenue,' said Mr Claud Ravilly, finance director of Canal Plus. 'There is a limit as to how many mainstream channels the advertising market can support. Three is probably the maximum. Five is too many.' La Cinq's collapse has, temporarily, at least, helped to alleviate this problem. It is possible that it will find a rescuer. So far the only would-be saviour to have stepped forward is Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate who is one of its larger shareholders. However, his bid may not be acceptable to the French government given that his Italian stations broadcast exactly the kind of pornographic programmes that the socialists were eager to avoid in France. If no suitable rescuer comes forward, La Cinq will go off air. Its likeliest replacement would be the current affairs channel - a French version of CNN, the US round-the-clock news format - recently proposed by TF1, Canal Plus and M6. They claim such a channel would be financially viable, as a low-budget service funded partly by selling its own advertising and partly by the revenue they expect to gain after La Cinq's demise. There would then be four mainstream commercial stations. Most observers of the French media sector believe, like Mr Ravilly, that there is only room for three. The likeliest scenario is that the government might merge the two remaining state channels - A2 and FR3. So far though, it has given no definite indication that it plans to do so. In the meantime the government could try to aid the TV industry by relaxing state restrictions on advertising - which are stricter for the state stations than their commercial rivals - and programming. These restrictions range from a ban on TV advertising for certain products, such as most forms of retailing, to a stipulation that at least 40 per cent of all programmes be made in France. Some observers claim that these constraints impose an unfair burden on the TV companies by artificially inhibiting the growth of advertising revenue and inflating overheads. The '40 per cent French' rule alone is estimated to add 20 per cent to programming costs. 'It is a ridiculous situation,' said Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European media analyst at Morgan Stanley Securities in London. 'You can't expect commercial TV companies to fend for themselves in a competitive market when they are shackled to the ball and chain of government regulation.' The government has, in recent years, made slight modifications to the advertising constraints. This may reflect the fact that these restrictions are partly a legacy of the era when France's powerful regional press used its political influence to try to curb TV's potential as a competitive advertising medium. Given that a number of the leading regional press publishers, notably Hachette and Havas, are now big investors in TV, the situation today is less sensitive. On programming, the government shows no sign of relinquishing its controls. The lynchpin of its arts policy under Mr Jack Lang, the powerful minister of culture whose brief includes broadcasting, has been to protect the French language and France's heritage. Mr Lang recently fought a fierce campaign in Brussels over the '40 per cent' rule. One area of broadcasting where the government does seem prepared to take action is cable. The French cable system is struggling to build an audience in the face of hefty losses and an embarrassingly high 'churn', or disconnection rate. Ten years ago, when the socialists unveiled their 'plan cable', they forecast some 1.25m subscribers by 1992. But cable's progress has been so slow that fewer than 700,000 homes subscribe. One reason for cable's problems is that, just as TF1 has drained advertising revenue away from the other commercial channels, so the popularity of Canal Plus has made it difficult for cable to attract subscribers. Earlier this month the French cabinet ordered a review of the cable sector. The collapse of La Cinq has led to calls for the government to do the same for the rest of the broadcasting arena. So far there has been no response from the government, probably because it is desperate to distance itself from the political embarrassment of the La Cinq debacle.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          FRENCH TELEVISION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Advertising revenue             Viewing shares                    1990          1991          1990           1991                 FFr million    Jan-Jun       (Percent)       Jan-Jun                 (Percent)     (Percent)                     (Percent)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TF1           7,154  (51.4)     52.3            43.2           43.8 Antenne 2     2,023  (14.5)     15.8            22.4           21.4 FR3             972   (7.0)      7.3            11.2           11.4 Canal Plus      336   (2.4)      2.5             4.0            4.5 La Cinq       2,302  (16.5)     13.5            12.0           10.9 M6            1,048   (7.5)      8.7             7.2            8.0 RTL              87   (0.6)      na             na            na TMC               7   (0.1)      na             na            na Total        13,929   (100)      100             100            100  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

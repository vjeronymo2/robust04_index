			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference  of heads of organization departments -- which ended today --  pointed out that, in 1994, organization affairs must keep pace  with the new situation; and organization leaders at all levels  must continue to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts,  strive to improve their skills in leading socialist market  economy and their ability to resolve their own problems, build  stronger grass-roots party organizations, and intensify efforts  for educating and managing party members so the endeavors of  deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, expediting  development, and maintaining stability can be ensured  organizationally.    Addressing the meeting, Zhang Quanjing, executive deputy  head  of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department, stressed  the need to earnestly accomplish the assignment put forth by the  14th national party congress to arm all party members with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. He said: County-level and higher  ranking leaders must be more aware of the need to study the  theory and properly handle the relationship between their work  and study, and between leading economic construction and leading  ideological construction. They must set aside more time for  study, take part in fewer parties [shao yi dian ying chou 1421  0001 7820 2019 6804], and make greater efforts to improve their  theoretical proficiency. Currently we should combine the study  of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  with the study of the decision of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, and consider whether we can  actively implement the central authorities' measures for reform,  and properly handle the relationship among reform, development,  and stability as an important criterion for examining whether or  not our study is successful.    Zhang Quanjing pointed out: We must build stronger leading  bodies, focusing on their political awareness and conduct.  Members of leading bodies at all levels must continue to  heighten their awareness of enforcing democratic centralism, and  they must properly handle the relationships between partial and  overall, local and central, and immediate and long-range  interests. They must strictly enforce orders and prohibitions,  firmly safeguard the Central Committee's authority, and make  sure that all its decisions and measures for reform are  successfully carried out. While heightening their political  awareness and improving their conduct, leading bodies must also  fight corruption and perform their duties more ethically and  diligently. To guard against irregularities in selecting and  using personnel, we must uphold the principle that our cadres  must be more revolutionary, better educated, younger in average  age, and professionally more competent; and that our cadres must  have both political integrity and capability.    Zhang Quanjing said: We must strive to do a good job in  training, educating, and selecting middle-age and young cadres.  We must do a good job in bringing up and selecting cadres to  become top leaders of party and government departments. Party  committees and organization departments at all levels must pay  attention to finding candidates with good qualities, and  especially great potential for growth; train them hard, and  create for them the conditions with which they can mature after  being tempered in all respects. We must truly emancipate our  minds, change our mindsets, and select people -- especially  young people -- who are commonly acknowledged to have performed  remarkably in upholding the line of reform and opening up, and  people who are able to lead socialist market economy. To create  the mentality and institution favorable for young talents to  come to the fore, we must break the bondage of outmoded  conventional ideas, especially ideas that emphasize seniority,  and ideas that people to be used must be perfect in every way.    Speaking on building stronger grass-roots party  organizations, Zhang Quanjing said: As for party organizations  in state-owned enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, our  main responsibility is to make sure they are properly  established, to supervise and inspect their operations, and to  sum up and popularize typical experiences. As for grass-roots  party organizations in rural areas, priority should be given to  tightening up the regressive party branches. We should study  how to build stronger party organizations while establishing a  modern enterprise system; intensify the study of establishing  party organizations in township and town enterprises; and  actively study how to establish party organizations in  enterprise groups, incorporated enterprises, and private  enterprises, and how these organizations can play their parts  effectively.    Zhang Quanjing noted that great efforts must be made in  reforming the personnel system governing the use of cadres. He  said: Currently and in the time to come, the personnel system  will be restructured comprehensively, instead of achieving  breakthroughs in some particular respects. The basic assignment  is that, under the premise that cadres are placed under the  management of the party, we will gradually establish a  scientific system of managing cadres -- a system under which  cadres are graded and categorized, qualified personnel are used  through open and equal competition, cadres' performance will be  scientifically evaluated, awards and penalties will be given  justly, cadres will be encouraged to move up or move down, human  resources will be allocated rationally, the flow of cadres will  proceed in an orderly manner, cadres are subjected to  supervision and restraint, and cadres will be given all kinds of  training at various levels and through various channels. Zhang  Quanjing stressed: This year, organization departments should  make new strides in taking active part in guiding the  implementation of the state's civil service system, in  expediting the process of managing cadres according to their  different specializations, in making the management of cadres  even more democratic, in promoting exchange among cadres, and in  intensifying the supervision over cadres.    Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central Committee Organization  Department, chaired the conference. He also addressed the  meeting before it closed. Present at the meeting were heads of  organization departments under party committees of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the Central Government's jurisdiction; heads of organization  departments under the party committees of municipalities  authorized to have independent economic planning, and party  committees of some provincial seats; heads of organization  departments of work committees for organs under the Central  Committee and work committees for central government organs; and  persons in charge of the cadres' affairs department and the  organization department of the General Political Department of  the People's Liberation Army and the Political Department of the  National Armed Police Corps.</p>

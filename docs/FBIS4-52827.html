			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By lecturer Kim Pyong-ro] </F>   [Excerpts]  <H8>  1. The Publishing Begins </H8>   It is asserted that the number of Kim Chong-il's writings  presented and published up to now amount to a total of over 400  works. Of these, the titles have been revealed for over 230  works and the full text confirmed for over 170. Most of Kim  Chong-il's writings of thesis size are published in  single-volume booklet form. As for complete-works-type  publications, at present only the two-volume Kim Chong-il  Selected Works has been published. As of yet, they have not  been systematized into a form such as the "Selected Works" or  "Collection of Works" of Kim Il-song.    It appears that most of Kim Chong-il's writings are  statements he has made, such as working-level guidance, on-site  guidance, and oral instructions, recorded by secretaries in  charge of ideology and theory. These then pass through  correction and supplementation and are published as addresses or  conclusions. This is often seen when a work is first made public  in NODONG SINMUN. Its contents are introduced without revealing  its title; the title is presented at some later time.    Writings by Kim Chong-il first appeared officially in 1982.  The publication of his works has progressed systematically,  closely connected with the construction of Kim Chong-il's  succession. Establishing a broad principle, called the  "character standard," and three rules, being founded in popular  support, electing a figure from the new generation, and electing  the next leader while the leader [Kim Il-song] lives, as the  fundamental principles for electing a successor, North Korea  [NK] has been highlighting Kim Chong-il as the person fitting  these principles. Presenting three elements as characteristics  the leader must have--extraordinary foresight, lofty moral  character, and superior leadership ability--NK has especially  attempted to create the image of Kim Chong-il as figure in which  these three elements are combined.    The publication and propagation of Kim Chong-il's writings  are indispensable means of publicizing his "extraordinary  foresight." NK has pursued the publication of Kim Chong-il's  writings by calling him a "genius of ideological theory" and a  "master of ideological theory," to make him into an ideological  theoretician by stressing his intellectual side. Although  publishing his works is fundamentally a means of publicizing his  talent as an ideological theorist, because presentation of  policy for each sector of society, such as combative slogans,  literary guidance, economic-construction guidance, etc., is  achieved through the publishing of these works, it also displays  his "superior leadership ability." Furthermore, these writings  on each sector of society, by showing Kim Chong-il's great  concern, also publicize his "lofty moral character."    That Kim Chong-il's works were first published in 1982 is  not  unrelated to his succession was firmly established at this time.  Emerging as the heir to power in the October 1980 Sixth Party  Congress, Kim Chong-il began concrete, working-level guidance in  May 1981. He also tried to create opportunities to strengthen  his power base in the political sector, such as becoming a  representative of the Songnim District, North Hwanghae Province  in the Seventh General Election of the Supreme People's Assembly  held on February 28, 1982. We can take the view that the  publication of his writings began in 1982 as a way to secure a  political base by publicizing his talent for thinking as a  successor. [passage omitted]  <H8>  2. The Three Stages of Publication </H8>   Publishing Kim Chong-il's writings was carried out in three  stages, according to analysis. The first stage was from 1982  through 1984: works capable of being used as policy guides in  each sector of NK society were presented and published. The  second stage was the publishing conducted between 1985 and 1987.  In this stage, a reconstruction of Kim Chong-il's past  activities was attempted by finding past, unpublished writings  and retroactively publishing them. The third stage began in 1988  and at present, in 1993, is ongoing. With Kim Chong-il's  succession in mind, the transfer of the leader image of Kim  Il-song, the creation of the legitimacy of his regime, and the  concrete publication of his works are being carried out.  <H5>  A. Stage One: Publication of Basic Policy Platform and </H5> Expansion of Kim Chong-il's Power Base    The publication of Kim Chong-il's writings beginning in 1982  saw the publication of his main writings, to be used as policy  guides in each sector of society, by the end of 1984. This was  the first stage of publication. That is, from 1982 through 1984  NK caused his political influence to be felt, from everyday life  to the workplace, by replacing with Kim Chong-il's writings  teachings necessarily quoted in each area of society, on Chuche  Thought, party construction, the economy, youth activities, art,  education, the military, etc., and by having these studied in  each neighborhood unit, workplace and school, and by clarifying  them through debates and rallies.    In order to obtain authority as the successor to Kim Il-song  in NK, more than anything else, he must secure the right to  interpret with authority the official ideology of NK society,  Chuche Thought. This is the first consideration for qualifying  as the leader in this socialist society ruled by ideology. In  this context, Kim Chong-il organized and systematized theory on  Chuche Thought previously alluded to by Kim Il-song, presenting  and publishing his thesis entitled, On Chuche Thought.    Kim Chong-il's second thesis, The [Korean] Workers  Party is a Chuche-Type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the  Glorious "Down With Imperialism Union" Tradition , was  published on three pages of the October 17, 1982 NODONG SINMUN.  This was to display another quality he must have as a leader: an  anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition and insight on party  building. In an editorial four days later, NODONG SINMUN quoted  it as one of Kim Chong-il's teachings. Using the name, "Party  Center," seven times and "Kim Chong-il" seven times, it greatly  emphasized his position.    A thesis, On Further Improving the People's Lives  published on 16 Feb 84 played a very important role in Kim  Chong-il securing the legitimacy of his regime. Since it was  published, all NK economic policies have come to quote this  thesis and all economic policy success since then has been  completely credited to him. His image was further strengthened  with the report that the results of the "August 3rd People's  Consumer-Goods Increased Production Movement" to improve the  people's lives, the Kwangbok-kori and Tongil-kori construction  to increase the number of housing complexes, etc., were achieved  based on the teachings of this thesis.    In July 1984, with the presentation and publication of  On Further Strengthening Party Leadership of the Youth  Enterprise and On Further Developing the Educational  Enterprise, policy guidance was presented covering the  whole of national education. Another work small in size but  treated as important by the military was published in April  1984: The People's Armed Forces Must Defend with Their  Lives Their Leader and Party, Their System and Fatherland.  Although no works have been published on unification, The  Leader Kim Chong-il, published in two volumes in 1984, not  only depicts him as having deep interest in unification too, but  it also publicizes that he has led the formation of various  unification-related social organizations since the Koryo Federal  System was proposed in 1980.    Together with the publication of his writings, the process  of  Kim Chong-il's political position becoming secure from October  1982, when his writings began to be published, through 1984 can  be confirmed through NODONG SINMUN. Kim Chong-il's name started  to be introduced on NODONG SINMUN's front page with the October  22, 1982 issue. Beginning in 1983, the frequency of its  appearance increased. By November 1984, it reached its present  form, in which articles on Kim Chong-il's recent situation and  the publication of his writings are headlined on page one of  NODONG SINMUN. This signifies that stage one of the publication  of his works begun in October 1982 came to a conclusion in 1984.    In stage one, the work of highlighting Kim Chong-il's  leadership image was carried out in parallel, by converting into  the achievements of Kim Chong-il those for which the credit had  formerly been given to Kim Il-song: the achievement of the  various popular movements, such as the "Campaign To Create  Examples of Loyalty Learned By Following Lathe Number 26,"  "Three Revolutions Red Flag Movement," "Three-Revolution Team  Movement," "Production, Study, and Life--All in the Manner of  the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas," etc. Also, in this process, the  fact that a "semi-war state" was proclaimed in February 1983 has  similar aspects with the "semi-war-state" proclamation made  prior to Kim Chong-il's appointment as National Defense  Committee Chairman in March 1993. This can be seen as a measure  taken to help minimize internal side effects resulting from  pushing his succession forward.  <H5>  B. Stage Two: Retroactive Publishing and the Creation of a </H5> Successor Image    Stage two was the collection and retroactive publishing of  Kim Chong-il's past writings. This is more closely related to  the construction of the Kim Chong-il-succussion system. Of the  total of over 400 writings by Kim Chong-il, the entire texts of  30-some works were contained in the DPRK Yearbook  and NODONG SINMUN in the year of publication, so there is no  question of their veracity. This is not even 10 percent of the  total. That is, the remaining 90 percent of his writings can be  seen as a retroactive publication of past works. This was to  create Kim Chong-il's talent as a successor. Retroactive  publishing was probably more important than anything else for  highlighting his talent as a thinker.    The publishing generally took place between 1985 and 1987.  Published first was Kim Chong-il's college-graduation thesis,  The Position and Role of the Military in the Construction  of Socialism, from March 18, 1964. Then economics-related  works were published: Let Us Strongly Carry Out the Three  Revolutions, Causing a New Upsurge in Production (July 1,  1975), Let Us Strengthen Party Leadership of the Rural  Economy, Causing a New Upsurge in this Year's Agricultural  Production (February 6, 1976), On Further Developing  Science and Technology (August 3, 1985), and On  Observing Revolutionary Discipline within the Party and Further  Strengthening Party Leadership of Socialist Economic  Construction (July 13, 1978). These works, together with  On Further Improving the People's Lives, are  considered important writings of Kim Chong-il dealing with the  economic sector.    The reason economics-related works were published in a  concentrated manner at this time was to create his image as an  economic-policy theorist and secure the legitimacy of his  regime. This was to be done by supporting the policy to improve  the people's standard of living through a revolution in light  industry he advocated beginning in 1984. In June 1985, the "June  1985 Machine Tool Multiplying Movement" was carried out. In  early 1986, in connection with improvement of the people's  standard of living, a blueprint was presented for pursuing the  construction of Kwangbok-kori. The frequency of Kim Chong-il's  working-level guidance increased in connection with these  large-scale, economic-construction projects. Accordingly, it  appears that the collection of his economics-related works took  on important meaning.    Meanwhile, at this time an attempt was made to establish his  image as a leader by collecting and publishing On Several  Problems in Developing Cinematic Art (March 1, 1978),  To Further Develop Chuche Cultural Art (March 31,  1981), etc., works in the sociocultural field. A representative  work on his literary theory, the entire text of Cinematic  Art Theory was made public in For the Completion of  the Chuche Revolutionary Great Task Volume II, and  translated and published in various languages. Thus, his image  as a "genius of literary art" was brought into relief. Also,  publishing a pamphlet entitled Gifted One of Ideological  Theory, the Korean Workers Party Publishers propagandized  on his college writings and effectively used them in creating  the myth of Kim Chong-il's genius.    As background to the full-scale retroactive publishing in  1985, we can point to China's fulfillment of its promise of  support for the Kim Chong-il system through his visit to China  in June 1983, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu  Yao-bang's visit to NK in May 1984, and Kim Il-song's visit to  China in November 1984, and that it was influenced by the  positive discussion of Kim Chong-il's succession during Kim  Il-song's six-week tour of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  during May and June, 1984. Not only this, but internally it  appears to have started in the designs of Kang Song-san, elected  prime minister in the third session of the Seventh Supreme  Peoples Assembly in 1984, and others of the reformist forces to  expand their own power by using the glory of Kim Chong-il in the  course of actively pursuing Kim Chong-il's economic policies.  <H5>  C. Stage Three: Systematization of Publishing and </H5> Preparation for the Succession    After the succession issue concerning Kim Chong-il was  mentioned in Kim Il-song's official statement in May 1986, NK  changed direction to publishing writings for the succession. In  preparation for the succession, NK entered a new phase by  conducting a publishing project for transferring the charisma of  Kim Il-song to Kim Chong-il and for establishing the legitimacy  of the Kim Chong-il regime. During the eight months from late  September 1988 through early May 1989 as many as 13 Kim Chong-il  writings were made public as preparation for this succession.    First of all, NK started supplementing the area of the Kim  Chong-il's leadership succession process in which he was the  weakest: unification. He was made the center of lively activity  in that area. As of yet, no independent Kim Chong-il works on  unification have been published. However, NK started inserting  sections on North-South unification in the last part of  documents, beginning with the October 1988 The Present  Time and the Duty of Youth and An Answer to the  Question Posed by the Cuban newspaper GRANMA's Chairman in  October 1989.    NK is also highlighting Kim Chong-il's great influence on  unification. Not only was it made official that he is playing a  leading role in unification with his 1988 presentation of the  so-called "Four Principles Guaranteeing Peace": orientation  toward unification, withdrawal of U.S. forces, North-South arms  reduction, and negotiation between the parties, but it gives Kim  Chong-il all the credit for sending relief goods for  flood-disaster victims in September 1984 and the mutual exchange  of art teams and hometown-visitation groups realized in  September 1985.    Second, he did an overall organization of literary theory.  Putting together a work on literary theory, Kim Chong-il started  publishing with a book entitled, On the Literary Art of  Chuche, and published five books by the end of 1990.  [passage omitted] Apparently, writings on this field were  systematized first, out of consideration for the fact that Kim  Chong-il's talent as a thinker begins in literary theory and  that even at present he is active as the leader of the literary  field.    Third, NK commenced full-scale systematization of Kim  Chong-il's works by publishing on February 14, 1992 for the  first time in a complete-works format, Kim Chong-il  Selected Works Volume I, in commemoration for his 50th  birthday. [passage omitted] These writings were praised in the  extreme by NODONG SINMUN, which called them a strong guide to be  held firmly in the construction of Socialism and Communism, an  encyclopedia revealing the way by which the achievements of  socialism can be defended and advanced through the realization  Chuche Thought.    Also, in the course stage-three publication for the  succession, NK made a first attempt at dispersing the focus of  praise concentrated on Kim Il-song. That is, by symbolizing Kim  Il-song as a figure of the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle  and highlighting Kim Chong-il as a capable leader of the present  time, NK wanted him to inherit the leader's authority,  monopolized by Kim Il-song during the construction of socialism  in NK after liberation from Japan. Beginning in late 1987, NK  had emphasized the history of the anti-Japanese struggle of Kim  Il-song, through such things as the discovery of the so-called  "Slogan Tree."    The History of the Korean Workers Party, published  in 1991, can be understood in the same context. Centered on Kim  Il-song, The History of the Korean Workers Party  (1979 Edition) was suddenly revised. With the exception of those  portions related to the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle,  most mentions of Kim Il-song were replaced with Kim Chong-il.    In particular, NK in 1988 produced and showed the  documentary  film, 1974, The Year of the Great Turning Point, in  which Kim Chong-il was depicted as if having already been made  successor in 1974. This has led to the idolization of Kim  Chong-il by creating symbols, such as the cultivation and  propagation of the Kimjongillia [a flower named after Kim  Chongil], Chong-il Pong (November 15, 1988), Hyangdo Pong  (January 1991), and Mansu Mugangsu (February 9, 1991). Also, the  fact that since 1987 the DPRK Yearbook has not been  using his previous titles, "Leader," and, "Secretary," can be  seen as preparation for the use of the title, "The Leader."  <H8>  3. Conclusion </H8>   The publication of his works has functioned as an  indispensable element of the construction process of his  succession. Through the third stage of publishing, the  evaluation of his past activities and his image as a leader were  reformed: his college years were mysticized, the successor issue  was resolved early (in 1974), and his talent as a thinker and  his abilities as a leader were demonstrated.    We cannot overlook the propaganda activity contributed by  overseas networks, such as the Chochongnyon [NK-sponsored union  of Koreans living in Japan] and the African Chuche Thought  Research Center, in the construction of Kim Chong-il's image. To  put it another way, his being the heir and the leadership  succession were brought up more directly through overseas  organizations. By reporting this in domestic newspapers and  broadcasts, NK built the people's image of Kim Chong-il. Also,  titling his works using popular slogans appears to have greatly  contributed to the elevation of his popular appeal within NK and  the expansion of his influence.    Viewed overall, his writings have not yet been developed  comprehensively into a single work encompassing politics,  economics, diplomacy, and unification, as is the case with Kim  Il-song's writings. Concerning diplomatic and unification issues  in particular, Kim Chong-il's writings are of little importance.    Most teachings being carried out in NK's economic and  literary fields are based on the writings of Kim Chong-il. In  economics, in connection with the recent construction of  Tongil-kori and the pursuit of a revolution in light industry,  his On Further Improving the People's Lives is  frequently quoted as a message from the ruler. Because they have  systematized all the fields of cinema, music, dance, art,  architecture, and literature, Kim Chong-il's writings are quoted  as teachings concerning literary activities too. Since Kim  Il-song's writings on Chuche Thought and the party  organizational system, are indispensable for Kim Chong-il's  succession, the frequency of quotations from Kim Chong-il's  writings on these areas too is gradually increasing.    In connection with the establishment of Kim Chong-il's  image,  the question of how to establish a relationship between Kim  Chong-il's and Kim Il-song's writings will become important. NK  will have to increase quotation of Kim Chong-il's writings in  the mass media, etc., to establish his image and build his power  base. Because of this, there is the possibility that conflict  will occur with the writings of Kim Il-song over the quotation  issue. Such problems in the establishment of a relationship  between them will have to be resolved by classifying the two  series of writings by time period. Kim Il-song's writings will  be limited to the period before the advent of Kim Chong-il. Kim  Chong-il's writings will be used for the period after he came on  the stage.    Since it is asserted that Kim Chong-il was already the  successor in 1974, it is predicted that quotation of his  writings published after 1974 will increase. For the present,  however, since there are no Kim Chong-il writings before 1960,  for this time at least, NK will have no choice but to depend on  the writings of Kim Il-song. Thus, from a long-term standpoint,  NK will have to unify the quotation issue by classifying the  works of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il using 1960 or 1974 as a  standard.</p>

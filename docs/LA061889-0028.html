			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV QUESTIONS  </P> <P> Questions about television as it celebrates its 50th birthday (PBS programs  excepted):  </P> <P> Has TV improved manners? Increased respect for law, authority, wisdom, our  traditions?  </P> <P> Has it made better citizens or a better life? Supported education? Fostered  good speech and language? Has TV any motive aside from profit?  </P> <P> Does health require such vast exhortation on body culture (with no detail of  the toilet, concupiscence or privacy omitted)? Has TV considered the physical  stagnation it invites as a cause of deterioration and ill health?  </P> <P> Is the innocence of children proof against its indiscriminate "facts of life"  promulgation?  </P> <P> Has TV counted the multibillion hours of life that its commercials have stolen?  </P> <P> ERNST BACON  </P> <P> (Professor Emeritus, Syracuse University)  </P> <P> Orinda, Calif.  </P></p>

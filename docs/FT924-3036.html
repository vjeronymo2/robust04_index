			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Brazil to act over surge in kidnaps IN AN attempt to crack down on a new wave of kidnappings in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian Congress is to vote this week on a project to freeze the assets of captives' families. An Interpol conference last week said Rio was becoming the world centre of kidnapping. The city has a record number of 10 people in captivity, two of whom have been held for two months, while 146 cases have been registered this year. Mr Mauricio Correa, the law minister, admits: 'It's like a raging epidemic.' Multinationals, such as Land Rover, planning to invest in Brazil are bypassing Rio as unsafe. The head of one foreign bank in Sao Paulo said: 'Five years ago we couldn't get people to move from Rio. Now, no one wants to stay.' Victims are usually leading businessmen or socialites, or their relations, with the real number of kidnappings believed to be far higher than the 360 registered in the last three years. Many are not reported for fear of a repeat. The kidnappers are well armed, with imported weapons and cellular telephones, and are controlled by the Red Command, the city's main organised crime gang. Evidence is also emerging of police involvement. Mr Sergio Quintella, a local businessman whose son was released last week on a Dollars 330,000 ransom after 49 days in captivity, has made a public appeal for people to come forward with information. Some victims are starting legal action against the Rio state government for 'omission', but Mr Nilo Batista, the state security secretary, said: 'Kidnapping is one of the hardest crimes to prevent. In Italy it took 10 years to bring under control.' It is increasingly common to see local business people accompanied by security guards and driving battered vehicles, leaving smart cars in the garage.</p>

According to local officials, last year the province earned  72.63 million U.S. dollars from exports of labor services, and  signed agreements for undertaking overseas projects, involving  83.15 million U.S. dollars, up 34 percent compared with the  previous year.    Entering the 1990s, the province has kept enhancing its  competitiveness on the international labor market by making full  use of its advantages in manpower, technology, equipment and raw  materials.    The International Economic and Technological Co-operation  Corporation of Henan has set up more than 30 branches across the  province and extended its business scope to contracting overseas  projects, conducting labor co-operation in foreign countries and  launching engineering and design consultancies. It also engages  in economic and technological co-operation and foreign trade,  with the focus on contracting overseas projects and exporting  labor.    Last year the province sent 6,790 workers to implement labor  contracts in 27 countries and regions.</p>

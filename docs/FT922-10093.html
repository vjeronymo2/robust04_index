			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: All eyes on Mayfest - A preview of the Glasgow galleries participating in this month's festivities IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative positions was impossible? So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely balanced. Glasgow may not yet boast the major exhibitions which Edinburgh's museums have always the good sense to offer at festival time, with the city full of visitors. But that effort is usually qualified by a wish to distance it from the Festival as such, opening particular shows well beforehand and running them on long afterwards. As for the Festival authorities, their current advance literature is innocent of any reference to the visual arts at all. But Mayfest has always integrated the visual element into its programme. This year there may be no single outstanding offering, but across the spectrum, from public to private, some 15 galleries are participating, with all but two of them open by this weekend, and a further eight listed in association. To try the flavour, I visited four shows, one of which, at the Collins Gallery (22 Richmond Street: until June 6), with the opening due on Friday night, was on Thursday morning but a flurry of carpentry, paint and wallpaper and a gleam in the artist's eye. 'Access', by Jim Buckley, is to be an installation that takes further the images he first developed in his sculpture. This he based on the old peepshow principle, making boxes with interiors that proposed their own imaginative scale and reality. Here, in one darkened gold-papered room, Buckley has set into the wall four large display transparencies taken from the boxes he showed in Kunst Europa in Germany last year, the images imagined, richly decorated, sanctuary-like interiors. The other room, white and light, holds seven peepholes through which to view photographic details of actual architectural interiors found in the city itself. Cyril Gerber was the first dealer to bring modern and contemporary art to Glasgow, and he stands naturally at the heart of Mayfest. At his personal gallery (148 West Regent Street: until May 23) he shows Benjamin Creme, a Glaswegian painter now 70 but long neglected. The work here is of the 1940s, when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and character. Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21), Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish print-maker, Elspeth Lamb. With her 'Cornerstones', she offers us the fruit of a recent visit to Mexico where she was particularly taken both by the popular festivals of the Day of the Dead and the ancient architectural carvings and hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan and Quetzalcoatl. But what makes her show remarkable is not so much the imagery as the medium by which she has developed and quite literally expressed it. Making the paper herself, saturating the pulp with pigment, she at once simplifies and concentrates the image while impressing it into the very fabric of her material. The paper is itself the image: and rich and dense and beautiful too. The Transmission Gallery (28 King Street) is a co-operative run by a changing committee of five artists to show not their own but the work of artists they would wish to see. Throughout May it offers a group show - a collaborative relief-cum-lightwork by Paul Maguire and Simon Starling, consisting of three isometric cubes, small, medium and large, described by white neon tubes; four cibachrome prints of a leather holster, by Michael McDonough; and a set of of ironically dispassionate photographs of taped and sand-bagged windows, taken in Zagreb last November by Donald Urquhart. Small, black and white, the format insistent in its simple frontality, the plastic bags oddly disturbing in the way they are heaped and trussed, they are rather impressive.</p>

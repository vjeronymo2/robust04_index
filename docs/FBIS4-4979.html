			<p>BFN     [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  secretary general, said that Japan should work flexibly on  measures to break the deadlock in the Japanese-U.S. economic  framework talks. He noted that it may be possible for Japan to  set import targets as long as these are not linked to U.S.  sanctions.    In a 4 April news conference at the Diet, Ozawa said, "I  think that Japan should take the initiative in improving its  market practices so that these are not criticized by the  international community."</p>

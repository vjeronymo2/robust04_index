			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER INJURED AT MOBIL REFINERY  </P> <P> A contract employee erecting scaffolding at the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance  was hospitalized for four hours Friday after suffering a minor facial burn from  a small leak of water containing hydrofluoric acid.  </P> <P> Benjamin R. Chaves, 35, of Santa Ana was taken by paramedics to Little Company  of Mary Hospital, where he was treated and released.  </P> <P> Torrance Fire Department Inspector Doug Bergen said Chaves was hit in the face  by a drop of acid leaking from a flange. He said Chaves was wearing protective  clothing but that he had his facial shield raised when the accident occurred.  </P> <P> Mobil's environmental manager, Greg Munakata, said Chaves was constructing the  scaffolding so that workers could repair the leaking flange in the refinery's  alkylation unit.  </P> <P> The slow leak, discovered early Friday morning, occurred in a relief gas  scrubber that removes hydrofluoric acid.  </P> <P> An initiative campaign has been launched in Torrance to force Mobil to stop  using the acutely toxic chemical.  </P></p>

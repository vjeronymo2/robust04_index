			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sunshine treats - Cookery Hope springs eternal. The bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May boasted glorious sunshine, a summery promise dashed severely since - but not forgotten. Now, as though to force the gods into giving us another blaze of fine weather this bank holiday, barbecues have been reassembled and fresh supplies of charcoal bought. If, perish the thought, the weather forces a retreat indoors, the recipes that follow can be cooked just as well under the grill of a conventional cooker, or on a ridged grill pan, as over glowing embers. Some may call it sexist but, whichever grilling method is used, I reckon the cooking is done best by a man. SARDINES AGRODOLCE (serves 4) A few very obliging fishmongers will, if given advance warning, scale, gut and fillet sardines. More often, these chores fall to the cook - a fiddly but not difficult task. Chop off the heads and fins, slit the bellies and clean out the insides. Rinse well and pat dry. Lay the fish open side down on the work surface and press down gently on the backbone. Turn the fish over, cut the backbone close to the tail, and pull the bone away. Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb sardines weighing about 1 1/2 oz each;  1/2 lb main crop carrots; 4 shallots; 1oz toasted pine nuts;  1/2 oz currants; 1 lemon; a very large pinch of sugar; a little olive oil; 2 bay leaves; the leaves stripped from a sprig or two of thyme,  1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds; 1 heaped tablespoon chopped parsley. Method: Toast the pine nuts in a fat-less frying pan, shaking it frequently and watching the nuts like a hawk. Snatch them from the heat when golden brown all over. Chop the shallots finely and soften them gently in a little olive oil while you peel the carrots and cut them into batons. Stir the carrots, fennel, thyme, bay and sugar into the shallots. Pour on 4 fl oz water, bring to the boil, cover and simmer for five minutes. Sprinkle on the currants and simmer for one minute more. Then add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, turn up the heat and drive off most of the liquid, stirring frequently and adding salt and pepper towards the end. Set aside while you grill the sardines. Brush the silvery skins of the sardines with a fine film of oil and grill them briefly over hot coals until cooked through. (Or, if forced indoors, cook the fish skin side up under a conventional grill or skin side down in a ridged grill pan: two to three minutes should be enough.) In all cases, be sure the grill is pre-heated. Quickly add the pinenuts and a little parsley to the carrots and toss to mix. Spread the vegetables on a shallow dish. Lay the sardines on top, grinding pepper and sea salt over them. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, scatter with parsley, and serve with wedges of lemon and bread. WARM SALAD OF GRILLED AUBERGINES (serves 4) Dutch aubergines grown under glass, the sort available most widely in Britain, do not need salting before cooking. Garlic, lemon, olives and capers are just right for perking up their blandness. Ingredients: 1 1/2 -2lb aubergines; a little olive oil for grilling; 1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped; 2 tablespoons rinsed and chopped capers; 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves; 2 tablespoons whole small black Nicoise olives (or stoned and chopped Kalamata olives); 3 tablespoons olive oil; 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice. Method: Put the garlic, capers, coriander, olives, olive oil and lemon juice into a shallow earthenware dish and slip it into a low oven to warm through. Cut the aubergines into  1/2 in-thick slices. Brush lightly with oil on both sides and grill in batches on a barbecue, or in a ridged grill pan, or under the grill of a conventional cooker. Turn the slices once and allow six to seven minutes for the vegetable to become hot, tender and burnished with gold. Keep the grilled slices warm while cooking the rest. When all the aubergine is done, toss the slices in the warmed dressing, adding sea salt and black pepper to taste. Serve with hot bread to mop up the fragrant juices.</p>

The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. In the event that the Owner through its Engineer, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6.

Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense.

Notwithstanding the acceptance of workmanship, materials, supplies or equipment, or the giving of any certificate with respect to the completion of the work, if during the construction or within one year after such completion, or within such longer period as the Project or any part thereof may be guaranteed by other provisions of the Contract or the Specifications, the workmanship, materials, supplies or equipment shall be found to be defective or not in conformity with the requirements of the Specifications, the Bidder shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice of the existence thereof shall have been given to the Bidder by the Owner. In event of failure by the Bidder so to do, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case may be, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.

Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of estimates thereof certified to by the Bidder, and approved by the Engineer and by the Owner solely for the purpose of payment: Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials; and provided further, that in estimating the amount of construction accomplished, consideration shall be given only to equipment and materials incorporated into the Project and equipment and materials delivered to the site in accordance with approved shipping schedule. Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project. Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer shall inspect the work performed hereunder and if he shall find the work acceptable and all provisions hereunder fully performed, he shall so certify to the Owner and shall certify the balance found to be due the Bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Certificate of Completion, Contract Construction, REA Form 187, a copy of which is attached hereto, after it has been signed by the Engineer and certified to by the Owner and the Bidder shall thereupon be submitted to the Administrator for his approval and when such approval has been given, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all unpaid amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled hereunder unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar month provided (1) the Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of construction completed during the preceding month, and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall have approved such certification. If, for any reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been given on or before the fifteenth day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection ``b'' shall be the fifteenth day of such month notwithstanding the absence of the approval of the certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Owner shall insert a rate equal to the lowest ``Prime Rate'' listed in the ``Money Rates'' section of the Wall Street Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

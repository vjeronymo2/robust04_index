			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Mirghani: No Reconciliation With </F> al-Bashir Regime"]    [Excerpts] London, Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Sudanese Democratic  Unionist Party [DUP] leader Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani has  emphasized that "there will be no negotiation and no  reconciliation with the regime" of President 'Umar al-Bashir.  The secretary general of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and  chairman of the Coordination Committee of the Sudanese  opposition's National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has stated that  Sudanese opposition radio will begin transmission next week  "from somewhere outside the Arab homeland."    A statement issued by al-Mirghani's office yesterday, of  which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, said that reports of a  reconciliation dialogue between al-Bashir and al-Mirghani were  "not true" and that "the DUP's principled position regarding the  regime of the (National Islamic) Front has been the same since  the first day legitimacy was violated, namely that there will be  no negotiation and no reconciliation with the regime, a position  the party's leader, officials, and masses still adhere to."  [passage omitted]    In Cairo, Abu-'Isa [secretary general of the Arab Lawyers'  Federation] said at a news conference held at the headquarters  of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and attended by Sudanese parties  that the Sudanese opposition radio "will next week begin  transmission of its programs beamed to the Sudanese people  inside and outside Sudan to expose the practices of the ruling  Sudanese regime and work for its downfall."    He said that the transmission would be from a country which  he declined to name, but he stressed that "it is not Egypt or  any other Arab country."    Abu-'Isa said that the NDG "is now the target of internal  and  external plots aimed at splitting its ranks." He reaffirmed the  NDG's support for "the Sudanese opposition's unity and its  common objective of bringing down the ruling regime, restoring  democracy, and stopping the war in the south."    Abu-'Isa denied issuing a statement criticizing the  political  parties which form the NDG and calling for its replacement with  a progressive rally. He reaffirmed interest in the continuation  of the NDG and in working through it. [passage omitted]</p>

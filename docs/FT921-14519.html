			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Paying proper price for risk Sir, I would make the following observations on the letter from Mr Kevin Pratt, editor of 'Insurance Age' (January 7) commenting on an earlier article by Richard Lapper. Mr Pratt's attack on the Direct writers spells out exactly why the public have voted with their feet. He is correct that Direct Line selects the risks it writes very carefully: I entirely disagree that the insurance industry as a whole should perpetuate its own inefficiencies by continuing to insist that the good drivers should subsidise the bad ones. Bad risks will always get cover but, just as the good drivers do with us, they will have to pay the proper price for the risk they represent. Surely, we all want to encourage people to drive as carefully and safely as possible. Direct Line does not make it easy for young drivers to drive cars they are too immature or inexperienced to handle. Our policyholders know that they pay the rate for their own risk. The comparison made between my remuneration and insurance commissions paid to brokers out of premiums received is mischievous and misconceived. We have made reasonably priced motor and home insurance available to people who, previously, had no alternative but to pay the extra cost of commissions and other expenses of the intervening broker on top of what their insurance should really have cost. Already, in only our seventh year of trading, we are in the top 10 UK private motor insurers. Our mission remains to continue to offer the best quality service at a very reasonable price.

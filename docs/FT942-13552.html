			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections: Buthelezi relies on high profile - Inkatha Freedom Party The face of Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi appeared screen-printed on traditional African cloths, shirts, skirts and scarfs months before he officially entered the election race. Chief Buthelezi in fact has spent 20 years making sure his face is well known to every potential voter in his power base of Natal province, and in the migrant workers' hostels near Johannesburg, where his support is strongest. His campaign strategists say they are relying on his high profile to compensate for the brevity of his campaign: only five days (as campaigning stops at 7am today). The biggest boost for his campaign so far came when King Goodwill Zwelithini called on Zulus to vote. Those who are likely to heed the call of their traditional ruler (as opposed to urbanised Zulus, whose tribal ties are weaker) are likely to exercise their vote in favour of Inkatha, the party of ethnicity and tradition. For it is not as though Chief Buthelezi is setting out to woo voters away from other black parties, notably the African National Congress. In a country of rigid political loyalties, western-style campaigning has little impact. Individual preference is almost always subservient to choices dictated by geography (residents of ANC areas are unlikely to risk voting Inkatha) or greed (many vote not for the policy but forthe prospect of personal benefit). Chief Buthelezi's goal is simply to ensure that his supporters know that they are supposed to vote and not boycott the election. The rest takes care of itself: Inkatha supporters respect authority and are used to taking orders; the key is to ensure that they know what those orders are. Support among whites - the other potential pool of Inkatha voters - is a different matter. Chief Buthelezi's white support fell away almost entirely during his campaign to boycott the poll; but if Johannesburg's radio talk shows are anything to go by (and with publication of opinion polls banned, there are few other ways to test public opinion) many have returned since his decision to participate. They, too, need little persuasion. Everyone knows his positions on questions such as federalism, after months of daily news coverage of his dispute with the ANC on this matter. No campaign can do more.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> N.Y.'S ANGELS GO EN GARDE IN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS PARIS METRO  </P> <P> Four members of the Guardian Angels vigilante group descended on the Paris  Metro today to test their New York style of crime control on this city's  increasingly dangerous underground system.  </P> <P> "We're here to feel the atmosphere, to see if they need us," Guardian Angel  co-founder Lisa Sliwa told a press conference at Chatelet, one of the city's  roughest Metro stations.  </P> <P> A thick belt of photographers and journalists surrounded the Angels, who wore  the group's trademark red berets.  </P> <P> Travelers were squeezed aside as the Angels passed through the turnstiles and  took up position on the platform.  </P> <P> Passengers, mostly tourists, looked on in confused amusement. One American  tourist shouted out, "Yeah, you do a great job in New York, I tell ya, good  luck!"  </P></p>

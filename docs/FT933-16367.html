			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: Hanging on to your holiday - Practical Traveller I HAVE been to only two creditors' meetings of failed travel companies, but I am starting to get the hang of it. At the top table are the liquidator and his solicitor, dressed in black. Between them sits the managing director of the failed concern - pale, fidgeting and alert to the possibility that a jug of water may be poured over his head, as happened at the first creditors' meeting I attended. The venue is dingy, as the liquidators do not want to be seen to be spending too much money. I was there as a reporter. You do not want to be there as a creditor. You are unlikely to get either your money back or your holiday. There are three groups of creditors in attendance. There are the trade creditors - hotel keepers, coach owners, and so on - who know they are unlikely to recover anything. There are accountants, representing some trade creditors and the odd well-connected traveller, who also know that there will be little money, but who enjoy tormenting the managing director with inquiries about the Italian villa that was previously on the company's books. Finally, there is you, the travelling public, who have lost both your money and your holiday. The travellers fidget while the liquidator reports on the company's meagre realisable assets. They listen while the accountants probe the matter of the Italian villa. Finally, one of the travellers explodes, finger shaking at the managing director: 'You should be locked up]' So . . . how to avoid these gatherings? In theory, no one should ever lose money on a package holiday again. At the beginning of the year, an EC directive came into force, obliging all package travel companies to ensure that customers' money can be returned in the event of corporate collapse. In the UK, the directive has already proved useless. Firstly, there is no way of ensuring compliance. Trading standards officers are meant to keep an eye on companies, but they have neither the time nor the experience. Secondly, no one knows the legal definition of a package holiday. One company which collapsed recently was told by the Department of Trade and Industry that it was not a package holiday company, and did not have to comply with the directive, because it allowed customers to choose their own ferry crossings. As there were customers who had paid an inclusive price for their car, ferry crossing, villa and linen, the DTI's advice was difficult to understand. There are three ways of ensuring you do not lose your money: 1) If you are travelling by air, ask for your operator's Air Travel Organiser's Licence (Atol). Then telephone the Civil Aviation Authority (071-832-5620) to check it is still in order. If an Atol holder collapses, the CAA will arrange your refund. 2) If you are travelling by road and sea, make sure your operator is a member of the Association of British Travel Agents (0891-202-520) or the Association of Independent Tour Operators (081-744-9280). It is important to check that the operator is a member. Having a travel agent who is an Abta member might not be enough. 3) Pay by credit card. Under the Consumer Credit Act, you could be entitled to your money back if the company collapses. If you have a charge card, debit card or gold card, check that you are protected.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: ITD in Dollars 1.6bn Bangkok float Italian Thai Development (ITD), Thailand's biggest construction and civil engineering company, is to be floated on the stock exchange in Bangkok later this year in a deal which could value the company at Dollars 1.6bn, brokers and ITD executives say. The construction company, which dominates the Thai market for large infrastructure projects, is part of the ITD group founded in 1958 by the late Mr Giorgio Berlingieri and Mr Chaijudh Karnasuta. The group is controlled by the Karnasuta family. They are planning to sell 10 per cent of the construction company, or 25m shares, in the initial public offering in the next couple of months, to raise about Bt4bn (Dollars 157m), although the exact price of the shares has yet to be finalised. Jardine Fleming Thanakom and Goldman Sachs are co-lead managers, and 30 per cent of the issue will be set aside for foreign investors. Company executives say the listing gives ITD the chance to raise capital more cheaply than by bank borrowing. 'In the old days the government was our main customer, but that's slowly changing,' said Mr William Zentgraf, managing director of Italthai Holding. 'More and more of the work is coming in private concessions and to do these you need capital.' He noted that Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, one of ITD's listed competitors, had recently raised Dollars 80m for 10 years at 1.75 per cent through a Euroconvertible debenture - a far cheaper way of borrowing money than anything available to an unlisted company. 'As soon as you're on the stock exchange, all of these other doors open up for you,' said Mr Zentgraf. Among other projects, the company is installing new provincial telephone lines as part of a 1m line concession won by Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, and it has a 14 per cent stake in TT&amp;T.</p>

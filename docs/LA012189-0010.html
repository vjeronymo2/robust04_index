			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL GAP: LINGERING PROBLEM FOR BLACKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY  </P> <P> In response to "Socially, Color Line Is Still Drawn in Nation's Capital," Part  I, Jan. 17:  </P> <P> Why is it called apartheid when we talk about it happening in South Africa and  apartness when we talk about racial divisions in "Chocolate City," the capital  of the United States? And what, exactly, is the difference? Do we accept a lame  explanation, such as voluntary versus involuntary segregation because many  black Americans supposedly say they choose not to mingle with whites?  </P> <P> As to the "courageous" order by Gov. Michael Dukakis to the Massachusetts  executive branch to stop making purchases from companies with ties to South  Africa, will he also order them to stop dealing with companies based in  Washington, the city he would have loved to reside in?  </P> <P> B. VAN DAALEN  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

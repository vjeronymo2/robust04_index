The teams are coming to  Belarus to inspect the former USSR bases housing short- and  medium-range missiles. According to General Major Viktar Vakar,  head of the National Agency for Control and Inspections, before  the opening of the facility, U.S. teams arrived via Moscow,  which contradicted Belarusian sovereignty, as in those cases  U.S. experts were accompanied by Russian military officials,  while Belarus had to pay for their airfare.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: FUND RAISING FOREIGN TO OXFORD  </P> <P>  -- Oxford University will begin a fund-raising campaign in the United States,  marking the school's first such effort outside the United Kingdom. The school,  hurt by cuts in public funding by the government of Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher, hopes to raise $400 million, and already has collected $112.2 million  in Britain and from American corporations and foundations. Queen Mother  Elizabeth, patron of the Oxford International Development Program, was one of  the first to make a contribution. Sir Patrick Neill, vice chancellor and head  of the fund-raising effort, said: "Posts stand empty as there is no money to  pay salaries for new appointees. An alarmingly high proportion of academic  posts have no supporting endowment." Prominent graduates among the school's  9,000 alumni in this country will join Lord Jenkins, Oxford's chancellor, at a  dinner dance at New York's Hotel Plaza to kick off the campaign. The alumni  expected to attend the dinner include New York University President John  Brademas, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, Vanity Fair Editor  Tina Brown, former U.S. Atty. Gen. Nicholas Katzenbach, Brown University  President Vartan Gergorian, publisher Rupert Murdoch and art historian Rosamond  Bernier.  </P> <P>  -- A Pole is going from "Solidarnosc" to the Stars and Stripes. Kazimierz  Bascik, who created the red-and-white banner of Poland's Solidarity trade union  in 1980, is going to take the oath of U.S. citizenship in Columbus, Ohio. The  Polish government declared martial law when he was returning to his homeland  from a visit to Ohio, so he detoured to West Germany and eventually settled  back in the United States. He and his mother, Cecylia Bascik, live in  Clintonville. After he takes the oath, Bascik says: "I'm going out to dinner  and wave the American flag."  </P> <P>  -- As more than 2,000 Italians with speech and hearing impairments watched,  Pope John Paul II dedicated a statue of a priest who worked with the  handicapped two centuries ago. Priests and nuns at the ceremony in Trevignano  translated the Pope's words into sign language as he said: "I exhort you to  persevere without being discouraged by difficulty." The bronze statue honors  Tommaso Silvestri, a priest who was the first man in Italy to begin educating  speech- and hearing-impaired people. Before the dedication, the Pope prayed at  the priest's tomb on the 200th anniversary of Silvestri's death. The pontiff  also celebrated a Mass for 5,000 people at the town square.

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER VOTE SET ON PACT IN SCHOOL STRIKE  </P> <P> Spurred by mounting parental pressure, striking teachers and the Beverly Hills  Unified School District reached a tentative settlement Tuesday afternoon, with  teachers scheduled to vote on the agreement early today.  </P> <P> Terms for ending the 12-day-old strike, the district's first, were not to be  disclosed until they were presented to teachers this morning, but Judy  McIntire, president of the teachers union, said the two-year agreement entailed  "movement on both sides" from their earlier positions on salaries and benefits.  The agreement included a pledge by parents to contribute $600,000 to sweeten  the settlement, according to a parent close to the talks.  </P> <P> Other parents said the one-time contribution by parents this year would be  replaced in the second year by funds from a parcel tax -- if passed by city  voters next June -- that would be permanently built into the salary schedule.  </P> <P> School Supt. Robert French said teachers could be back on the job as early as  this afternoon, depending on how quickly substitutes can remove their  belongings. He said the district is working on a plan to keep the two groups  from having to face each other after the highly emotional strike.  </P> <P> "We are recommending the tentative agreement to you," McIntire told members  after the settlement was reached.  </P> <P> Teachers who are members of the union, the Beverly Hills Education Assn., will  vote by secret ballot on the tentative agreement at 7 a.m. at the Beverly  Hilton Hotel, McIntire said.  </P> <P> Union leaders had wanted the nearly 300 teachers, counselors and librarians who  struck the district Oct. 16 to vote on the settlement proposal Tuesday night  and go back to work in the morning.  </P> <P> But several teachers said they had made plans to take their children trick or  treating, or celebrate a colleague's birthday, so the vote was postponed.  </P> <P> Earlier Tuesday, teachers made what they hoped would be their final push,  picketing Board of Education members' homes and marching up and down Beverly  Drive after a mid-day rally.  </P> <P> "I feel wonderful, relieved and at the same time excited. I welcome the  teachers back," said school board President Dana Tomarken, who embraced  McIntire upon word of the tentative settlement.  </P> <P> Latin and French teacher Betty Nichols said, "If this is something the  bargaining team recommends, it's probably the best bargain that can be gotten."  </P> <P> Students also welcomed the news. Jason Tevelowitz, who headed up student  support of the teachers and boycotted classes, said he wanted to go back to  school but hoped "teachers don't rush into anything that's not satisfying."  </P> <P> The agreement came amid growing frustration from parents, some of whom were  scrambling to hire tutors and search for private schools for their children.  Parents took an active role in the resolution of the strike, offering ideas,  participating in negotiations and raising money to help pay for the raises the  teachers demanded.  </P> <P> "The parents were the key to this," said Albert Gersten, a parent and a leader  of Children First, a community group formed to raise money after the district  said it could not afford to meet the union's initial demand for 18% pay raises  over two years. The district said it could afford only 11%. Since the strike  began, parents have raised more than $400,000.  </P> <P> "It's a real big night . . . . We feel we have done our best to bring our  teachers back with dignity, and we're real proud of all the parents who are  involved in supplementing the (district's) offer," Gersten said.  </P> <P> He said parents' groups have pledged to make available the $600,000 as quickly  as possible and will distribute it to teachers "as soon as it is raised." In  addition, Gersten said, the teachers union, Board of Education and parents will  work to get the tax on each parcel of land in the city passed in the spring to  bring more money to district coffers.  </P> <P> City voters narrowly rejected a similar tax in March, 1987, when 60% approved  it, short of the two-thirds vote required.  </P> <P> Since the effects of declining enrollment and the 1978 initiative cutting  property taxes began to be felt in full several years ago, the district has  struggled to keep up its renowed academic programs.  </P> <P> This year's $28.3-million budget, with a reserve fund of $1.3 million, included  $4.6 million from the city of Beverly Hills, plus monies from a private  foundation formed to raise funds for the district and from sales of sportswear  with the famous high school's logo.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills teachers currently earn between $21,604 and $48,270 a year.  Average salary is $42,659, district officials said.  </P> <P> Many teachers in the 4,700-student district said they have been spending their  own money for equipment and supplemental materials for years, despite the  city's reputation for affluence.  </P> <P> Parents who can afford to opened their checkbooks, but many are not wealthy,  some residents said.  </P> <P> As the strike entered its third week and attendance at the district's four  kindergarten-through-eighth grade schools and the high school averaged around  60%, parents on both sides were increasingly agitated by the impasse.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, with all we've been doing, the ones who are going to  pay the biggest price in this whole thing are the children," said Eileen Traub,  who tutored her first- and fourth-graders to keep up with school work.  </P> <P> College-bound students were especially anxious. One parent was reported to have  called Harvard and UCLA to request they waive their deadlines for applicants'  recommendations from teachers, and advanced placement students were scrambling  for tutors.  </P> <P> "There is only so much time in the school year, only so much time to make this  up," said one parent.  </P></p>

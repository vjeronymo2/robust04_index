			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Foreign investment flows gather pace Flows of foreign direct investment, which have faltered in recent years, will pick up momentum over the course of the decade but are unlikely to match the explosive growth of the 1980s, according to a United Nations study published this week.* Foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries is expected to grow considerably faster than flows into industrialised nations, which now account for some four-fifths of total global flows of Dollars 200bn (Pounds 136bn) a year. The study, by the UN Conference on Trade and Development, bases its predictions on what it claims is the first-ever forecasting model for FDI flows. Using three different economic scenarios, the study projects increases in FDI flows of 11-12 per cent a year for Asia in the first half of the 1990s, down from 21 per cent a year in the second half of the 1980s. For Latin America FDI growth is projected at 12-18 per cent a year between 1989 and 1995, against 16 per cent in the late 1980s. For Africa the projected range is 6-16 per cent, well above the 4 per cent annual growth notched up in the late 1980s but starting from a very low base of Dollars 2bn a year or less. FDI flows into the developed world, which grew by 22 per cent a year between 1984 and 1988, are expected to slow to 8-10 per cent a year in 1989-95. *Unctad Programme on Transnational Corporations: Explaining and forecasting regional flows of foreign direct investment.

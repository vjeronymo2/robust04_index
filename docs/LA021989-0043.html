			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> My mother passed away in New York on Saturday, Dec. 10, 1988. Since the Jewish  religion requires burial as soon as possible, the services were scheduled for  Monday, Dec. 12. That meant that the only flight I could take that would get me  there on time was the Sunday evening "red eye."  </P> <P> I began calling both American and United Air Lines, as well as others, and was  informed by all of them that there were no provisions for reduced fares due to  emergencies. I had some other people call and also had my travel agents call  regarding this. They were all told the same thing, no reduced fares.  </P> <P> You have given American and United Airlines positive publicity that they do not  deserve. My trip cost me almost $1,200 to fly into New York on Sunday night and  back to Los Angeles on Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> COLEMAN W. GROSFLAM  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

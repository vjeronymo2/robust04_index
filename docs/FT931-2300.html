			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Inflation rate rises after end of sales season BRITISH retail price inflation edged higher last month, boosted by more expensive food and petrol and a bounce-back in prices after the January sales. Prices rose in February by 0.7 per cent from the previous month, taking the year-on-year rate of inflation to 1.8 per cent, slightly higher than in January when it was 1.7 per cent. This was the first rise in the annual rate since April last year. The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, an underlying measure favoured by the Treasury, rose by 0.6 per cent in February. On this basis, the annual rate rose to 3.4 per cent from 3.2 per cent. In spite of the February figure, prices are still rising at their slowest rate for 25 years and underlying inflation remains within the government's target range of 1 to 4 per cent. Foreign exchange markets concluded that the rise in the inflation rate would discourage another interest rate cut. The pound rose a pfennig on the news, but later slipped to close at DM2.4325, down  3/4 of a pfennig on the day. Sentiment towards the pound, which gained five pfennigs this week, remained positive after some mildly encouraging economic data, including a rise in manufacturing output, a drop in unemployment and higher retail sales. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said there were signs that economic recovery was beginning. 'On the balance of probability both we and independent forecasters now believe that the outlook is for growth,' he said. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said inflation was set to rise and that value added tax increases in the Budget would push up the RPI in April next year when they were introduced. Although the Treasury said it was not unduly worried by the rise, it warned that the chancellor would continue to operate interest rate policy to keep inflation within its target range. The Central Statistical Office said much of the increase in prices last month reflected a rebound from January's sales. Background, Page 4 Currencies, Page 11 London stocks, Page 13</p>

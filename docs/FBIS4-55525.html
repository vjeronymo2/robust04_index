			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F> Martinkova; place and date not given: "Prime Minister V. Klaus  Answers LN"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Martinkova] In the context  of the Hungarian elections, you declared the Czech Republic a  little island in the sea of peculiar returns. How do you  explain, however, that the Hungarian Socialists are promoting an  economic policy similar to that of the Czech Government? Is  there a difference between the left wing and the right wing in  the declared stands or in specific economic measures?    [Klaus] I made a very balanced statement on the Hungarian  elections. The cheap little joke was at the very end of this  and, taken out of context, it acquired an inappropriate setting.  I am far from assessing the outcome of the elections in Poland  or Hungary in a simplified manner. The idea that it is a return  of the communists is a jest that did not come to my mind. Their  ideology is markedly different from the former communist  ideology. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that they are  parties from the left of the political spectrum. I have never  had any serious doubts that these parties could implement a more  or less balanced and reasonable economic policy.    On the other hand, I must say that, when I had the  opportunity to meet with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian  Socialists, at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum  last year, our visions of the world were infinitely different.  His arguments reminded me of debates on the economic reform  scenario with the adversaries of our economic strategy in  1990-91. In this sense, it would be wrong to conceal the  differences. The main thing is, however, that Hungary is and  has been in all aspects a very close partner of ours. I am  convinced that we will be able to cooperate with the new  Hungarian Government just as effectively as we did with the  previous governments, and I even believe that a certain sharp  ethnic minority tone that was very strong in the previous  Hungarian Government and that I have always feared a bit may, in  this case, retreat into the background.

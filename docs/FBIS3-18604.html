Andreatta again highlighted that the Greek decision -- in  retaliation against Macedonia's declaration of independence  under a name Greece says signals territorial ambitions on the  northern Greek province of the same name -- was "a violation of  precise European Union regulations."    All EU members except Greece have recognised the former  Yugoslav republic as Macedonia.    He also stressed that "certain countries, including  Macedonia" have suffered unduly from the embargo, and that it  was necessary to "step in with some form of compensation." For  this reason, Andreatta said, studies had begun on a road project  linking Valona, Sofia and Istanbul.    Andreatta ended his reply to the Greece-Macedonia question  by  saying that "if Greece has put itself in an awkward position,"  it "cannot count on implicit European solidarity; our position  is clear on that."</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Europe is stifled by the Bundesbank's interest-rate policy THE DUST still has to settle from last month's fracture of the European exchange rate mechanism, but the equity markets are already sorted into two groups. Ahead of any further realignment of the ERM, they have divided themselves into what are perceived as the winners and losers of September's currency crisis. On the upside stand the Deutsche Mark/French franc group, including Switzerland and the Netherlands; while the downside includes Spain, Italy, the Nordic countries and the UK. This was reflected in their respective performances in the past quarter in the FT-Actuaries World indices, although significantly this also highlights a 16 per cent fall, in local currency terms, in Germany, emphasising weaknesses in its domestic economy. In dollar terms, a broader picture emerges, which reflects comparative currency strengths: Germany declined by 9.5 per cent, France by 2.1 per cent, Spain (21.2 per cent) and Italy (25.7 per cent). The FT-A World index, meanwhile, improved by 1.4 per cent in dollar terms, boosted by Switzerland, Japan and the US. The volatility in the European money markets, particularly in the second half of September, which saw the devaluation of sterling, the lira and the peseta, a revaluation in the D-Mark, the dollar's weakness, and an inconclusive French vote on Maastricht, has caused a shift in analysts' views regarding the fourth-quarter performance of equity markets. With the Bundesbank so far resisting calls for additional interest-rate cuts, economic and corporate growth in other EC states has effectively been stifled. Melissa Carrington, strategist at Hoare Govett, says that 'domestic demand in Italy and Spain is expected to fall even further next year, while the effective revaluation of the currencies of the core members of the ERM will hit their exports.' She adds that, as EC governments attempt to rein in their budgetary deficits, 'there will be no growth impetus from fiscal policy. As a result, it is difficult to see whence the impetus for European growth will come.' Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW, is even more pessimistic, observing that 'the cumulative effect of the monetary squeeze and fiscal tightenings in several economies has finally brought growth to a halt.' He has revised downwards his corporate earnings expectations for Europe (excluding the UK) for 1992 to 1.6 per cent, against 6.1 per cent. The situation among the Nordic countries has been particularly bleak over the past three months. The unsuccessful efforts by Uni Storebrand of Norway and Hafnia of Denmark to accumulate a 47 per cent stake in Sweden's Skandia led to the former two insurers suspending payments in August. Both markets subsequently fell to all-time lows. Sweden, which last month raised overnight lending rates to 500 per cent, since lowered to 24 per cent, continues to deteriorate. Peter Bradshaw and Gordon Maclean, Scandinavian analysts at Robert Fleming, fear that worse is to come, and that the government may be forced to devalue, following Finland which announced in early September that it would allow the markka to float freely, for the second time in under a year. In Spain, the re-imposition of capital controls, which followed the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta, saw share prices fall by 15 per cent in the last few weeks of the quarter. These measures drove away foreign investment and had a serious effect on the electricity sector, which has a large amount of foreign currency debt in issue. As a historic safe haven, Switzerland is still regarded as having good investment potential. Guy Rigden, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, comments that 'a stable earnings background will give solid support to the market over the next 6-12 months, when other 'hard currency' European markets may still be vulnerable to downgrades.'</p>

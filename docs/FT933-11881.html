			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD moved ahead in late trading on the London bullion market after Comex futures prices advanced early with the entry of a big fund into the market. New York analysts were divided over the possible effect on the market of Sunday's massacre of 11 churchgoers in South Africa. Some said the market had disregarded the violence, while others attributed gold's advance to concerns that the violence might escalate. COPPER traded in a narrow range on the LME, ending in the plus column. Factors such as possible strikes in Peru and drawn-out labour talks at Kennecott were seen as peripheral. Tightness in the September delivery month was again the driving force, but there was little activity on this front. Three-month ALUMINIUM met some support around Dollars 1,215 a tonne. News that workers at Alcan's Kitimat smelter are to vote on a new contract deal later this week, and that work is carrying on, suggests that a stoppage is unlikely. New York raw SUGAR prices came under pressure from the continuing lack of news in the cash market. October fell in heavy midsession trading to 9.11 cents a lb - the lowest level from an active contract in nearly six months. Compiled from Reuters</p>

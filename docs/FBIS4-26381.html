			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Xinhua Nationwide  Paging Network -- a radio paging network covering more than 70  large and medium-sized cities across China -- was inaugurated in  Beijing on 18 June.    It is the first nationwide radio paging cooperative  organization in China, as well as a network with the most users  and the widest area of information service coverage. A would-be  user may apply for the service in his or her city, and may  obtain a "nationwide paging service card." Along with the card,  he or she will be given a beeper at any of the cities covered by  the network. Each user has a "nationwide paging number" and can  be reached at any of those cities. It takes two calls at most  to reach a user.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Analysts search for 'headline' earnings LEADING financial analysts yesterday called for companies to provide a new 'headline' earnings figure in their annual accounts which would show their trading performance. In a widely circulated draft, the Institute of Investment Management and Research, formerly the Society of Investment Analysts, calls for the publication of a new figure which strips out the effect of profits or losses on capital items. The proposal has been generated by the changes brought about by FRS 3, the new accountancy standard on the profit and loss account, which places all elements of company performance above the line, or before the earnings figure. However, the standard also leaves scope for companies to quote a second earnings figure on a different basis, and the institute is hoping that its own version will become an industry standard. The headline figure would remove all profits or losses including the tax effects of goodwill, prior year adjustments, the costs of eliminating discontinued operations, and the sale of fixed assets or businesses except those bought for resale. The idea is to provide a universally adopted figure which would be robust, factual and reflect a company's trading position during the year. The institute is holding discussions with the Stock Exchange which could lead to an amendment to the 'Yellow Book' of listing requirements for quoted companies, and would require them to include the new figure in their preliminary announcements. The headline earnings figure is also likely to be partially adopted by the Financial Times, which will mention it in company results stories and may adopt it as the basis for calculating price/earnings ratios. Other organisations such as Extel will also adopt the headline figure in their stories. The new figure was produced by a sub-committee created by the institute on the day the final version of FRS 3 was published late last year. Originally it proposed a 'maintainable' earnings figure which would have attempted to show a company's future profitability. But it concluded that it was impossible to derive such a figure consistently since so much depended on judgment. Mr David Damant, chairman of the committee, said: 'A definition of earnings refers to a number chosen for a specified purpose. One number cannot do everything.' He added that calculating a maintainable earnings figure would remain the preserve of individual analysts and research firms. The institute's exposure draft supports the idea of FRS 3 as 'realistic and constructive'. But it says there will continue to be the need for an earnings figure as an unambiguous reference point which encapsulates a company's performance. The institute's proposals are out for consultation until April 30. It hopes to have its recommendations in force by the summer, when FRS 3 becomes compulsory for companies with year ends after June 22.</p>

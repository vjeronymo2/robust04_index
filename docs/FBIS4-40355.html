			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 15, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet accepted  Tuesday a free trade agreement with the European Union (EU).  The Latvian and EU delegations plan to sign the agreement on  June 20, the Foreign Ministry's EU Affairs State Minister  Olgerts Pavlovskis said at a press conference.    Pavlovskis said that the free trade agreement with the EU is  very important for the development of Latvia's economy.    Pavlovskis stressed that the agreement will not negatively  influence Latvia's agriculture and industry, because, according  to the initialed agreement, Latvia will have a transitional  period for four years during which the import duty tariffs for  the EU states' agricultural produce will be gradually decreased.    The Agricultural Ministry's specialists support the ready  for  signing additional protocols to the free trade agreement,  providing for the procedure of decreasing of agricultural  products' import duty tariffs, because the agreement itself  provides for protecting Latvia's inner market from flowing in of  too much EU agricultural products, said Pavlovskis.    The free trade agreement with the EU will promote the  flowing  in of foreign investments in Latvia and establishing of joint  ventures with the local producers, whose produce could be sold  in the markets of the European states.    Pavlovskis noted that the quota for industrial and  agricultural produce can be revised once in three years thus  effectively regulating the development of Latvia's foreign trade.    The Latvian 5th Saeima plans to accept the free trade  agreement with the EU in October.</p>

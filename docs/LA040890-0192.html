			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WATCH THAT COUNCIL  </P> <P> I would like to congratulate you on your new Ventura County section. I  delivered The Times as a boy and have been a faithful reader since that time.  </P> <P> Now I have one small request. Please expand your coverage of the Ventura City  Council. This group bears watching, as I noted in your article "Vote Delayed on  Ban of Big Boats in Yards." This ordinance was brought up without a public  hearing, and when I called this morning, they had no plans for a public  hearing. This affects me directly, as I just installed 90 feet of driveway and  a 12-by-30-foot pad to store my boat in the back yard.  </P> <P> The press is my only link to city government, and I can't emphasize how  important that link can be.  </P> <P> WYLEE D. McCRARY  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

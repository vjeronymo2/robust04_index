			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Performance, the only way to judge a trust's real worth - Classifications are no guide as to how a fund will perform The malaise afflicting classifications for unit trusts can be demonstrated by looking at the UK growth sector. While many of its 114 funds with five-year track records have much in common, a lot of others differ so much that there seems no reason to lump them all together. One way to address this problem is to split the sector into two parts - one having non-specialist funds, sometimes biased towards FT-SE stocks, that aim for no-frills growth; the other with funds pursuing growth with a twist, in other words, specialisation. We will look at these funds now and the non-specialist ones next week. Many specialist funds can be identified immediately by their names: special situations, recovery, ethical and enterprise are the most obvious. The distinctive nature of at least three of these translates into a unique five-year risk/return signature. Take the 18 special situations funds with five-year histories: they have been 26 per cent riskier than the sector average (risk here is represented by unit price volatility), and returns have been 30 per cent less. Recovery funds (12 of which have five-year records) have been marginally less risky (20 per cent greater than the average) and marginally less disappointing (a 24 per cent underperformance of the sector's average return). The five-year-old ethical funds (there are four of them) are the least risky of all the growth types, specialist and non-specialist, with risk 6 per cent less than the average and an average total return that matches the sector's average return, too. The enterprise funds, of which there are two, are classified as specialist because of their pursuit of aggressive growth plus strategies of the special situations type. The important point is that the special situation and recovery classes are not growth funds. Growth is a definable characteristic which is distinguished not by the fund's aim but by its style. Specifically, growth funds are those which pursue stocks with earnings growth rates higher than the market average; therefore, they will generally have an average price/earnings multiple higher than the market as well. Yet, I could not find any recovery or special situation funds with both these characteristics. Indeed, most recovery funds have virtually no exposure to growth stocks, and that is how it should be. Recovery is a highly cyclical theme which has virtually nothing to do with growth, whereas special situation funds tend to mix virtually every style possible. In the absence of proper classification, performance assessment is the thing to watch. We have applied two performance standards so as to cull the many into the few. The first is a simple test of whether a fund has beaten the FT-SE A All-Share index on a total return basis; but because cumulative return distorts performance, the returns used here are the sum of period-to-period returns. Managers could, of course, beat the market simply by taking riskier bets, so our second benchmark adjusts the returns of the All-Share for its risk. The same method has been applied to the 39 specialist funds I have surveyed in this sector. The resulting number for the All-Share is 0.29. Any funds that have been able to beat this, as well as the discrete total return for the All-Share (85.28), have been included in our main table. These standards constitute a tough test of ability to manage risk as well as return. Unfortunately,specialist funds do not fare well. PC Technical Analysis passes with a high risk/return rating (0.33) but fails with a lower than necessary total return, albeit one which is fourth out of 39. Much worse, no special situations fund betters either test (although Capability Special Situations just misses out), and only one of 12 recovery funds (Legal &amp; General's) is up to scratch. This result is perhaps understandable for recovery funds because their five-year records always will be hit hard by their cyclical sensitivity (although the strategic common sense of L&amp;G's Leslie Hooper - who bought high-quality stocks in bombed-out sectors rather than bombed-out stocks directly, and then switched into true recovery stocks when economic recovery was in sight - suggests that recovery management can be more than just a cyclical play). The non-representation from the 18 special situations funds, however, is a damning sign. There is no overwhelming reason, aside from the consistent bias towards small company stocks, why this type of fund should be dominated by cyclical trends. This wholesale failure might call the special situations concept into question except for one thing: the problem is not absence of potential but a scarcity of asset-allocation ability. The one specialist fund to make the grade, Schroder UK Enterprise, has a matchless record of total returns (its BM ratio of 1.31 is huge) and consistency (it has beaten the All-Share in all five years). For that matter, only two funds in the whole sector - Pembroke and Gartmore British Growth - have been able to give it a run for its money. Schroder's strength is that it has no particular specialisation; indeed it has had a mix of value, growth and stocks with small capitalisation over the past five years. The fund also has had a policy of boosting its returns by concentrating its portfolio in 25 stocks, which often means taking a 5-6 per cent bet on a particular company. This is a risky strategy - the fund's risk relative to its sector (obtained by dividing its price volatility number, the standard deviation, by the same for the sector average) is 1.08, or 8 per cent above the average. Yet, it has paid off. The high risk/return score of 0.37 not only says that the fund's total risk has been well-rewarded - its size also is a sure sign of ability at work.

NB The five year total is based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the five year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The benchmark (BM) ratio expresses the percentage non-cumulative total return outperformance over the FT-All Share by the fund over the five years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is measured by the standard deviation of monthly returns over five years to December 31, 1993. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by the sector's average standard deviation of 4.74. Risk/return is the division of the five-year average monthly total return by the five-year standard deviation of monthly returns. The five-year risk/return figure for the All-Share index is 0.29.

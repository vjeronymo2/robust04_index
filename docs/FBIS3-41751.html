			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by editorial board, ``Radiation Around Us''] </F>   [Text] This was reported by Nina Solovyeva, an expert from  the Novosibirsk Cytology and Genetics Institute, in the course  of a ``round table'' at the Russian Federation Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. According to  Miss Solovyeva, an examination of residents from the village of  Muchlyumovo located on the river Techa, 78 km downstream from  the radioactive waste discharge from the Mayak Scientific  Production Association, revealed elements in the chromosomes of  certain children which belong neither to the father nor to the  mother. In the physicians' opinion, this is a result of mutation  changes in the organism. Furthermore, the residents of  Muchlyumovo display impairments in their organism which are  typical only of this inhabited locality. Thus, e.g., the  ailments not detected in other regions include constant  dizziness, numbness in the body and limbs, nose and gum  bleeding, and gastrointestinal tract disorders. In attempts to  treat the residents of Muchlyumovo, children in particular  respond inadequately to drugs. Moreover, 33 cases of balding  have been recorded among children in recent years, some of them  involving total baldness, according to the Postfaktum Agency.</p>

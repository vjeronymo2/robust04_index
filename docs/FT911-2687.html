			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): The trend spotters - Chart Analysts 'OLD men in dirty white raincoats' was how a famous entrepreneur once described chart analysts, or so the legend goes. Exactly what the boffins of the financial markets had done to upset this particular financier is not known. But they had probably used their curious art to predict that one of his investments was on 'a downward trend.' To those with little familiarity of chart or technical analysis, much of it must seem like mumbo-jumbo. Strange lines drawn on charts reveals such things as 'head and shoulder' formations. They also claim to do the impossible: tell the future course of financial markets. However, for those with an interest in financial markets, particularly foreign exchange, the growth in influence of technical analysis during the last five years has been too great to ignore. One measure is the membership of the Society of Technical Analysts, which with 650 members is the largest chartists' organisation in the world. STA chairman Mr John Bream says that 10 years ago an STA 'teach-in' would attract 15 to 20 people. Now it is 80-100. The dynamic growth of the foreign exchange market during the last decade has led to renewed interest in the all-important question of what determines a particular currency's level. Over a period of years, the economic fundamentals of a country are what counts; for example, the declining competitiveness of American industry over the past ten years has led to a long-term decline in the dollar. The same has been true for sterling over an even greater time span. Economists have developed a theory which attempts to determine a currency's level based on economic fundamentals. It is called purchasing power parity (PPP) and calculates a currency rate on the basis of the different inflation levels prevailing in the two countries concerned. PPP is a useful tool for identifying trends over a number of years. However, it is of more limited use in determining where a currency is likely to be over a period of days or weeks. In fact, some chart analysts say that a currency can be out of line with its PPP value for up to five years. Undermining the importance of economic fundamentals on a short-term basis is the size of the currency market. With more than Dollars 180bn changing hands each day on the London market alone, and the world currency market 32 times greater than world trade, currencies often bear little relationship to underlying changes in the real economy, which by their very nature move at a far slower rate. Until the mid-1980s, corporate users of the foreign exchange market would use PPP and other economic reports to analyse the market and estimate where they were likely to move in the future. However, the experience was not always a happy one. Many lost money on the basis of PPP predictions. For an economist, if the currency failed to move in the direction predicted, the underlying assumptions would have to be revised. However, chart analysts can constantly revise their opinions. It was this experience which triggered a greater interest in technical analysis, particularly in broking houses which were advising the corporates. Few of today's foreign exchange managers do not have a knowledge of the trends which chart analysts have identified and the important points which have to be breached to confirm that trend. Essentially, chart analysis is a study of the balance of buyers and sellers in a market and the sentiment which follows from that. When a price breaks a certain level it is an indication that the balance between buyers and sellers has changed. This determines the sentiment in the market - bullish, bearish or neutral - which in turn will influence the way news items are perceived. So how do analysts apply this to their day-to-day work? Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank explains how he uses chart analysis in foreign exchange dealing. 'The first thing I do is run off charts showing the movement of different currencies over the past 48 hours, week and six months. I then look at the charts and try to establish trends by drawing lines between troughs and peaks. 'Once you have established a trend then you know whether a position you are taking is going to be with or against the trend - which is important to be aware of. The next thing is to look for consistent levels of support or resistance to movement. 'When a price has stopped falling it can mean there are lot of buyers there. If the currency succeeds in breaking through that support it means the buyers have been satisfied and it may be set to fall sharply. And by implication you expect it to fall to the next support level.' Mr Feeny says that these technical factors account for virtually 100 per cent of one day's trading movements. The only exception comes when there is a dramatic news item, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Over a two week basis, movement is still technical; after a month, its importance is declining but still the best indicator of movement; after three months, it is 50 per cent technical and 50 per cent economic fundamentals; over six months, fundamentals have become more important; and by one year it is all fundamentals. There are also longer-term trends which are caused by economic changes and can be determined by technical analysis. But as most companies are not interested in two or three year currency positions, this tends to be used less. Many traders use a mixture of personal judgement and technical analysis to determine their day-to-day market decisions. A September 1989 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research found that some chartists performed extremely well compared to a range of alternative forecasting procedures, but that they typically failed to predict turning points in the market. The use of judgement along with technical analysis makes this method more of an art than a science. This was shown up in the CEPR study, in which it tantalisingly revealed that one chartist, who it called 'M', had outperformed not only the alternative forecasting methods but also all the other chartists. To this day, M's identity remains a mystery.</p>

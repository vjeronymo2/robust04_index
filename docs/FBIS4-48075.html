			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of home affairs has issued a statement  regarding the work stoppage by some police officers in Maseru.  The statement said the commissioner of police had information  that police officers in Maseru will not go to work. He knew  this at 6 o'clock in the evening last night.    The statement said during discussions the commissioner  received written complaints from the police. It said this  morning those complaints were tabled before the defense  commission, which urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to table  them before the cabinet.    Most of the requests had already been presented to the  Ministry of Home Affairs by the commissioner of police.  Following the decision made by the cabinet, a committee was  established to look into their requests. The committee ended  its work last week and its findings will be announced soon.    The ministry therefore appeals to the police officers who  were not carrying out their normal duties to return to work, as  their requests were being attended to.    Meanwhile, the strike by police initially reported in Maseru  this morning has spread to other districts of the country, and  in Maseru looters took advantage of the situation and emptied  some of the shops situated at the old bus stop. The looted  shops include bakers and hypermarkets, prompting their owners to  call members of Security Lesotho to quell the looting. Members  of the Lesotho Defense Force also arrived at the scene to put  the situation under control.    Other districts affected by the strike are Mafiteng, Leribe,  and Butha Buthe. In Mafiteng the work stoppage began this  morning, when a notice saying there were no services was mounted  at the gate of the Mafiteng police station. Police officers who  normally assist at the district secretary's office also did not  turn up for work.    In Leribe the police said they began the strike after  receiving word from someone who said he was calling from the  police headquarters in Maseru informing them about the strike.  The news spread to the Butha Buthe police and they also joined  the action.</p>

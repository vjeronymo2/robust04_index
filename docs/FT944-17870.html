			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Fears over code on newspaper delivery The National Federation of Retail Newsagents yesterday said the government's code of practice on national newspaper distribution, published yesterday, could accelerate the expansion of multiple retailers at the expense of smaller independents. Mr David Daniel, director of federation services, said the code, which requires new newsagents to pay a deposit to secure wholesale supplies, risked intensifying competition for existing independents and deterring new ones. It was previously left to wholesalers to decide whether to supply new newsagents.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN READY TO EASE STORE RULES  </P> <P> Japan is ready to comply with U.S. demands to ease enforcement of a law  regulating the establishment of large retail stores, the minister of  international trade and industry said today.  </P> <P> U.S. trade negotiators listed Japan's large retail store law as one of several  barriers to American imports to Japan.  </P> <P> "At the moment I think it will be sufficient to ease the law, but in three  years we may have to make a drastic change," said Trade Minister Kabun Muto.  </P> <P> The retail store law, designed to protect tiny family stores, requires large  stores to seek approval of the smaller stores in a neighborhood before opening.  </P></p>

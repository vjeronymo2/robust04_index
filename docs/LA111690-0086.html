			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAR VET'S PROMISE FULFILLED;  </P> <P> SEARCH: A TORRANCE MAN FINALLY HOOKS UP WITH THE WOMAN HE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO  THAT HE WOULD FIND HER GI FATHER'S GRAVE IN A BELGIAN CEMETERY.  </P> <P> Four years after they met at a peace march in Barstow, Wallace Perry finally  found Marylyn Scott on Thursday to tell her he had kept a promise.  </P> <P> In a telephone call that ended a lengthy quest, Perry, 67, of Torrance, told  Scott that he had found her father's grave in Belgium, just as she had asked in  March, 1986.  </P> <P> "I'm so touched," Marylyn Scott, 53, said by phone from Ukiah, in Northern  California.  </P> <P> Said Perry: "I feel like I'm floating."  </P> <P> Perry met Scott as the Great Peace March passed through Barstow. The Army Air  Corps veteran of World War II told Scott that he often traveled to Belgium,  where he is organizing support for a peace memorial.  </P> <P> Scott asked Perry if he could find the grave site of her father, Pvt. George  Scott, killed Sept. 4, 1944, in a tank battle in Belgium. And if Perry did find  it, she asked, would he place a medal inscribed "Peace on Earth" on the grave?  </P> <P> During a 1988 trip to Belgium, Perry made a Memorial Day visit to the American  Cemetery in Henri-Chapelle and found Scott's grave.  </P> <P> After returning to the United States, he tried unsuccessfully by phone and mail  to contact Marylyn Scott at her home outside Calpella, in Mendocino County.  </P> <P> A Veterans Day story of Perry's quest led to phone calls from Scott's friends  in Los Angeles. They told Perry that she could be reached either at the private  grade school where she teaches or at the Mendocino Environmental Center, where  she volunteers.  </P> <P> On Thursday afternoon, Perry finally reached Scott at the school.  </P> <P> "She said she felt honored by what I had done," said Perry, who is making plans  to meet with Scott again. "I told her, 'What the heck. A promise made is a  promise kept.' "  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Scott said she remembered Perry's promise but never  received his letters. The mother of six said she never tried to contact Perry  because "I felt that he was probably too busy with his life, and I was busy  with mine."  </P> <P> Perry's odyssey, Scott said, was a poignant tribute to a father she remembers  as a good man.  </P> <P> "I remember my father very well," said Scott, who was 7 years old when Pvt.  Scott died. "He didn't have to go to war at his age and with a family. But he  felt he had to fight for peace."  </P> <P> Her memories, she said, have been strengthened by Perry.  </P> <P> "It is as though Wallace brought my father's spirit alive for me," Scott said.  "And that is wonderful."  </P></p>

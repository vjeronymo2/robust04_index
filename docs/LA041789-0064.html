			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> 'JEKYLL, HYDE' FOUND IN WINE  </P> <P> Many red wines contain a "Jekyll and Hyde" chemical that is both a mutagen (a  chemical causing mutations in cells) and a potent anti-cancer chemical,  according to microbiologist Terrance Leighton of UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> The chemical, called quercetin, occurs naturally in high concentrations in  onions and garlic and in lower concentrations in many fruits and vegetables,  including the grapes used for making red wines. Recent studies in China have  shown that Chinese who eat diets high in onions and garlic have only  one-quarter as much stomach cancer as the general population there.  </P> <P> In his study of 250 red wines from around the world, Leighton, who owns the  Kalin Cellars Winery in Novato, found quercetin only in those that had not been  treated with a chemical called PVPP during "fining," the process of removing  fine solids from the wine. Quercetin binds to PVPP and is removed. Leighton  noted that there is no danger in drinking red wines because the  anti-carcinogenic effect of the chemical is much greater than the mutagenic  effect.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata voiced optimism Monday [24  January] that the government can secure Diet approval for  political reform bills before the current session ends Saturday.  "I think the political reform bills are sure to be passed by  the Diet because there are still opportunities for  negotiations," Hata told a meeting with business executives at a  Tokyo hotel.    Hata, who is also head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party),  said the package can still be approved either by a joint panel  of both houses of the Diet or by a two-thirds majority at the  House of Representatives.    The House of Councillors rejected the package of four bills  Friday. Seventeen rebel members of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), the largest force in the ruling coalition, joined members  of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Japanese  Communist Party to vote down the package.    Hata said the enactment of the four reform bills, which  would  introduce a new election system and measures designed to curtail  corruption, would produce "dynamism" in Japanese politics  because it would activate stalled debates in the Diet. He  brushed aside suggestions for corruption prevention measures to  be enacted before overall political reform, saying the root of  political corruption lies in the current multiseat constituency  system.    Touching on the sluggish economy, Hata predicted that the  future of Japan's economy is not so gloomy, although it is  unlikely to recover immediately. He told the audience of  executives and managers from across Japan that compiling of the  state budget and carrying out deregulations are essential for  the economy, saying it would boost demand in Japan, open markets  for other countries and improve public life.    The foreign minister expressed willingness for Japan to  become a permanent member of the United Nations Security  Council, saying Japan has various techniques and know-how to  offer to the world besides money and that its role is to extend  them to the world. Hata said Japan should take initiatives on  the international scene and put forward its own proposals.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Loss from fraud 'likely to rise' BANKING institutions and individual investors face the prospect of mounting losses through increasingly sophisticated and widespread financial fraud, a seminar organised by the International Chamber of Commerce heard yesterday. 'There is a need for the banking industry to tackle this problem and come out openly and strongly against it,' said Mr Eric Ellen, chief executive of the chamber's Business Security Services. 'The problem is widespread and waiting to erupt.' Delegates, including senior bankers, private investigators and police officers, were given a large restricted-access file compiled by the ICC's Commercial Crime Bureau identifying types of fraudulent banking transaction which appear to be increasing. The seminar focused in particular on fraudulent standby letters of credit. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee from a bank to a customer that it will honour that customer's trade debts to a third party. The letter can be used as collateral to borrow funds. Professor James Byrne, a US commercial law expert, told the seminar that fraudsters were taking advantage of the proliferation of laws and the complexity of international guidelines to couch documents in highly legalistic language. The quality of documents was in many cases enhanced by highly developed copying machines and intercepted swift codes - swift is a fast computer-based communication system banks use to transfer messages on transactions and which can replace telexes. One senior police officer told the conference one problem in pursuing fraud cases was that banks sometimes refused to co-operate on the grounds of confidentiality. Without more support from the banks the police did not have the resources to deal with the problem. 'Unless the banking fraternity gets its act together, financial fraud is just going to mushroom,' he told the seminar. A vice-president of a US bank said that the international recession had brought about a 'cocktail of circumstances' in which fraudsters were flourishing.</p>

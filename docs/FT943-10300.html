			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Mexican shares given greater SEAQ display Mexican equities will be quoted on the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ International screen under their own country heading from August 15, the Stock Exchange said yesterday. The exchange said the move 'recognises the maturing of the Mexican market'. Mexican shares are already listed on SEAQ International, the Exchange's bulletin board for dealing prices in non-UK shares, but only under a broader Developing Markets Sector. The total volume of SEAQ International in firm-quoted Mexican stocks last year was Pounds 3.6bn, or 4 per cent of volume on the Mexican Stock Exchange.</p>

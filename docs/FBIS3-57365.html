The same source has made  it known that the most probable destination for the Duma is in  southeast Moscow, in the building of Moscow's Academy of  Management. Incidentally, this option was discussed during the  meeting between President Yeltsin and Speaker Rybkin last week  after Mr. Rybkin came in for criticism from the leaders of Duma  factions for his excessive pliancy.</p>

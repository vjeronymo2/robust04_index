			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL;  </P> <P> RENOVATION TO EXPAND MAINPLACE/SANTA ANA NEARS COMPLETION  </P> <P> The $7-million renovation of the MainPlace/Santa Ana shopping mall is now more  than half complete, an expansion that will add a new wing with 32,500 square  feet of leaseable space.  </P> <P> The construction will add 20 new stores by the time it is completed in  November.  </P> <P> In addition, a 150,000-square-foot May Co. department store is planned to open  next spring. The May Co. will be the mall's fourth anchor store, joining  Nordstrom, Bullocks and Robinson's. The expansion will increase the size of the  mall, one of the newest in Orange County, to about 200 retail establishments.  </P> <P> Sandwiched between the twin pillars of Orange County consumerism -- South Coast  Plaza in Costa Mesa to the south and Brea Mall to the north -- MainPlace is  planning to go upscale as well. It is already the third largest mall in the  county in terms of sales, the most recent figures available from the State  Board of Equalization.  </P> <P> Like some competitors, it has also tapped into the tourist trade. The mall  operates a shuttle bus to Anaheim area hotels. The move has been so popular  that it has been expanded to include two shuttles, serving a total of 22  hotels.  </P></p>

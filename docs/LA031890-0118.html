			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAINLAND NOT ISLAND  </P> <P> More accuracy is needed in the Travel Section. Your Feb. 25 edition contained a  photograph whose caption stated that Livorno is on the island of Elba.  </P> <P> The town is, in fact, on the mainland.  </P> <P> In the same edition, John Haase's article on New Zealand ("Nature Supreme in  Bay of Islands") claims the Bay of Islands was discovered by Capt. Cook in  1796. Not easy: the good captain died in 1779. The discovery was made, in fact,  in 1769.  </P> <P> PETER BARNA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

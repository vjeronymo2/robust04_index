			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Bank union seeks action on raids THERE are seven raids on high-street banks and building societies every day, Bifu, the banking union claimed yesterday. Bifu called for urgent action to improve security, train staff and provide better support for those affected by raids. It also called on the government to toughen laws on carrying, advertising and distributing replica weapons which are used in many raids and are often indistinguishable from real weapons. The details emerged at the launch of a series of draft guidelines on bank raids developed by the Health &amp; Safety Executive in conjunction with Bifu, employers, police, government officials and the Victim Support Group. The guidelines, out for consultation for three months, call for better training, improved counselling for those affected by raids and additional co-ordination with the police.</p>

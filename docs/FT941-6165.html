			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Puzzle grows over Buthelezi election role Uncertainty about Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's role in South Africa's elections heightened yesterday when the Inkatha Freedom party leader responded angrily to President FW de Klerk's earlier warning that security forces would prevent disruption of the poll. 'We need to separate the kingdom of KwaZulu from the rest of South Africa,' Chief Buthelezi told a meeting of the KwaZulu homeland legislative assembly in the homeland capital Ulundi. The position of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in post-apartheid South Africa had not yet been resolved, he said, and called for a separate Zulu kingdom. On Tuesday, Chief Buthelezi said he was prepared to register Inkatha for South Africa's first all-race poll, but a final decision would depend on his constitutional demands being met. The offer was made after talks with his main black rival, ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Durban. It was not clear if Chief Buthelezi would go ahead with Inkatha's registration after yesterday's developments. Speaking in Cape Town, Mr de Klerk welcomed Chief Buthelezi's apparent offer, but stressed the April 26-28 election would take place as scheduled. 'From the government's side, the security forces will be used, the law will be applied. . . to ensure the election is free and fair. The government will use everything at its disposal to ensure law and order will be maintained and the elections go ahead as planned,' he said. The government had a contingency plan to ensure voting took place in the Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu black homelands, both members of the autonomy-seeking Freedom Alliance of white and black conservatives including Inkatha, Mr de Klerk added. 'I will ensure the maintenance of law and order and use all the facilities available to the state to that effect, according to the threat and situation as it develops.' Chief Buthelezi told the Ulundi assembly the sovereignty of the kingdom was threatened by government and ANC 'manipulation' of constitutional negotiations.</p>

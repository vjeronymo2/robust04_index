			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- A new Japanese package of  market-opening measures is a "significant step" in trade  negotiations with the United States, despite U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor's grim assessment of the plan, a  government source said Wednesday [30 March]. The source was  commenting on Kantor's overnight comments in Washington that the  measures, announced in Tokyo on Tuesday, do not meet U.S.  concerns on bilateral trade issues ranging from auto trade to  government procurement.    The source also stressed that Japan expects to announce an  additional market-opening package in June for presentation at  the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrial nations set for  July in Naples, Italy. He also expressed hope that the latest  package will lead to a resumption of bilateral "framework" trade  talks that broke down in mid-February.</p>

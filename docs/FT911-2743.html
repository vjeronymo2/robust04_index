			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Tax debate dominates election battles THE Labour and Conservative parties are banking on winning the debate over the replacement for the poll tax as electioneering for the Monmouth by-election begins and the council campaign enters its final days. The cost to households of the government's proposed 'council tax' and Labour's 'fair rates' yesterday dominated clashes as the council campaign intensified ahead of polling next Thursday. Meanwhile, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, launched the Conservatives' campaign to retain the Monmouth constituency on May 16 with figures showing how the council tax would affect its voters. The party is defending a majority of 9,350 against strong campaigning from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. All three parties are anxious to make a good start in the campaign that will influence Mr John Major's choice of a general election date. Labour, which believes it has already established itself as the main challenger to the Tories, sent Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, to campaign. The Liberal Democrats fielded Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. In 1987 Labour came second, but the former Alliance parties were less than 2,000 behind. The present contest was caused by the death of Sir John Stradling Thomas, a former deputy chief whip. Mr Hunt said the average Monmouth household would pay Pounds 194 under the Tory proposals compared with a rates bill of Pounds 453 under Labour's. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, retal-iated by claiming the Tories were favouring a scheme in which the average house-hold would be 'surcharged' to subsidise the wealthy and single-person households. Labour's proposals, he insisted, would cost the average household Pounds 67 less than the council tax. The Liberal Democrats will this weekend list councils on which the party expects to take control next week.</p>

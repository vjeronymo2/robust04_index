			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina, Yuriy Sizov, </F> and Nikolay Sorokin]    [Text] Kazan, 31 May -- "An example of the economic  approach to economic management" was how Boris Yeltsin described  the Mayskiy state farm, which he visited on Tuesday during his  two-day working trip to Tatarstan. The Russian president also  pointed to its high profit level and progressive production  methods in the growing of vegetables. Even so, Mintimer  Shaymiyev, Tatarstan's president, acknowledged that the  republican's agricultural industry could not have developed  without subsidies from the Russian budget.    Fatikh Sibagatullin, minister of agriculture and food, said  in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents that 80 billion  rubles [R] had been transferred to the republic from the Russian  exchequer to meet rural needs and, following the arrival in  Kazan of Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the  republic's agricultural sector would receive in June a further  R35 billion in the form of credits. It is evidently for this  reason that Tatarstan manages to keep food prices lower than in  other regions.    However, Boris Yeltsin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that  "these sums should not be called subsidies: Tatarstan and  ourselves live on the basis of a treaty, and we arrange our  division of labor and finances in accordance with it." The  president of the Russian Federation explained the fact that  Tatarstan has owed the Russian budget R43 billion since the  beginning of the year as being due to the general cash-flow  problem. Mintimer Shaymiyev told journalists that, once the  cash-flow problem has been solved, Tatarstan's debts to the  federal budget would be paid off.</p>

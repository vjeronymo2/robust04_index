			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Press review] </F>   [Text] Writing about the Syrian-Lebanese summit and the  unified position of the two countries, TISHRIN says: Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi have held talks on enhancing  fraternal bilateral ties, the peace process, and the continuous  Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon.    TISHRIN notes the continuing Syrian-Lebanese coordination on  all hot issues, primarily on the peace process and Israel's  attempts to escape its obligations, especially withdrawal from  the Golan and southern Lebanon.    The paper further highlights Israel's attempts to disturb  the  distinguished Syrian-Lebanese relationship and drive Lebanon to  unilaterally conclude a suspect settlement. Israel is doing  this through making threats and carrying out attacks. Israel's  efforts are in vain because the Syrian-Lebanese relationship has  reached a historic state of cohesion between the two fraternal  countries. The two countries have faced Israel's prevarications  and exposed maneuvers with a unified position, whether at the  Washington talks or directly on the ground. Despite all the  damage it has done to southern Lebanon, Israel could not make  Lebanon drop its demand for the entire south or stop its  coordination with Syria. The two countries share the same  destiny and security and harm done to one of them harms the  other.    TISHRIN goes on: Experience has shown that the strength of  Lebanon and Syria lies in their unified position. Israel is  trying to disengage the two countries and drag them one after  the other to conclude unilateral, unfair agreements according to  which part of the territory would be lost. Despite the fact  that Syria and Lebanon have shown willingness to establish a  just, comprehensive, and firm peace in the region, Israel has to  date not pledged, even for once, to withdraw from the Golan and  southern Lebanon. In fact, it is asking Lebanon to conclude a  treaty in advance and to make security arrangements. It is  giving hints to Syria about a partial withdrawal on the Golan  and that it will conduct a referendum on its fate. If anything,  this position proves that Israel is taking lightly the peace  process, the U.S. initiative, Security Council resolutions, and  the Geneva charters.    Syrian-Lebanese coordination is the best reply to such  outright Israeli intransigence and schemes to undermine  Lebanon's sovereignty over its territory and Syria's sovereignty  over the Golan. Syria has proven over the years its  willingness, in word and deed, to help Lebanon and share its  bread and butter with it.    Concluding, TISHRIN asserts that Syria will remain by  Lebanon's side. If there are people in Israel who are wagering  on a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement, they are certainly  entertaining illusions. The Syrian-Lebanese relationship is  expected to grow and develop further. Coordination will  continue in the mutual interest of the two countries and for the  good of the Arab nation.    AL-BA'TH also comments on the importance of cooperation and  coordination between Syria and Lebanon, as well as the peace  process and Israel's hard-line approach toward any progress in  this process.    The Syrian-Lebanese summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad  and Ilyas al-Hirawi reasserts the commitment of the two  fraternal countries to a just and comprehensive peace, without  any relinquishment or concession. The two countries also reject  all Israeli maneuvers and plots aimed at taking on the Arabs one  at a time and imposing its distorted, incomplete peace.    AL-BA'TH says the above principles also consolidate  Syrian-Lebanese ties, based on cooperation and coordination in  all fields. These ties are an example of what brotherly  relations should be like, to serve the one people in the two  countries and the higher Arab interests. As for the hard-line  Israeli positions on the peace process, the paper says these  stands do not leave any room for optimism -- in the short and  long run -- about prospects for progress in the peace process.  Israel is still placing more and more hurdles to the bilateral  talks in Washington by totally refusing to commit itself to the  major principles on which the peace process was launched,  primarily Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and  the land-for-peace principle.    The paper asserts that Israel has greatly benefited from the  serious achievement it has made on the Arab level by signing the  Gaza-Jericho accord with the PLO -- an agreement which Israel  wants as a model for other agreements it wants to conclude with  the rest of the Arab states involved in the peace process.    AL-BA'TH concludes: In light of the above, the Arabs had to  embark on vital, concrete activity to straighten things out. In  this context came the historic Geneva summit between Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. The summit has succeeded, by  all standards, in stressing the major foundations of peace and  crystallizing a general international approach that is committed  to a just and comprehensive peace that liberates all of the  occupied Arab territories and restores all usurped rights.</p>

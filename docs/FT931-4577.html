			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: CNBC plans expansion in Europe and east Asia CNBC, the NBC cable television channel that specialises in business news, is planning to expand in Europe and eastern Asia. The 24-hour channel carries around 12 hours a day of programmes devoted to Wall Street, supplemented by consumer and other news, in a format described as 'money during the day and talk at night'. Several individual CNBC programmes are already broadcast to Europe on Super Channel, the pan-European channel which claims it is available in around 50m homes. CNBC is expected to announce today a significant expansion of programming carried on Super Channel. It is also considering significant expansion in Asia by joining a satellite system there.</p>

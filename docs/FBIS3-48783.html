U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor "is ready to  announce  that competition policy should be the next main agenda for the  next GATT round," Keio University Associate Professor Jiro  Tamura, a participant in the Brookings Institution competition  policy project, told a seminar sponsored by the Japanese  American Citizens League.    Tamura later told a journalist he was informed by a chief  economist at the Washington-based think-tank earlier in the day  that Kantor "looks like" he is going to propose competition  policy as the new theme for the next round of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT.)    The last round of the 117-nation trade organization was  finally concluded last month after seven years of negotiations.  Tamura said trade negotiators are likely to meet toward the end  of this year to mull over a topic for the next round, which will  be conducted under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the new  name for the GATT umbrella organization.    Competition policy is a broad concept that includes better  enforcement of anti-trust laws so that companies will compete  with each other in a free and fair manner, he said. The term  would include crackdowns on cartels and mergers, and restrictive  business practices.    Tamura told the seminar on Japan-U.S. relations in 1994 that  anti-competitive practices such as company-led boycotts, where  manufacturers agree not to provide products to discounters to  drive them out of business, have been common in Japan. But he  said that the U.S. approach to enforcing anti-trust laws is not  suitable for Japan because of a tradition of cozy ties between  regulators and industry.    "The confrontational approach in this country just doesn't  work," said Tamura, an adviser to Japan's Fair Trade Commission  (FTC).    Tamura said the FTC has been relatively ineffective in part  because powerful bureaucracies such as the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry and the Finance Ministry have  been uncooperative in the interest of protecting their turf.    For competition policy to be successfully implemented in  Japan, the powerful ministries must be given a role in carrying  it out, he said.</p>

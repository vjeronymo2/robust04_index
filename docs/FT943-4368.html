			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Computerised speech enhanced A computer that will enable people who cannot speak to talk in a human-sounding voice - with emotion and at a natural speed - is being developed by a consortium of European universities and companies. Two prototype devices are under test and the consortium is confident that a working device will be available within 2 1/2 years, Dr Iain Murray of Dundee University said at the British Association science festival in Loughborough yesterday. Talking machines have been available for many years, and speech has been added to a number of consumer products. Dr Murray said that had been done mostly in the form of 'consumer gimmicks'. Aids for disabled people form an important and growing market for talking computers - especially machines that convert text into speech for the blind and generate speech for the voiceless. The quality of the speech synthesised by computers is improving rapidly. The rules for converting from text to speech are complex, and are different for every language. The new machine relies on recent work that makes synthetic speech more natural by adding variations in pitch and voice quality which resemble those produced by a human speaker. A module that adds emotion effects to synthetic speech, developed by Dr Murray, is an important part of the system. The most important feature of the new device is that it will include special software components to enable disabled users to generate speech at normal conversational speeds. That would be impossible if text had to be typed in word by word. One component - predictive active lexicon, licensed to Lander Software of Glasgow - learns what words the user is likely to say in a given context. The other - called Talk: About and marketed by Don Johnson of Chicago - predicts what phrases are likely to occur. Commands to generate speech can be issued rapidly enough to maintain a natural conversation. With the new device, it will be possible within three years to use a computer to speak on behalf of an individual. Speaking to a computer is much further away. Progress is being made in recognising speech - that is in converting the sounds into words. Understanding what the words mean is much more difficult, said Dr Murray. The most successful word recognition systems recognise single words with an accuracy between 60 per cent and 99 per cent. Extracting the words from a stream of continuous speech is not yet possible, said Dr Murray. Recognition of single words is good enough for applications in which only a limited number of words needs to be used. Systems that handle simple travel enquiries are already in use. Dr Murray said the prospect of holding a conversation with a computer was probably 20 years away.</p>

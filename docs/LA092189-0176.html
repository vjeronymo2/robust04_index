			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIT FUNDING INCREASES L.A. ARTS ENDOWMENT BUDGET  </P> <P> The windfall of arts funds for local artists, which began with the passage last  November of the more than $20 million Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts, is  getting a $2.7-million addition -- plus several million more in years to come  -- from another local government agency, the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission. The agency is allocating one-half of 1% of all construction costs  for its rail transit commuter lines for public art works in each of its  stations.  </P> <P> According to the LACTC's Public Art Administrator Jessica Cusick, who is  responsible for the commission's Art for Rail Transit program, the commission  plans to "promote a wide variety of visual art" through the program, including  sculpture, wall murals and artistic design features such as benches, fences and  lighting. At least one piece of public art will be installed in each station,  and artists will be involved in the design process of some of the stations as  well.  </P> <P> The move, which Cusick said will improve the neighborhoods and communities  through which the aboveground light rail transit lines pass, is the latest in  what public arts administrators are calling a new outlook on the importance of  public art.  </P> <P> "I see it entirely as a quality of life issue," said Barbara Goldstein, project  coordinator for the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs department, during a Tuesday  night meeting with local artists at Barnsdall Art Park. "People are beginning  to see the way the arts can be used as a way to enhance the quality of life in  Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Ray Grabinski, LACTC Commissioner and Long Beach City Councilman, said artists  are not the only ones who will benefit from the windfall of funds being spent  on public arts.  </P> <P> He said that art in public transportation systems "makes waiting in a station  more of an event, and takes away some of the apprehension and a little of the  waiting time."  </P> <P> "What we hope to do is expand the public's awareness of contemporary art,"  Cusick said of the Art for Rail Transit program, which will begin with the  first commuter line -- the 22-mile Long Beach-to-downtown Los Angeles Blue Line  which is scheduled to open next July.  </P> <P> But the program will not end there, as LACTC will be commissioning artists "for  years to come," Cusick said. She said that in addition to the $2.7-million art  budget for the Blue Line, the commission expects an arts fund of $1.5 million  to $2 million for its 20-mile Norwalk-to-El Segundo Green Line (scheduled to  open in 1994), and similar amounts for future lines (four are currently under  consideration).  </P> <P> (In a separate program for the rail transit's downtown underground Metrorail  portion known as the Red Line, which is administered by the Rapid Transit  District, $575,000 has been allocated for artists' fees and the construction of  art in those stations.)  </P></p>

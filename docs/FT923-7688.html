			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Publishers defiant in spite of UBS writ on Smith THE ESCALATING dispute over the book Accounting for Growth intensified yesterday when UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, served a writ on the book's author and its publisher. Mr Terry Smith, head of the firm's UK research department who wrote the book, was suspended on Wednesday for allegedly breaching internal procedures with regard to the book. The writ is brought in the name of UBS and four of its UK subsidiaries against Mr Smith and Random House, which is due to publish the book in mid-September. It alleges infringement of copyright, disclosing confidential information used to help prepare the book, 'passing off' by associating the firm's name with it, and breach of contract of employment. Accounting for Growth examines a number of techniques used by large UK quoted companies which have the effect of producing high earnings figures and make the balance sheet appear less geared than it is. UBS said yesterday that Mr Smith did not go through the normal channels, including clearing the book through the firm's own editorial committee and sending copies to the companies mentioned to check for accuracy. Mr Smith said yesterday: 'I have no intention of withdrawing the publication. I have signed a contract and I can't possibly back down.' Random House said it was going ahead with publication. 'We are confident and we are going to contest the writ vigorously,' a spokeswoman said. The book is due to be published on September 15 for Pounds 25. However, it is understood that a paperback version could be ready for sale as soon as next week for Pounds 12.99. The name of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which was printed on the front cover of the book below Mr Smith's name, will be removed. Reports of the book published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper and in Accountancy Age, a specialist magazine, led to complaints to UBS from Grand Metropolitan, which was named as using more of the techniques than any other company. The report triggered complaints from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of GrandMet, to Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.</p>

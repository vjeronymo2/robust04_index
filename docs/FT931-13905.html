			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: No longer a dirty word THE government is searching for an industrial strategy. It is a serious project. More than any other, it may ultimately define the extent to which Mr John Major's government breaks with the 1980s. The shift began with the package of tax incentives and export assistance for industry in the 1992 Autumn Statement. In part it was dictated by circumstance. Driven from the European exchange rate mechanism, the government needed something with a strategic ring to it. But Mr Major has not lost interest. Quite the reverse. The March 16 Budget will see the Treasury obliged to bury the rest of a Lawsonian theology which treated widget manufacturers no differently from fast-food outlets. The prime minister was never convinced by sophisticated arguments that the trade deficit would in the end look after itself. The message from 10 Downing Street is that manufacturing counts: that the prime minister sees no reason why British companies cannot compete again in industrial sectors which they all but abandoned during the the 1970 and 1980s. He is interested in exports, he wants ministers to bat for Britain. The renaissance of the car industry is offered as a model. Mr Major is leading by example. Last week he spent a morning talking to the managers of the country's leading food producers, processors, retailers and caterers. He wanted to know what the government could do to help them compete effectively in domestic and overseas markets. At the front of his mind was a Pounds 5bn trade deficit in food products. On Saturday a further 20 captains of industry will accompany him on his official aircraft on a 5-day trip to India, the first of many prime ministerial trade missions. Early in February cabinet ministers will be summoned to 10 Downing Street to explain how they intend to contribute to a renewed drive to lift the regulatory burden on business. Mr Major believes that the damaging impact on industrial competitiveness of excessive regulation is greatly under-estimated. Part of it is blamed on Brussels; much more on excessive zeal in Whitehall. The pro-industry message is being picked up across the government. Sir Terence Burns, the astute permanent secretary to the Treasury, has already instructed his senior officials to start meeting businessmen. (One mandarin confessed this week that it had never occurred to him to visit a factory. What were they like?). Budget submissions from manufacturing industry are no longer filed in Treasury wastebins. So far so good. It is hardly surprising that a government stunned by the ERM debacle and an economy emerging uncertainty from such a prolonged recession goes out of its way to underpin business confidence. But more than the rhetoric is changing. The coal industry debacle and a squeeze in his department's budget have obscured the influence of Mr Michael Heseltine. His department may not have any extra money but its political clout has increased as that of the Treasury has declined. The trade and industry secretary is as concerned about securing institutional and cultural changes in Whitehall as about securing extra cash. Mr Heseltine's starting point is that the realities of international trade and industrial co-operation mean the government cannot avoid a role in shaping the future of strategic industries. Mr Major seems to agree with him. Purists on the right of the Tory party are horrified. Many cling to the 1980s orthodoxy that the government should do no more than set the macro-economic framework. Markets can then decide whether manufacturing industry sinks or swims. Already there are dark mutterings about a return to Heathite corporatism. They will grow louder when Mr Heseltine unveils plans to subsidise some of the 31 coal mines threatened with closure. In reality the pit handouts will have more to do with the politics of a Tory majority of only 21 than with any fundamental change of heart. The government is not seeking a return to the 1970s. Businessmen may find themselves chatting to the prime minister across the cabinet table, but there will be no places for the unions. Mr Major is not talking about subsidies for sunset industries. He sees the future in technological innovation, in turn driving a determination to increase opportunities in - and the status of - technical and vocational education. And the prime minister does believe a Thatcherite commitment to free markets can be melded with a strategy which gives the government a supporting, and occasionally a leading, role in shaping Britain's industrial future. We will have to wait for the Budget and beyond to see exactly what that means in practice. But it is important enough that interventionism is now seen as a misunderstood rather than a dirty word.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ THEIR LETTERS  </P> <P> I find it interesting that the letters defending New Kids on the Block ("Oh,  You Kids," June 10) appeared on the same day as the article in which their  manager admitted that New Kids sometimes lip-sync during their concerts.  </P> <P> The way I see it, New Kids are cleverly promoted entertainers rather than  musicians with any sort of artistic integrity.  </P> <P> I hardly think their new album merits a five-star rating (as Michelle Parkinson  suggested in her letter), unless we're giving points for unadulterated  commercialism.  </P> <P> As for the adults that go to New Kids' concerts with their children, one  wonders how many parents are there involuntarily simply because most of New  Kids' fans are too young to go to concerts unattended. Chris Willman's negative  review of "Step by Step" certainly won't stop it from selling millions of  copies, but the fact is that, as musicians, New Kids on the Block are great  dancers.  </P> <P> MELISSA HENRY  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Dagmar Bazlikov and Ludmila </F> Bulakova on a news conference given by Slovak Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar in Morda on 12 February on the outcome of the  HZDS leadership meeting; passages within quotation marks are  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Bazlikova] Questions by our colleagues from the  mass media could be divided into two basic spheres: One part  concerned the problems of early parliamentary elections, the  second further policies toward those who presented an  alternative of political realism to the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The first sphere includes a reply  to the question of whether the HZDS prefers early elections or a  referendum:    [Meciar] "Basically, there are various circumstances. It is  possible that we will agree with some of the parliamentary  parties so that we will have 90 votes in the parliament to adopt  a constitutional law on early elections--and, in that case,  there is no need to have a referendum on this question.    "Another alternative may arise, which is basically being  prepared by the opposition, who were for immediately calling  early elections, but now, when it seems to them that they could  have a majority in the National Council, they postpone this  immediately by one year. [words indistinct] in this case, there  are 350,000 citizens going for the referendum, who I assume will  support such initiative.    "The referendum is connected with yet another question--with  the right of the deputies to preserve an absolute mandate even  after they denounced the program with which they went into the  elections, even after they denounced the right that ensues for  them from the election law. And that is also the question that  the citizens should decide in a referendum.    "As to the period up to the early elections, I think they  should take place soon. Personally, I think that the election  period of the parliament should be shortened to one-half. The  bridging of this time is necessary and suitable. Naturally,  this will not lead to instability. In fact, it aids stability  because only those who really want to work in the government  will be in it, and not those who spend half of their working  hours trying to work out how to discredit them."    [Bazlikova] Asked whether Vladimir Meciar wants to go to the  elections as prime minister or as the head of the opposition  party, the HZDS chairman said:    [Meciar] "It is up to the parliament, not up to me. In no  circumstances do I intend to resign."    [Bazlikova] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar characterized the  possible early elections as follows:    [Meciar] "As to the early elections, I think that this time  the elections will include three large groupings: The HZDS will  be in the center of one group, the Party of Democratic Left  [SDL] will be in the center of another, and the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH] will be in the center of the third.  The decision about the results of the elections will be made  between the three. The SDL assumes that, if a party of similar  leanings wins the elections in Poland and probably will win them  in Hungary, it is its duty to win in Slovakia. We are doing all  we can not to fulfill this party's hopes."    [Bazlikova] The journalists also wondered whether the prime  minister assumed that the Slovak Parliament will dismiss his  Cabinet as early as at the meeting that will continue next week:    [Meciar] "As to the possibility of expressing no confidence  in the government--that always exists. In any case, whoever  attempts to do so must count on our reaction."    [Bazlikova] Asked whether he could indicate what this  reaction would be, the prime minister said unequivocally:    [Meciar] "No."    [Bulakova] The second part of the news conference, after the  extraordinary meeting of the republican leadership of the HZDS  in Modra yesterday, concerned the next moves against those who  initiated the Alternative of Political Realism, especially  against two members of the government--Deputy Prime Minister  Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. This is how  Vladimir Meciar responded to the possibility of their dismissal.    [Meciar] "It is a test of character. Both Dolgos [former  privatization minister] and Kucera [former education minister]  themselves asked to be recalled and resigned after the vote of  no-confidence in them was passed. They knew what their moral  duty was. For Moravcik and Kovac, it is a character test, a test  of their realization of what is their moral duty. They should  be given a chance to express themselves."    [Bulakova] In connection with the dismissal of these two  government members, the issue of who will replace them came  about. Commenting on this problem, Vladimir Meciar said, among  other things:    [Meciar] "The issue of their replacement is a matter for a  coalition agreement. To be honest, until the [republican]  leadership passed its decision [on Moravcik and Kovac], I  discussed with nobody whether this replacement could be dealt  with in some other way." [passage omitted]    [Bulakova] General questions were also voiced at the meeting  between the prime minister and journalists yesterday. One of  them concerned the assessment of the balance of political forces  in the Slovak Parliament. Speaking about this issue, Vladimir  Meciar said, among other things:    [Meciar] "Everyone has an axe to grind. For example,  Hungarian parties and Cernak [chairman of Slovak National  Party], or the Christian Democratic Party and the Party of the  Democratic Left. The parliament cannot carry out its work. It  is incapable of agreeing on anything other than issues directed  against the government and on the division of assets.    "A very dangerous precedent could arise as a result of the  structure [government of broad coalition] they want to set up in  this way. Everyone must have thought that the HZDS response  would be that the HZDS would split up and that it would be the  Hungarian political parties that would tip the balance of power  with regard to the stability of the government. Their policy is  widely known nowadays. Although the government, whose intention  is to work against us, would have votes, it would be incapable  of action. But if this government did not have these votes, it  would fall because the opposition, including the HZDS, would  have a clear majority. Unless, of course, they accept the  Hungarians into the government coalition. [passage omitted]    "But if they accept them into the coalition, they will have  to meet their demands. And you know what these demands are  directed at! From this you can judge what Slovakia's future  development would be like!"    [Bulakova] At the conclusion of the news conference, there  was a question whether--in quotation marks--the dropping out of  people from the HZDS was not a consequence of the fact that the  movement had delayed turning itself into a political party with  a clear political structure and ideological objectives.  Answering this question, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said,  among other things:    [Meciar] "This is not a dropping out; this is a cleansing  process. Because only that which is diseased, which does not  believe in itself, drops out. And that is good. The path of  honesty is the best path. The path of intrigues, of  decomposition, of social structures is a path leading nowhere.  One can only score one victory this way. But, at the same  time, such a victory amounts to a political defeat. The  movement's structures have been cleansed, and all of its  components are capable of carrying out normal political work."</p>

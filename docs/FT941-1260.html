			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ireland awards exploration licences Ten companies, grouped into five consortia, have been awarded petroleum exploration licences under Ireland's 1993 'frontier' licensing round. The 16-year licences cover 28 of the 128 blocks in the Slyne and Erris Troughs lying some 70km off the west and north-west Ireland, and represent the first major offshore exploration effort in the Republic since the early 1980s. The licence terms require some 5,000km of seismic and other geophysical testing to be carried out, followed by the drilling of exploration wells. Eleven of the 28 blocks have been licenced to a consortium headed by Statoil (UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. In announcing the licence awards this week, Mr Noel Treacy the Irish energy minister, said the response to the round had been 'very encouraging and vindicates our recent efforts to promote offshore exploration, particularly the 1992 licensing terms and taxation measures'. These measures include a concessionary corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for companies producing oil and gas under licence. The Slyne and Erris Troughs lie in water depths ranging from 200m to over 1,000m, and is a relatively unexplored area, having had only three exploratory wells drilled to date, although seismic surveys carried out in 1991 and 1992 suggested a 'significant potential' for both oil and gas. The current licensing round, covering 178 blocks in the Porcupine Basin off the west of Ireland, closes in December this year. Existing gas reserves in Ireland, at the shallower Kinsale and Ballycotton fields, are expected to be exhausted shortly after the year 2,000.</p>

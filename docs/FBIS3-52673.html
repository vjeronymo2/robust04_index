			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bill Hutman] </F>   [Text] The Jerusalem municipal planning committee  yesterday approved the first stage in the construction of a  Jewish housing project near the Bet Orot Yeshiva on the Mount of  Olives.    The committee voted 7-3 to allow Bet Orot to place a dozen  mobile homes on land adjoining the yeshiva, in the Arab  neighborhood of al-Tur.    The decision came after Mayor Ehud Olmert voiced his support  for the controversial project.    Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir (NRP) [National Religious Party]  said approval of the project reflects the new city council's  plans to increase the Jewish presence in eastern Jerusalem,  committee sources said.    Me'ir said the mobile homes would be followed by  conventional  housing, a position also voiced by Bet Orot officials in the  past.    Approval was given against the recommendations of the city's  planning department, which argued the land was earmarked for an  Arab school. In an opinion presented to the committee before  the vote, the department maintained the lot had to be rezoned  for the plan to be approved, committee sources said.    Committee head Uri Lupoliansky presented a letter stating  the  department promised to find another site for the Arab school,  signed by Jerusalem education department head Nisim Solomon.    But the planning department said no reasonable alternative  site exists for the Arab school.    Me'ir insisted he knows of four alternatives sites, but  declined to give their locations, sparking sharp criticism from  Councilor Yisra'el Shulderman (One Jerusalem).    Despite heated exchanges, the plan was easily passed by the  municipal coalition, joined by My Jerusalem's Yehoram Ga'on.  The one Meretz and two One Jerusalem members voted against the  plan.</p>

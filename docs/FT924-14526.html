			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (8): Hunt for cheaper locations - Taiwan is being forced to upgrade its industry SINCE the late 1980s, rising wages and property prices have narrowed profit margins for Taiwan's low-cost manufacturers, while the unwillingness of an increasingly well-off population to do low-status, low-paid factory work has led to a tight labour market. Faced with declining competitiveness, Taiwan is being forced to upgrade its industry and replace low-cost manufacturing, which is increasingly relocating to other cheaper Asian locations. Appreciation of the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar has not helped. Footwear manufacturers say that profit margins of between 5 and 12 per cent when the Taiwan dollar was at 40 to the US dollar, were completely eaten away when it appreciated to 25. Hardest hit and first to move operations overseas were textile companies, footwear manufacturers and producers of low value electronics. Manufacturing output in these areas has fallen by about 29 per cent since 1986. For example, production of electronic calculators fell from 68.3m sets in 1988 to 31.5m sets last year. Output of heavy industries and chemicals has continued to increase. However, falling margins have put pressure on companies' investment in research and development. The accelerating flow of investment overseas in recent months has led to concern that Taiwan's industrial base is being eroded. Meanwhile, as the economy matures, growth in services has consistently been about 2 per cent higher than manufacturing. Some economists fear a serious decline, or 'hollowing out', of Taiwan's industrial base. The Chung Hwa Institute for Economic Research has warned that as low-technology industry moves abroad, capital intensive industry must be upgraded and high technology businesses fostered to maintain smooth economic growth. The government is therefore offering tax holidays and low interest loans to companies wishing to upgrade operations. Government officials claim 'tens of billions' of Taiwan dollars will be available for this purpose, in the form of a cabinet development fund, to be administered on a case-by-case basis. It has also earmarked USDollars 22.7bn of a USDollars 303bn six-year infrastructure plan for industrial upgrading and research and development. Part of a USDollars 31.6bn budget for education and cultural facilities, will also go to help lift the number of qualified and skilled workers. Ten 'emerging industries' have been targeted for development, including telecommunications, information technology, consumer electronics and semiconductors. Within these industries, eight 'key technologies' have been highlighted for improvement, among them optoelectronics, industrial automation, advanced sensing technology and biotechnology. The government hopes that a large proportion of this technology will be imported, or made available as a result of joint ventures with foreign companies. One of the 10 selected industries is aerospace. Taiwan Aerospace, set up in 1991 to develop the island's aerospace industry, last month signed a memorandum of understanding with British Aerospace for co-production of regional aircraft. This should lead to significant transfers of technology from the UK. Taiwan's first semiconductor plant costing USDollars 152m is also a joint venture, between Texas Instruments of the US and one of Taiwan's leading computer manufacturers, Acer. The government is also providing funds to companies wanting to improve management and marketing skills. Because Taiwanese companies tend to be small and family-managed, they have not emphasised marketing. Sports equipment manufacturer Kunnan, which uses the brand name ProKennex, is one of the few Taiwan companies which has achieved a measure of brand-awareness globally. Some economists say, however, that government loans and spending will only help if the private sector simultaneously upgrades its industrial base. Private sector's gross fixed capital formation actually fell in 1990 for the first time since the early 1980s. Investment has since accelerated but is growing slower than government or public sector investment. Meanwhile, there are signs foreign investment is slowing. In the first eight months of this year investment fell 36 per cent to USDollars 870m while manufacturing investment fell 54 per cent. These figures are slightly distorted by legal changes which led to a rush of investment early last year. But businessmen in Taipei said the same factors which are forcing Taiwanese companies overseas, high costs and poor infrastructure, are also affecting foreign investors.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Here is the news . . . - Directors' transactions Biggest sale of the week came at Scottish newsagent and retailer John Menzies where the chairman, also John Menzies, sold 420,000 shares at 580p and Charles Ramsey, a non-executive director, disposed of 86,400 at the same price. The sale leaves both with very large chunks of stock - Menzies with more than 5m shares and Ramsey more than 2.3m. Mosaic Investments is responsible for licencing many of the cartoon characters featured on children's lunch boxes, toys and clothes. Ken Robinson, the director in charge of packaging consumables, has acquired 100,000 shares at 26p, which increases his holding by about 20 per cent. International Business Communications provides information services to professional newsletters and magazines. Over the past 12 months, its share price has risen by more than 57 per cent compared with the market. Donald de Groot is a non-executive director and his sale represents a considerable chunk of his holding - although this would not appear to be anything more than a timely spot of profit-taking.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                 Sector       Shares         Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberforth Split Inc       InvT      100,000        90,000           1 British Polythene         PP&amp;P        3,916        18,092           1 Chiltern Radio            Mdia        5,000        11,750           1 EFT                       OthF      300,000       180,000           1 Howden                     Eng      100,000        91,000           1* Intl.

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: NICE ON ICE WON'T CUT IT HERE  </P> <P> OK, King family: We won't suggest anything too outrageous here. We don't want  any drastic line changes, Wayne Gretzky benched in favor of Mike Allison or  anything like that. We shouldn't get too worked up about one lousy loss. And we  definitely wouldn't advocate that you start playing, uh, dirty hockey. Don't go  around shish kebabing anybody with your sticks.  </P> <P> But, to beat the Edmonton Oilers, you might have to beat them up. Check 'em,  deck 'em and wreck 'em. Otherwise, these oily little rascals are just too  slick. Unless you smack them around and slow them down, the Oilers will leave  your defensemen as frozen in their tracks as the Gretzky statue that guards the  door of the Northlands Coliseum, and they will leave your goaltender flopping  on his belly like a seal.  </P> <P> Right from Wednesday night's opening faceoff of the Smythe Division finals, the  Oilers demonstrated their superior quickness and stickness. Glenn Anderson put  a move on King goalie Kelly Hrudey the likes of which hasn't been seen in  Alberta since Katarina Witt slipped into her lace teddy. He scored. Five  minutes later, Jari Kurri did a dipsy-do that left Hrudey sprawling flat on  his, uh, mask. Another score.  </P> <P> Came the next two periods and more of the same. Mark Messier slapped one.  Score. Martin Gelinas flipped one over the goalie's glove. Score. Esa Tikkanen  bluffed a slap shot and faked Hrudey into the organist's private box. Score.  Joe Murphy made Hrudey go into a dive like the "Red October." Score. Tikkanen  tikked another one in. Score. Game 1 turned into an Edmonton avalanche, 7-0.  </P> <P> Talk about losing ugly.  </P> <P> Maybe for the Kings it was just one of those nights when the only thing that  goes right is that your suspenders don't snap.  </P> <P> Or maybe, just maybe, this was a classic case of a bunch of guys taking too  much time off for good behavior. Maybe the time has come for the Kings to turn  back into the Manchester Blvd. Bullies, same way they did when they pounded  lumps on Edmonton's helmets last time they met.  </P> <P> When the King-Oiler rumble turned gruesome at the Forum on the final night of  February, everybody made note of the 86 penalties and 356 penalty minutes that  made this game the nastiest confrontation in the Los Angeles area since the  last time Roseanne Barr's writers had a staff meeting. Oh, the fuss that was  made over Marty McSorley, the mutant ninja hockey player, doing his level best  to mess up Messier's face.  </P> <P> Forgotten in all the commotion was that the Kings won that particular game,  4-2. And face it, they don't ordinarily have much luck against Edmonton,  regardless of how that 1989 playoff series turned out. The Oilers played the  Kings eight times this season, and lost to them only twice. Edmonton has had  L.A.'s number, and we don't mean 99.  </P> <P> If Wednesday's game is any indication of how this series is going to go, may we  humbly suggest that when the Oilers take the ice here Friday night, the Kings  go right out and crown them.  </P> <P> Hey, we were just sort of getting comfortable with the notion of L.A. as a  tough hockey town. These were becoming the all-new, leaner, meaner Kings, bad  boys dressed in black. Nobody was accusing them of turning into the  Philadelphia Flyers, but 356 penalty minutes -- man, that's not hockey, that's  mud-wrestling. That's some dirty stuff.  </P> <P> And the Kings haven't been making many friends lately, either. Some of them  were offended by former teammate Bernie Nicholls' alleged comment that the only  thing the Kings know about defense is how not to play it. There was also some  fuss made over Theron Fleury of Calgary supposedly hurling his stick at Gretzky  and calling him "the most hated player in the league," and Flame Paul Ranheim  accusing Gretzky of waving his arms and laughing right in the Flames' faces.  </P> <P> It was kind of nice having people bad-mouthing the Kings for a change. In the  past, people hardly mentioned them at all.  </P> <P> Sadly, though, the Kings who laced up their skates for Game 1 against Edmonton  were about as inoffensive as a hockey team gets. We can scarcely remember a  hard check into the boards, much less a punch in the snoot. Oh, McSorley gave  Kevin Lowe a little love bump as the first period was ending, and later on Lowe  and Steve Duchesne demonstrated surgical techniques to each other's eyebrows  with their sticks. Otherwise, the Kings played like perfect gentlemen.  </P> <P> And came away with a big fat zero.  </P> <P> OK, Kings: You tried the polite bit. You tried to be nice, pleasant guests. You  probably wiped your feet before stepping into the arena. It didn't work. The  Oilers still have to beat you three more times. Beat them to the punch.  </P></p>

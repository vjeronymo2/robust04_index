			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Every summer, a group of bicyclists meets by the reflecting pools of the Los  Angeles Department of Water and Power building, where they fill up test tubes  that they later empty into Mono Lake 350 miles to the north.  </P> <P> It's an event with "good visuals" for the media. But the symbolic protest  against the DWP's drainage of Mono -- now at its lowest level in years -- isn't  dear to the heart of the DWP.  </P> <P> Funny thing, though. The tenth edition of the event, called the Los  Angeles-to-Mono Lake Bike-a-Thon, didn't make its usual splash when it kicked  off Monday morning.  </P> <P> The DWP has drained the pools for what it terms scheduled repairs. "There is no  tie-in," a DWP spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The 100 or so bicyclists brought their test tubes anyway.  </P></p>

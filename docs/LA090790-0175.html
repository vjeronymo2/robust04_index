			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITAIN STILL HOLDS OUT ON POUND  </P> <P> The British government today quashed days of sometimes frenzied market  speculation that the pound would finally join the European Community's exchange  rate mechanism this weekend.  </P> <P> Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, said in a  radio interview that while Britain fully intends to join the ERM, it will do so  only when its previously stated conditions for entry have been met.  </P> <P> "Not this weekend," he said.  </P> <P> The ERM is a feature of the European Monetary System. It limits the amount that  European currencies can fluctuate against each other and is seen as a  stabilizing influence.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has repeatedly ruled out the pound's entry  into the ERM until British inflation can be brought into line with that of  other major Western European countries.  </P></p>

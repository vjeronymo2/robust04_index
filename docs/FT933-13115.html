			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dublin angered by Tebbit remarks THE Irish government is to raise with Britain remarks made by Lord Tebbit about bomb attacks on Dublin. During a Sky TV programme on Monday night on Ireland's controversial constitutional territorial claim on Ulster, the former Conservative party chairman declared: 'I suspect that the only thing that will take that out of the Irish constitution is when the bombs begin to blow in Dublin in the way that they have been in Belfast and in London.' Last night Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds called the comments 'deplorable' - and made it clear his views were being relayed to London. Outlawed loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Freedom Fighters yesterday planted bombs outside the homes of three nationalist SDLP politicians, including West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron. Two bombs went off and a third was defused. No one was hurt.</p>

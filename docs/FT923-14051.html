			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Air France gets ready to fly into battle - A look at the more aggressive attitude adopted by the national carrier MR BERNARD Attali is bracing himself for what he calls 'the mother of all battles' in the airline industry. 'We haven't seen anything yet. It's going to be a terrible earthquake and we are all going to be engaged in a frightful war for the next 10 years,' says Mr Attali, whose mandate as chairman of Air France has has just been renewed by the French government for another three years. During the past three years, Mr Attali has been preparing Air France by attempting to transform the French state-owned carrier into a more aggressive, market-orientated enterprise. His task has not been easy. The group has lost a total of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 270m) during the past two years. Mr Attali expects Air France to show another loss this year, although he hopes his group will return to the black in 1993. Air France, like other airlines, has suffered from the combined effects of the recession in many world markets and the hangover from the slump caused by the Gulf crisis. The expected recovery in traffic has been elusive. The pressures are now building up on the airline and the industry. Capacity continues to outstrip demand. Airlines have launched a fares war to try to fill empty seats and protect market shares. Air transport liberalisation in Europe next year will intensify competition while the large US carriers continue their onslaught on the European market. 'We are number one in Europe in terms of turnover and our ambition is to remain number one,' says Mr Attali. But, despite its size (Air France had sales of FFr57.6bn last year), Mr Attali concedes his airline continues to be regarded by some as 'a big, sleepy, monopolistic elephant'. But he claims this is no longer true and that Air France is changing fast. 'I'm a chess player, and the first lesson in chess is never underestimate the opposition. Many of our competitors are clearly making that mistake,' he says with a touch of defiance. Mr Attali's strategy has focused on restructuring operations while strengthening market position by acquisitions and partnerships. His target is to achieve productivity gains averaging 5 per cent a year. Between 1991-1993, Air France will have shed 11 per cent of its ground staff. He has also been reorganising the structure of the company by integrating Air France and UTA, the independent French long-haul carrier which he took over two years ago. He also acquired control of Air Inter, the domestic French carrier, which is continuing to operate under its own identity. 'The UTA and Air Inter deals were fundamental for Air France. Without them I would have now felt very uncomfortable,' he says, explaining that it was critical for Air France to consolidate its position in its domestic market to compete against other big European carriers already dominant in their home markets. The next step was to develop alliances in Europe. He achieved this by acquiring this year a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena, the Belgian airline, and leading a group of investors to take a 40 per cent interest in CSA, the Czechoslovakian state carrier. He now intends to look farther afield in an effort to forge partnerships with carriers in America and the Asia-Pacific region. Air France has also been reviewing its marketing strategy in response to the new competitive pressures and especially the growing North Atlantic fight against US carriers. It has introduced a frequent flier programme, is investing heavily in training, and is seeking to enhance its customer service. It has also joined in the latest transatlantic fares war by announcing discounts of up to 35 per cent on some tickets. Mr Attali regards the US as posing the most immediate threat to Air France. He has lobbied hard to secure a more favourable bilateral air service agreement between France and the US for his airline. Since the new breed of giant US carriers like American Airlines, United and Delta have started expanding into Europe and France, the French carrier has seen its share of the transatlantic market decline from around 50 per cent to just over 30 per cent. 'In 10 years' time we risk being under the domination of US carriers,' Mr Attali says, arguing for the need for greater consolidation in the European airline industry. Competition policies must enable European carriers to develop into significant global entities. 'The problem in Europe is that there are about 60 airlines that matter, and that's 40 too many,' he says. Although the French government has sought to delay the implementation of full liberalisation in Europe, Mr Attali says he is not worried by the recently-approved third package of EC liberalisation measures. Indeed, he plans to take advantage of it and is considering operating domestic services in other EC count-ries, including the UK. In turn, his UK rival BA is also expected to expand in the domestic French market. BA is especially interested in setting up joint ventures with smaller carriers in other EC states to operate domestic services in these countries. In France, BA has been talking with TAT, the French independent regional carrier. 'If BA does a deal with TAT, it won't find life easy in France,' Mr Attali warns. He also warns liberalisation could backfire as long as the congestion problems of European air traffic and airports are not resolved. 'It's difficult to see how you can put even more aircraft in the skies if the adequate infrastructure is not in place,' he says. Improving the quality of his airline is a priority. 'We already have a strong product and that is one of our strengths,' he claims. In anticipation of the forthcoming battle, the other strengths he plans to build on are the extensive size of his airline's international network, his domestic market, and his hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle with considerable expansion potential and its connection with the French TGV high-speed rail network. Mr Attali is also continuing to shop around for opportunities. 'There is bound to be an acceleration in deal-making between airlines in the current climate,' he says. 'The problem is to be in a position to choose your partner and not to be chosen first.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that Israel  will meticulously see to it that all the centers of government  for the Palestinian Authority are located in Jericho and not in  Jerusalem. We will now go over to our political correspondent  Shlomo Raz in the broadcasting van at the Ramat Aviv Hotel in  Tel Aviv:    [Raz] Addressing Labor's Political and Social Forum -- this  time devoid of any puns -- the prime minister referred to a  series of political issues on the agenda. With Jerusalem  increasingly becoming the top item, it is important to hear what  the prime minister had to say in view of the agreements signed  with the PLO.    [Begin Rabin recording] I have no doubt that there have been  several phenomena in Jerusalem through the years where it would  have been better if it had not taken place. I believe we will  take steps to enforce what is written in the Declaration of  Principles, to the effect that all the centers of government of  the Palestinian Authority should be located in Jericho. That is  what we both agreed to and committed ourselves to in writing,  but I will not elaborate on how and when we will do that. [end  recording]    [Raz] The consultation summoned by the prime minister  yesterday should be noted in this context. The unpublicized  session summoned to discuss one issue only: how to tackle the  PLO's desire to establish political facts in Jerusalem. Israel  plans to tackle the issue by imposing clear-cut restrictions on  the Palestinians.    Another issue raised by Yitzhaq Rabin was the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    [Begin Rabin recording] The current situation in the field  is reasonable. For example, if they imprisoned the Palestinian  officer who would not let Brigadier General Doron Almog travel  in the Gaza Strip, I think it is a good response.    In view of all sorts of reports, I would like to clarify  that  to the best of my knowledge -- and we will yet check this  thoroughly -- not even one Palestinian from the territories has  joined the police force without our approval. We did not  approve the return of some deportees proposed by them, and our  lack of approval prevented their return. [end recording]    [Raz] Rabin was referring to reports that Uri Magidish's  murderers had been inducted into the Palestinian police, and he  proceeded to deny these reports. The prime minister added --  and I have heard him say this more than once this week -- that  the Palestinian police takes the job seriously. For example,  the Palestinians stationed 70 more policemen than Israel had  actually demanded at the Erez checkpoint. The prime minister  disclosed that Israel would lend metal detectors to the  Palestinians for the simple reason that security is important to  us.    The prime minister did not say even one word about Ari'el  Sharon's announcement that he intends to run for the  premiership. Journalists were waiting outside to get his  reaction and ask him juicier questions, such as who will be the  next health minister, but the prime minister would not humor  them and hastened to leave the place.    Earlier in his public address, the prime minister also  referred to the negotiations with Syria and Syria's intransigent  position.    [Begin Rabin recording] Today, even in my view -- for which  you are upset with me -- the gaps between Syria and us are still  broad and deep. This was the situation before, and it remains  unchanged. [end recording]    [Raz] That is what the prime minister had to say with regard  to the negotiations with Syria which are scheduled to gather  momentum in two weeks, when the U.S. secretary of state arrives  for yet another tour in the Middle East.    The prime minister spoke about the spread of fundamentalist  Islam throughout the Middle East and outside. He gave the  example of Holland, where 10 years ago there was only one mosque  and today there are dozens. The prime minister said he also  discerned fundamentalist Islam among Israel's Arabs, but he went  to great lengths to put it in the proper proportions.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / A striking difference across the picket lines: Workers in eastern Germany have mixed emotions about their current industrial action I suppose we have no choice,' said Wolfgang, a 55-year-old stevedore. Until last Tuesday, he had been clocking in since 1953 at the Neptun shipyard in Rostock, north-eastern Germany. Then the word came from IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, that the workers, who had already been balloted, were to start an indefinite strike in support of higher wage claims. 'We have to trust Steinkuhler,' he added. Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, is staking his reputation on the outcome of a strike in eastern Germany, the first for more than six decades. He wants the employers to reinstate a contract which would this year have given eastern German metal, engineering and steel workers pay rises of more than 20 per cent, and which would have equalised eastern and western wages by next year. The contract, which was signed in March 1991 between the employers, IG Metall and east German factory managers, was cancelled by the employers in March this year because of Germany's deteriorating economic situation. 'Its difficult to tell you how I feel,' continued Wolfgang. 'I have never been on a strike before. They were banned. Steinkuhler says that we might as well strike anyway so that even if we lose our jobs we might win higher unemployment money.' Heinrich, a colleague who started work at Neptun 15 years ago, at the age of 27, expresses greater doubts about the wisdom of the strike. 'I don't want to be without a job and remain at home,' he says. 'My wife has lost her job in a factory. She is now depressed. She sits at home all day. I don't want to end up like that. I want work, not broken promises.' Both men earn DM1,500 (Pounds 607.00) a month after tax - about half the average in western Germany. They each spend about DM350 on rent. 'The money does not go far enough. We pay western German prices for most things - petrol, cars, phones, utilities, household goods. We cannot live on what we earn,' says Wolfgang. Both men feel confused about the goals of German unification. 'Kohl promised jobs, a better life, real unification. But look what has happened,' says Heinrich. 'The Treuhand (the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry) has either shut down almost everything along the Baltic, or else has completely cut back the workforce. 'Neptun used to have 7,500 workers before 1989. Now there's only 1,200. I get up every day thinking I might be the next one without a job. It's very frightening. We never had to think like this before. Maybe Steinkuhler is right. He says we have nothing to lose if we go on strike because he says we are going to lose our jobs anyway,' he added. Wolfgang dismisses the argument advanced by employers that low wages will attract outside investment and increase the competitiveness in the region. He believes IG Metall's message that if eastern German workers accept lower wages they will have condemned themselves to second-class status. 'IG Metall says a low-wage economy would amount to exploitation, that we would be treated as second-class citizens, with a second-class economy, and as the poor eastern German cousins. We would then never catch up with western Germany,' he adds. Down in the southern parts of eastern Germany, the heartland of the region's heavy industry which has borne the brunt of factory closures, workers are similarly confused about the aim of the strike. Maria, who is 50, used to work at a local chemicals factory, just outside Leipzig. She now sells souvenirs in the Nikolai church, the meeting place of the opposition groups which helped bring about the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. As the strains of a Bach fugue echoed through the church, Maria explained her opposition to the strike. 'We - the ossies (easterners) - have no say. It is not we who are organising the strike. The wessies dominate the unions and the employers groups here. It was here, in this church, where we found our voice back in 1989. Today, we have no voice.' What bothers Maria most is the fact that the 'ossies' are not trusted. 'Whenever we speak out, even about the strike, they (western Germans) patronise us by reminding us of our past, and how much money western German taxpayers are spending on eastern Germany.' Some of Maria's nieces and nephews have already migrated westwards. 'They don't want to come back. They don't what to know about the place where they were born. They hardly send a postcard,' she says. But Manfred, a good-humoured 23-year-old young construction worker, decided to stay. 'I used to work in a machine tool factory near Leipzig. It is now closed. I thought about leaving. But this is my home. I found work. Had the union asked me to strike, I would have said No. What gets me is that the union says we should have the courage to strike. Why? To help the employers and unions play out some stupid power game here in eastern Germany? The wessies will soon start blaming us for the strike. They have organised it. Not us.' The feeling that the east Germans have not been able to voice their real feelings about the strike was echoed by Horst, 32, who lives in east Berlin. Unlike many of his friends who commute to west Berlin, or western Germany, Horst borrowed money and set up an electronics store not far from Checkpoint Charlie. 'Don't talk to me about Steinkuhler and his boys. What are they trying to do to us?' he asks. 'I am very angry about the strike. It will deepen the psychological gap between the two Germanies. We have to build this country together. Sometimes I think Steinkuhler wants to keep us divided. We don't need a strike and further job losses. We need success stories. Our self-confidence would grow. We would find our voice. Then we might be treated as equals.'</p>

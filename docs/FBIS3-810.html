			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Freedom Alliance has voiced its support for  President Lucas Mangope after this morning's meeting in  Kimberley. The alliance strongly attacked the South African  Government for taking over control of Bophuthatswana.    [Begin recording] [Inkatha Freedom Party President  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, in English] We feel what has happened to President  Mangope in Bophuthatswana is a disgrace. We believe that what  has happened to President Mangope is in fact unchristian. We  feel that President Mangope has been betrayed, has been  double-crossed, and we feel that it strengthens our resolve  never to take the word of President de Klerk or his government.    [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] The meeting decided that  General Viljoen, who has submitted a list of candidates for his  Freedom Front, should withdraw from the alliance.    [Viljoen] Our participation in the election depends on a  complete accord -- there are actually two accords to be  fulfilled. The first accord has been entered into with the ANC  [African National Congress] and the government.    [Van Zyl] Dr. Hartzenberg said that the CP [Conservative  Party] is working hard to prevent a split after rumors that  certain CP members support General Viljoen.    [Hartzenberg, in English] We do not promote splits. We are  not in favor of splits, and we try to prevent it. Therefore, we  talk to each other, and we see whether we can come to a solution.    [Van Zyl] General Viljoen admitted that the tug of war  concerning participation in the election could lead to a split  in Afrikaner ranks.    [Viljoen] I am very worried about this. It is not a good  situation and I have tried to bring about Afrikaner unity, but  one reaches a stage where you have to make such a decision. If  I do reach a certain decision, then I want to state very clearly  that this is not as a result of personal interest. The only  factor I consider is what is in the best interest of my people,  and I am there to give the strategic guidance. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian methanol plan to go ahead STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, announced yesterday that it would proceed with plans to build a NKr3bn (Pounds 285m) methanol plant, despite a NKr600m cost escalation. In April, Statoil warned that the costs, originally put at NKr2.4bn, threatened to rise by several hundred million kroner, prompting a comprehensive review of the plan. Statoil 82 per cent of the project and partners Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont du Nemours 18 per cent. The plant is to be supplied, from the fourth quarter of 1996, with 650m cu m of gas annually from the Heidrun oil and gas field. It will produce 830,000 tonnes of methanol a year. 'The decision to continue the methanol project has been based on an overall assessment of both solutions for Heidrun gas (reinjection of the gas into the field's reservoir or supplying it to the methanol plant),' Statoil said.</p>

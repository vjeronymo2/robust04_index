			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Ivanov, experimental engineer for rocket </F> and space hardware: "Explosion on the Pad"; first paragraph is  source introduction]    [Text] That explosion at Plesetsk took dozens of  lives. The living and dead participants in the unsuccessful  launch were pronounced guilty. Today, almost 15 years later, we  can look at the situation differently...    On 18 March 1980, on launch pad No. 4 of the Plesetsk  Cosmodrome, during the preparations for the launch of a Meteor  launch vehicle, an explosion took place. Fifty-one people died,  and several dozen were injured. The launch vehicle and the  spacecraft and some of the ground equipment were destroyed. The  launch structure and the launch pad required major repairs.    Immediately after the accident was reported, a State  Commission was set up, headed by the deputy chairman of the USSR  Council of Ministers, L. V. Smirnov. In the span of two months,  the commission came up with several versions of the possible  causes of what took place and set up several experiments to  check them. But the objectiveness of the commission's conclusion  couldn't help but be influenced by the large measure of  potential responsibility that the various officials would have  for such a grave occurrence or by the departmental interests and  service ties of the experts.    The results of the commission's work were laid out in  several  dozen volumes. The lead volume contained the commission's  report, in which the cause of the accident was pronounced to be  the improper, unsanctioned actions of the servicing crew  (specifically, of Pfc Velikoredchanin) in stopping a leak of  liquid oxygen with an irregular method. Pronounced indirectly at  fault for the occurrence were the leaders of the servicing crew,  who were responsible for the correctness of the designs adopted,  the adherence to the necessary discipline in conducting the  operations, and the technical training of the personnel.    The investigations came to an end, the orders were issued,  those remaining had to go on living and working. But besides the  sense of unfairness that attached to the punishments, there was  alarm at the fact that the true causes of the accident had not  been fully unearthed and that they would happen again, no matter  how carefully a program of measures to avert them was drawn up.  On 23 July 1981, an emergency situation occurred again, during  the preparations for launch of a Soyuz launcher on pad No. 1 of  the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.    Upon the completion of the fueling with hydrogen peroxide,  the crew reported serious heatup of the filter housing in the  ground pipeline, which indicated that the component was breaking  down inside. It managed to stop further progress of the process,  which could become explosive at any moment, by immediately  draining the peroxide from the pipeline. When the filter was  examined, it was found that solder had melted, which could have  happened only at temperatures of several hundred degrees. In  light of the fact that concentrated hydrogen peroxide tends to  explode at temperatures above 90 degrees, one gets an idea of  all the danger that arose with the situation, danger that not  only the experience of the leaders and the level of training of  the crew helped to counter, but also a good amount of luck.    Studies of the filter showed that the soldering by the  manufacturing plant had been done not with pure tin, which is  neutral to hydrogen peroxide, but with a tin-lead solder, which  became a catalyst for the breakdown. After that, it was  established that the use of that very solder had been ordered in  the design documentation. As it turned out, when the  documentation was corrected, not long before the accident in  1980, the type of solder was "simply" mixed up in the KB General  Machine Building (the head developer of the launch system).    This became clear to specialists: the unusual catalyst had  been found, the chain of evidence of the correctness of the  "lower" version was completed, and the groundlessness of the  "upper" version became even more apparent. The intentions of the  critics of the official conclusion were very firm. But to prove  with documentation that the rocket in the accident had been  assembled with a filter that was substandard is impossible  today. The most pointed accusations were made in the clay of  collective irresponsibility. All that, based on the presumption  of innocence, did not make it possible to regard the cause of  the accident as proven in a judicially strict manner, no matter  how obvious it was to specialists. One way or other, further  investigation ceased. The decision adopted by the command was  diplomatic: the penalties imposed were lifted, but not taken off  the record, and those punished were not acquitted of all  charges, but were pronounced to be "now free of the earlier  noted shortcomings."    So what can we give today as the final assessment of the  causes and effects of the tragedy of 18 March 1980?    What we now know is fully sufficient for the absolute and  final acquittal of the living and the dead who 14 years ago were  accused in haste and unfairly. Their fate is largely typical,  however paradoxical and hard that may sound. During the postwar  years at the testing grounds and cosmodromes of Kapustin Yar,  Baykonur, and Plesetsk, interdepartmental commissions  investigated several hundred unforeseen occurrences without loss  of life, and in only a handful conclusions was the cause  pronounced to be error on the part of the servicing crews. In  those instances accompanied by loss of life, however, it was the  servicing crew -- those who died, as a rule -- that was, with  few exceptions, pronounced guilty. The temptation to use the  dead, who couldn't respond, as the chief offenders was too  great. The effect of such an approach was reflected in the  results of the investigations of many other accidents, and the  "convenient" decisions not only soiled the memory of the dead,  but also maimed the living.    Restoring the truth is necessary, and perhaps it should be  done quickly, while those who took part in the events are still  alive and before all the materials classified "Keep  Indefinitely" have been destroyed.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Ofgas chief to quit as soon as monopoly report is published SIR James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, is to step down in September, almost a year before the end of his contract. Sir James, renowned for his acerbic manner and combative style, said yesterday he would leave his post as director general of the regulatory body Ofgas after the publication of a report on British Gas by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, due in July. 'That report is bound to propose some fundamental changes to the business and I believe a new person should follow through those changes from beginning to end,' he said. Sir James's announcement came as Ofgas became embroiled in another row with British Gas over complaints from customers last year. Ofgas said complaints had risen by 89 per cent to 1,624, but British Gas said it was not aware of more than half those. Relations between the company and the regulator have been rancorous and have recently sunk to an all-time low. But Sir James, 63, attacked his critics yesterday: 'Many people are perplexed at the aura of tension between British Gas and Ofgas, but to think there would be no conflict between a regulator and monopoly supplier is somewhat naive.' Without the scrutiny of Ofgas, there would not be the 'tension and acrimony' that had developed, Sir James said, 'but neither would there be the results achieved'. He pointed to a 20 per cent drop in gas prices in real terms since privatisation in 1986 as one of his greatest achievements. Ofgas yesterday accused British Gas of over-charging schools for gas supply by at least Pounds 2,000 a year each when they opt out of local authority control. British Gas points to a legal technicality which means the company must charge schools separately for gas and not as bulk purchasers under a local authority. This increases the price by 10p a therm since bulk purchasers are eligible for a quantity discount. 'Schools' budgets are strapped in many ways and you can imagine they are aggrieved with British Gas's treatment,' said Mr Greg McGregor, director of competition and tariffs at Ofgas.

"The Partnership for Peace programme provides Poland with  the  opportunity to develop contacts guaranteeing her security in the  future," the prime minister told a press conference after the  signing of the document.    He stressed several times that the Partnership is an open  formula and its content "depends on our activity." If there are  certain limitations "they are in the sphere of our possibilities  and not expectations or willingness." He pointed out to the  significance of the participation of Russia in this programme.    According to Pawlak, "these two days (Tuesday and Wednesday)  are of utmost importance for Poland. Yesterday, the association  treaty between Poland and the European Union came into force.  Today I had the opportunity and the pleasure to sign at the  NATO headquarters a document that starts the Partnership for  Peace procedure. Poland's contacts with the West are acquairing  new dymanic," he added.    Addressing the participants in the ceremony, as earlier  while  he was speaking to parliamentarians, Waldemar Pawlak appealed  for "the partnership for development" suggesting that the scheme  will add closer cooperation to the NATO programme.    Earlier in the day, the prime minister met with leader of  the  European Parliament Egon Klepsch, and replied to questions asked  by members of the European Parliament concerning the Phare  programme and Poland's relations with her Eastern neighbours.  The prime minister declared that Poland is striving to have the  best possible relations with them but her efforts are hampered  by the unstable situation in Russia and Ukraine.    Between the meeting with parliamentarians and the signing of  the Partnership for Peace programme, Waldemar Pawlak was  received by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.    In the evening he met with representatives of Polish  community at the Polish Consulate General in Brussels.    Later on, he was the dinner guest of organizers of the  Thursday international conference on Polish affairs.</p>

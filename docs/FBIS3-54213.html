			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F> Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), by  Riyad Mansur in Amman; date not given]    [Text] [Mansur] The al-Asad-Clinton summit has clarified  the situation and it may push the peace process forward. As a  leader of the Palestinian opposition, how do you view the summit?    [Hawatimah] The Geneva summit has once again emphasized that  U.S. Middle East policy still operates on a double standard.  The U.S. President announced that he was for a comprehensive  and just solution in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy. But when it comes to the tangible  agenda, we immediately notice the use of double standards. The  U.S. Administration is ready to do that on the Golan front,  Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories. The same also  applies to the occupied Palestinian territories.    This was clear in the Geneva summit talks, and was also  tackled during the al-Asad-Clinton news conference. Clinton  stressed his administrations' commitment to international  legitimacy and the principle of land for peace regarding the  Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordanian territories, but he  adopted the Oslo accord, which conflicts with the resolutions of  international legitimacy. Replying to questions on settlement in  the occupied territories, he said that these territories were  disputed areas, in conflict with Resolutions 242 and 338 and  with other Security Council resolutions.    This double standard was also clear when he replied to a  question on implementing Security Council resolutions on Iraq,  while Israel ignored Resolutions 242 and 338. He used two  standards--the standard of the heavy club and comprehensive  destruction for Iraq and the standard of bypassing everything  that might embarrass Israel. At the same time, he left the door  open for the settlement process, which was condemned by Security  Council resolutions as illegitimate and illegal, in addition to  turning the Palestinian territories into disputed areas.    The Syrian side adhered to a comprehensive withdrawal in  return for peace and to the unity of all the tracks in the peace  process, because all the occupied territories are Arab and are  subject to international resolutions. This shows the big  mistake 'Arafat made when he moved from secret talks in  Washington to secret talks in Oslo, struck a partial agreement,  and accepted all the Israeli peace conditions without regaining  an inch of land. He approved the Oslo accord and recognized  Israel's right to exist in accordance with Rabin's conditions,  as well as normalization and security and economic cooperation,  without getting anything in return. This conflicts with the  principle of land for peace.    This reveals the extent of the crime committed by the Oslo  team when it accepted all the Israeli conditions. Thus, the  Palestinian territories became, as Clinton and Israel put it, a  disputed area in violation of the principle of land for peace.  Regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement, pressure is being  exercised in the Taba talks regarding secondary issues like the  crossing points, the redeployment of the occupation forces, and  the areas that will not be controlled by the Israeli forces, as  well as the alternative Palestinian conditions. All these  secondary issues will fall, and insistence on the principle of  land for peace will survive. This necessarily requires the  cancellation of the Oslo accord and the return to the peace  negotiations based on international legitimacy and halting the  settlement process. Israel is drawing up plans to make a  complete geographic and demographic change in Arab East  Jerusalem in two years, after which no Arab East Jerusalem land  will be left for negotiations. In addition, the settlement  process is going on in the West Bank and Gaza. Therefore, we  have warned against falling into the trap of recognition,  normalization, and security and economic cooperation, which are  Israel's peace terms, without securing withdrawal from occupied  Palestinian territories in accordance with Resolution 242 and  other Security Council resolutions and without solving the issue  of the refugees in accordance with UN Resolution 194.    [Mansur] Nothing has yet been implemented from the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. Will there be an Israeli withdrawal, or  will things remain the way they are?    [Hawatimah] Even 'Arafat himself could not drink the poison  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and is trying to escape from it,  using superficial issues. We therefore call for that agreement  to be annulled; for a return to the home of national unity,  which is the strongest weapon in our hands against occupation  and settlement; and for the negotiating equation to be rebuilt  on the basis of the land-for-peace formula, which is the  complete opposite of the Oslo formula.    After the Geneva summit, the Israeli Government is playing  two very serious games, and we warn against them. First, the  Israeli Government's statement on declaring Syrian sovereignty  over the Golan Heights in return for a clear Syrian statement on  readiness to accept normalization, the exchange of diplomatic  and commercial ties, and the opening of borders. We remind  everyone of the success Israel achieved by pushing 'Arafat to  such a statement. Israel has managed to get all Israeli  conditions without relinquishing an inch of land. We also  remind everyone of the example of southern Lebanon. Since 1978,  Israel been making statements about Lebanese political  sovereignty over south Lebanon, saying that it does not covet a  single inch. However, Israeli occupation has continued since  then.    Declaring Syria's political sovereignty over the Golan  Heights is similar to the Israeli declarations on Lebanese  sovereignty over south Lebanon. Israel must recognize the  principle of withdrawal and then set a timetable for that  withdrawal.    The example of south Lebanon is flagrant. For 15 years,  Israel has been declaring that Lebanon has political sovereignty  over south Lebanon -- that is probably why it set up the South  Lebanon Army. Israel has also been stating that it does not  covet a single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of Lebanese  water. However, it has been more than 15 years and we have  still not seen Israel withdraw its occupation troops from a  single inch of south Lebanon in compliance with Resolution 425.    Therefore, the Arab states should learn from the south  Lebanon experience and from the deep abyss into which the  advocates of the Olso agreement have fallen. The Arab states  should not fall in the trap of a declaration of political  sovereignty over their territory in exchange for normalization  and ties because this means accepting the Israeli conditions  without withdrawal from a single inch of the occupied Arab  territories. South Lebanon is an example. They should also  not fall in the Oslo agreement abyss -- to accept normalization  in return for farfetched illusions.    We also warn the Arab states against attempts to deal with  the Oslo team. The Tunis team is now trying to involve itself  again in the Washington talks. Washington is now pressing to  promote the Tunis team and the agreement on the separate  Gaza-Jericho agreement by inviting that team to Washington  despite the fact that it has no work there. This team already  has an agenda for negotiations over proposals for choosing a  self-rule administrative council. The real objective for that  team's trip to Washington is to provide a cover for the Oslo  agreement, which is now drowning, and to give it an umbrella by  the cordon states.    Israel's second dangerous game is its threat to put the  question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, south  Lebanon, and Jordanian territory to a referendum. These are  occupied territories that should be vacated as provided for by  UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Under a referendum,  the Israeli public opinion would be in a position to override UN  resolutions. The principle of referendum lends the Golan  Heights, south Lebanon, and Jordanian territory the status of  disputed rather than occupied land, the future of which would be  a matter for the Israeli public opinion. The Israelis are thus  extending the crime committed by the Oslo agreement to other  Arab fronts. The Oslo agreement has, virtually, turned the  occupied Palestinian land into disputed territory. This is  because the agreement satisfies Israel's peace terms even before  it ceded a single inch of land or acceded to the principle of a  pullout from the occupied Palestinian territory as envisaged by  UN resolutions.    [Mansur] The Israeli Government has hinted that unless  'Arafat accedes to Israel's terms, it will quicken the pace of  the talks with Syria. What do you think?    [Hawatimah] This is not the first time that Israel has  sought to use intra-Arab contradictions to its advantage and  capitalize on parochial and isolationist attitudes in the Arab  arena. The idea is to promote its occupation of Arab land.  Israel has applied the same tactic since the sixth round of the  bilateral Washington talks. In August, 1992, the Israelis  created the impression that the road was clear for progress on  other tracks by way of getting the Palestinian leadership in  Tunis to run after secret talks in Oslo behind the backs of  'Arafat's negotiating team in Washington. Let's remember that  the Washington negotiators were mostly unwilling to make the  kind of astonishing concessions 'Arafat was pressing Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi to make. Throughout the negotiating exercise in  Madrid, Washington, and Oslo the Palestinian and other Arab  peoples were kept in the dark. What took place in Oslo were  secret negotiations held behind the backs of the Washington team  and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who began to balk at the considerable  amount of concessions the Tunis leadership wanted him to make.    The Arab parties must beware of these Israeli tactics.  Otherwise, they will fall one after another and be made to go  along with Israel's terms for a settlement, without any of the  UN resolutions stipulating an Israeli pullout from the occupied  Palestinian territory being honored.    [Mansur] Some say that the U.S.-Syrian Geneva summit will  lead to a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. As a leader  of the Palestinian opposition, how much room will you have to  operate on Syrian territory?    [Hawatimah] Whether Syria reaches an agreement or not, this  is Syria's business. We hope that narrow regional interests and  views will not take precedence over the common national and  pan-Arab interests of our people to struggle to end the  occupation, dismantle the settlements, exchange land for peace,  and implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such  befuddling arguments have been going on for years. They will  continue after the Geneva summit.    Those who try to depict the situation as if the Palestinian  movement depends on administrative offices in the Arab capitals  are under a great illusion. Whether these administrative  facilities remain or go, this will not affect the genuine  Palestinian democratic forces that call for a balanced and  comprehensive peace on the basis of full withdrawal in return  for full peace. Actually, some of these facilities are no  longer provided. For us in the DFLP, this is a very minor  issue. We exist within the organizational, popular, political,  professional, and armed ranks of our people inside the occupied  Palestinian territory and in the diaspora. Our offices exist  inside the hearts of the people, their homes, and in several  social, trade, and professional institutions in the occupied  territories, which have been in existence for over 25 years.  Our people's camps in the diaspora are the arenas in which our  organizations operate. Also, the homes in the camps are our  offices. It is useful to have administrative facilities in the  Arab capitals. However, should some constraints be imposed on  us, this will not affect us. This is a minor issue, because the  democratic and nationalist forces of opposition exist in the  occupied territories, the camps, and the diaspora, and not in  administrative offices in this or that capital.    [Mansur] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is now leading an  opposition movement for democratic reforms in the PLO. What can  you tell him?    [Hawatimah] I have said, and I say again, that we welcome  the person who discovered 'Arafat's dictatorship 26 months late.  We tell him that if he really wants to democratize PLO  institutions, make collective decisions, and reestablish  Palestinian national unity, then he should join the democratic  and nationalist opposition, spearheaded by the DFLP. Now, we  have a unified central command for the 10 factions. We will  operate by having reference to popular legitimacy at conferences  at home and abroad and by electing leaders from the base to the  top by democratic means.    I tell Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi that his major mistake was that  after the eighth round of the peace talks, he did not declare a  halt to the bilateral talks and boycott the multilateral talks.  'Abd-al-Shafi made another mistake when he traveled to Tunis.  He came back sad and disappointed. He said that he was sure  this time that the decision was in the hands of one person.  Therefore, he can now return to the people and the masses,  along with us.</p>

"I was just hoping to break the meet record.  I'm not trying to be first in the state, I'm just trying to improve myself."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo won the championship with 84 points, 36 from the jumps. Edison  finished second with 48, and Woodbridge was third with 38.  </P> <P> "I'm excited by (Fager's) mark, but not surprised," said John Hattrup, Mission  Viejo's jump coach. "She's got the potential to go farther."  </P> <P> Canyon's Allison Franke, the field athlete of the meet the past two years,  finished second in the triple jump (38-1 1/4), broke her meet record in the  discus with a throw of 155-5 and won the 100-meter hurdles in 14.91.  </P> <P> Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer was named sprinter of the meet after victories in the  400 meters (59.96) and 300 hurdles (45.39). Distance runner of the meet was  Edison freshman Shelley Taylor, who won the 1,500 in 4:43.93 and placed second  in the 800 in 2:19.44, behind Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Malhaupt (2:16.38).  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: US concerns hit Micro Focus / A look at the worries behind the fall of a software star THE MARKET value of Micro Focus has fallen sharply over the past few weeks as US investors question the company's ability to maintain its hitherto impressive record for growth and profitability. Last night shares in the Berkshire-based software house closed at Pounds 13.33 in thin trading having lost 25 per cent of their value in the past seven days alone. They stood at just over Pounds 30 in February this year. The company is now capitalised at Pounds 188m compared with over Pounds 400m at its peak. The share price was not helped by a sell note last week from a US analyst, Mr Paul Bloom, of brokers Volpe, Welty &amp; Co, a company which in earlier years had praised Micro Focus' management and market positioning. Mr Paul O'Grady, Micro Focus managing director, said Mr Bloom had issued the note without consultation with the company In the UK, however, analysts were not reassured by a round of presentations last week from Mr O'Grady. He seemed 'downbeat' and had failed to impress UK shareholders. Micro Focus is a company whose stock is at the mercy of its American Depositary Receipt listing. At one stage almost 40 per cent of its shares were held in the form of ADRs; now the total is about 20 per cent. US investment has been behind the dramatic rise in Micro Focus' share price over the past three years. Now it is the root cause of its collapse. US investors understand the software market better than their European counterparts. Micro Focus had powerful appeal because it had developed a set of tools - software which makes it easier to write other software - which were of obvious value in corporate data centres. They made it possible to write software in Cobol, the most common business language, on cheap personal computers rather than taking up expensive mainframe time. Micro Focus has an alliance with Microsoft, the world's largest software company, through which Micro Focus tools are included in Microsoft products. Mainframes, however, are gradually giving way to networks of smaller computers (client-server systems) and Cobol will eventually be superseded by more modern computer languages: the question hanging over Micro Focus has always been: when? So US investors began to take fright when the company recorded flat profits and a mere 11 per cent rise in revenues in dollar terms in the first half of the year. Typically Micro Focus has grown both revenues and profits by more than 20 per cent. In sterling terms, revenues were Pounds 40.8m and pre-tax profits Pounds 11.6m for the first half. US investors also noted poor performances from traditional mainframe vendors such as Amdahl and concluded the shift to client-server systems was under way. Mr O'Grady said yesterday that Micro Focus was well positioned to exploit moves to newer technology. UK analysts agreed yesterday that little had changed in the company's underlying trading performance and were maintaining estimates of pre-tax profits for the full year at between Pounds 27m and Pounds 30m. The company has Pounds 53m cash.</p>

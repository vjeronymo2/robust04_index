			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us begin with Paolo Berlusconi's arrest. Dario  Carrella reports from Milan:    [Carrella] There was another sensational development this  morning in the clean hands offensive. Another qualitative leap  forward was made.    Paolo Berlusconi was arrested on the order of the Milan  public prosecutor's office, which had made him the subject of a  warrant for preventive detention. Examining Judge Italo Ghitti  and Prosecuting Judge Antonio Di Pietro will question him this  afternoon.    The arrest warrant is within the framework of investigations  into kickbacks paid to encourage the Cariplo [Cassa Risparmio  delle Provincie Lombarde] pensions fund to purchase several  buildings. Berlusconi has been accused by one of those under  investigation-- broker Giuseppe Clerici, who was formerly a  Cariplo employee--of paying a bribe of more than 1 billion lire.  News about Berlusconi's involvement in this chapter of the  clean hands investigation has been making the rounds for several  days.    The clean hands judges have also ordered two other arrests,  but this time related to illegal financing of political parties.  Giovanni Donigaglia, chairman of the Argenta building  cooperative has been arrested. The Milan judiciary had already  investigated Donigaglia within the framework of possible illegal  contributions to the Italian Communist Party. This time  Donigaglia is accused of having illegally paid 350 million lire  to former Christian Democratic Party treasurer Severino  Citaristi during the 1992 general election campaign.    Antonio Mosconi, former managing director of Toro  Assicurazioni, part of the Fiat Group, has also been arrested.  He is accused of having illegally given 200 million lire to  Cesare De Piccoli, the former communist deputy mayor of Venice.  The Milan public prosecutor's office has sent a cautionary  warrant to De Piccoli, who is currently a PDS [Democratic Party  of the Left] member of the European Parliament.</p>

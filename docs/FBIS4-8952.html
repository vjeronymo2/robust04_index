			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Michl: "Czech Civilian Aviation Industry </F> Is Heading Straight for a Museum"]    [Text] The successful bidder for the purchase of Motorlet  Praha or Let Kunovice will acquire the results of technical  development in the value of several billion korunas [Kc]. A new  mid-size L-610 aircraft for 40 passengers has been developed  since 1983 in these companies, which, according to the aviation  industry restructuring program, are not expected to remain in  the Aero holding. The cost of the development to date amounts to  approximately Kc3-4 billion, and experts estimate that overall  completion, including U.S. international certification, would  cost another Kc1.5 billion. In this instance, it would be  possible to start aircraft deliveries to potential customers in  1996. At this time, there are two prototypes of the "610"  tested--the L-610 G, with General Electric CT7 engines in Let  Kunovice, and the L-610 MX05, with Walter M602 engines from  Prague Motorlet being tested by the Czech Army. The civilian  aircraft manufacturer, Kunovice Let Co., cannot afford to  operate this prototype. If development of the Czech civilian  aviation continues in the direction taken, both prototypes will  end up in the same place---the Kbely Aviation Museum.    If the military part of the aviation industry (the L-39 and  L-59 production) is referred to as one with good marketing  prospects, it is, above all, because of the initiative of Aero  Vodochody management. If the official material finds that the  civilian part of the aviation industry has no chance of  survival, it is because no one has thought of an aggressive  marketing policy. At the same time, many experts believe that  the marketing prospects for civilian production are at least as  good as for the military one, and it is economically more  effective.    According to marketing surveys conducted outside the  official  management structures, there are realistic chances for a  long-term workload of the civilian aviation firms based on the  sales of large series of L-420 or L-610 aircraft in Latin  America, Southeast Asia, and on the traditional markets of the  former Soviet Union. According to the estimates of the firm  Saab, until the year 2000, the world demand for midsize aircraft  is approximately 1,300 units. This most likely does not include  the potential marketing possibilities in the republics of the  former USSR, where the service lives of approximately 2,000  Jak-40 and An-24 aircraft are coming to an end, so that the  overall demand comes to approximately 3,000 machines. There is  no manufacturer in the world that could independently satisfy  this demand. Moreover, in the difficult operational conditions  in these territories, no competition can stand up to the Czech  aircraft. In addition, thanks to the comparative advantage of  the Czech economy provided by the cheap labor and the production  input, in comparison with the world standard, the development  cost comes to about one-quarter. The preliminary sales price of  the L-610 comes to approximately $9 million, while the  comparable Regional Jet costs $14-15 million and the  Saab-Scania-2000 more than $12 million. (If we add the cost of  the operation of the aircraft, which includes the price of  engines--because their lifespan is shorter than that of the  airframe--the instruments, spare parts, and complete overhauls,  the total purchase price of the aircraft comes to approximately  two and a half to three times as much). With annual sales of 30  L-410 or L-420 aircraft and 12 L-610 M or G Let, Kunovice and  Motorlet Praha can show profit and begin to pay off their debts.    From this vantage point, the debt burden does not appear to  be so tragic, although it amounts to Kc1.31 billion debt to  banks and Kc1.85 billion to the Aero holding in the case of Let  Kunovice, while its equity totals Kc1.07 billion. And, in the  instance of Motorlet--an equity of Kc1.55 billion--the debt has  reached Kc0.8 billion to banks and Kc0.1 billion to the holding.  Even if we also take into account the debt to the state  treasury and suppliers (they are partially covered by the  unfinished production), both firms could be paying off their  debts beginning in 1996. Moreover, it would mean the  preservation of the production opportunities and, by extension,  jobs in cooperating enterprises. The views have been voiced in  expert circles, including managerial ones, that, except for the  interests of the Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB), or, as the  case may be, other creditors of Aero holding from the banking  sector, who logically are not interested in a business venture  with aviation production but, rather, in a speedy return of the  missing hundreds of millions to the bankers' parental care,  there is no real reason for one of the few areas in which Czech  industry is absolutely capable of competing in the world markets  to be sold abroad below value and with uncertain results.    Because the aviation industry has been and still is, above  all, in the hands of the state, there is no need to search  laboriously for the bearer of specific responsibility for the  present situation and ignorance of what is coming. The  government that recommended the implementation of the  conclusions from the 8 March 1994 meeting of economy ministers  on restructuring the aviation industry in fact only officially  endorsed what has been happening for the past nine months on the  initiative of the IPB, which, although not a shareholder, has a  majority on the aviation holding board. No other principal  decision on the part of the major owner has been adopted. The  situation in the aviation industry after 1990 can be described  as waiting for privatization, which, in turn, with respect to  the current knowledge, can be termed jumbled. Under these  circumstances, the decision to sell certainly is a welcome  opportunity for the government to rid itself of a hot potato,  but, except for the so-far-uncertain amount to go to the  creditors' pockets, it does not solve the problem. Even though  the decision to capitalize the Aero holding debts may not be  ideal, it certainly represents a possibility of further  development for its military part. This chance was denied to  the civilian sector, although no real argument has been given  explaining why this sector should not have just as good  prospects and why the property of the coupon privatization  investors, who invested in the first wave of privatization in  aviation as a whole, should not thereby appreciate. While the  decisionmaking on the future of Czech breweries, the auto  manufacturing industry, and china production took place or is  taking place with media--and thereby public--participation, the  demise of civilian aviation production in the Czech Republic  should most likely be quiet and without pathos.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Stitch-up' alleged in review of union links CONTROVERSY was brewing last night over the composition of a special Labour committee to examine the party's union links, amid claims that grassroots opinion has been deliberately excluded from the review process. The Labour Co-ordinating Committee, the constituency activists' pressure group, said proposals to be debated at today's national executive meeting were 'wholly unacceptable' and little more than a 'stitch-up' of the much-heralded review by the unions. Mr Mike Craven, the LCC chairman, said the commission would be dominated by unions, which have seven of the proposed 15-strong commission members. He also attacked plans to hold monthly meetings of the union section of the NEC to monitor the review committee. Calling on the NEC to amend the plan, submitted by Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, he said representatives of constituency Labour parties, local government, and more women should be included. The criticisms will be taken up by Mr Bryan Gould, an NEC member representing the constituency parties, when they are debated today. Last night, Mr Gould said that while strong union representation on the committee was welcome, the lack of 'grassroots input' was a clear weakness in the proposals. Under Mr Whitty's plan, a copy of which has been received by the FT, the NEC will reaffirm the party's union links but then go on to acknowledge that the unions' are 'over-represented in the counsels of the party'. The committee will include Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds, respectively leaders of the TGWU and GMB general unions, five MPs, Mr Whitty, Ms Joyce Gould, a Labour national official, and Professor Lewis Minkin, an academic authority on Labour's union connections. The NEC is expected to include in its remit examination of reforms to exclude the unions from selection of MPs in favour of a one-member;one-vote system. Last night Mr Nigel Harris, an NEC member from the AEEU engineering and electrical union, joined the LCC in warning against tinkering with changes to the selection process agreed by the NEC organisation committee last week. Welcoming the review committee of which he will be a member, he said the AEEU would resist any attempt to 'sabotage' the change. 'It would be a snub to our constituency members who overwhelmingly support one member, one vote.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Perform a one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or a missing piece in the bushings in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For any bushing that is found broken and/or any bushing that is found having a piece missing during the inspection(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2), as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Within 10 flight cycles after detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 10 flight cycles since detection. Or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the affected bushing has not been replaced within 10 flight cycles after detection, observe one-brake-deactivated performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) until replacement of the affected bushing is accomplished. Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional, while operating with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for broken bushings and/or a bushing with a missing piece.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) For any bushing that is found to be cracked or deformed during the inspection(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2), as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Within 100 flight cycles since detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 100 flight cycles since detection. Or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the affected bushing(s) has not been replaced within 100 flight cycles since detection, observe one-brake-deactivated performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved AFM until replacement of the affected bushing is accomplished. Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional, while operating with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked bushings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Operators may operate beyond 60 days after the effective date of this AD with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked or broken bushings, provided that the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Revise the Limitations and Flight Performance sections of the FAA-approved AFM (or computer generated takeoff weight tables) to include the following information. (This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM.) If the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have not been accomplished within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, the following two-brake-deactivated performance decrements must be observed until the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished. The following adjustments reflect takeoff and landing performance, assuming failure of two brakes. Operation must be performed with all brakes operative and the anti-skid system operative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> ``Option 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Subtract 70,000 LB ( 31,750 KG) from the takeoff limited weight (the most limiting (lowest) of maximum certified, obstacle clearance, tire speed, brake energy, climb, or field length limited weight).

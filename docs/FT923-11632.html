			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MBO at Continuous Stationery proceeds Mr William Eastwood, chairman of Continuous Stationery, the printing group, told the annual meeting that backers had agreed in principle to fund the management buy-out offer at 40p a share. Since the announcement in February of the plan, a number of other approaches had been made. These parties had been given all the help they needed, he said, but no offers had been forthcoming and the company had therefore progressed with the management buy-out team. The company expected to make a further announcement within the next few weeks.</p>

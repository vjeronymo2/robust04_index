			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley warns on benefits spending MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told the Commons last night there could be no escape from 'structural reform' of the benefits system. He insisted that it was necessary both to contain the growth of the Pounds 80bn social security budget and to ensure that the money was spent to best effect. The government secured a majority of 44 (312-268) to defeat a Labour motion accusing it of seeking to dismantle the welfare state. Mr Lilley said the underlying position of social security spending outstripping national income could not be sustained indefinitely. Accepting the need for a 'considered look' at the social security budget, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, warned that Labour would battle against short-term reforms stemming from the Treasury's 'crisis management demands'. Mr Lilley identified three main sources of expenditure - invalidity and related benefits, lone parents and housing benefit - for the projected growth in social security provision to the end of the century. Mr Lilley accepted that growth in lone parenthood - up from 570,000 in 1971 to 1.3m in 1991 - was not likely to be checked primarily by changes in the benefit system. The availability of housing was a significant factor, he said, and welcomed a recent statement by Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, calling for positive housing policies which did not encourage the belief that having a baby was the only way to a home.</p>

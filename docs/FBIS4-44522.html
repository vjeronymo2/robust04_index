			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Feng Youlu (7458 2589 4389), Ministry of </F> Machine-Building Industry: "Issues on China's Machine-Building  Industry Development in 1994"]    [Text] The total output value of China's machine-building  industry was 269 billion yuan in 1993 including 20.5 billion  yuan worth of products produced under mandatory plans and 15.9  billion yuan worth of products produced under guidance plans.  The output values of the two accounted for 13.1 percent of the  total output value. It means that 86.9 percent of the products  have been produced by enterprises in accordance with the market  situation. The machine-building industry will continue to  develop itself towards this direction in 1994.    China will register another high rate of growth in its  national economy in 1994. The GNP is expected to rise by 9  percent. There will be more investments in fixed assets under  the state plan; and more loopholes will be plugged so that more  funds will be available for major construction projects as  compared with 1993. With the improvement of the people's living  standards, more machinery will be needed in general. The world  machinery market is also quite vast. Therefore, we reasonably  believe that there will be a higher rate of growth in the  machine-building industry in 1994. Naturally demands vary for  different types of machinery. We must pay attention to the major  developments in our national economy and the international  market, and continuously readjust our product mix in order to  make our products more competitive and export-oriented. As long  as we go with the tide of the situation, we will be able to  triumph.    Whether or not our machine-building industry will score  even greater achievements in 1994 lies in how we deepen our  reform and carry out our production and business activities in  accordance with the market economic system.  <H5>  1. Work Hard To Strengthen Market Investigation and Survey, </H5> and Business Policy-Making.    Enterprises must pay full attention to the markets. They  must fully understand the actual requirements of the  international market as well as the domestic market. They must  also study the potential requirements, and gather all kinds of  information. They must fully understand consumer needs, market  capacity and the current situation in promoting scientific  research and development. They must know their competitors'  product features, means of production, production costs, prices  as well as their supporting factories' properties of products,  production capacity, delivery schedule. The enterprise must also  take advantage of their own advantages. They should know their  competitors and themselves. Only then, will it be possible for  them to win victories. Although work in this respect has been  strengthened since machine-building industry has changed its  trend from one of product economy to one of commodity economy,  it is far not enough. We must mobilize workers in all sectors,  and carry out the work of investigation and analysis from all  angles. Enterprises must periodically hold meetings for business  policy-making; solicit all kinds of proposals; carefully analyze  them and form policy decisions; and send them back to various  departments to have them implemented. If the enterprises keep on  making policy decisions in such a way, they will definitely be  able to play up their strengths and avoid weaknesses, become  more competitive and certainly win victories.  <H5>  2. Work Harder to Strengthen Scientific Research Work </H5>   The machine-building industry not only supplies facilities  for the development of the four modernization programs, but also  provides machinery to help people improve their living  standards. With the rapid development of science and technology,  we must fully realize that machinery reflects modern science and  technology. It is for this reason that we must work hard to  strengthen scientific research work. Whoever produces fine and  durable machinery will win consumers' confidence. Modern science  and technology demand that we train a group of professionals of  multiple disciplines. The Art of War by Sun Zi  mentioned: "There are only five colors, but it is hard to  perceive the changes of the five colors. There are only five  flavors, but it is hard to fathom the changes of the five  flavors." It means that there are only the red, yellow, blue,  white and black colors, but it is hard to estimate the number of  changes in mixing all the colors. There are only five flavors --  sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty --, but it is difficult  to fathom the changes when all flavors are mixed in cooking. We  might as well regard the modern machinery as a combination of  devices using technologies in machine-building, electricity,  hydraulics, gas and light. The changes are unlimited. As long as  we combine them in different way and in a flexible manner, our  opportunities know no bounds as pointed out by the Art of  War by Sun Zi.    We must mainly rely on ourselves to improve our products.  Enterprises must strengthen their forces in conducting  scientific research and development. Meanwhile, they must also  solicit outside help by importing foreign technologies and  cooperating with scientific research organizations and colleges  and institutions of higher learning.  <H5>  3. Work Harder to Readjust Enterprises' Product Mix </H5>   Only when products are readily marketable, can enterprises  that manufacture such products flourish. Enterprises must follow  the market when they turn out their products. However, the  supply and demand on a market are constantly changing. Actually  all machinery products will go through the stage of development,  stage of growth, stage of maturity and stage of obsolescence.  The current situation is that such cyclic changes are becoming  faster and faster. Therefore, enterprises must constantly adjust  their product mix. Those enterprises which manufacture a single  product must start working on the next generation when their  product of the previous generation has entered the stage of  maturity and the sale of such product is still good so that the  new product will be able to replace the old when the time comes.  Enterprises that manufacture many varieties of products must  upgrade their products on a rotation basis. Thus, their  production and management should be developed in a balanced  manner. Efforts must be made to prevent any adjustment of the  product mix from adversely affecting the operation of the  enterprises.    The adjustment of the product mix may also create a series  of  problems to production engineering. Right now, foreign  machine-building factories often make full use of numerical  control machine tools and institute the soft manufacturing  system. This is aimed at increasing the capability of the  enterprises in coping with changes. Although the initial  investment will be greater, it can shorten the period and reduce  the cost in adjusting the product mix. Basically speaking, it is  worthwhile to do so.  (h3} 4. Work harder to Push Sales    If it is said that to strengthen market surveys, make  correct  policy decisions and develop products that are readily  marketable is a process of cognition and practice from the  market to the product, then how to make consumers know the  product and help such product become more marketable is also an  important process which is definitely not less important than  the first one. We often talk about helping the product "work its  way" into the market. This phrase "work its way" means that we  must strengthen our efforts in pushing the sales of the product.  A good salesperson must carefully brief the customer about the  performance, quality, delivery schedule, price, after-service  and other good points of his own product, and make the customer  feel at ease and pleased to buy such product. A salesperson with  good business ethics must never try to defame other people's  products. He should know how to give prominence to his own  products.    As far as each enterprise is concerned, to push the sales of  products is not merely selling the merchandise alone. The  enterprise must introduce to the customer the capability of the  factory in developing and manufacturing the products. It should  supply the appropriate machinery equipment in accordance with  the customer's requirements.    In order to adapt ourselves to market mechanism and sell  more  machinery products, we must pay attention to public bidding and  carry out our work well in submitting tenders. To succeed in  public bidding, we must, first of all, satisfy the needs of the  consumer, be more competitive among the fellow bidders, and make  money for one's own enterprise. In order to make correct and  timely responses, the enterprises must compile all kinds of  reference material and build various types of data bases.    Enterprises must strive to build and cherish their own  reputation. They should realize that only with a good  reputation, can their products enjoy a greater share of the  market.  <H5>  5. Work Harder to Strengthen Enterprise Management In Order </H5> to Become More Competitive    It is necessary to become more competitive in terms of  performance, quality, delivery date, price and services. All of  them are based upon an enterprise's scientific management in  quality and cost control and its energy and material-saving  measures and its production technology. All these are important  aspects. The Ministry of Machine-Building Industry must  regularly call for efforts to strengthen enterprise management  and raise their standards. All this is aimed at making  themselves more competitive. What merits attention is the fact  that some time ago when the sales of machinery products were  picking up, some enterprises once again attached importance to  speed and price only instead of management efficiency. It is  necessary to rectify this situation.  <H5>  6. Work Harder to Strengthen Motivational Mechanism </H5>   Heaven makes the final decision as to how things shall end  up. How to fully arouse man's enthusiasm is an extremely  important issue. The leadership of the various enterprises must  adopt measures to help workers strengthen unity and become more  creative and encourage them to make suggestions and work harder  than ever before for the enterprises. Efforts must be made to  improve personnel management, the wage system and the incentive  mechanism, and to encourage the professionally qualified people  to work harder and offer more to the enterprises</p>

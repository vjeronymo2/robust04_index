			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that  after the Turkish side refused to cooperate on the  confidence-building measures, the Cypriot Government began  preparing an action plan to deal with the Cyprus issue. This  plan is expected to be submitted after the UN secretary general  submits his report to the Security Council.    Mikhailidhis said that expert legal advice was sought in the  preparation of this report. He added that apart from the ideas  that are already included in it, the action plan should be  completed in a substantive manner and should include issues that  will arise after Butrus-Ghali submits his report.    The foreign minister emphasized that the Greek Cypriot  side's  position stresses that the Security Council must examine ways to  change the current unacceptable status quo and create  prerequisites for a substantive dialogue.</p>

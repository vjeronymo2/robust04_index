			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM, 2 PHONE FIRMS INTRODUCE CALLER ID SETUP FOR COMPANIES  </P> <P> IBM, Northern Telecom Inc. and Nynex Corp. on Monday announced a product that  links incoming phone calls at a company or organization with computerized  information on the caller.  </P> <P> The system will make it easier, for example, for customer service  representatives at a mail-order house to handle inquiries and for public-safety  officials at a college to locate a caller in an emergency, the companies said.  </P> <P> Previously, such systems were available only to companies owning expensive  in-house phone switching systems.  </P> <P> The new system is aimed at companies and organizations that do not have their  own private phone system. It operates through the electronic central-office  switch of the local phone company.  </P> <P> The systems match the number of an incoming phone call with a computer file.  The file then pops up on a screen, using the same telephone network technology  as residential "caller ID" systems that flash the number of an incoming call on  a small screen near the telephone.  </P> <P> For instance, a customer's file would appear on a screen at a mail-order  catalogue company where that customer has an account.  </P></p>

Wasmosy, accompanied by Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez  de  Lozada, will visit the Itaipu hydroelectric dam at 0700 and  visit Brazilian towns until the afternoon.    Peasant organization leaders say Wasmosy's attitude shows he  has no vision of the real magnitude of the current conflict and  that he lacks the political will to give structural solutions to  the problem of land and the sale of cotton.    After visiting Itaipu, Sanchez de Lozada and Wasmosy will  lunch in Foz de Iguazu and then visit the Brazilian city of Sao  Paulo to dedicate a sluice in a hydroelectric power plant in  Tiete River. For this reason he will not see the peasant protest.  <H5>  Agitators in Congress? </H5>   Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas has  said he is aware that some people have been hired to cause  disturbances outside Congress during the peasant march.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LEAST THE PRICES ARE FIT FOR A KING  </P> <P> As a season-ticket holder for the Los Angeles Kings, I begin preparing myself  for yet another ticket price increase in April, just about the time the Kings  are eliminated from the playoffs. And every year, no matter how well I prepare  myself, I get the shock of my life when the bill arrives.  </P> <P> This year was no exception.  </P> <P> When I first bought my season seats in 1986, I paid $1,659 (parking included)  for a pair in the loge. This year, those same seats will cost me $4,032, an  increase of 243% for a team that has never been remotely close to winning a  Stanley Cup in a town that is hardly a haven for hockey.  </P> <P> I just wonder what Bruce McNall's response will be when Wayne Gretzky is gone,  the Kings continue to flounder in fourth place and still have not come close to  winning a Stanley Cup, the Johnny-come-lately fan no longer buys tickets and  the longtime fan can't afford it. What will you do then, Bruce?  </P> <P> MICHELLE BUEHLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

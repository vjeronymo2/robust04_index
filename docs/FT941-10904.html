			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (22): Istanbul bounces to the top  -Turkey After spending the whole of 1992 at the bottom of the table, Istanbul has risen over the past 14 months, to outperform all the world's emerging markets, according to the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. Thanks to robust retail demand, an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and timely legal changes, giving tax breaks for those funds investing in equities, the 85-share index has been pushed to record heights. The market lists some 150 companies, and is capitalised at around USDollars 30bn. Daily trading volume is around Dollars 80m. The best performers are those companies with low debt and a strong franchise in the local market, such as Arcelik, the white goods manufacturer, local retailer Migros, or beer companies such as Ege Biracilik. Brokers say there has been a marked deepening in the market, with the arrival of foreign investors and more tentatively the local institutional buyers. But trading still suffers from a shortage of liquidity, a restrictive settlement system, and the lack of good research facilities. For the bull market to continue, the government will have to contain its own appetite for funds which has had a damaging effect, not only crowding out the equity markets but undermining corporate profitability as borrowing costs have been pushed higher. Today, treasury bills and other official debt instruments still account for 80 per cent of capital market activity. There also remains some concern about the permanence of the government's interest rate policy after the Central Bank last month was forced to devalue the lira by 12 per cent after raising interbank rates which at one time reached 200 per cent. If interest rates are to settle at these new levels, equities may find it harder to entice funds away from fixed interest instruments. This could force the small retail investor, who has provided much of the momentum of the bull market, to reconsider his portfolio options. For all that, there remains an underlying confidence in the market. Brokers point out that in dollar terms, the index still has some way to go to attain the levels enjoyed in the 1990 bull market, which lasted until the day Saddam Hussein's tanks rolled into Kuwait. The market has made considerable strides, on the regulatory side and in improving settlement and clearance systems. Under the Turkish practice, on any transaction, the physical delivery of stock must be completed before the end of the following day. This is a direct result of Turkey's high inflation. It is also an attempt to encourage trading in larger volumes and take away some of the attractions of speculative dealing. But for foreign investors, particularly those dealing from far-flung markets such as Hong Kong, where there is a time difference, it can present a serious headache. In an effort to ease this problem, the exchange has now introduced a new centralised custodian system which accounts for 70 per cent of transactions. In addition, a new electronic trading system was inaugurated in early December, on some 50 shares. The whole exchange shifts to screen-based system later this year when trading moves to its new premises. The market's other constraints have more to do with Turkey's particularly conservative corporate culture, where equity finance remains a small part in the thinking of many companies. Private concerns are wary of the disclosure requirements and the dilution of ownership. However, all that may soon change. Reforms have been introduced to allow companies to float non-voting shares. In addition, the new tax law included incentives for companies going public. Brokers anticipate a wave of new issues, as companies seek to rationalise the spread of their empires, ahead of the move to a customs union in 1995. Equity finance could also be useful as companies upgrade technologies, in a bid to keep pace with the renewed competition from imports. The number of public offerings has already increased as banks seek to float subsidiaries in a bid to meet new capital requirements set by the Basle-based Bank of International Settlements. A less welcome prospect is that the market might be flooded with government stock as Turkey's privatisation speeds up. If only for political reasons, Turkey seems destined to offer some part of the state corporations now being considered for privatisation to local investors. How well the market digests this will depend largely on whether big Turkish institutions are attracted. The fund managers of insurance companies and state enterprises have traditionally remained averse to risk, preferring government securities to dabbling in the more uncertain waters of the equity market. However, rule changes introduced in 1993, now make it easier for banks and brokerages to establish funds. The law also provides tax breaks for those A-type funds invested in equities. According to figures from the Capital Market Board, the government's securities watchdog, the government has approved 23 funds, with a further 13 under consideration. It is still a relatively immature area. Many banks, for example, make use of funds they establish to buy stock in their own industrial affiliates. As one leading broker put it: 'That's not fund management, that's price fixing.' But on one thing the brokerage community is agreed - this is the only way forward. For only with the ballast provided by long-term institutional investors, will Turkey's market attract fresh interest and enable the index to reach new heights.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Tony Blair confident of easy Labour victory in Dudley West by-election Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, canvassed support yesterday in the Dudley West by-election amid reports that his party is cruising to an easy victory, Paul Cheeseright writes. The Conservatives are more than 55 points behind Labour, a poll of 635 voters carried out by the Evening Mail of Birmingham on Friday and Saturday found. The poll puts Labour on 71.02 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives on 15.93 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 11.06 per cent. Nearly 53 per cent of those polled thought their lives had worsened over the last 15 years. More than 51 per cent considered they and their families would be better off under Labour. Nearly 54 per cent thought Mr Blair would be the best prime minister. Mr John Major's approval rating was 16.38 per cent. Dudley West has been held by the Conservatives since 1979. The by-election follows the death of Dr John Blackburn who had a majority of 5,789 at the 1992 election, a lead of 8.1 per cent over Labour. Mr Blair is pictured with Mr Ian Pearson (left) the Labour candidate, canvassing support from disillusioned Tory voters.</p>

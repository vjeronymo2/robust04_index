			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tudor Mohora, vice president of the </F> Socialist Party of Labor, by Peter Sragher; place and date not  given: "The PSM Does Not Wish To Resume the Construction of  Socialism"]    [Text] [Sragher] County conferences of the Socialist  Party of Labor [PSM] are currently taking place and are meant to  prepare the congress of the party due at the beginning of this  year. I thought that it would be interesting to find out the  political opinion of Mr. Tudor Mohora, one of the leaders of  this party, regarding this issue.    Mr. Mohora, you affirmed that the PDSR [Social Democracy  Party of Romania] called itself a social-democratic party, thus  a left-center party, which is ruling with right-wing measures.  How can you support a different party in parliament and a  different cabinet?    [Mohora] We are in a somehow different situation today than  right after the September 1992 elections. A possible answer to  your question might be that, when we decided to support the  ruling party, we took into consideration its program and the  political signals that they released during the electoral  campaign.    Today, we have a certain critical attitude toward the  government, the act of ruling itself, and our criticism ended in  a simple motion, which however we could not promote further.  After one year of ruling, we can no longer talk about  declarations of intent, but we can talk about the act of  governing, which has unfolded for long enough for us to have a  proper picture of it.    [Sragher] If the PDSR is ruling with right-wing measures,  some of your voters are claiming that they should better allow  the opposition to govern. How real does the possibility of the  opposition's governing seem to you?    [Mohora] I have studied the program and situation of the  opposition carefully. Having a complete belief in the  democratic system that we are currently building in our country,  not only I do not exclude it, but I even believe that it is  desirable that, in certain phases, the opposition should have a  chance to govern. Unfortunately -- it is not I who judges them,  but public opinion itself passes a judgment -- currently the  opposition does not have a coherent picture of an economic and  social construction. It is known that, although in the last  part of this century there have been certain converging elements  between the liberal and the social-democratic perspectives, both  as doctrines and as pictures of the society, however, they stay  far apart.    [Sragher] You criticize the heterogeneous character of the  CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]. The PRM [Greater  Romania Party] has only a national doctrine, just like the PUNR  [National Romanian Unity Party], which, however, very recently  called itself neoliberal, following the example of the PDAR  [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which, however, also  assumes the agrarian doctrine. How homogeneous and viable is a  possible future agreement with the parties that have such  different ideologies?    [Mohora] Well, certainly your question is very interesting  and at the same time very difficult, but I believe that the  answer to this question can be found in the responsibility and  the idea of compromise that should govern us when we accept such  a political alliance. The parties that you have mentioned might  be criticized just like we can be criticized for certain aspects  or, probably, for certain limitations in our policy. However,  we have the following concept: We should be open and the  democratic system requires -- if we understand the basic rule of  democracy, which is ultimately a sublimation of tolerance --  that, if needed, one can set up alliances even with parties --  and such thing has already happened throughout history in  Romania -- that are on the other side of the barricade. We have  constantly said that we must be open and discuss issues  regarding our country with all parties, regardless of their  orientation, including the right-wing parties.    [Sragher] Do you have a national unity government in mind?    [Mohora] Yes, I do. As long as there are people outside our  country's borders who are observing -- maybe from a more neutral  position, that is, they are more detached from the political  excitement -- that here one might reach -- and it is high time  to reach -- an agreement on principles and on rules regarding  major issues in the domestic and foreign policy of our country,  that can be accepted by all of us. I believe that this would  lead to the idea of a national unity government.    [Sragher] Suppose tomorrow you become prime minister. What  would be the first three major measures taken by you in order to  solve the current crisis of our country?    [Mohora] First of all a strong government is required. It  should be strong both in the area of professional competence and  in its moral force and the honesty of the people it includes, as  well as in its team spirit. I believe that the PSM could form a  strong government. It would need not only three, but a whole  set of measures. First of all, those government decisions and  those laws should be adopted and promoted that would put order  in the public sector. If the government and society have such  an important public sector, it should not be left -- as it has  happened so far -- unattended. A second issue would refer to  the real stimulation of the private sector. Currently I believe  that there are no appropriate conditions, neither legislative  nor governmental ones, that would enable a small entrepreneur to  start a business and be successful. Currently, a monopoly and a  banking system have been established, which are a wizardry that  pumps very important funds into firms that, in most cases, do  not have a productive character, but rather a character of  financial-banking and commercial profiteering. The third  measure: Precisely the team that I was talking about should  start a merciless war against corruption. This affliction that  I believe continues to expand is -- to say the least --  tolerated by the current leadership. This would mean to put  order in the police and justice system. We can put our own  house in order by persistently implementing daily measures and  actions. In fact, our country has reached such a dramatic  situation that, as a matter of fact, a concrete anti-crisis  program should be adopted by a government that would have all  fields of activity in mind.    [Sragher] Does the PSM believe that the construction of  socialism should resume?    [Mohora] No. The PSM believes that we should establish  the state of law because, in our program, we recognized and  included, without any reticence, the provisions of Romania's  Constitution. However, we should make sure that this  establishment of the state of law serves the national interests,  namely the reform, our integration in European structures, etc.  and should be in Romania's favor. Secondly, the ordinary  citizen should detect and perceive this state of law as a major  advantage compared to the past regime. Unfortunately, one  cannot say that, according to the way things have developed in  the past four years, the citizen feels more protected or a  greater social and legal, or even physical, security than before.    [Sragher] In what way did you support the idea of  privatization?    [Mohora] From the very beginning, we agreed to privatization  in agriculture and in the sphere of services, which should be  much more developed, in commerce, and tourism. But  privatization can be done in all areas -- apart from the energy  system, telecommunications, transportation, and the defense  industry -- on the basis of economic profitability and the  privatization process should even be speeded up.    [Sragher] Do you believe that the Euro-Atlantic integration  is a positive act?    [Mohora] We have spoken out without reticence in favor of  integration in the European structures, both in the political  area as well as economic and cultural areas. Those who believe  that the PSM wishes to find answers for the renewal of the  Romanian society in other regions of the world are greatly  mistaken. We do not see integration under all circumstances,  but rather under conditions that should really serve Romania.  We desire a position of dignity and equity in relations with  the countries that are members of the European Union's  structures and also a real promotion of our interests on  essential, cardinal issues such as integration into the NATO  structures.    As far as foreign bases are concerned, our position is on  this issue is that the Romanian Parliament and the Romanian  people should be consulted. These are not issues that belong  exclusively to the government or the president.    [Sragher] Can we understand that currently the PSM would  oppose the deployment of NATO bases on Romanian territory?    [Mohora] In the leadership of our party we have not  established a position regarding NATO. However, I could not say  that now, if Romania were invited to enter NATO structures, the  PSM would certainly oppose such actions. We would decide about  it after we took into account the respective circumstances at  the time when such a proposal is made. Because the balance of  forces certainly will be different in six months time or a  year's time and the geostrategic picture will also be different.  There is no point in discussing now how we would relate to such  an issue. We cannot be against integration in a security system  that would be to our advantage.    As far as our position on a foreign basis is concerned, we  have a determined position: We do not wish the deployment of  foreign bases on our country's territory.    [Sragher] Do you believe that Romania's joining or not  joining a security system also depends on Russia? How do you  regard the new political games after the announcement of the  military doctrine and the strengthening of the army after the  October coup?    [Mohora] I believe that one should not ignore the warnings  that Russia is launching toward all countries that formerly were  part of the "cordon sanitaire" between it and the Western world,  when it demands that no political-military alliances should be  established that might be directed against it.    Russia believes that every alliance in Europe in which it is  not included is directed against it or in some way opposing it.  In fact, this is an old political concept. The more so since  Russia had and continues to have a global vision about foreign  policy and cannot give up and will not be able to give in the  future either -- except maybe under certain circumstances --  this idea.    A healthy policy in this respect would be if Romania adopted  a very prudent attitude on the issue of military integration and  security structures, that are still not consolidated. We can  see that the situation of establishing relations in this area is  still vague. Forcing for example the issue of integration in  military structures might create in the future reactions and  might mark our relations with our very powerful neighbors, which  possess the nuclear weapon and which, even if they currently  face economic difficulties, still hold the statute of great  military powers. And this might be harmful to our country's  interests.</p>

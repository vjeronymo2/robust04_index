The sides discussed a wide  range of issues connected to Ukraine's participation in  implementing UN sanctions against Yugoslavia. Individual  attention was paid to cooperation by the customs and border  services of Ukraine with the authorities of Danube countries and  with the missions for facilitating sanctions in these countries,  and to the possibilities of rendering financial and technical  assistance to Ukraine, which is needed for efficiently securing  the sanctions regime.    The Ukrainian ambassador drew Napolitano's attention to the  necessity of stepping up the search for practical ways of  compensating losses experienced by third countries, including  our state, as a result of introducing sanctions against  Yugoslavia.</p>

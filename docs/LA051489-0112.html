			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REPAIRS SCHEDULED FOR PARKING LOT AT CABRILLO BEACH  </P> <P> Repairs to the Cabrillo Beach parking lot that was damaged by a winter storm in  1987 will begin in August.  </P> <P> Half of the 320 spaces at the parking lot off Stephen White Drive in San Pedro  were lost when pounding waves sent boulders flying from a sea wall onto the  lot.  </P> <P> Bids for the repair job are expected to go out Tuesday, said officials of the  city Recreation and Parks Department, which operates the lot. Construction is  to begin in August and will cost about $400,000.  </P> <P> Lot manager Jean Thaxton said the missing spaces are badly needed because the  lot serves a popular beach, museum and boat launch area.  </P></p>

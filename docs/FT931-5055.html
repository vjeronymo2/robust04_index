			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: HK Electric beats forecasts with 30% rise HONGKONG Electric, which operates the electric power monopoly on Hong Kong island, has exceeded expectations by reporting a 30 per cent rise in 1992 earnings to HKDollars 3.05bn (USDollars 394m) from HKDollars 2.3bn in 1991. Profit was struck on a 9.3 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars 5.3bn, from HKDollars 4.8bn. The directors declared a final dividend of 52 cents a share, making 82 cents for the year - a rise of 17 per cent on 1991. Mr Simon Murray, chairman, said Secan, the group's property development associate, contributed more than 20 per cent of pre-tax profits. Analysts expect the company's land bank to be fully utilised by the end of 1994. Mr Murray said the electric company recorded a profit growth of 14 per cent during the year. Unit sales of electricity rose by 4 per cent - well below the overall growth rate of Hong Kong's economy of 5 per cent in real terms. During the year the company invested HKDollars 2.97bn in new electricity and power facilities.</p>

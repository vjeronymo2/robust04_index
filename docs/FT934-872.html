			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Further pay-out at Atlantic Total liabilities of Atlantic Computer Systems, the leasing company that collapsed in April 1990, should not exceed Pounds 168m, the liquidators said yesterday. With net realisations of up to Pounds 39.2m under current estimates, that could lead to a further dividend of 4p in the pound after an interim payment announced this week of 19p. Mr Richard Boys-Stones, one of the liquidators from Price Waterhouse, the accountants, said the payment reflected his strategy of 'maximising the realisations and minimising the liabilities'. The recalculated liabilities figure contrasts sharply with the estimate of nearly Pounds 450m provided by Atlantic's directors at the time it went into administration.</p>

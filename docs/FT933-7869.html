			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / EC steel shake-up 'overdue' THE LORDS EC energy, industry and transport committee today rejects any notion of 'national burden-sharing' in planned cuts to Europe's steelmaking capacity. In a strongly worded report the committee says large-scale restructuring of the EC steel sector, which is suffering from chronic overcapacity and recession, is long overdue. It warns against state subsidies to support inefficient production and says: 'There is a real danger that efficient private firms such as British Steel . . . will suffer at the expense of inefficient state firms such as the bankrupt Ilva in Italy.' Mr Brian Moffat, chairman of British Steel, has argued that continental steelmakers should reduce overcapacity to match the heavy cuts made in the UK. The committee's report comes at a sensitive time for the EC steel industry. More than 30m tonnes of crude steel capacity have been recommended for closure, leading to an estimated 70,000 job cuts. The committee says British Steel does not expect to participate in the current closures but the UK government has not ruled out further cuts. It says competitive forces should be allowed to determine the future structure and location of the industry, but expresses concern about the human costs of closures.

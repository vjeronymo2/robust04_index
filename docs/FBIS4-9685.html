			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has reiterated that  legislative decree No. 776 [not further specified] will not be  repealed. He said this issue will not be dealt with in political  discussions. Commenting on another issue, Fujimori said he  respects his Ecuadoran counterpart's, Sixto Duran-Ballen, the  decision against traveling to Peru, but he made it clear that  the invitation still stands.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have to continue working  along the same serious lines, without adding any demagogic or  populist ingredient. Because you know what the answers are; the  people are well aware of them -- earnest effort, sound  management of the economy, and unheard-of levels of government  resources, which total some billion dollars. International  reserves exceed the benchmark of $3 billion. We are now talking  about billions, not millions. The government will continue with  the same economic program, which will enable us to definitely  overcome our problems. We have to avoid discussing or taking  measures by letting ourselves be carried away by a passing  euphoria because that will be tantamount to going backwards. We  have to avoid this at all costs. This is why I am not concerned  about public opinion polls.    [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct]    [Fujimori] I am going to continue with my job, I am going to  work harder and earnestly in handling the economy and everything  we have started.    [Reporter] Is there going to be any change with regard to  the  decree, some details of which have been criticized?    [Fujimori] The decree [passage indistinct].    [Reporter] With regard to the Ecuadoran president's decision  to suspend his visit to Peru [passage indistinct].    [Fujimori] Only through the media. As you very well know,  both the Ecuadoran community and the president himself [words  indistinct] Peru is awaiting this visit with open arms. Whether  this visit has been postponed or not, whether it will be made in  the near future or not, we want to welcome him with open arms.  I suppose there are circumstances preventing him from coming to  Peru for the time being.    [Reporters interrupting] [passage indistinct]    [Fujimori] The invitation still stands; it is an ongoing and  open invitation.    [Reporter] In any case, Mr. President, this decision to  postpone this trip again...    [Fujimori, interrupting] These are decisions that the  invited  person has every right to take -- to set the most appropriate  date. We will conform to this...    [Reporter interrupting] Do you think, Mr. President, that  relations between the two countries may deteriorate because of  this decision?    [Fujimori] No, bilateral relations are at their highest  level. Current circumstances do not change the [words  indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

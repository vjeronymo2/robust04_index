State President F.W. de Klerk and  ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela met  again today to discuss the issue and indicated that other  parties would have to be consulted.    [Begin recording] [De Klerk] The government has a specific  role to play with regard to law and order and the prevention of  violence. We've discussed our plans in that regard with Mr.  Mandela. We will be discussing those plans also with the  Transitional Executive Council. I will also be discussing them  with Chief Minister Buthelezi because of the importance of the  Inkatha Freedom Party in the conflict situation. We will be  discussing it with the peace structures.    [Reporter Linda van Tilburg] Mr. De Klerk was commenting on  his talks with Mr. Mandela this morning after meeting with  French Foreign Minister, Mr. Alain Juppe. He indicated that an  announcement could be made on addressing the East Rand violence  by the end of the week. The president wouldn't confirm whether  the Internal Stability Unit would be withdrawn from the East  Rand, but said security force numbers could be boosted in  strife-torn townships. Mr. Mandela was whisked away from the  Union Buildings after refusing to talk about what had transpired  during the meeting. He told TV news the issue was extremely  sensitive. [end recording]</p>

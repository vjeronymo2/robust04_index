			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: German Bank puts in offer for BNC stake A little-known German bank is thought to be behind the mysterious counter-bid for Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni (BNC), the Italian bank being courted by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino. Italian news agencies said the Bank fur Vermogensnlagen und Handel (BVH), based in Dusseldorf, had confirmed it had tabled an offer for a stake in BNC, which is controlled by the Italian railway. Mr Publio Fiori, the Italian transport minister, has claimed over the past few weeks that a counter-bid for BNC was imminent. He is trying to pressure San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, into amending its preliminary all-share bid for BNC, to safeguard the interests of the state railways. BVH and Mr Fiori's office - which is reported to have received the BVH offer on Wednesday night - were silent yesterday on details of any alternative bid. San Paolo, the only group to have declared a formal interest, still seems the favourite to acquire BNC. Mr Fiori's intervention has irritated the Italian Treasury and the Bank of Italy. Last month he accused the central bank, responsible for vetting bank takeovers, of trying to force BNC into the San Paolo fold.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: DG Bank ahead DEUTSCHE Genossen-schaftsbank, the central bank for Germany's co-operative, said it would only break even in 1992 due to high costs of foreign branch closures and staff cuts, and poor trading conditions in Germany, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. DG's partial operating profits jumped to DM69m in the first half, against DM14m, which is half of total 1991 partial operating profits. Last year's plunge followed outlays of DM800m for bond deals.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wyko Pounds 4m in red but this year starts well Wyko, the West Midlands-based industrial distribution and engineering group, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.16m in the year to April 30, but resumed profitable trading in the first quarter of its current year. The deficit, foreshadowed in statements in January and May, was expected as the group provided for the cost of a policy under which, as Mr Philip White, chairman, put it yesterday, 'all our major problems have been firmly addressed'. Mr White said this year there had been 'sustained improvement in demand within our UK distribution business and improved trading results elsewhere in the group.' This justified a dividend of 0.5p, half of the previous year's payment when the year end pre-tax loss was Pounds 20,000. Losses per share were 11.3p (0.5p). Total turnover was Pounds 58.3m (Pounds 57.4m) including Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 6.47m) from discontinued operations. There were exceptional or one-off items of expenditure of more than Pounds 3.4m. These covered withdrawal from South Africa, the concentration of manufacturing sites and, most significantly, Pounds 1.2m to provide for withdrawal from capital equipment manufacture: units in this business will be sold individually. Losses at the operating level amounted to Pounds 3.4m, compared with profits of Pounds 753,000. Shareholders' funds dropped from Pounds 15m to Pounds 10.9m during the year. Gearing fell to 33 per cent (45 per cent).</p>

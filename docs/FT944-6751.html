			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (2): EU changes tack - Policy Tensions in Brussels The European Commission is working hard to improve energy efficiency by EU-wide regulation. But the results fall far short of its ambitions. Economic pressures, rock-bottom fuel prices and political wrangling between EU governments have thwarted Brussels on the two main planks of its energy efficiency campaign - the ill-fated carbon tax and a clutch of energy-saving programmes. Both initiatives have effectively stalled. Driving the EU's campaign is a commitment made in the mid-1980s to raise energy savings by 20 per cent between 1986 and 1995. Current estimates by the Commission energy directorate are that saving will be only 11-12 per cent. Brussels officials partly blame the historically low energy prices. But confusion over whether the EU's main priorities should be economic or environmental has also frustrated the Commission. A second policy commitment, motivated purely by environmental concerns, is the objective agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth summit to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000. That target is also likely to be missed, although estimates vary over the shortfall. Environment commissioner Yannis Paleokrassas has predicted a shortfall of 15 per cent by the end of the century. These two objectives have co-existed uneasily, and much of the blame for the failure of EU energy-saving policy is attributed to the confusion between them. 'The carbon tax has actually been the bane of energy efficiency policy because it has distracted everyone's attention from the other measures,' says Mr Andrew Warren, director of the London-based Association for the Conservation of Energy. But those other measures - led by the Commission's Ecu 35m five-year Save (Specific Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency) - programme have also fallen victim to the post-Maastricht Treaty campaign for subsidiarity. The Commission's energy directorate, DG17, is therefore drawing up a second Save scheme which will be mainly educational, with none of the legally-binding directives envisaged in the first one. The new low-key approach is in stark contrast to Brussels' previous ambitions, which reached a high peak in 1992 when Carlo Ripa di Meana, then environment commissioner, proposed the controversial energy tax. Now, although the Commission continues to promote it, it is generally agreed that the carbon tax is dead. According to the original Brussels proposal the tax would have levied Dollars 10 - later watered down to Dollars 3 - on the equivalent of a barrel of oil. Such fiscal interference by the EU has been flatly rejected by the UK, in defiance of compromise plans tabled by a succession of governments in the EU's rotating six-month presidency. The EU's southern states also posed problems, arguing the tax would discriminate against their less developed economies. The attempt to break the deadlock this year, when the Greek presidency tried to tempt the sceptical southern EU states with compensatory 'burden-sharing' arrangements, did not even address the UK's opposition. The Commission, supported by the current German presidency, is now pushing this debate in a far less controversial direction. The latest suggestions, yet to translate into any formal proposal, are to attack CO emissions through the EU's regime for excise duties and VAT on fuel. The UK, although still deeply opposed to relax its grip over fiscal policy, has to some extent led the way along this path by imposing VAT on domestic electricity - a move estimated to achieve 25 per cent of Britain's targeted reduction in carbon emissions. The EU excise and VAT system, established at the start of 1993, is due for review by the end of the year but is likely to be delayed into the next Commission, which takes office in January. The debate is still likely to be dogged by arguments over sovereignty, however. Meanwhile, Brussels is adapting its other energy-saving programmes to the new political climate. Gone are its ambitions to set EU- wide fuel-conservation standards on building construction and management - a key failure of the original Save programme which led to the watering down of six directives. Instead the Commission plans to limit legislation to areas covered by existing EU internal market rules - in other words in traded goods, such as fridges and boilers, where Save has already had some success. Gone also is the idea of overruling national laws with new directives from Brussels. 'From now on we are following the added-value concept - what can Save add to the national programmes,' says the Commission. The new approach, expected to be spelled out by the German presidency at a Council of Environment ministers in Brussels next month, is also geared more closely to market realities. For example, the new proposed directive on third party financing would create incentives for banks to fund energy saving at public institutions such as hospitals. Increasingly funds are being directed at projects for eastern Europe, both from Save and from the EU's Pounds 700m five-year Thermie programme, which aims to promote new energy-saving technologies.</p>

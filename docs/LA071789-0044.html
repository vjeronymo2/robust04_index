			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REWARDS ARE OFFERED FOR IDENTITIES OF FIRMS LINKED TO WATER POLLUTION  </P> <P> Disappointed by the Environmental Protection Agency's delay in cleaning up  contaminated ground water in the San Gabriel Valley, about 1,100 members of a  church-based community organization voted Sunday to offer rewards to  individuals who identify companies responsible for the pollution.  </P> <P> But an EPA official, who spoke at the East Valleys Organizations' annual  assembly at St. John the Baptist Church auditorium in Baldwin Park, said it  would be difficult to positively identify the sources of the pollution that has  affected 20% of the 200-square-mile San Gabriel Valley water basin and seeped  into 245 of the area's 400 wells.  </P> <P> Under the federal Superfund law, which provides money to remove toxics, the EPA  must try to recover expenses from companies that caused the damage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Term Habits  </P> <P> "While I support the concept of having citizens on the alert for companies that  spill (toxic) materials, it's going to be very, very hard and very complex  because for 50 years or longer industry and others have deliberately put  contaminants in the ground water," said Jeffrey Zelikson, director of hazardous  waste management in EPA's western region.  </P> <P> The reward program was endorsed Sunday by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner, Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente), and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los  Angeles).  </P> <P> Both Torres and Roos told the gathering that they would consider proposing  legislation in support of the program. Their endorsements were followed by  bursts of applause and standing ovations from the audience.  </P> <P> Details of the reward program will be worked out at a conference of EVO  leaders, Reiner and Torres. EVO is a coalition of 12 San Gabriel Valley and  Pomona Valley churches, and claims a membership of 35,000 families.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television In the second of its three programmes about Billy Wilder, Arena (9.30 BBC2) covers the making of various movies from Ace In The Hole to Sabrina. Discussing Sunset Boulevard, Wilder explains that Mae West was the original choice to play the ageing star of the silent movies, though Gloria Swanson eventually got the part. At 12.05 BBC2 screens Sunset Boulevard itself, just about the best Hollywood put-down ever made, matched only by Kenneth Anger's weird book, Hollywood Babylon, in its readiness to concentrate on the warts and forget the all. The script is wonderfully acid. Channel 4 presents the first in another series (the fourth) of Whose Line Is It Anyway? (10.35) one of the few really different ideas to have turned up in television light entertainment in 25 years. Once again Clive Anderson chairs the contest in which entertainers improvise before a studio audience. Clashing head on with Sunset Boulevard at 12.05 is Monterey Pop (C4), DA Pennebaker's account of the 1967 International Pop Festival where the performers included Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, and, in an extraordinary finale, Ravi Shankar.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Israelis kill activists MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said last night he had instructed the army to continue its intensified hunt for violent Palestinian activists in the occupied territories, thus ignoring protests from the Palestine Liberation Organisation, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. Two members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement were killed by the army on Saturday, in a big offensive in the Gaza Strip that prompted a letter of complaint to Mr Rabin from Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. Mr Rabin said that Israeli troops would continue to target 'all terror forces'. He added that the army and security services had recently uncovered, on the West Bank, three other Hamas cells believed to be responsible for having killed two soldiers and three Jewish settlers. The army's operation at the weekend involved hundreds of soldiers and curfews being extended to large areas of the Gaza Strip. Mr Arafat's letter complained that the offensive - which followed the capture of six pro-PLO fighters in the West Bank earlier last week - violated the spirit of the peace deal between Israel and Palestinians.</p>

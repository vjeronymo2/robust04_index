			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALFONSIN TO FINISH TERM IN ARGENTINA, BATTLE INFLATION  </P> <P> A newly forceful President Raul Alfonsin declared Tuesday that he will serve  out his term rather than hand over power early to his Peronist successor, and  he pledged "a war economy" to fight raging inflation.  </P> <P> "What is certain is that we are resolved to govern without dismay until Dec.  10, so no one should come and say that what might happen is reason for an  earlier hand-over," the president said in a nationally broadcast address.  </P> <P> Alfonsin said President-elect Carlos Saul Menem's negotiators backed down from  an apparently firm agreement on an emergency economic package to reduce runaway  inflation, which was to accompany the transition.  </P> <P> Menem denied that the Peronists had broken a deal with Alfonsin's ruling party,  the Radical Civic Union, and said he is still willing to talk but "without  committing ourselves to short-term measures that work against the people."  </P> <P> He said Alfonsin's speech was "more or less adequate under the circumstances"  and added, "I prefer that the president depart without resigning and with all  the honors that are due to a man who has fought for democracy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans Bold Action  </P> <P> Alfonsin, who has appeared discouraged and directionless in recent weeks,  promised a bold new style "which is not to my taste" -- a tough, demanding  campaign, using government-run media, to get the economy under control.  </P> <P> The standoff left the country where it stood in the days after Menem's May 14  trouncing of the Radicals' candidate, Eduardo Cesar Angeloz: facing an  uncertain seven months under a lame-duck administration with the currency  crashing and annual inflation of more than 8,000%. Meat prices soared by more  than 80% this week alone.  </P> <P> The Radicals had sought an accord with the labor-based Peronist party for  higher taxes, exchange controls and other measures to restore order. Economy  Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese had acknowledged that without the Peronists'  support, any program imposed by the Radicals was doomed.  </P> <P> Menem's advisers, anxious not to spend their political capital on a risky  venture even before Menem takes office, insisted they would not co-sponsor any  plan. Menem, governor of the small province of La Rioja, said he opposes higher  taxes and fees and wants salary increases for workers whose buying power has  been decimated by the unprecedented inflation and more aid for the bankrupt  provinces.  </P> <P> Alfonsin said he failed to understand how the Peronists could hope to increase  both salaries and provincial funding while refusing to approve ways to raise  the money to do so.  </P> <P> The 62-year-old president, who oversaw the transition from a seven-year  dictatorship to democratic rule after taking office in 1983, noted that no  other Argentine president has ever handed over power to an elected successor  from another party.  </P> <P> "I had a great dream, as you know, because I have referred to it many times: to  complete the mandate of six years," he said. In accepting the notion of  shortening the transition, Alfonsin said he took into account that "the mission  was completed, we had already had the elections, there was already a  president-elect and the consolidation of democracy was practically a reality."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Homage to Democracy'  </P> <P> "Of course it was painful, but it was called for in homage to democracy  itself," he added.  </P> <P> Following the failure of that effort, "We are going to create not only a war  economy but a crisis government. . . . We are going to carry forward a program  with social awareness, but it will of course be tough, as everyone can  imagine."  </P> <P> He said the currency exchange market will be closed for the rest of the week to  allow the Radicals' economic team to complete the emergency package, which is  to be announced by Sunday. All Cabinet members resigned Tuesday night, and  Alfonsin is expected to make some changes.  </P> <P> Congressman Eduardo Bauza, Menem's chief negotiator, told reporters that  Alfonsin sought "to shift to us the blame for the current situation without  accepting any of the responsibility for it."  </P> <P> He said that "in the face of this arrogance of the government, we cannot  continue negotiating. . . . The economic measures that they take are the risk  of the Alfonsin administration."  </P> <P> A Radical legislator involved in the talks said privately that "every 15  minutes they (the Peronists) changed negotiators and negotiating themes. They  viewed our act of grandeur as weakness."  </P> <P> He added that some Peronists wanted a broader accord, including an agreement to  end trials of military officers for human rights violations, a constant  disruptive factor during Alfonsin's administration.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Radio group loses both Devon licences two of the main companies in the industry - has lost both its broadcasting licences. The Radio Authority yesterday decided not to renew the licences of DevonAir which broadcasts in the Exeter and Torbay area. It awarded both FM and AM licences to Gemini Radio, a local consortium put together by Mr Ivor Stolliday, a former secretary of the ITV Association and Television South West; and Mr David Rogers, managing director of Orchard FM in Somerset. The authority gave detailed reasons for its decision for the first time. It said it had awarded the licences to Gemini 'because it was particularly impressed by the applicant's coherent, detailed and well-researched proposals for two complementary AM and FM programme services'. DevonAir appears to have lost because it broadcasts the same mainly pop-orientated service on AM and FM. Gemini, which takes over in January 1995, plans to have at least 45 per cent speech on its AM service. The authority will advertise the franchise for the mainly speech-based third national commercial station on November 30.</p>

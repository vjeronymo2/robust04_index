			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli warplanes stepped up reconnaissance of Syrian army positions in Lebanon  amid tension over reports that Syria is preparing its troops for an assault on  Christian forces. Syrian troops did not open fire on the Israeli planes, which  flew for two hours over Syrian positions in the hills above Beirut as well over  Muslim West Beirut and southern Lebanon, military sources said. Muslim militia  sources said that Syria beefed up its estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon to put  pressure on Christian army commander Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces oppose  the pro-Syrian Muslim government of Premier Salim Hoss.  </P></p>

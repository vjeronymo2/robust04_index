[In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0944 GMT on 10  January adds the following: "Israel and the PLO returned to the  negotiating table at this Red Sea resort on Monday with chief  Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th confidently predicting an  accord within three weeks.    ["`I don't think it will take any more than two-three  weeks,'  Sha'th told reporters as he went into the talks seeking to iron  out differences over the implementation of the September 13  autonomy agreement.    ["`We have to finish as soon as possible and we are ready.  If there is goodwill from both sides, and I believe there is,  it will be done.    ["`Today the purpose of the discussion will be a general  review of where we are and a plan to finish in three weeks.'    ["Sha'th offered reporters an image of how much work  remained  saying if the agreement represents 100 pages only two pages  still had to be completed.    ["But he added: `The most difficult issue is willingness to  finish.'    ["Sha'th accused Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid of  violating the agreement when he stated Sunday that he expected  the talks to last two months.    ["`It is said when publicly you say it will take two months,  it is violating the agreement,' Sha'th charged.    ["Israel delegation spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska said: `I  think Mr. Sha'th's estimations are too optimistic and the  negotiations should last longer because a lot of problems  remain.'    ["The two delegations held a brief plenary session at the  Hilton Hotel and then Sha'th and Shahaq went into a meeting  alone."]</p>

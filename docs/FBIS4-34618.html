The decree also names Miguel  Angel Maidana Zayas as presidential general secretary and civil  household chief, and Hugo Saguier Caballero as integration  minister.    The president, exercising his prerogative, created the new  Political Affairs General Secretariat to handle the presidency's  relations with political parties and movements. Secretary  General Melgarejo Lanzoni is currently Paraguayan ambassador to  the OAS in Washington.    Integration Minister Saguier Caballero was presidential  secretary general and civil household chief while his successor,  Maidana Zayas, was the presidential legal adviser.

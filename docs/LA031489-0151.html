BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UPS ORDERS 10 BOEING FREIGHTERS  </P> <P> United Parcel Service has ordered 10 more Boeing 757-200PF jet freighters at a  cost of about $500 million, the jetliner maker said today.  </P> <P> In 1985, UPS ordered 20 757-200PFs -- for "package freighters" -- and took  options on another 15.

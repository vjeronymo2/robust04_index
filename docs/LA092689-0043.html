			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal investigators went inside the wreckage of a USAir jet, looking for  additional clues to the cause of last week's aborted takeoff and crash into the  East River that killed two people. Local authorities announced a grand jury  would investigate the crash of the Boeing 737-400 to see if any criminal  charges are warranted. The aircraft was headed for Charlotte, N.C., when it  slid off the runway. Queens Dist. Atty. John J. Santucci said he initially had  no designated targets and would not seek specific charges. But sources in  Santucci's office said the grand jury might be asked to consider charges  including criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and leaving the  scene of an accident.  </P></p>

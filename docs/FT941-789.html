			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Argentina pensions flare-up The president of Argentina's securities commission has refused to accept government demands he resign after criticising a proposal by the US investment banks CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch to handle share sales for the country's pensioners. Mr Martin Redrado, president of the CNV securities commission, said a proposal by the two companies to sell an estimated Dollars 720m worth of shares in YPF, the privatised oil company, was against the interests of the pensioners. 'I am not resigning,' Mr Redrado said yesterday. 'I am defending disclosure and protecting investors and the independence a regulator needs to have in a credible market.' His tenure is guaranteed by law until 1996, he said and challenged the government to remove him. Charges proposed by the two banks, 3.75 per cent commission plus a 50 cent discount on the YPF share price in New York, were excessive, Mr Redrado declared. He demanded the pensioners be offered a better deal. An economy ministry official said: 'Someone who does not agree with the government's policies should leave.' Neither First Boston nor Merrill Lynch would comment on the issue. Merrill Lynch and First Boston underwrote the Dollars 3.04bn sale of 45 per cent of YPF in last year's privatisation.</p>

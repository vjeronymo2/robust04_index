			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Auditors likely to have more inspections The government is poised to require that auditors are subject to far more frequent inspections by regulators in efforts to improve quality. In proposals likely to be announced in the next few days, accountancy firms judged to be particularly high risk will be subject to the most intense scrutiny. The moves are part of an attempt to ensure that those with lower standards are examined as quickly as possible. The recommendations are the outcome of the first detailed evaluation by the Department of Trade and Industry of the system of audit self-regulation that was introduced two years ago. They follow officials' consideration of a report commissioned from Mr Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at Leeds University, and submitted earlier this year. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, is expected to give a parliamentary answer this week in which he will rule out some of the more radical suggestions made in the Moizer report. These included merging the three existing regulatory bodies for auditors and opening them up to greater independent public scrutiny. Mr Hamilton is expected to say that the present system of monitoring is generally working well but that there is scope for improvement. He will call for a wider range of monitoring methods, and efforts to ensure that these methods match more closely the differing circumstances of practitioners. He will also ask the supervisory bodies to submit in the autumn their proposals on how these recommendations will be implemented. The Moizer report will be made public by putting it in the library of the House of Commons. This is in spite of pressure from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to suppress its findings, which the institute felt were unfair. The report was more in favour of the approach taken by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which visits its firms more frequently and is perceived to be more sympathetic in dealing with weaknesses. The report also argued that the present system was unlikely to improve standards among the larger firms.</p>

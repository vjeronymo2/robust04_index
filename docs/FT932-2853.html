			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Ilyushin wins first big order from west THE first airliner jointly built by Russian and US companies has won its first western order, at the Paris Air Show this week. Partnairs, an Amsterdam-based aircraft trading and leasing company, has placed an order for up to 10 Ilyushin IL-96M, worth about Dollars 700m (Pounds 454.5m). The aircraft is Russia's challenge to the new generation of long-haul airliners from the European Airbus consortium and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US. Deliveries of the 318-seat Russian aircraft, powered by four US Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and fitted with advanced US fly-by-wire technology and digital flight navigation equipment produced by Rockwell Collins, are due to begin in 1996. United Technologies (UTC), Pratt &amp; Whitney's parent company, said Partnairs had placed five firm orders for the new aircraft and taken options on an additional five. The deal was worth about Dollars 280m for Pratt &amp; Whitney, according to a UTC official. Ilyushin, together with the rest of the Russian aerospace industry, has been seeking to introduce western engines and avionics on Russian airliners to gain access to western markets and badly needed hard currency. Tupolev has equipped its TU-204 mid-range 200-seater twin jet airliner with Rolls-Royce engines. Russian airframe manufacturers could eventually pose a longer term challenge to western manufacturers because their products are priced about 25-30 per cent lower than equivalent western jets. Ilyushin has about 40 firm orders and options for its new airliner, including Russian International Airlines, Aeroflot's international division.</p>

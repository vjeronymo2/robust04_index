			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NISSAN IS JAPAN'S FIRST CAR MAKER TO GO ALL-AMERICAN;  </P> <P> AUTOMOBILES: WORK HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON A MINI-VAN THAT WILL BE DESIGNED,  ENGINEERED AND BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES.  </P> <P> In what could represent a dramatic shift in Japanese business strategy, Japan's  auto makers are starting to develop the ability to completely design, engineer  and build new cars in the United States -- with little or no input from their  central offices in Japan.  </P> <P> Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, has quietly become the first major  Japanese firm to begin work on such an all-American project. Here on the  outskirts of Detroit, Nissan has set up a sprawling engineering complex where  260 Japanese and American engineers and other staffers -- many of them emigres  from the nearby offices of the Big Three auto makers -- are working side by  side on the first Japanese auto to be developed in the United States.  </P> <P> Nissan Research and Development, the auto maker's engineering unit, is  performing the developmental work on a new mini-van that was designed by  Nissan's design studio in San Diego.  </P> <P> Starting in 1992, the front-wheel-drive mini-van will be assembled in a Ford  factory in Avon Lake, Ohio, through a joint venture between Nissan and Ford and  finally will be sold both by Nissan and by Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division.  </P> <P> While Nissan and other major Japanese auto makers have had design and styling  studios in California for years, the Nissan mini-van represents the first time  that a Japanese product designed in California will actually be engineered and  fully developed in the United States. Previously, initial clay models proposed  by stylists in Southern California were shipped back to Japan, where Japanese  engineers then turned the designs into cars ready for manufacture.  </P> <P> Nissan's decision to shift engineering resources from Japan to the United  States follows new policy guidelines set by the company's top management to try  to become a truly global company, rather than just a Japanese corporation that  sells worldwide, according to Nissan R&amp;D President Takeshi Tanuma, who is  now based here in Plymouth.  </P> <P> "Nissan wants to have one complete auto company in the United States," Tanuma  said. "Once we have a complete auto company here, then we will be insiders in  the American auto industry."  </P> <P> Nissan's action also follows years of warnings by some American economists and  industry observers that the Japanese would provide only unskilled factory jobs  to Americans -- so that they could assemble cars here and thus skirt U.S. trade  sanctions -- but would always keep the really good jobs for highly educated  professionals back home in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "They only want our brute strength," Maryann Keller, the well-known automotive  analyst with the Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney brokerage in New York,  has complained.  </P> <P> To be sure, Nissan's mini-van project has required help from Japan. For  example, the van's front-wheel-drive transmission and its V-6 engine were  designed in Japan -- at least in part because Nissan engineers felt that Ford's  comparable American-designed engines were outmoded.  </P> <P> But Tanuma still believes that the rapid pace of change in the U.S. car market  is making it increasingly difficult for designers and engineers working in  Japan to keep up with American tastes, without at least some engineering and  design facilities in the United States.  </P> <P> The recent flap over the court case involving a Nissan engineer who lived  undercover with an Orange County family -- allegedly spying on them and their  neighbors while concealing his real identity -- was really an outgrowth of the  new Japanese determination to "Americanize" their products.  </P> <P> "It is difficult for Japanese engineers to tell what is luxury in the United  States, to tell what American tastes are," Tanuma said.  </P> <P> "Is it possible for a Japanese to understand American tastes while sitting in  Tokyo on a tatami mat? To understand what it is like to sit in a big American  house, with a big American living room, while he is sitting in his . . . little  Japanese apartment?"  </P> <P> Honda has also begun to rely more heavily on American engineers for its new  cars. About 250 Honda engineers, working at the company's massive Marysville,  Ohio, manufacturing complex, are performing most of the development work on a  new 1991 Honda Accord station wagon, which was largely designed by Honda's  design center in Torrance.  </P> <P> The Accord station wagon will be produced exclusively in the United States and  then exported to the rest of the world, according to Shigeaki Kato, Honda  spokesman in Detroit.  </P> <P> But Honda has not yet taken the leap that Nissan has -- completely developing a  new product in America. Kato noted that while the Accord wagon was developed  here, the basic Accord sedan model was designed in Japan.  </P> <P> "But we've said that Honda would become a self-reliant company in this  country," he added, "and that means that eventually we want to design, engineer  and build a car completely independent of Japan. But you don't do that  overnight. . . .  </P> <P> "Our (American) manufacturing in Ohio is now mature, and the research and  development and engineering aspects of our American operations are growing,"  Kato added. "The next step could possibly be a complete car."  </P></p>

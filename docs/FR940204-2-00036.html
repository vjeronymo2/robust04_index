			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Award of Cooperative Agreements is anticipated. All projects shall be cost shared by DOE and the participant. Applicants should be aware that any awardee shall be required to have a cost share of not less than 20% of the total cost of the program for the research and development phases and 50% of the total cost of the program for the demonstration phase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the interest of the natural gas industry in this solicitation, it is expected that segments of that industry may make some cost share funds available to applicants for projects they consider to be beneficial to their segment of the industry. The natural gas industry has typically supported the research, development and demonstration phases of projects. The Industrial Gas Technology Commercialization Center (IGTCC), 1515 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22209, has agreed to serve as a clearinghouse for channelling gas industry funding into projects. Applicants wishing to be considered for natural gas industry support should contact David L. Sgrignoli, Executive Director (telephone number 703&hyph;841&hyph;8561) at IGTCC before submitting proposals. It is suggested that bidders contact IGTCC as early in the proposal preparation process as is practical. While the cost share requirements of EPAct must be met, natural gas industry funding is NOT required to obtain DOE support. Likewise, natural gas industry funding will NOT provide assurance of DOE support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No fee or profit will be paid to the award recipients. DOE anticipates that approximately $873,000 will be available for support of activities during FY&hyph;94. It is anticipated that there will be one or more awards. Available funds for future years is anticipated to be at the same or an increased level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual project duration will not exceed 5 years. Project(s) with durations of less than 5 years and in any phase (I, II or III) of development are eligible, if conclusive evidence is presented that previous phase(s) have been completed successfully. All applications with project periods of 5 years or less will be given equal consideration. Initial awards will be for one year, with subsequent year extensions, contingent on available DOE funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications shall contain a well defined research concept and plan; confirmed industrial partner participation and support; and indicate satisfactory expertise, experience, capabilities, resources, and management of R&amp;D team personnel; and adequate facilities to perform the research including a potential host facility for demonstration purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection is expected to be made in June 1994 and the earliest award is expected to be made in November 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negotiation, award, and administration will be in accordance with DOE Financial Assistance Regulations (10 CFR part 600).

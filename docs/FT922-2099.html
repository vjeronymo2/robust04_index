			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Euro MPs press over Maastricht TORY MEPs yesterday increased the pressure on Mr John Major to tackle opposition to Maastricht by adding a protocol that would ensure decisions are made at the lowest possible level of government. At an hour-long meeting at Downing Street, the members of the European parliament supported the prime minister's determination to press ahead on ratification of the treaty. But they urged him to work for a 'Citizen's Europe', based on greater decentralisation. Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Tory MEPs, said Mr Major had been 'upbeat' about the delegation's proposals for a Citizen's Charter for Europe. The MEPs were also anxious to make an early start on ensuring a positive message by Tories in the 1994 European elections - in contrast to the party's poor performance in 1989. Sir Christopher said the UK government, in its presidency of the EC from next month, ought to carry through the idea ministers have floated of a protocol reinforcing the principle of 'subsidiarity'. It was winning support in the European parliament, he said. A protocol would have to be binding on all EC members, even though that would require a technical negotiation of the treaty, Sir Christopher said. He suggested that work on the protocol would not need to start until the 11 countries, other than Denmark, had ratified the treaty. Sir Christopher reiterated Mr Major's pledge to put Britain at the heart of Europe, in spite of the row over Maastricht. 'If we just stand aside, it will become the thing we most fear - a centralised Europe,' he said. The meeting counter-balanced pressure on Mr Major from Conservative Euro-sceptics in the Commons, highlighting the spread of views across the party.</p>

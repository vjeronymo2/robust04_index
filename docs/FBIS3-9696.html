			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes is visiting  Slovenia. He has already met with the highest state officials,  namely, President Kucan, Prime Minister Drnovsek, and Foreign  Minister Peterle. After the talks Willy Claes and Lojze Peterle  signed a bilateral agreement on road and air traffic between  Belgium and Slovenia. The ministers assessed today's talks at  the news conference from which we have a report by Igor Juric:    [Begin recording] [Juric] Willy Claes assessed the talks as  successful, which is not surprising because there are no  problems between the countries. He emphasized the importance of  the signing of today's agreement and spoke in favor of imminent  agreement on double taxation and protection of investments, and  an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation, which would  strengthen the contacts between the countries. He spoke most,  however, about the relations between Slovenia and the European  Union:    [Claes, in English with superimposed translation into  Slovene] I believe that the time has come for final  negotiations on associate membership between Slovenia and the  European Union. At the end of the week I will meet with Jacques  Delors and urge him that the negotiating team that has already  visited Slovenia faces the council as soon as possible and  proposes its views on negotiations.    The final admittance will, of course, depend on the European  Parliament and the parliaments of individual member-states of  the Union. I believe that Slovenia meets all the criteria and  our state will support you wholeheartedly in this.    [Juric] In the continuation he also said he doubted that the  next expansion of the European Union would occur before 1996 as  the present members must first resolve their internal problems.  He concurred with our foreign minister that a gradual approach  is needed in the integration with the European Union.    Minister Peterle said that Slovenia has made the biggest  steps toward the European Union so far while Belgium was the  chairman of the Union. The result of good relations between the  countries is also the signing of today's agreement, which is the  first between the countries, and will definitely help more  intense economic cooperation.

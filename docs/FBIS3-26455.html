The two satellites have now been injected into synchronous  orbits, according to reports from Xian Satellite Control Center  and the space measurement vessel "Yuanwang" which was observing  the satellites at the Pacific.    The two satellites were launched by a "Long-March 3A"  carrier  rocket, which was developed recently by the Space Industry  Corporation for launching China's new-type communications  satellites.    The "Long-March 3A" rocket, which was patterned after  "Long-March 3," is capable of launching a 2.5-ton satellite.    The "Long-March 3" rocket, which is capable of launching a  1.4-ton satellite, ranks fourth in the world in terms of  launching capabilities.    The scientific satellite "SJ-4", carrying six sound  instruments, will probe charged particles and their effects in  near-earth space.    With the satellite, which was developed by the space center  under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese space scientists  can calculate the parameter of the particles' distribution and  the necessary electric potential for charging satellite  batteries.</p>

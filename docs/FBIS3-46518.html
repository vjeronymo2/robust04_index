She said: "As the international community sees  it, Japan is already a power. The country should make better  use of the United Nations in every meaning."    Regarding a survey mission the Foreign Ministry plans to  send  to the former Yugoslavia, she said, "Even the simple fact that  Japanese will be actually going to the site has meaning in  itself."    Referring to the question of making contributions to the  former Yugoslavia, meanwhile, a source in the Foreign Ministry  said on the same day that "if for preventive diplomacy in  Macedonia, there should be many ways of doing it from the  humanitarian viewpoint." [phrase as published] Thus, the source  revealed that the ministry is also willing to send a survey  mission to Macedonia to probe the possibility of providing  assistance.</p>

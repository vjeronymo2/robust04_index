			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Inquiry head used to security issues LORD Justice Scott, who will head the judicial inquiry into the Matrix Churchill affair, is no stranger to dealing with sensitive issues involving the security and intelligence services. In 1983 as a newly appointed High Court judge, he presided over the case brought by the government against The Guardian newspaper for return of a confidential document leaked by Ms Sarah Tisdall, the former Foreign Office clerk. He ruled that the document should be returned on the grounds that it was government property. Ms Tisdall was later convicted under the Official Secrets Act and jailed for six months. In 1987 he presided over the first Spycatcher hearings and refused the government injunctions banning newspapers from publishing extracts of the book by the former MI5 officer Mr Peter Wright. It was this decision which established his reputation as a member of the 'liberal wing' of the judiciary, a reputation enhanced when he spoke out in light of the Spycatcher case against the dangers of government legislation on confidentiality. He also has a reputation for being open-minded and pragmatic. In 1985, agreeing to end a sequestration order that had deprived the South Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers of more than Pounds 700,000 of its funds, he was not troubled by the union's failure to apologise for defying a court order. 'The court's dignity,' he said, 'does not depend on or require a public recantation, the sincerity of which, if offered, might in the circumstances be open to question.' Sir Richard Rashleigh Folliott Scott, 58, is one of three South African members of the higher judiciary. He was educated at Cape Town University and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the English Bar in 1959. He was chairman of the Bar in 1982 and as head of its race relations committee was responsible for drawing up a code to end racial discrimination at the Bar. He was appointed a judge of the Chancery Division in 1983 and was promoted to the Court of Appeal last year. He will have wide ranging powers to request disclosure of confidentail documents and subpoena witnesses.</p>

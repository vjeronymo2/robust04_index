			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / People: Aldridge sweeps away from Hays Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of business services company Hays, has lured on to his board 42-year-old Mark Aldridge, chief executive of the cleaning services division of BET, another, considerably less successful, business services group. Frost hereby puts the final touches to a senior management structure that he thinks will see the company through the next decade. He admits he has been looking to fill this position for 18 months and has been talking to Aldridge for the last six. 'In the end, despite what was offered him by John Clark (BET's chief executive) he was not persuaded to stay on.' It is understood that, having turned around the cleaning division, he was about to be transferred to another problem area. Aldridge wins plaudits for his performance at Biffa, a business he started from scratch and built into one of the UK's leading waste disposal concerns. BET sold Biffa in 1991 to Severn Trent at a multiple of 18 times earnings. At the cleaning division, meanwhile, Frost says Aldridge 'cut a hell of a lot of staff and won several worldwide contracts'. But despite the efforts of Clark, who has been trying to revive BET since he arrived two years ago, the group is 'too broad and has too many problem divisions', in the opinion of Frost. Whereas Aldridge was not on the board of BET, he will be in charge of the commercial and personnel divisions of Hays, between them currently furnishing about 43 per cent of group profits. Personnel, Frost claims, is now bouncing back, after a difficult period, and the chairman is keen to see 'growth by acquisition as well as organically' in the commercial division. 'Mark is a great ideas man. He is just the boy for that.' In December, Michael Proffitt and Dennis Matthewman joined the Hays board.</p>

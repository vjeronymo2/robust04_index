			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: European road research development TRAFALGAR HOUSE TECHNOLOGY has started work on a Europe-wide research project to develop a cementitious overlay for repairing flexible road pavements. The Ecu3.06m (Pounds 2.38m) project is aimed at combating the growing problem of rutting in asphalt pavements caused by increasing axle loads, higher tyre pressures and growing traffic volume. Known as NEWPAVE, the research will be of interest to all European countries who currently devote a substantial amount of their transport budgets to road maintenance. The European Commission's Brite-EuRam programme is providing 50 per cent of the project's funds with the rest coming from a consortium made up of seven organisations. Besides THT, the consortium consists of the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, two Danish companies, Aalborg Portland A/S and Dansk Beton Teknik A/S, the Danish Road Institute, the Technical University of Denmark and the National Civil Engineering Laboratory of Portugal. The overlay material being developed by NEWPAVE will be used both as a wearing course and strengthening for flexible road pavements.</p>

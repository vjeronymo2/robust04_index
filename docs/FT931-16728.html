			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Investors see a new star rising slowly in the east: Growth in the former Soviet bloc AFTER a hesitant start, paved with pitfalls, momentum is building behind the growth of western investment and business in the 28 independent countries that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet empire. Over the year ending September 1992, western investors committed Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.7bn) to 719 acquisitions, joint ventures and greenfield projects in the vast area from the Elbe to the Pacific, according to East Europe Investment Magazine. This tripling of commitments was accompanied by a new willingness to go beyond the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland - the main targets of western trade and investment - to encompass energy and resource-rich countries further east. Kazakhstan, unknown to many in the west before the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 independent republics just over a year ago, attracted investment commitments worth Dollars 9.1bn last year. There have been casualties, however. 'At first, it was all a big dream. Then people started pulling out because transactions happened much more slowly than they wished,' said Mr Michael Fortier, director in charge of eastern Europe for Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. 'Expectations were simply too high.' 'Lots of companies sent out inexperienced professionals to an area where the complexity of the task and the responsibilities of advisers were much greater than usual,' said Mr Guy de Selliers, deputy head of merchant banking at the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction. 'They soon found out that payments cannot always be relied on, that fees are low and mandates too competitive.' Dealing with governments has also been challenging. Most advisers who sought a long-term presence in the region started with mandates from governments. These were funded mainly by the European Community 'Phare' programme, the British government's Know-How fund or the US Agency for International Development. In Poland, where privatisation followed a 'sectoral approach', government mandates turned out to be a nightmare for advisers charged with selling all the enterprises in a specific industry as only a few companies in each sector proved attractive to potential investors. The Polish government's attempts to boost competition and break up large industries also misfired by discouraging investors interested in acquiring large market shares. 'Paradoxically, Poland has suffered from too much government and too little,' said one investor. In the Czech and Slovak republics, western advisers criticise the authorities for focusing on mass privatisation to the detriment of direct sales to foreign investors. 'The rules of entry for foreign capital were left unclarified for a long time and the influx of foreign capital has suffered as a result,' said Mr Daniel Arbess, a partner in White and Case, a US law firm with offices in all east European capitals. Disputes over the price of assets have sometimes damped the ardour of willing buyers in Hungary. 'The Hungarian government has often overvalued assets,' said Mr Sriram Chari, of Schroders, the UK merchant bank. The over-valuation of assets also reflects the political sensitivity of privatisation. Public concern has grown as the best enterprises have been 'cherry-picked' by foreign buyers. 'Getting high prices for companies is a way for governments to protect themselves against public resentment,' said Mr Keith Tilson, partner at Price Waterhouse, the UK accounting firm. Governments are also looking for new ways to draw local investors into the privatisation programmes. The popularity of distributing privatisation vouchers to the public was underlined in the Czech republic where the scheme's main architect, Mr Vaclav Klaus, won the Czech elections last June. Since then Hungary has also been considering a similar scheme as well as offering incentives to domestic investors willing to buy shares in local companies. For most foreigners, the quick transfer of ownership through privatisation will be good news. 'It is difficult for governments to execute lots of privatisation deals involving foreign capital. It is better to leave asset sales to the privatised companies which are looking after their own survival,' said Mr Arbess. Financial advisers say they intend to focus increasingly on individual, newly-privatised companies. Large enterprises have proved difficult to sell because of the heavy costs included in restructuring. Mid-sized companies have been quicker to find foreign partners, as shown by the many unrecorded deals in eastern Europe falling in the Dollars 30m-Dollars 50m range. 'Establishing local low-cost structures is the key to targeting medium-sized businesses,' said Mr Charles Harman, executive director at Credit Suisse First Boston, the merchant bank which employs around 50 people in eastern Europe. Some financial advisers disagree. 'There is simply no money in medium-sized deals,' said Mr Michael Ferriss, managing director at Bankers Trust, the UK merchant bank which intends to concentrate on financing large infrastructure projects. Mr Fortier of Salomon added: 'We cannot justify taking someone out of the international market and making a specialist on two industries in Poland.' Direct foreign investors meanwhile welcome the shift away from dealing with government agencies and procedures. In the Czech republic, where mass privatisation is most advanced, potential buyers and partners are negotiating directly with the new shareholders. This is made easier now that 70 per cent of all shares in privatised companies are held in private investment funds which are acting as closed-end mutual funds for the public. In three years a wealth of experience has been gained by governments, advisers, investors and traders alike. The learning curve has been steep, and the casualties high. But as the deals and the experience accumulate, the transition to capitalism shows clear signs of acceleration.</p>

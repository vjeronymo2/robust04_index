			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Japanese Eximbank backs private loan THE state-owned Export-Import bank of Japan has guaranteed a Y8bn (Dollars 75m) private sector loan to modernise Greece's railways, in the latest part of a drive to calm strains over the country's trade surplus. This is a fresh development in Japan's six-year-old strategy of trying to recycle part of its capital surplus in development and aid. It is the first time the Export-Import bank has guaranteed a loan by private institutions, under the so-called 'funds for development' scheme, and the first time a European Community member state has benefited from the scheme. 'This loan to a member of the EC will help improve Japan-EC economic relations, which are clouded by the trade imbalance,' said the bank. The bank's guarantee allows the fixed rate loan, by 11 insurance companies, to have an unusually long maturity, 12 years. Without the guarantee, the lenders would have been unable to accept the risk, said Mr Masahiko Agata, special adviser to the governor. The precursor to this scheme was launched in 1987, with a Dollars 65bn package of loans to developing countries, seen at the time as an important gesture to critics of Japan's growing current account surplus. Of this, the Export-Import Bank of Japan had lent Dollars 23.7bn by the time the scheme was fully disbursed last June. Lending is untied, in that the recipients do not have to use the cash to buy Japanese goods, though the bank specifies that the borrowers must use the money on development projects.</p>

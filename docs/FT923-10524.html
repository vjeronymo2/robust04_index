			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Airtours may drop Euro Disney arrangement AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest holiday company, said it was reconsidering its status as a special operator to the Euro Disney theme park as sales to the resort had been disappointing. The company said it was unlikely to remain a special operator when its contract comes up for renewal next year. Euro Disney said it had eight special operators in the UK and most appeared happy with the arrangements. In some cases, operators had asked for additional Euro Disney capacity to meet demand. Special operators have the right to book places at Euro Disney's own hotels and receive assistance with promotion and marketing. Mr George Marcall, Airtours sales director, said it was difficult to say how well the rest of the company's high season programme was selling. 'The situation is getting better. Prices are holding,' he said. Airtours shares closed at 253p, up 22p on the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 18 April]    [Text] Re: alleged kidnapping of four people in the ANC PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices    The officials of the ANC PWV region met this morning,  Monday,  April 18, 1994, after receiving reports in the news about the  alleged kidnapping of people in our regional offices. Officials  received information from the security personnel of the region  which points out the following:    1. That it is true that people were brought to the regional  offices by one of the security personnel employed by the region.    2. That the presence of those people in the building had  nothing to do with organisational matters. The individual  involved was conducting his own personal investigation after his  car was broken into.    After receiving the report of the incident, ANC PWV regional  officials convened an urgent meeting to consider our response to  the situation.    It is not ANC policy to hold people against their will no  matter what their crime is. We believe any individual involved  in any form of crime, should be handed over to the police. The  ANC PWV region regrets this incident and condemns it in the  strongest terms.    The following steps have been agreed upon by the officials:    1. The security person involved is suspended with immediate  effect. Internal investigations are continuing, and should any  other person be found to be implicated in the incident,  appropriate action will be taken.    2. To remain in close liaison with the police and to  co-operate with investigations in this matter.    The ANC response to this incident demonstrates our  commitment  to transparent and open government and a clean administration.  The same cannot be said of the National Party government. To  date, the present government still fails to account to the  nation about third force activities, deaths in detention,  corruption and maladministration.    Our chairperson, Tokyo Sexwale, spoke on Saturday at the Zoo  Lake: "All criminal elements, must know that the new government  is bad news for them. We believe in a clean government and that  we will clean up crime in this province and in the whole  country."    No member of the ANC is immune from disciplinary action.  This  type of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</p>

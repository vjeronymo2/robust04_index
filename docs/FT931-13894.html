			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warned on social chapter THE GOVERNMENT warned Labour last night that the UK would be unable to ratify Maastricht if the party succeeded in its attempt to amend legislation on the treaty with the aim of reinserting the social chapter for Britain. As Labour mounted its first significant offensive against the government during the treaty's Commons committee stage, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, said that approval for the amendment would mean MPs approving legislation different to that agreed at Maastricht. 'Therefore it would not be possible for the UK to ratify the treaty,' the minister said. But Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said he knew the party would create a dilemma for the government. 'The problem has a simple solution - to include the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty,' he said. A vote on the amendment is not due for a few weeks. Mr Cunningham added that the other 11 European Community countries had told Labour they would be 'happy' to see Britain abandon the protocol which allows it to opt out of the social chapter. Challenged by a Tory MP about whether it would mean the other countries re-ratifying the treaty, Mr Cunningham said they 'have already accepted the social chapter'. If passed, Labour's amendment would remove Britain's opt-out, but would need fresh negotiations with other EC countries and a further amendment in order to actually incorporate the social chapter. Labour regards reinserting the chapter as its principal objective during the Commons stages of the bill. Mr Cunningham said Britain's opt-out went against 'what was clearly understood by everyone else' - the importance of investing in a trained workforce. The party's chances of winning approval for its amendment depend on how the Tory opponents of Maastricht decide to vote. Some may back Labour to try to wreck the bill - even though they oppose the social chapter. Liberal Democrats support the social dimension of Maastricht but would not want to risk wrecking the bill. No side is disclosing tactics. Mr Garel-Jones went out of his way to warn the government's Tory opponents about taking any steps that would risk Britain's opt-outs. He said the government had won the general election last April on a manifesto setting out its opposition to the social chapter.</p>

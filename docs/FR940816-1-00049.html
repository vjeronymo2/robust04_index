			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a June 3, 1994, letter, the GLIFWC proposed off-reservation special migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons. Details of the proposed regulations are shown below. In general, the proposal contains liberalizations in bag limits for ducks (including mergansers) and geese from 1993&hyph;94 for all of the Minnesota and Wisconsin ceded areas. Bag limits for ducks and geese in these areas would be 20 and 10, respectively, although certain sex and species restrictions would apply. Regulations proposed for the 1836 and 1842 Treaty areas located in Michigan will be the same as those permitted for the State of Michigan, except for the daily bag limit of geese. Last year, the request for increase of goose bag limits was objected to by the Service in the belief that the Southern James Bay Population of Canada Geese, a population that has declined dramatically in the past several years, could potentially be further hurt by this action. We now know that this goose population is not a major contributor to the GLIFWC member band harvest; probably less than 25 geese from this population are taken annually by the Bay Mills Community hunters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has met several times over the last three months with the GLIFWC to explore the increase in duck and goose bag limit issue. The 1994&hyph;95 GLIFWC proposal provided results from those meetings and reflects the sensitivity to biological concerns acknowledged both by the GLIFWC and the Service. Estimates indicate that the GLIFWC bands have been harvesting less than 2000 ducks and 600 geese annually in past years. Results of the 1993&hyph;94 hunter survey show that 1631 ducks and 402 geese were actually harvested. Under the proposed regulations, the increase in harvest is projected to not exceed 3000 ducks and 900 geese. The Service believes that regulations advanced by the GLIFWC for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season are biologically acceptable. The Service is proposing to approve the GLIFWC regulations. If the regulations are finalized as proposed, the Service would request that the GLIFWC closely monitor the member band duck harvest and take any actions necessary to reduce harvest if locally nesting populations are being significantly impacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission and the Service are parties to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) designed to facilitate the ongoing enforcement of Service-approved tribal migratory bird regulations. The MOA is intended to have long-term cooperative application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, as in recent seasons, the proposal contains references to Chapter 10 of the Migratory Bird Harvesting Regulations of the Model Off-Reservation Conservation Code. Chapter 10 regulations parallel State and Federal regulations and, in effect, are not changed by this change in reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GLIFWC's proposed 1994&hyph;95 waterfowl hunting season regulations are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ducks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin and Minnesota 1837, 1842 and 1854 Zones: Season Dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Begin September 15 and end November 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daily Bag Limit:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20 ducks, including no more than 10 mallards (only 5 of which may be hens), 4 black ducks, 4 redheads and 4 pintails.

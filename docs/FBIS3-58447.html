Cindoruk received members of the U.S. Congress Defense  Subcommittee. In a statement during the meeting, Cindoruk  remarked that the international measures adopted regarding  northern Iraq have failed to solve the problem and asked that  the issue be reassessed.    [Begin Cindoruk recording] The current situation creates two  sets of difficulties for Turkey. First, we have sustained great  material damage because of the embargo. Second, the current de  facto situation in northern Iraq makes it more difficult for  Turkey to wage its struggle against terrorism, and furthermore,  the region is a breeding ground for elements that seek to divide  Turkey. [end recording]    John Murtha, chairman of the U.S. Congress Defense  Subcommittee, declared that Turkey's importance is increasing  with time because of world developments and the country's  geopolitical position.    Meanwhile, National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan expressed  concern over the U.S. decision to cease military aid and the  7:10 ratio applied by the United States in its aid to Greece and  Turkey. Golhan received Murtha and the delegation accompanying  him. Pointing out that most of the equipment, machinery, and  weapons used by the Turkish Armed Forces are U.S.-made, Golhan  said that the decision to stop the aid should be reviewed within  the context of common goals.    President Suleyman Demirel also received the visiting  delegation at the Cankaya Mansion and conferred with its members  for some time.</p>

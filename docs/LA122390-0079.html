			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANA PARSONS: CASE MAY SHOW HOMELESS GET SHORT END OF NIGHTSTICK  </P> <P> Cops are an interesting breed of cat. The best ones are wonderful combinations  of brains, guts, insight and a visceral desire to help other people. You can  have some enlightening conversations talking with cops about the human  condition.  </P> <P> Other cops, however, can give you the shivers. Their personal foibles may be no  lesser or greater than yours or mine, but we don't get to carry nightsticks and  guns. So, when we see something or someone on the street we don't like, our  options are severely limited.  </P> <P> Not so for the street cop. He has a whole range of exciting possibilities.  </P> <P> I had the unpleasant experience of sitting at home the other night and watching  a short videotape that showed four uniformed Laguna Beach police officers  standing over a man. The video, shot in June by an unidentified person, shows  one of the four officers delivering a few kicks before a fellow officer extends  his arm, seemingly to stop the attack. You don't see who's being kicked because  he's on the ground, but momentarily a shirtless man with a bloodied face is  raised to his feet. The man, Kevin Dunbar, has conceded that he was drunk at  the time of the incident.  </P> <P> As in most cases when police are making an arrest, it's doubtful that Dunbar  said: "Good evening, officers. How may I make your job easier?"  </P> <P> So while it's possible that there's more here than meets the camera, it's  difficult to imagine anything Dunbar could have done to warrant the assault  caught on tape. Indeed, only one of the four officers -- the one doing the  kicking -- seemed the least bent out of shape.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil Purcell had a surprisingly candid reaction.  While noting that more investigating is necessary before all the facts are  known, he said: "I understand that officers are only human. Sometimes they can  lose it."  </P> <P> The thought of a cop "losing it" when dealing with a defenseless drunk is -- if  you'll pardon the pun -- sobering. What if the incident hadn't been videotaped?  Would this have been another case where a suspect fell down on the curb and cut  his face?  </P> <P> So far, Chief Purcell seems to be making the right moves. At least in his  public comments he's keeping an open mind as to what might have happened. In  addition, the district attorney's office is investigating.  </P> <P> That investigation should answer the question of whether the officer, Keith  Knotek, mistreated Dunbar.  </P> <P> But other questions need to be addressed. Dunbar was apparently well known to  Laguna Beach police as a homeless person. And while Purcell has discounted any  possibility that the incident is tied to Dunbar's social status, it's a  question worth pursuing.  </P> <P> Many people -- cops and citizens alike -- don't like the sight of the street  people. They assault our senses and our sensitivities. Some of us want to help  them; some of us want to run them out of town.  </P> <P> This is no make-believe issue. The U.S. Conference of Mayors released a report  last week citing "increased hostility to the homeless. . . . 80% of the cities  reported that public sentiment toward the homeless is changing."  </P> <P> That was a reference to the public at large. And yes, police officers are  trained to handle people based on their behavior, not on their station in life.  But they're also human beings. We remember how all too many of them reacted to  "longhairs" of a generation ago.  </P> <P> Public hostility toward the homeless can coexist with public efforts to help  them. Just because Laguna Beach or Santa Ana or any other city is helping the  homeless doesn't mean that its citizens or its police force may not have some  members who harbor hostility toward them.  </P> <P> The homeless issue is so real that California police officers and sheriff's  deputies receive special training on it, according to Hal Snow, an official  with the state commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> "I've been in groups with law enforcement officers who have discussed this," he  said. "It almost places (an officer) in a situation where he has to be the  mediator between the classes in our society. . . . Often, the haves want them  out of sight, out of the city, out of the county.  </P> <P> "Here in Sacramento, city police were requested to run the homeless out of our  river area that's also a park. That's been a place for the homeless for years."  </P> <P> Steven Brummer of the Bakersfield Police Department prepared a paper a couple  of years ago for the Peace Officer Standards and Training state panel,  regarding the projected effect of the homeless population on police agencies. A  summary of that paper includes: "It was determined that, presently, law  enforcement training on homeless issues is generally inadequate, and few  enforcement programs are capable of managing the myriad of issues associated  with the homeless population."  </P> <P> The D.A.'s office and Laguna Beach police promise to fully investigate the  alleged assault on Dunbar. It surely wouldn't hurt if they could reassure  people that the incident had nothing to do with Dunbar's homeless status.  </P> <P> If nothing else, it might help the rest of Laguna's homeless sleep a little  better at night.  </P></p>

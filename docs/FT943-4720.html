			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kodak sells diagnostic business to J&amp;J for Dollars 1bn Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, continued along the disposal trail yesterday with the Dollars 1.01bn sale of its clinical diagnostics business to the US healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson. With the sale of its drugs businesses to Sanofi of France and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, the deal brings Kodak's total disposals since June to more than Dollars 5.6bn. The latest sale takes in Kodak's chemistry-based and immuno-assay diagnostics products, which had sales last year of Dollars 535m. As part of its strategy of concentrating on traditional strengths under new chairman Mr George Fisher, Kodak is retaining its X-ray film based diagnostic business, in which it claims world leadership. Johnson &amp; Johnson, which two weeks ago announced the Dollars 924m acquisition of the Neutrogena skin and hair care company, said the deal would make it the world's third-biggest diagnostics company after Abbott Laboratories of the US and Boehringer Mannheim of Germany. Its existing sales of diagnostics are just over Dollars 700m. The Kodak business, which includes the diagnostics business of the UK company Amersham, acquired in 1990, would continue to be run as a separate company on acquisition, Johnson &amp; Johnson said. Mr Ralph Larsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson chairman, said that 'the acquisition will add important positions in clinical chemistry and immuno-diagnostics to our existing diagnostics business, and significantly broaden our customer base in the hospital central diagnostic laboratories'. The company said the deal would leap-frog it into third position worldwide, ahead of Bayer of Germany. The sale brings Kodak close to the end of its ambitious disposal programme announced in May this year. The final business to be sold is L &amp; F Products, encompassing household products such as disinfectants and DIY products such as wood finishers. Kodak announced last month that it would sell the two parts of L &amp; F separately, having been unable to reach its target price - estimated by outsiders at around Dollars 2bn - for the business as a whole. The latest deal also brings Kodak close to its target of eliminating debt. Lex, Page 22</p>

Speaking at a seminar organized by the CISL [Italian  Confederation of Trade Unions], Gallo said "If we want to  achieve serious and efficient taxation, which weds simplicity  with equality, then the next government must have the necessary  technical capacity and political backing. This way a `strong'  finance minister will be able to work, in peace, for three or  four years."    In his address, Gallo also spoke on tax evasion and observed  how in Italy it had "historic roots" and involved not only some  sectors in small industry and commerce, but also agriculture,  which had a lobby, he added, that his ministry has never been  able to break. "In this field" the finance minister said, "there  are some 1.2 trillion lire in uncollected tax revenue" and that  "some value-added tax (VAT) easements are not justified for some  enterprises which are involved in activities which are more in  tune with true industrial activities."    Turning his attention to revenue controls, Finance Minister  Gallo recalled how a decree will be issued next week to add a  further 1,000 auditors to the ranks of the ministry and stressed  the importance of incentives for his ministry's  "auditor-detectives."    "One should not practice fiscal terrorism by talking about  `bounties' for tax evaders" the minister said; "incentives are  more often than not recognition to employees who work harder  without having sufficient means and often using their our  transportation."    Gallo, as did Left Democrat Vincenzo Visco in his address,  then went on to criticize those who spoke of the famous "200  Italian taxes," arguing how "this is a metropolitan myth. In  reality there are only 30 or 35."    In his address, Visco sharply criticised the referendum  initiative by Marco Pannella to abolish withholding tax saying  how "this is tax evasion, and the Court of Cassation can only  reject it...because of its clear unconstitutionality." Visco  went on to voice his opposition to taxing state paper, also in  view of the fact that, during the Ciampi government, the  interest paid on the paper has fallen.    Also taking part in the CISL seminar was Giorgio Fossa, the  Confindustria vice president for small enterprises, who stressed  how taxation now conditions the lives of enterprises and  "blocked productive activity with formal controls" and "does not  honor its debts," return tax re-imbursements in real time.</p>

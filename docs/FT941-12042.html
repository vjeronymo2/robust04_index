			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lagardere launches Matra-Hachette offer Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere yesterday launched his long-mooted shares exchange offer to absorb Matra-Hachette, the missiles-to-magazine group, into his own Lagardere group. Under the offer, which closes on March 12, holders of some 58m Matra-Hachette shares which are not already held by Mr Lagardere and his industrial and financial partners would receive Lagardere group shares on a one-for-one basis, plus a warrant convertible at a rate of five for two Lagardere shares. The Lagardere group said it would only go through with the share swap if it gained at least 65 per cent of Matra-Hachette's capital. At present it holds 37.6 per cent of Matra-Hachette's capital and 51.2 per cent of its voting rights. Mr Lagardere said the deal was designed to merge Matra-Hachette, which represents 90 per cent of the Lagardere group assets, into a simpler and more transparent structure, and allow Matra-Hachette to grow without the constraint imposed by the Lagardere group's need to preserve its present controlling 51 per cent stake. In fact, the issue of warrants to tempt Matra-Hachette shareholders could bring the Lagardere group FFr4.3bn (Dollars 731m) if all the shares were exchanged and all the accompanying warrants were exercised by mid-1997, Mr Philippe Camus, the Lagardere group finance director, estimated yesterday. Financial rather than industrial considerations lie behind the plan, which Mr Lagardere said was motivated by the fact that on the Paris bourse the shares of the holding company that bears his name were considerably under-valued in relation to its underlying assets, and in particular to the share price of Matra-Hachette. Trading in the two shares was suspended on yesterday's announcement, but on Friday Lagardere closed at FFr160 and Matra-Hachette at FFr165.80. Mr Lagardere compared Matra-Hachette to 'a fast train' which he said would show nearly a doubling of earnings in 1993 to FFr600m. But he likened his Lagardere group to a high-speed 'TGV train'. 'We are proposing that Matra-Hachette shareholders step on to the TGV, and that not only will they suffer no risk and pay no extra charge but they will be rewarded in switching,' he claimed.</p>

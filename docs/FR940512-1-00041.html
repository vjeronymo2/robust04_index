			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.22(b) if, after meeting the priorities in proposed &sect;366.22(a)(1) and (2), there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment to fund a new center under proposed &sect;366.22(a)(3), the Secretary may use the excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or may reallot these funds in accordance with section 721(d) of the Act. This proposed provision is designed to give the Secretary added flexibility to respond to the local needs within a State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.26, the Secretary would use the statutory selection criteria from section 722(d)(2)(B) of the Act, as incorporated in proposed &sect;366.27, to evaluate applications for awards to centers under section 722 of the Act. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of the ``Extent of the need for the project'' from 15 to 20 points and decreased the value of the ``Plan of operation'' from 25 to 20 points in proposed &sect;366.27 (a) and (g), respectively. The Secretary also has added language to the selection criterion on the ``Extent of the need for the project'' that would encourage an applicant to provide information on whether the applicant proposes to serve an area that has been identified in the State plan as a priority service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;366.28 would clarify existing authority implicit in the Act permitting the Secretary to use funds from the allotment of one State to award a grant to a center located in another State if the Secretary determines that the proposal of the out-of-State center to serve individuals with significant disabilities who reside in the other State is consistent with the State plan of the State in which these individuals reside. Nothing in the Act limits the award of funds allotted to a State under section 721 of the Act to eligible agencies only in that State. This proposed provision would allow the Secretary to fund the most qualified applicant and would facilitate the provision of services to unserved and underserved areas in a State in the most efficient and economical manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;&sect;366.29 through 366.38 would incorporate the statutory requirements applicable if the Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed &sect;366.32 and the amount of State funds earmarked to support the general operation of centers is equal to or greater than the amount of Federal funds allotted to the State for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed &sect;&sect;366.29 and 366.31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2) would incorporate section 723(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2), if a State submits an application for a fiscal year to award grants under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366, the Secretary would determine whether the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that preceding fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.29(c), the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 would be considered the ``preceding fiscal year'' for purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act. For example, if fiscal year (FY) 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart, FY 1993 would be the ``preceding fiscal year.'' The Secretary chose the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program as the ``preceding fiscal year'' because that year would be the most recent year for which complete financial data would be available to the Secretary to make his determination. The Secretary would make any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.30(a), the amount of State funds that are earmarked by a State to support the general operation of centers would not include: (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; (2) State funds used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal assistance or skills training; (3) State attendant care funds; or (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds. Proposed &sect;366.30(c) implements congressional intent as expressed in S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;357, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 92 (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.30(b), ``earmarked funds'' would mean funds appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly identified as State expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding the general operation of centers. ``Earmarked funds'' would be described in this manner for purposes of this proposed provision to ensure consistency among the States for what should be included as ``earmarked funds.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.31, if the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 for a fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required by proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal year, the State would be ineligible to make grants under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 after the end of the fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer the CIL program in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY 1996. The State could continue to award grants in FY 1997 but could not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

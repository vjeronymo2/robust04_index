			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mozambique builds on peace Mozambique is poised to become an energy exporter, thanks to the end of the country's 17-year civil war and to an international project to rebuild power lines supplying electricity to South Africa from the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric dam. Portugal, the former colonial power, South Africa and Mozambique are finalising the details of a Dollars 105m (Pounds 70m) financial package to rebuild 1,800 pylons destroyed by South African-backed rebels in their war against the Marxist government in Maputo. When energy exports can resume, Cahora Bassa will be Mozambique's biggest export earner with estimated revenues of Dollars 56m a year, according to Mr Manuel Lopes da Costa, Portuguese ambassador in Maputo. The economy now can barely muster export revenues of Dollars 200m a year. South Africa has agreed to supply new electricity towers worth Dollars 48m. Portugal will finance the procurement of cables and isolators with Dollars 27m. Italy had agreed to contribute Dollars 35m but withdrew last year when its foreign aid programme came under investigation for corruption. Mr Lopes da Costa hopes the European Union, France or the European Development Bank will fill the gap left by the Italians. Cahora Bassa is a 2,000 MW dam on the Zambezi river, completed in 1977. Its transmission lines were a favourite and frequent target of Renamo rebels in the early 1980s. More than 200km of lines were destroyed and Cahora Bassa is operating at only 1.5 per cent capacity. Portugal, which built the dam and holds the operating concession, has spent Dollars 35m a year to keep it in working order. Mozambique, although entitled to a share of Cahora Bassa's export earnings, has not seen a penny because the contracts to supply the South African electricity grid have not been fulfilled. Mr Jose Miguel Nicolau, planning director at the national power company, Electricidade de Mocambique, hopes reconstruction will begin in July, at the start of the dry season. It should take 36 months to complete.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: ABB Any company which swallows a Dollars 500m (Pounds 335.50m) restructuring charge and continues to shed jobs at the rate of 1,000 a month may be presumed to be in a spot of trouble. But in Asea Brown Boveri's instance, quite the reverse may be the case. Although heavy capital goods markets have remained sickly throughout the western world, ABB continues to make progress. Flat pre-tax profits of Dollars 497m at the half-year represents a fine achievement when currency swings are taken into account. The restructuring charge will pull costs forward and depress profits for the year. But it will have little effect on ABB's ability to fund the dividend. Shareholders are therefore right not to blink. Longer term, the restructuring programme will enable ABB to shift production from high to low cost sites. This will enhance cost competitiveness and help ABB win new business in the promising markets of eastern Europe and the Far East. ABB is also making striking efforts to reduce manufacturing lead times and improve capital and labour productivity. More leaden-footed rivals, such as Siemens, can only stand and gawp. That said, neither the Swedish or Swiss markets have been neglectful of the respective charms of Asea or Brown Boveri. Both shares have seemingly powered ahead of the anticipated upturn in the capital goods cycle. Yet those prepared to wait should reap full benefit when sales volumes and margins swing higher.</p>

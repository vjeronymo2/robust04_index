			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Institutions warn on housing grants City investors most involved with housing associations have warned that cuts in government housing grants could make it harder to provide private finance to build low-cost homes for rent, according to the National Federation of Housing Associations. A majority of institutions contacted by the federation said they were concerned at government plans to cut the grant rate to 55 per cent of the cost of a new home. Several said that they were concerned that the financial health of associations might be affected.</p>
